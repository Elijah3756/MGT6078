Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech last month, had announced creation of a high-level committee for regulatory reforms for a review of all non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licences, and permissions. \"The committee will be expected to make recommendations within a year. The objective is to strengthen trust-based economic governance and take transformational measures to enhance 'ease of doing business', especially in matters of inspections and compliances. States will be encouraged to join in this endeavour,\" she had said. Observing that a number of structural reforms have been announced in the last 10 years, Seth said, at the same time keeping those reforms in tandem with technological advancement, removing legislative provisions which have outlived their utility, and maintaining their relevance in the 21st century and the next 23 years requirement have to be looked at. There is a need to move towards light touch regulatory reforms, which are people-friendly, which are modern and flexible, he said at SKOCH Summit here. \"So this initiative of a high-level committee on regulatory reforms in the non-financial sector work should be starting soon,\" he said. To promote competitive cooperative federalism among states and also to assess which state is more investor friendly, Seth said, an Investment Friendliness Index of States will be launched. This will generate healthy competition among states and promote business friendly reforms to attract investment, he said. \"Our journey towards Viksit Bharat is possible only when everybody comes together, all people, all regions (and) all states,\" he added. Speaking about financial sector reforms to be undertaken by the Financial Stability and Development Council, Seth said, the objective is to support development, and at the same time allow for more efficient use of capital. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council, a mechanism will be set up to evaluate the impact of the current financial regulations and subsidiary instructions, and it will also formulate a framework to enhance their responsiveness and development of the financial sector, Sitharaman had said in Budget 2025-26. The Financial Stability and Development Council is headed by the Finance Minister and all financial sector regulators, including the RBI, SEBI, IRDAI and PFRDA, are its members.

Mukhamad Misbakhun said the commission has been preparing measures on how parliament could help the government to achieve its 8 per cent target from the current 5 per cent, including strengthening the roles of the finance ministry as well as Bank Indonesia. \"If our economic growth is driven by two engines of fiscal and monetary policy, this will be a strong national combination going forward,\" he said at a capital markets forum in Jakarta. Misbakhun did not elaborate on how the central bank's role could be enhanced and no decision has been taken to date. He said discussions were still ongoing and said he had met BI officials the previous night.

Indonesia's economic growth has hovered at around 5 per cent in the past few years. Parliament is discussing a revision of the 2023 Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector Law, after the Constitutional Court ordered lawmakers earlier this year to review it on matters related to the independence of the state deposit insurer agency. There have been concerns, however, that lawmakers might also reevaluate the central bank's role. Its Governor Perry Warjiyo has acknowledged there had been talks about the central bank's mandate in those parliamentary discussions, but no changes were expected. BI's mandate is currently supporting sustainable economic growth along with maintaining the stability of the rupiah currency and prices. Indonesian financial markets fell sharply earlier this week, pressured by concerns over the government's fiscal strategy and growth prospects.

Gulf News | Jay Hilotin Manila: The Philippine peso closed at Php57.248 against the US dollar on Monday (March 17, 2025) its best in nearly five months since October. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data show the peso has so far averaged Php57.488 in March against the US greenback, up from Php58.094 average in February, Php58.391 in January and Php58.448 in December 2024. What's behind the rise Amid a raft of global and domestic developments that supported the Asian currency, the Philippine peso finished the first week of March on a strong note against the US dollar. The US dollar slid against other Asian currencies recently, the peso included, following Trump’s announcement to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and services that are covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement or USMCA until April 2, 2025, when Trump plans reciprocal tariffs. After the ripple effects of Donald Trump’s presidency rattled markets, the peso emerging as one of the hardest-hit currencies. The peso was flirting with the Php60-per-dollar mark, keeping analysts on edge. With forecasts predicting a dive to this level by midyear — something straight out of the financial history books — it’s been a wild ride for the currency. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc, and Fitch Solutions foresee this breaking point, while DBS Group Holdings Ltd. warns it could dip even further to Php60.8. Recent developments Despite the recent developments surrounding the Manila arrest and extradition to the Hague of former president Rodrigo Duterte, the country's financial sector has shown some resilients. Recently the BSP reported growth in universal and commercial bank loans growth going at its fastest clip in two years. In a dramatic turn for the Philippine financial sector, bank lending skyrocketed by 12.8 per cent in January 2025, marking its fastest growth in two years, according to BSP data. Adding to the momentous news, the Philippines has officially broken free from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \"grey list\", shedding the shadow of increased monitoring after nearly four years. The grey list, a red flag for global investors, signalled concerns over the country’s efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and financial crimes. First placed on the list in June 2021, the Philippines has since fought to overhaul its financial safeguards. The BSP now hails the country’s exit as proof of its strengthened defenses against illicit finance, a milestone that restores international confidence in the nation’s banking system. What a stronger peso means With lending on the rise and a more robust regulatory environment, the Philippine economy is charging ahead — leaving its troubled past behind. A stronger peso benefits import-heavy businesses and consumers but can hurt exporters, OFWs, and industries that rely on dollar earnings. The BP) monitors exchange rates to keep a balance and avoid extreme fluctuations. Winners & losers When the Philippine peso appreciates against the US dollar , it means the peso strengthens, and fewer pesos are needed to buy one dollar. This has several effects on different sectors of the economy: Winners Importers and consumers – Imported goods (e.g., oil, electronics, raw materials) become cheaper, lowering costs for businesses and consumers. Government debt payments – If the government has foreign debt in dollars, it becomes cheaper to pay back in pesos. Travellers and students abroad – Filipinos studying or traveling abroad spend less on foreign expenses. Losers OFW Families – Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) sending remittances receive fewer pesos per dollar, reducing family purchasing power. BPO Sector – Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies earn in dollars but pay expenses in pesos, reducing profits. Exporters – Philippine products become more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing sales. Tourism Industry – Foreign tourists find it more expensive to visit the Philippines, possibly reducing tourism revenue.

In addition, an amount of GH¢2.2 billion is required to fully capitalise NIB and ADB,” he stated. According to him, despite a GH¢30.3 billion expenditure on the financial sector clean-up by the end of 2024, the sector remains fragile.

He made this revelation during the presentation of the 2025 Budget Statement in Parliament on Tuesday, 11th March.

    "article_text": "Audio By Carbonatix The High Court (Human Rights Division) has overturned the Bank of Ghana’s (BoG) decision to revoke the operating licence of Ideal Finance Limited. Delivered on Monday, March 10, the ruling marks a major victory for the once-defunct financial institution in its ongoing battle against the central bank. The court concluded that the Bank of Ghana had failed to follow the appropriate legal procedures before revoking Ideal Finance’s licence, rendering the action unjustified. As a result, the court has effectively restored the company’s legal standing, allowing it to resume operations. The Bank of Ghana had revoked Ideal Finance’s licence as part of its comprehensive financial sector cleanup initiative, citing insolvency and poor governance as the primary reasons for its action. However, the High Court found that the BoG did not exhaust the required processes before making its decision, leading to the quashing of the revocation. On August 16, 2019, the Bank of Ghana revoked the operating licences of 23 financial institutions, including Ideal Finance, GN Savings and Loans, First Allied Savings and Loans, Midland Savings and Loans, and Unicredit Savings and Loans. The central bank justified its sweeping measures by stating that these institutions had remained insolvent despite being given sufficient time to recapitalise. The BoG’s financial sector cleanup exercise was aimed at restoring stability and confidence in the banking system, particularly after concerns over the sustainability of certain institutions. However, the cleanup led to the closure of numerous banks and financial companies, leaving depositors and other stakeholders in financial turmoil. While the Bank of Ghana’s actions were intended to strengthen the industry in the long term, they have faced significant opposition from affected institutions and their clients. Ideal Finance’s successful challenge to the revocation could set a precedent for other legal battles, raising questions about the transparency and fairness of the central bank’s regulatory procedures. The High Court’s decision to quash the revocation of Ideal Finance’s licence could have wider ramifications for the Bank of Ghana’s future actions within the financial sector.

Answer by Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Board member of MAS, on behalf of Mr Gan Kim Yong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chairman of MAS: 1. MAS is committed to developing our financial sector’s local workforce while being open to complementary foreign manpower. Working closely with industry, we invest heavily in building skills and capabilities in our local workforce, to enable our locals to take up good jobs in the financial sector. As a leading regional and global financial centre, Singapore must continue to attract high quality talent, both locally and from abroad, in order to stay competitive. 2. This balanced approach has been key to Singapore’s success as a global financial centre. We are now a leading financial centre in Asia and the third most competitive globally Based on the 2024 Global Financial Centre Index . . We are home to over 2,500 licensed financial institutions and employ close to 200,000 people. Over 80% of our financial sector Financial sector refers to Financial & Insurance Services (SSIC2020 K64-66) excluding holding companies. workforce is local, and the sector offers the highest median gross income amongst employed locals. Over 2018 to 2023, the financial sector workforce grew by more than 25,000, of which more than 9 out of 10 of the net jobs created went to locals. 3. To help locals acquire skills and capabilities to take on good jobs in the financial sector, MAS has committed $400 million from 2021 to 2025 to support the training of local finance professionals at each stage of their careers. a) At pre-entry and entry levels, MAS provides funding support for internships, apprenticeships, and job rotation programmes, to equip our polytechnic and university students and fresh graduates with the skills to take on jobs in our financial sector. b) At mid-career level, MAS provides opportunities for finance professionals to upskill and reskill. We work with training providers to develop relevant courses, subsidise course fees and develop career conversion programmes with financial institutions for our mid-careers. c) At the senior-level, MAS supports the development of senior leaders through overseas postings, leadership programmes and by building leadership networks. 4. Financial institutions also recognise the importance of developing local talent to meet their manpower needs. For instance, in 2024, OCBC launched OCBC Ignite, an accelerated career programme that comprises an internship and apprenticeship on full time employment with the bank. OCBC Ignite aims to benefit 500 polytechnic students and graduates over three years. UBS also partnered government to develop the UBS-SUPER programme in 2020, and has trained over 400 fresh graduates and mid-career professionals. UBS has also doubled the number of Singaporeans sent on overseas postings, compared to pre-COVID levels. 5. To balance the need to develop the local workforce with the importance of attracting high quality global talent, MAS closely monitors the overall workforce profile of our financial sector as well as the workforce composition of key financial institutions. MAS regularly engages senior management of key financial institutions on their workforce needs and composition, and on how MAS can work with them to develop local talent. MOM’s Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for Employment Pass applications encourages firms to support local employment by awarding points based on locals’ share of PMET roles in the firm. COMPASS also recognises and gives additional weight to global talent who bring in skills in shortage, while the Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass (ONE Pass) attracts and anchors top global talent from around the world. 6. We will continue to strike a delicate balance – ensuring our financial institutions have access to high quality foreign talent, while steadfastly developing our local talent pipeline. By maintaining this balance, we will attract more investments and provide good jobs, career choices and progression opportunities for our locals. * * *"

    "article_text": "A financial conditions index (FCI) is imperative for Qatar to assess the current state of financial conditions and evaluate the relationship between financial indicators and future growth distribution, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"The FCI is an important leading indicator of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth, highlighting its predictive potential for future economic performance,\" said the IMF working paper, which developed an FCI for Qatar and used the growth-at-risk (GaR) framework to examine the impact of financial conditions on Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth. As Qatar seeks to enhance the financial sector's contribution to growth through the third financial sector strategy (FSS3), the paper said an FCI will be essential for assessing the current state of financial conditions and evaluating the relationship between financial indicators and future growth distribution. Highlighting that the analysis showed that the FCI is an important leading indicator of Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon growth and closely follows the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB) bank's lending survey; the IMF paper said the FCI exhibits a relatively strong correlation with real non-hydrocarbon GDP (gross domestic product) growth, highlighting its predictive potential for future economic performance. Additionally, the credit conditions component of the FCI aligns with the QCB’s bank lending survey, indicating consistency of its FCI with other surveys. The GaR analysis highlights the importance of domestic and external conditions as indicators of real non-hydrocarbon GDP growth performance, it said, adding domestic conditions seem to offer the strongest signal in the short term, whereas the effects of external conditions are significant in both the short and medium term. \"Overall, the current downside risks to Qatar’s baseline non-hydrocarbon growth projections are relatively mild. Alternative scenario tests indicate that future non-hydrocarbon growth could improve following a reduction in the policy deposit rate. Additionally, non-hydrocarbon growth is primarily influenced by oil prices, with minimal effects stemming from global financial market uncertainty,\" it said. Finding that financial conditions play a significant role in shaping business cycle fluctuations as they reflect both the feedback of current and past economic conditions and markets’ expectations about the economic outlook; it said FCIs are constructed from a broader combination of domestic and external financial conditions. They serve as tools that facilitate a deeper understanding of macro-financial linkages, as well as enable historical assessments by comparing the current state of financial conditions against their past cycles. Stressing that developing the FCI has become even more important as the country aims to further develop the financial sector through the FSS3. The paper, authored by Dorothy Nampewo, said in Qatar, the financial sector plays an important role in shaping economic activity, and therefore serves as a key pillar in fostering the country's sustainable economic development. The FSS3 aims to enhance innovation and diversification in the financial sector, and to support the country’s goal to become a global financial services centre. The FCI would be important in assessing the current state of financial health, gauging the impact of initiatives aimed at fostering financial market deepening, and evaluating the nexus between financial indicators and the distribution of future growth."

Courtesy of Financial Security Institute By Jun Ji-hye Published Feb 28, 2025 9:53 am KST Updated Mar 4, 2025 2:46 pm KST Shin Dae-min, a senior researcher at the Financial Security Institute’s (FSI) personal information protection department, has proposed efficient development and operation strategies for financial software while minimizing security threats in cloud environments in his recent paper. His study has gained attention as the financial sector is increasingly adopting cloud computing, yet security systems and technologies remain tailored to traditional infrastructures, highlighting the need for improvements. Shin Dae-min, senior researcher at Financial Security Institute / Courtesy of Financial Security Institute His paper, “Enhancing Cloud-Native DevSecOps: A Zero Trust Approach for the Financial Sector,” was published in Computer Standards & Interfaces, an international journal indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded. In the study, Shin proposed a new security framework that integrates DevSecOps, which unifies software development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops), with zero trust, a model that continuously verifies all users and devices without assuming trust. The study was highly regarded for its concrete proposals on how financial institutions can minimize security threats in cloud environments while efficiently developing and operating financial software, the FSI noted. Shin said in an email interview with The Korea Times that the study’s findings could serve as a foundational resource for enhancing cloud-native security in the financial sector and facilitating the practical adoption of the zero-trust security model. “The findings may be considered as a security compliance standard for cloud-native DevSecOps environments in the financial sector. They can also serve as a foundational reference when establishing security assessment criteria and evaluation standards,” he said. “Additionally, the research can be used as a review resource for implementing the cloud native access point model in financial cloud environments, ensuring secure access between internal and external networks, and adopting zero trust network access-based access control.” FSI CEO Park Sang-won underscored that the institution will continue to enhance employees’ expertise, strengthen security standards in the financial sector and lead the way in safe digital innovation. “We will actively support research on emerging security technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, as well as participation in world-class hacking competitions,” Park said.

In an official statement, Rwangombwa expressed his gratitude to President Paul Kagame for the opportunity to serve as the country’s top central banker. “My deepest gratitude to you, Your Excellency @PaulKagame, for the opportunity to serve as the @CentralBankRw Governor for the past 12 years. It has been an honour to contribute to the stability of our country’s economy and financial sector under your guidance and leadership,” he stated. His departure marks the end of an era during which Rwanda’s financial sector saw significant stability, digital transformation, and resilience in the face of global economic challenges. Who is Soraya Hakuziyaremye? Soraya Hakuziyaremye is a seasoned economist and policymaker with extensive experience in financial regulation and economic governance. Before her appointment as Governor, she served as Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Rwanda and previously held the role of Minister of Trade and Industry from 2018 to 2022. With a strong background in international finance, Hakuziyaremye has worked with major financial institutions, including BNP Paribas and ING Bank, specializing in risk management and compliance. She has also been an advocate for financial inclusion, particularly in ensuring that Rwanda’s banking sector serves all citizens, including women and small businesses. A Historic Milestone for Rwanda’s Financial Sector Hakuziyaremye’s appointment signals a progressive step for gender representation in Rwanda’s financial leadership. As the first woman to head the central bank, she is expected to bring a fresh perspective to monetary policy, financial stability, and the ongoing digital transformation of the banking sector. Joining her in the leadership team is Dr. Justin Nsengiyumva, who has been appointed as Deputy Governor. Challenges and Expectations As Governor, Hakuziyaremye will oversee key aspects of Rwanda’s economy, including inflation control, exchange rate stability, and financial sector resilience.

Retail vs. commercial banking​: What's the difference? While both offer similar services, there are some key differences, too. Yahoo Personal Finance · d3sign via Getty Images E Emily Batdorf February 25, 2025 4 min read As an individual or business owner, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the banking options out there. Understanding the differences between retail and commercial banking can help. Retail banking targets individual consumers, offering products like deposit accounts and loans. On the other hand, commercial banks serve businesses, governmental bodies, and institutions. Importantly, some banks offer retail and commercial banking, catering to both types of customers. Read on to learn more about retail and commercial banking, as well as key differences between the two. What is retail banking? Retail banking encompasses the banking products and services geared toward “retail” customers or individual consumers. You may also hear retail banking referred to as consumer banking or personal banking. If you have a personal checking or savings account, you’re a customer of a retail bank. Retail banking is available at several types of institutions, from small community banks and credit unions to large national banks. At these larger banks, retail banking may be one division of the larger bank’s offerings. You can also access retail banking through online banks. Read more: These are the 20 biggest banks in the U.S. Because retail banking serves individual customers rather than large corporations, it often involves smaller transactions and tends to be less profitable than commercial banking. Retail banking products and services Retail banking includes a range of products and services aimed at helping consumers manage their money. Common examples include: Deposit accounts: Retail banking customers can open checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). These accounts provide a secure place to save, earn interest, receive deposits, and more. Mortgages: Many retail banks provide mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to individuals purchasing homes or those wanting to borrow against their home equity. Loans and lines of credit: Retail banks may offer several types of loans, including personal loans, auto loans, and student loans. These loans help qualified customers finance a range of expenses. Credit cards: Many banks offer a variety of credit cards, which allow customers to borrow, earn rewards, and take advantage of purchase protection. Investments and insurance: You may be able to open investment accounts — such as IRAs and health savings accounts (HSAs) — and purchase investments from retail banks. And some offer insurance policies too. Branch access: Some retail banks have a network of branches to serve customers in person. On the other hand, some banks operate entirely online. Online and mobile banking: Many retail banks cater to online users with robust mobile and desktop banking platforms. These tools let you view your balances, make transfers, pay bills, deposit checks, and more. Read more: 10 best mobile banking apps of 2025 What is commercial banking? Commercial banking, sometimes referred to as corporate banking, refers to the banking products and services catered to corporations, businesses, and government organizations. Commercial banks may even serve a specific business type, model, or industry. Because commercial banking serves large corporate bodies, its products and services differ from those of retail banking. (However, commercial banks may have retail banking divisions catering to individuals and businesses.) Many large national banks — like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America — offer commercial banking services. But smaller regional banks and credit unions can offer these services too. Due to its customer base, commercial banking typically involves larger transactions, loans, and fees compared to retail banking. Read more: Community bank vs. credit union: Key differences Commercial banking products and services Common commercial banking products and services may include: Deposit accounts: Like individual consumers, businesses need checking and savings accounts to help them save, manage money, and pay bills. Credit and financing: Commercial banks offer business credit cards, loans, and other types of financing that allow businesses to grow and expand. International banking: International banking helps businesses and other entities transact across borders, including payment processing, asset management, and investment banking. Treasury management: These services help businesses manage their cash flow, receivables and payables, debt, merchant services, and more. Wealth management: Like retail banking, commercial banking can also include wealth management services, such as succession planning, retirement planning, and trust services.

Retail vs. commercial banking: Key differences Though retail and commercial banking have many similarities, they also differ in several ways. The following is a look at some key differences between them. Customers Retail banking caters to individual customers, while commercial banking caters to small and large businesses, corporations, and government entities. Products and services Retail banks typically offer deposit accounts, loans, credit cards, and investment accounts. Meanwhile, commercial banking offers all of this, plus international banking, Treasury management, and more. Transaction value Because retail banking caters to individuals, this type of banking typically deals in smaller transactions. Commercial banking, on the other hand, often facilitates much larger transactions at a larger scale. Purpose While retail banking assists individuals in borrowing, saving, and building wealth, commercial banks offer products and services aimed at facilitating business growth. Profitability Retail banks are generally less profitable than commercial banks for several reasons. First, as mentioned above, retail banks deal with smaller transactions compared to commercial banks. Second, many retail banks operate a wide network of brick-and-mortar branches, which can cut into profitability.

RBI Deputy Governor Rao flags concern over excessive unsecured borrowings RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao emphasises that financial entities have a duty to ensure that customers fully understand the risks associated with leveraged products and speculative investing By BL Mumbai Bureau Updated - February 21, 2025 at 02:02 PM. | Mumbai × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/rbi-deputy-governor-rao-flags-concern-over-excessive-unsecured-borrowings/article69246113.ece Copy M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) RBI has flagged some concerns of excessive borrowing in unsecured segment and from derivative euphoria in the capital markets. “The temptation of short-term gains can easily overshadow the long-term financial security of individuals,” RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao said at a BFSI summit jointly organised by IIM-K and NSE . He emphasised that financial entities have a duty to ensure that customers fully understand the risks associated with leveraged products and speculative investing. While RBI along with other financial sector regulators is taking progressive steps to educate the customers, financial sector entities also need to shoulder part of the responsibility, Rao said. Absence of financial literacy leads people to fall prey to unscrupulous players which erodes the trust of the people in the system, he added.

Advertisement With every 10 per cent decrease in labour costs brought about by generative AI, the brokerage industry could see an 8 per cent increase in net profit, and the insurance industry could receive a 13 per cent boost, Craig Cao, a financial analyst at UBS Securities, said during a webinar on Wednesday. The Swiss bank expects valuations of brokerage and insurance stocks to rise by as much as 21 and 18 per cent, respectively, this year. “AI is fundamentally disruptive, especially for [large language model]-intensive jobs,” Cao said. “When comparing across industries, the financial sector remains the leader in language-based roles.” UBS is bullish on the prospects of Chinese brokerage and insurance stocks. Photo: Reuters DeepSeek-R1, an open-source reasoning model released by the Hangzhou-based start-up on January 20, has made waves in China and abroad as it showed capabilities comparable to those of models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, but with significantly lower training costs. Advertisement Cao said that while the current implementation rate of generative AI across all industries was less than 10 per cent, the use cases in financial institutions accounted for as much as 37 per cent of the total in 2023 and 2024.

    "article_text": "By Nkhensani Nkhwashu , ITWeb portals journalist. Johannesburg, 19 Feb 2025 Nolwazi Hlophe, senior specialist: fintech at the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, emphasised the importance of human integration in AI systems, particularly in finance. The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector has brought about unprecedented benefits, including enhanced operational efficiency and improved decision-making. However, as AI systems become more autonomous, the need for human oversight has become more critical than ever, according to Nolwazi Hlophe, senior specialist: fintech at the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. Hlophe was speaking at the recent ITWeb AI Summit, where she emphasised the importance of human integration in AI systems, particularly in finance. While AI has the potential to revolutionise the financial industry, over-automating AI systems can lead to inefficiencies and risks. Without human oversight, AI systems may raise false alarms, miss critical transactions or perpetuate biases and discrimination. In finance, where trust and accountability are paramount, human intervention is essential to ensure that AI systems operate ethically and responsibly, noted Hlophe. She highlighted the importance of the \"human-in-the-loop” (HITL) approach, which integrates human feedback at various stages of AI and machine learning development processes. “This approach enables human experts to correct errors, provide labelled data and validate AI outputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy, reliability and adaptability of AI systems.” Applications of human-in-the-loop in finance Hlophe said the benefits of HITL approaches are evident in various financial applications, including fraud detection, credit scoring and chatbot customer service. In fraud detection, AI might raise false alarms as opposed to picking up real fraudulent transactions, and this is where a human being will come in to monitor that exchange, noted Hlophe. “Credit applications and scoring are particularly vulnerable to bias and discrimination, making human oversight crucial for maintaining trust in the financial system. Additionally, human-in-the-loop approaches have proven valuable in chatbot-based customer service, where complex queries require human intervention.” See also Bridging the digital divide: Why African languages must be included in AI #ITWebAI2025: Tech leaders urge patience, perspective, preparation with AI To ensure effective human oversight in AI systems, Hlophe recommended the following best practices, defining clear roles and responsibilities by ensuring that both AI systems and human operators understand these: Utilise advanced tools and technologies: Implement tools that facilitate seamless interaction between humans and AI, such as user-friendly dashboards and real-time monitoring systems. These technologies enhance the efficiency of human oversight. Invest in training and development: Provide comprehensive training programmes for financial professionals to enhance their understanding of AI systems and interpret AI outputs effectively. Establish continuous feedback mechanisms: Create processes for ongoing feedback from human operators to improve AI models. “We need to make sure that we work together with this technology to improve its function and its outcomes.” Share"

    "article_text": "Share We recently published a list of 12 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now In this article, we are going to take a look at where Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. In 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market’s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025. The US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter. READ ALSO: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Financial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 5.9% gain. Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability. Investor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024. Our Methodology For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

In 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market’s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025. The US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter. Also read: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Financial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 5.9% gain. Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability. Investor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024. Our Methodology For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:C) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now. In 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market’s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025. The US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth.

Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion.

Another key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve’s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, “2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.” Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test’s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year. The financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a “soft landing”—a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability. Investor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts.

    "article_text": "India needs to add USD 4 trn in bank capital to meet 'Viksit Bharat' GDP target: Report ANI | Updated: Feb 11, 2025 09:10 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [ India ], February 11 (ANI): India 's banking sector will need to raise USD 4 trillion in capital over the next two decades to support the country's goal of becoming a developed economy, or \"Viksit Bharat,\" by 2047, according to a report by HSBC Mutual Fund. The report highlighted that for India to achieve its ambitious target, its financial and banking assets must grow at a much faster rate than GDP . The country's GDP , which stood at USD 3.4 trillion in 2023, is projected to expand nearly nine times to USD 30 trillion by 2047. To support this economic expansion, financial assets--valued at USD 6.4 trillion in 2023--need to grow almost 19 times to USD 120 trillion by 2047. Similarly, banking assets, currently at USD 3.1 trillion, are expected to surge to USD 45 trillion, marking a 14.5-times increase. It said \" India 's banking industry will need to add USD 4 trn in capital in the next 2 decades to create the multiplier effect to reach the Viksit Bharat GDP target\". A well-developed financial sector plays a critical role in supporting economic growth by providing credit, investments, and other financial services. The report noteD that India 's financial sector must expand significantly to match the scale of other major economies. At present, the U.S. leads with USD 135 trillion in financial assets, followed by China at USD 78 trillion and Germany at USD 21 trillion. India 's financial sector, though much smaller today, will need to grow rapidly to sustain the country's economic ambitions. The banking sector, in particular, will require a significant infusion of capital--around USD 4 trillion over the next 20 years. This capital will be essential in creating a multiplier effect, which will help boost business investments, industrial growth, and infrastructure development. A strong banking system will also enhance global confidence in India 's economy, attracting more foreign investment. The report also projected that India 's GDP could nearly double to USD 7 trillion by 2030 from USD 3.4 trillion currently. However, sustaining high growth for the next two decades will be the real challenge. If India successfully expands its financial sector at the required pace, it will not only reach the USD 30 trillion GDP target but also emerge as a key player in the global economy by 2047. (ANI)"

Speaking on Morning Starr with Lantam Papanko, Dr. Atuahene argued that those seeking justice should direct their concerns to the Attorney General's office rather than looking to the IMF for intervention. \"This case started in 2017. After 2020, are you saying that the previous Attorney General didn't see anything wrong with it? Why couldn't he have prosecuted it? People make a lot of noise, but if they had a solid case, they should be asking the Attorney General why it wasn't pursued,\" he said. He further emphasized that Ghana's Limitation Act, NRCD 575, places time restrictions on legal actions, with some cases having a statute of limitations of three, five, or thirty years. He warned that prolonged delays could make it legally impossible to prosecute certain financial crimes. Amid discussions about petitioning the IMF over banking sector issues, Dr. Atuahene dismissed the move as ineffective. \"The IMF is not in this country to arbitrate on these matters. They are only here because we are taking their money. Reporting to them won't change anything because it's not part of their mandate,\" he explained. With the IMF delegation expected in Ghana next week, he noted that their focus would be on broader economic assessments, not unresolved financial sector cases. Dr. Atuahene also touched on the ongoing transition at the Bank of Ghana , stating that the acting governor must first gather financial sector data before being confirmed by the Council of State. He urged stakeholders to be more circumspect in their accusations, suggesting that earlier due diligence could have prevented the current predicament. \"If we had done the right thing from the start, would we be having this conversation today?\" he asked.

Speaking on Morning Starr with Lantam Papanko, Dr. Atuahene questioned the discrepancies in reported bailout figures and urged a thorough scrutiny of the sector. \"The reason I want the new government to act when they take over is to conduct a forensic audit of the amount that was reportedly used for the bailout,\" he stated. He pointed out that while government sources claimed GH¢21 billion was spent on the banking cleanup and GH¢25 billion on the financial sector, official records from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2019 reflected only GH¢12.7 billion. Dr. Atuahene urged Dr. Johnson Asiama, a key figure in the new administration, to take a critical approach and not accept reported figures at face value. \"He must act like the Minister of Roads. He must conduct a forensic audit of every cost item—everything that has happened, including the remittances,\" he emphasized. Highlighting further financial discrepancies, he revealed that Ghana's Economic Summary Report for 2023 stated that the country received GH¢55.1 billion in remittances. However, the Bank of Ghana 's balance sheet only accounted for GH¢2.8 billion, raising concerns about transparency. To ensure impartiality, Dr. Atuahene recommended hiring foreign auditors instead of local ones. \"I don't want Ghanaian auditors to handle this. I want foreign auditors to conduct a forensic audit of the entire banking sector cleanup, including legacy issues,\" he stressed. Beyond the bailout audit, he warned about the financial instability of the Bank of Ghana , which he described as \"capital deficient.\" He disclosed that the previous Minister of Finance had signed an agreement with the IMF requiring a recapitalization plan for the central bank. Given Ghana's limited fiscal space under the IMF program, Dr. Atuahene questioned how the government would secure the necessary funds. \"You can't recapitalize the banks and leave the central bank out,\" he cautioned, urging the new administration to take a holistic approach to financial sector reforms.

In view of this, the government should give the highest priority to bringing back discipline in the financial sector and mitigating labour unrest before it flares up, said the paper, presented by Finance Secretary Md Khairuzzaman Mozumder to Chief Adviser (CA) Muhammad Yunus. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, and other senior finance ministry officials were present, according to the press wing of the CA. The paper said factories near the Beximco Group's industrial enclaves are prone to the risk of labour unrest The paper said factories near the Beximco Group's industrial enclaves are prone to the risk of labour unrest because of the layoff of 40,000 workers across the textile and garment units of Beximco. Incidents of labour unrest have been taking place in factories whose owners are absconding on allegations of either corruption or money laundering. The paper said a section of vested groups instigates the workers and students. This often deteriorates law and order and creates public suffering in industrial zones, it added. The financial sector is also at risk because of the massive buildup of default loans. Some 10 banks are at high risk due to mismanagement by the previous government, said the finance ministry paper, adding that authorities have appointed international firms to review the asset quality of banks. At a press briefing after the meeting, Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to the CA, said the chief adviser asked the BB governor to ensure the autonomy of the central bank as soon as possible. The BB has stopped all kinds of fresh recruitment until now, he added. Alam said the government has been trying not to take on any unnecessary and less important projects anymore. Citing the finance ministry paper, he said that major economic indicators are showing positive signs. For instance, exports grew by 10 percent year-on-year, imports were increasing, jobs were being created, and inflation had come down to single digits. Inflation decreased because of the hike in the interest rate, and it is expected that inflation will come down to 7.5 percent by July of this year, said Alam. Furthermore, the government has taken some measures, such as a contractionary monetary policy and a conducive revenue policy, to arrest high inflationary pressure, he added.

    "article_text": "Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Tue, 04 Feb 2025 14:46:07 GMT Tech sector consolidation: Software stocks rise amidst mixed market signals 📈 Technology and Software Sector: Signs of Strength The technology sector shows a mixed performance today, highlighted by notable gains in software applications. Salesforce (CRM) stands out with an impressive rise of 2.01%, indicating investor confidence in software solutions. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) leads in software - infrastructure, increasing by 0.78%. These gains suggest a strategic consolidation within tech, driven by software growth. 📉 Semiconductor Sector: Subdued Performance In contrast, the semiconductor sector sees lackluster movements. Nvidia (NVDA) inches up by 0.38%, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shows a stronger uptick of 1.84%. Overall, semiconductors struggle to generate momentum, reflecting cautious investor sentiment towards hardware manufacturing. 💼 Financial Sector: Mixed Reactions The financial sector shows varied outcomes. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lifts the mood with a 0.70% gain. However, significant declines such as PayPal (PYPL), down by 7.63%, weigh heavily on the sector. The mixed financial sector performance could be indicative of broader market volatility and interest rate speculations. 🩺 Healthcare Sector: Notable Declines The healthcare sector faces challenges, with Merck (MRK) taking a sharp downturn of 10.41%. Diversified drug manufacturers like AbbVie (ABBV) also drop by 1.02%, contributing to a sector-wide bearish sentiment potentially linked to regulatory or earnings concerns. 🚀 Overall Market Analysis Despite mixed signals, the tech sector, particularly software stocks, shows pockets of strength, offering investors potential long-term growth opportunities. The semiconductor sector's subdued performance calls for caution, possibly affecting related tech stocks. Investor focus might shift towards companies demonstrating robust software innovation. Financial stocks mirror broader economic uncertainties, with varying results impacting investment strategies. Health sector downturns highlight potential regulatory influences or negative earnings surprises, necessitating careful monitoring by investors. Investors should keep a close eye on the technology sector's evolving dynamics, particularly in software, and consider adjusting portfolios to leverage these trends. Additionally, the mixed performance in financials underscores the importance of diversification.

    "article_text": "Secretary, Economic Affairs, Ajay Seth New Delhi: The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are in talks to further ease foreign exchange rules, especially with regard to non-debt instruments, economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth told ET. He said the exercise focused on simplifying Foreign Exchange Management Act ( FEMA ) regulations and updating them to modern standards will be completed in three-four months. Given that sector-specific limits for foreign direct investment (FDI) have already been substantially relaxed, the government is turning its attention to easing restrictive rules to woo foreign investors . These changes will further liberalise the rules on equity investments, helping India attract more risk capital. Secretary, Economic Affairs, Ajay Seth “The (legislation) was designed with assumptions and economic situations 25 years ago and certainly requires a closer look,” Seth said. Some measures had been initiated after the July 2024 budget and more will follow once the review process is over, he said. Having scaled a peak of almost $85 billion in FY22, total FDI fell over two years to $71 billion in FY24. To be sure, equity FDI has surged 45% on year in the first half of FY25 to $29.8 billion from $20.5 billion. Live Events Regulations for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were relaxed in November. Their investments would be categorised as FDI once they exceeded the 10% FPI ownership limit in an Indian company. This was done after the July 2024 budget said a simpler foreign investment regime would be put in place. The government had in August 2024 eased crossborder share swaps, allowing the issue or transfer of equity instruments of a local company in exchange for those of a foreign firm. Also, investments by an overseas citizen of India on a non-repatriation basis would not be counted as indirect foreign investment. FACTOR MARKET REFORM Seth said the government will prepare medium-tolong-term plans for land reforms in urban areas, building on the July 2024 budget announcements. Financial sector reforms are also being discussed. “The Financial Stability Development Council (FSDC), which is looking at financial sector reforms, will also look at the capital-side reforms,” Seth said. “These are all work in progress and we have some distance to go.” The FSDC, a platform on which all the financial sector regulators are represented, is headed by the finance minister. BROADER REGULATORY EASING Seth said the expert committee proposed in the February 1 budget to review non-financial sector regulations will examine licences, compliance and inspections among other matters with the broad principle of “trust first and scrutinise later,” as FM Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her speech. He said states are being encouraged to participate in this exercise. Rules in the financial sector are largely driven by the Union government and the relevant watchdogs. However, several non-financial sector regulations are primarily handled by the states, he said. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

It said \"India's insurance sector is performing well and is projected to become the fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028)\". The survey highlighted that the rapid expansion of the insurance market is driven by strong economic fundamentals, increasing corporate earnings, and rising institutional investments. Additionally, the sector has benefited from growing inflows from Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), higher financial formalisation, digitisation, and improved accessibility. These factors have strengthened the insurance market, making it a key contributor to India's financial sector growth. Alongside the insurance industry, the pension sector is also expected to grow significantly as India moves from a lower-middle-income to an upper-middle-income country. As income levels rise, more people are likely to invest in pension plans, ensuring long-term financial security.

The survey, presented a day ahead of the annual budget, details the state of the economy while flagging longer-term economic and policy issues. Its suggestions and recommendations are not binding. Regulators in the financial sector, such as the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board, are largely left to regulate themselves, the report said. While there are public consultation processes followed before new rules and regulations are formed, \"there is a huge potential for improvement in their responsiveness\", it added. The report suggested that regulators set up an independent Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) agency internally. The RIA would directly report to the board of the regulator, which includes members from the government and independent directors. This can provide an \"impartial and objective assessment of the regulatory processes and outcomes, including the economic and social impacts of regulations,\" the report said. Such a process would also improve the transparency and responsiveness of regulators, it added. (Reporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Sonia Cheema) © Reuters - 2025 Share"

Summary The affordable housing finance lender started operations in 2014 as Aspire Home Finance Corp. and has a loan book of ₹ 4,098 crore Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now Mumbai: Mumbai-based financial services group Motilal Oswal wants to exit the home finance business and has put its housing finance company on the block, three people aware of the matter said. The development comes in the backdrop of increased deal activity in the affordable housing space in the past few months, both from private equity investors and in the primary markets. Motilal Oswal has appointed investment bank Avendus Capital to look for potential buyers, the people cited above added on condition of anonymity. The group’s holding company, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, along with other wholly owned subsidiaries, currently holds 97.49% stake in the housing finance subsidiary, Motilal Oswal Home Finance. Also read | What’s Sebi’s score: Increasing complaints test regulator’s redressal system While it was not immediately known how much the stake might fetch, some of its listed peers in the affordable housing space—such as Aadhar Housing Finance, Aavas Financiers, Aptus Value Housing Finance India, and Home First Finance Company—are trading at 2.8-3.9 times their book value or net worth. As per data from Crisil, Motilal Oswal’s housing finance business had a standalone net worth of ₹ 1,290 crore as on 31 March 2024. Going by peer valuation, back-of-the-envelope calculations show the company could be valued between ₹ 3,612 crore and ₹ 5,031 crore. A spokesperson for Motilal Oswal Home Finance denied the move: “There is no such development of sale of business of Motilal Oswal Home Finance Ltd (MOHFL)\". The spokesperson added that the company continually evaluates various business opportunities as part of ongoing strategic efforts, and it would “communicate any relevant updates if there is any such specific development in future\". An email sent to Avendus remained unanswered till press time. The numbers The affordable housing finance lender started operations in 2014 as Aspire Home Finance Corp. and was renamed to Motilal Oswal Home Finance in 2019. As of 30 June 2024, it had a loan book of ₹ 4,098 crore, according to Crisil. The loan book size was ₹ 4,048 crore on 31 March 2024. The lender has had its share of asset quality troubles in the past. An August 2021 note by rating agency Icra had pointed out that in FY19, the lender’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 9.2% of loans. It said that the Motilal Oswal Group undertook “several remedial measures, including the strengthening of the systems and processes, managerial support, increased oversight, and capital infusion, thereby underscoring its commitment to the venture\". Also read | Why HDFC Bank turned down MUFJ's overtures on HDB Financial The asset quality situation has since improved, with gross NPA ratio at 1.3% as on 30 September 2024, down from 2.1% as on 30 September 2023. A peer comparison showed that Aadhar Housing Finance and Aptus Value Housing Finance India had gross NPA ratios of 1.3% and 1.25%, respectively, as on 30 September 2024. Meanwhile, Crisil Ratings believes that Motilal Oswal Home Finance remains strategically important to Motilal Oswal Financial Services as it gives the group exposure to the housing finance space. This “imparts diversity to its revenue profile and mitigates the effect of cyclicality inherent to capital-market businesses\". In September 2024, Crisil revised its outlook on non-convertible debentures of Motilal Oswal Home Finance to positive from stable. Rising deal activity The decision to put the business on the block comes at a time when private equity investors have taken a keen interest in affordable housing businesses. For instance, Shriram Finance sold its entire 84.44% stake in Shriram Housing Finance to Warburg’s affiliate, Mango Crest Investment, for ₹ 3,929 crore in December 2024. The company has since been rebranded as Truhome Finance. Then, EQT Partners acquired 100% stake in Indo Star Home Finance in September 2024. Earlier, CVC Capital Partners acquired a 26.47% stake in listed Aavas Financiers in August 2024, triggering an open offer for control. Also read | Why RBI's new rules on bad loans have enthused buyers of stressed asset Other private investors such as TA Associates, Prosus Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Multiples Alternate Asset Management have also made minority investments. These include investments into Vastu Housing Finance, Vridhi Finserv Home Finance and Shubham Housing Finance. The segment also saw two large IPOs (initial public offerings) last year. At least a few housing finance companies—including Aadhar Housing Finance—pivoted from a sale process in favour of the public markets because of lucrative valuations. Besides Aadhar, Bajaj Housing Finance also went public last year. Affordable homes a bright spot Experts said that the affordable housing segment continues to remain a bright spot supported by rapid urbanization, increasing migration to cities, and a growing middle class, and is likely to continue to be a high growth segment. “This is particularly attractive for non-banks given limited penetration of large banks allowing HFCs (housing finance companies) to generate attractive risk-adjusted yield,\" said Prakash Agarwal, a partner at debt market advisory firm Gefion Capital Advisors. According to Agarwal, the outlook for the sector continues to remain positive even in the long term and provides enough scope for sustained growth for the players in the segment. Also read | Indian bonds in Bloomberg's emerging market index: To give a feel of India “This allows the sector to attract significant capital as it supports many aspects which investors are looking for in terms of large addressable market, long term prospect, strong visibility, decent returns and regulatory support,\" Agarwal said. Mint reported on 28 December how mortgage lenders are increasingly looking to finance affordable homes on the back of stiff competition from banks in the prime housing space. The affordable housing loan market in India is estimated at ₹ 13 trillion, with HFCs constituting ₹ 6.9 trillion and banks having a share of ₹ 6.2 trillion, as per National Housing Bank data cited in a joint report from industry lobby body CII and real estate consultancy Knight Frank in December.

Disclaimer: While deposits in small finance banks are insured by the Deposit Insurance Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) up to Rs 5 lakh, experts advise investors to exercise caution when investing in their FDs. Given their unique business model, the risk associated with investing in small finance bank FDs might differ slightly from that of scheduled commercial banks. To mitigate potential risks, it's recommended that investors limit their exposure to small finance bank FDs to an amount that falls within the DICGC coverage. This ensures that their principal and interest are protected in unforeseen circumstances. According to HDFC Bank website as of January 18, 2025, The following will be applicable for a Regular Fixed Deposit: ●TDS will be deducted when interest payable or reinvested on RD and FD per customer across all branches, exceeds Rs 40,000 (Rs 50,000 for senior citizens) in a financial year. ●TDS Certificate will be mailed to you after the end of every quarter during the financial Year providing the details of TDS deducted during the quarter. “If interest amount is insufficient to recover TDS, the same may get recovered from the principal amount of Fixed Deposit. If a customer wishes to have TDS recovered from CASA, the same can be availed by filling a separate declaration at the branch. For renewed deposits, the new deposit amount consists of the original deposit amount plus Interest Less TDS, if any, less compounding effect on TDS. For reinvestment deposit, the interest reinvested is post TDS recovery and \"hence the maturity amount for reinvestment deposits would vary to the extent of tax and compounding effect on tax for the period subsequent of deduction till maturity,” said HDFC Bank on its website.

Source: Zelenskyy’s evening address \"Today, I signed documents concerning sanctions. One is a decree imposing sanctions on Russia’s financial sector, targeting 140 different entities. We will continue working with our partners to align our pressure,\" Zelenskyy said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In addition, Zelenskyy signed another document – a draft law on criminal liability for attempts to circumvent sanctions, which will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. \"We all understand that the more pressure we exert on the aggressor, the closer we bring peace. Sanctions are one of the most effective tools for justly pressuring Russia and everyone associated with it or working for the war,\" he concluded. Background: In September 2024, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy supported a new package of sanctions imposed by the National Security and Defence Council against 73 business entities – airports and air cargo companies – and 74 individuals in the Russian Federation. In December 2024, the National Security and Defence Council imposed personal sanctions on four legal entities and two individuals involved in the production of Russian FPV combat drones.

    "article_text": "It appears that no industry is immune from the threats of artificial intelligence . Many fields like tech , programming, and more have already seen AI replacing human roles. Now it looks like Wall Street could also lose thousands of jobs as AI replaces roles. It looks like the financial services sector is facing disruption as AI technologies are threatening to displace a considerable amount of its workforce. Thousands of jobs in the financial sector are at risk due to AI According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, Wall Street could see thousands of job cuts as AI is replacing human jobs. Major Wall Street banks could cut more than 200,000 jobs over the next three to five years due to the adoption of AI. Companies mainly attribute the significant job cuts to artificial intelligence’s ability to perform tasks that human workers traditionally carried out more efficiently and accurately. Furthermore, the report suggests that the impending job cuts will primarily impact back-office, middle-office, and operational departments. The jobs in these fields consist of routine and repetitive tasks. Some of the positions involve data analysis, financial trend assessment, and risk evaluations. These departments are particularly vulnerable as AI systems can process huge amounts of information and generate insights at speeds far better than humans. Entry-level positions on Wall Street could face an uncertain future The entry-level positions in Wall Street’s financial sector are the most vulnerable . The banks are considering slashing new hires by as much as two-thirds, as AI assumes responsibilities carried out by junior analysts. Some analysts say they may see job losses equating to five to ten percent. Furthermore, the source claims that pre-tax profits of the banks could be 12-17 percent higher in 2027 than they are today. Notably, the profit of the banks could surge massively due to improved productivity in the back-end jobs."

The bank had implemented several measures between July and November last year to stabilise the economy. These include restructuring of commercial banks, formation of a specialised banking task force, efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market and inflation control strategies. “Some of these initiatives have already yielded results, but other outcomes will require more time to manifest,” Shikha was quoted as saying by domestic media outlets. “We are hopeful that inflation will ease this January.

Srikrishna to chair ID verification firm Equal’s advisory board The retired Supreme Court justice, who led the Union government’s first data protection law formulation committee, will chair ID verification firm Equal with account aggregator firm OneMoney’s advisory board Updated - January 09, 2025 06:06 pm IST - NEW DELHI The Hindu Bureau READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Justice Srikrishna has served in various finance-focused roles, including the Sixth Pay Commission head, Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission chairperson, and also led the Expert Committee on Arbitration Law to propose reforms to the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. File | Photo Credit: Sivakumar P. V. Retired Supreme Court justice B. N. Srikrishna will chair the ID verification and data sharing platform Equal’s newly formed Advisory Board. Equal provides identity authentication services for large firms, boasting digital integrations with several ID providers. The appointment comes as the government finalises the Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025 , to implement the DPDP Act, 2023. Data Rules to be rolled out by mid-2025, says Ashwini Vaishnaw Justice Srikrishna was the chair of the first committee formed by the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to formulate a data protection law. That committee’s report, submitted in 2018, was eventually not taken up. Justice Srikrishna has also served in various finance-focused roles; he has headed the Sixth Pay Commission, chaired the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, and also led the Expert Committee on Arbitration Law to propose reforms to the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The advisory board for Equal will also counsel the account aggregator OneMoney. Account aggregators are firms that provide Indians with a consolidated view of their financial data, a key digitisation priority for the government. Editorial | No secret affair: On the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025 The commitment of two firms enable “secure, compliant and consent-driven data sharing aligns closely with my work in safeguarding privacy and fostering trust in technology based democratization of products and services,” Justice Srikrishna said in a statement provided by Equal. “Together, we aim to create frameworks that not only drive innovation but also set global benchmarks for ethical data usage and business practices.” The advisory board includes retired central bankers and bureaucrats who have been key in establishing and maintaining key digitisation priorities: the appointees include Jagdish Capoor, Rakesh Mohan and Anand Sinha, who have all served as Deputy Governor at the RBI; J. Satyanarayana and Ajay Prakash Sawhney, who have served as CEOs of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which administers Aadhaar; and P.H. Ravikumar, the founding CEO of the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX). Onemoney “provides a consent management solution for consumers and a secure data-sharing service for financial institutions and participants in the open banking ecosystem,” the company said. While the account aggregator framework has given rise to a few concerns around privacy of personal financial data, OneMoney founder Krishna Prasad said that the framework “democratises the financial sector by establishing a balance in exchanges between two unequal parties”.

According to him, the country's financial sector is weak, and there are unresolved issues that could pose a challenge for the next government. According to a report by myjoyonline.com, the economist made these remarks on the AM Show on Joy News on Monday, January 6, 2025. He further criticised the Akufo-Addo-led government for failing to deliver on its promise to establish a GH¢1.5 billion Ghana Financial Stability Fund, which was meant to support struggling banks. Dr. Iddrisu pointed out that the lack of this fund has left the financial sector vulnerable, with banks recording significant losses under the current administration. “Banks have made losses amounting to GH¢60 billion, including the Bank of Ghana itself,” Dr. Iddrisu stated. “This is not an economy that is doing well. If the financial sector was healthy, such massive losses would not be recorded.” He noted that the promised stability fund, which was supposed to help stabilize the sector, has not been fully established, adding that the outgoing government has only secured a partial commitment of $250 million from the World Bank, which is not fully there yet. “This is just one example. If the economy was truly performing well, we wouldn’t be leaving such massive debts for the next administration to inherit,” he said. The economist expressed concern over the government’s focus on GDP growth as a measure of economic success. He asserted that while the outgoing administration has announced a GDP growth rate of 7%, the figure does not reflect the overall growth of the economy. “An economy cannot be judged solely by its growth rate. GDP growth does not necessarily mean the population is doing well. Other critical sectors, like energy and banking, tell a different story,” he explained. He criticised what he described as the government’s narrow focus on growth statistics, stating that a more comprehensive view of the economy reveals significant weaknesses. Dr. Iddrisu warned that without urgent action to address the financial instability, the NDC government will inherit a collapsed banking sector. “The NDC is likely to face serious banking crises if the stability fund is not established. Handing over a weakened financial sector and massive debts is not the mark of an economy that is doing well,” he remarked.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250106581587/en/ Regions Bank has selected Axway, a data integration company, and its Amplify Open Banking solution, to deliver future open banking capabilities for Regions’ customers. (Photo: Business Wire) With customer consent, open banking allows clients’ financial data to be shared securely between financial institutions and third-party service providers of their choice. This, in turn, enables customers to share their financial data to support a variety of needs including financial management and budgeting activities. Currently, Regions Bank customers can authorize third-party platforms to obtain their financial data through a credential-based process known as “screen scraping.” In the future, Regions’ digital banking capabilities will be supported by Amplify Open Banking in a new way that further enhances security with an application programming interface (API) solution. The result will be not only greater security but also a simpler, more seamless customer experience. Here’s how it will work: Regions’ Consumer Banking and Wealth Management clients will still be able to choose to share financial data with third parties if they wish. Instead of the third-party platform saving the banking credentials to use every time a transaction is made, Regions will authorize consent to share account information only after individual transactions are approved by the client. This new process will remove the need for third-party platforms to save their banking credentials on their own systems. A more secure connection will be created between the customer’s permissioned Regions Bank account and the third-party platform the customer chooses. Regions will monitor third-party activity and provide the customer with the means to review and, if needed, deactivate data sharing from their Regions account at any time. Separately, Corporate Banking clients can leverage Amplify’s Marketplace feature to connect their Regions financial data seamlessly through a secure API connection. “At Regions, our focus is on serving customers when and where they want,” said Tim Mills, emerging and digital payments group manager at Regions Bank. “As customers continue to grant access to their financial data to third party applications, this new solution will help capture customer consent, remove the need for credential sharing to third parties, and provide another layer of security to protect customer data. Open banking is the future, and we are pleased to work with Axway to make banking easy for customers who turn to Regions time and again for their banking needs.” Seite 1 von 3 Seite 2 ► Business Wire (engl.) 0 Follower Autor folgen RSS-Feed abonnieren Verfasst von Business Wire (engl.)

    "article_text": "San Francisco, United States - November 27, 2022: A picture of the Deloitte sign. Audio By Carbonatix Banks in Ghana and Nigeria will continue to shift from traditional banking operations to digital banking services in 2025 and beyond. According to Deloitte West Africa, mobile banking, online platforms, and digital payment solutions will dominate the sector, driven by the high adoption of mobile devices and internet penetration. In its Sneak Preview of 2025 report, the professional services firm said traditional banks will increasingly invest in digitizing their operations to meet consumer demand for convenience and efficiency and to compete more favourably with financial technology firms (fintech). It however warned that the expansion in digital banking services and use of IT infrastructure will continue to expose financial services players to cyber security challenges. Implications It pointed out that digital banking reduces operational costs, but banks will need to invest heavily in IT infrastructure and cyber security. Similarly, expanded digital banking services across all cadres will improve access to banking for under-served and rural populations, aligning with government financial inclusion goals. Banking Expansion and Increase Funding Deloitte continued that the banking sector is poised for significant growth in 2025. It added that the regulatory increase in capital requirements set by the Central Bank of Nigeria will prompt banks to bolster their capital base through equity infusions, mergers, and acquisitions, and this trend is anticipated to persist. “The ongoing recapitalisation exercise is attracting the much-needed inflow from both domestic and foreign investments which will further strengthen the sector’s financial stability”.

    "article_text": "Dr Ernest Addison, Bank of Ghana Governor Audio By Carbonatix Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG), Dr Ernest Yedu Addison, has shed light on the incomplete cleanup of the financial sector, particularly focusing on the Savings and Loans (S&L) subsector. In an interview on PM Express Business Edition on Joy News on January 2, he acknowledged that while significant progress had been made, a lack of resources had stalled the revocation of licenses for some troubled institutions, leaving depositors in limbo. Dr Addison was candid about the challenges faced in fully addressing the issues in the Savings and Loans sector. “Okay, did we fully complete the cleanup? This is the question you are asking,” he began. “The legacy we inherited, especially on the S&L side, includes some institutions that are still in trouble. \"Their licenses have not been revoked, and the reason is simple: the government does not have the resources to refund the deposits to the depositors.” He stated that the issue was not one of oversight but of budgetary constraints. “We’ve been waiting for three years to get the budgetary resources to solve that problem. \"We would have wished that we had the resources so that we could have fully completed the cleanup on the S&L side, but we didn’t,” he stated. Despite the incomplete cleanup, Dr Addison reassured the public that the impact on the overall financial system was minimal. “Fortunately for us, these are not systemic institutions. When you look at their sizes and the amount of exposure they have, they really will not have a systemic impact on the financial sector,” he explained. However, he acknowledged the frustration of depositors still waiting for their funds. “This is an issue that has been part of our discussions with the IMF. Once the budgetary issue is resolved, that problem will be taken care of,” he affirmed. Reflecting on the broader cleanup efforts, Dr Addison highlighted the significant steps taken to address depositor concerns in other segments of the financial sector. “Depositors and investors, as of the deadline given, those who respected the deadlines put out by the receiver, have fully received their deposits,” he noted. He acknowledged that the government’s approach to compensating depositors was particularly generous. “One of the errors that we did, I should say, was because the government was very generous with the intervention,” he admitted. “Not only did depositors get their original defaults, but also the interest they had accrued over the years. It made the whole exercise very expensive, but most of them were paid.” Dr Addison’s remarks highlight a key challenge for the financial sector’s recovery: balancing fiscal constraints with the need to restore confidence in Savings and Loans institutions. While the central bank has contained potential contagion effects, he acknowledged the urgency of addressing unresolved issues to complete the sector’s cleanup. “The banking sector cleanup was not just about fixing a broken system; it was about creating a foundation for long-term growth,” he said. “We must ensure that all aspects of the financial sector can fulfil their roles effectively, including the Savings and Loans sector.” DISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.

    "article_text": "Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:46:07 GMT Today's stock market reveals significant activity in the technology sector, with notable gains among major players like Amazon and Google. Meanwhile, the auto manufacturer sector faces challenges, led by a decline in Tesla. 📈 Tech Sector: Rising Momentum The technology sector is experiencing robust growth, highlighted by an impressive 1.56% gain in Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) 0.87% increase. This upward trend signals growing investor confidence in tech stocks. Oracle (ORCL), with a 1.12% lift, contributes to the sector’s positive momentum. 📉 Consumer Electronics and Automobiles: Mixed Outcomes While tech stocks shine, Apple (AAPL) faces a 0.89% decline, reflecting potential challenges or investor profit-taking. In the auto sector, Tesla (TSLA) experiences a substantial 3.64% drop, raising concerns about the industry's short-term prospects. 🚀 Consumer Cyclical and Communication: Strong Performers Amazon (AMZN) emerges as a standout, gaining 1.57%, suggesting robust consumer demand. Communication services also show strength, with Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META) rising by 0.82% and 1.22%, respectively. 🏦 Financial Sector: Stability and Growth The financial sector presents a stable outlook, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) up 0.63% and Visa (V) increasing by 0.62%. Consistent growth in financials highlights investor confidence amidst economic uncertainty. 📚 Strategic Recommendations: Consider increasing exposure to the technology sector, particularly in software infrastructure and semiconductors, given their current upward trajectories. Monitor consumer cyclical stocks like Amazon, which continue to exhibit resilience despite broader market fluctuations. Exercise caution in the auto manufacturer space, particularly with Tesla's recent downturn signaling potential volatility. The U.S. stock market today paints a mixed picture, with opportunities and risks spread across sectors. Investors should remain vigilant and agile, leveraging real-time data from ForexLive.com to adapt to these ever-evolving market dynamics."
