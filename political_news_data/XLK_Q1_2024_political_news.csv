In the nearly six months since the war began on October 7, Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion in 220 private financing rounds. The biggest financing round completed since the start of the war was by fintech company Next Insurance, which received investments of over $250 million from each of two foreign investment funds. RELATED ARTICLES IVC-LeumiTech: Israeli startups raised $1.6b in Q1 The data also show that the overall amount of mergers and acquisitions in Israel's tech sector since the start of the war totaled $3.7 billion. Among the companies acquired for large amounts were Talon Security, acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $625 million, Dig Security, also acquired by Palo Alto for $350 million, Avalor acquired by Zscaler for $350 million and Gem Security acquired by Israeli company Wiz for $350 million. Two other cybersecurity companies - Flow Security and Spera Security, were acquired for $200 million and $130 million, respectively. In the healthcare sector, there were also major acquisitions with CartiHeal, which manufactures coral implants to support damaged human cartilage, acquired for $330 million. ""After the war, I anticipate a startup baby-boom of tech companies"" The report found that since October 7, 20 new Israeli venture capital funds have been founded that have raised an overall $2 billion. Eleven of the funds were founded to provide a response to the urgent needs of startups experiencing financing difficulties because of the war. Among these funds were Iron Nation, the resilience fund set up by OurCrowd, Trendlines - Startup Shield SPV, a fund supported by Google Support Fund, as well as other funds. These figures come alongside a significant fall in manpower in the industry since October 7, with about 15% of employees drafted into the army reserves and short term financing shortfalls caused by the war, mainly hitting early stage startups. The data for the report was gathered by Finder Spotlight Research. SNC CEO Avi Hasson said, ""With attractive valuations and significant growth potential, the Israeli tech ecosystem is showing characteristic resilience. I anticipate seeing a new wave of innovation - a ‘startup baby boom’ of tech companies - which will create even more dynamic opportunities for our sector after this war.""

The rules, released in October, seek to halt shipments to China of more advanced AI chips designed by Nvidia and others as Washington cracks down on Beijing over concerns its advancing tech sector could help boost China's military. The new rules, which run 166 pages in length, go into effect next Thursday. They clarify, for example, that restrictions on chip shipments to China also apply to laptops containing those chips. The Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has said it plans to continue updating its restrictions on technology shipments to China as it seeks to bolster and fine-tune the measures.

The tech industry is constantly pushing new technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the latest tech driving conversations across the tech sector. It is something those involved in advancing Kubernetes and cloud native architectures regard as an important technolology to support. But like many tech innovations, there is a lot of industry hype associated wuth AI. Quoting Alan Greenspan, former chief of the Federal Reserve Board in the US, Sharma used her keynote to discuss “irrational exuberance” in technology innovation. Greenspan’s quote refers to the risk that some US stock prices are overvalued. In the tech sector and across society, Sharma points out that people get very excited about new technology innovation. She says they invest in resources and spend time looking into concepts that are not 100% fully thought through. Some of these may not yield the results needed to give a return on this investment. “Identifying that something is irrationally exuberant is,” says Sharma: “When there's a bit of cognitive dissonance.” Sharma is a self-taught software developer and she admits she has had ups and downs in her journey in software development. Her journey began when she was setting up her own startup. “We had to build our website. Someone had to get it going and that's how I learned.” Now, full time at CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation), her main opportunities to drill down into software development happens in preparation for the twice-yearly KubeCon/CloudNativeCon events. Kubernetes is being positioned as the technology to make AI workable. Container orchestration is being applied to manage graphics processing units (GPUs) for running machine learning and inference workloads. During her keynote presentation, Sharma gave a little demo showcasing the ease with which she could depoy a Large Language Model (LLM) application on her laptop using Kubernetes. She says: “Over the last few years, I have actually really enjoy doing my keynotes. That's where I've made a conscious decision to immerse myself in a certain technology, learn as much as I can and develop a demo with the help of my team and then deliver it. That is often the way I get to stay engaged [in software development] while also running an organisation that has as large of a footprint as CNCF.” In the video below, Enterprise Strategy Group analysts discusss the highlights of KubeCon 2024 in Paris."

China’s high-tech sector is driving an increasing amount of demand for goods and services in the world’s second-biggest economy, and its contribution could rival real estate by 2026, according to Bloomberg Economics. “The high tech sector has potential to become a much more significant source of growth,” economists Chang Shu and Eric Zhu wrote in a report Bloomberg Terminal . It’s estimated to drive demand worth nearly 19% of GDP by 2026, up from 14.3% last year, and almost on par with the property sector now."

With most men unable to leave Ukraine, women tech entrepreneurs like Anna Lissova, 30, who runs mental health startup Pleso Therapy, have taken charge of raising funds, finding new clients abroad and embracing other key roles. Before the war she focused on recruiting therapists in Ukraine. Now she travels abroad to pitch the company at conferences and has led product launches in Poland and Romania. “I had to suddenly change my role and take over the public representation of the company. The war led to women taking more senior positions and power in startups,” she said. Martial law prohibits most men of military age from leaving the country, creating a need and space for female tech entrepreneurs at home and abroad. They are able to build on a stronger representation by women in leadership positions in Ukraine than in the European Union and globally. Some say they still face prejudice in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry however, or describe their struggles to run a business while adapting to life as a refugee and having to raise families alone with fathers still in Ukraine. Over the past decade, Ukraine has boasted one of eastern Europe’s fastest growing tech hubs with startups attracting funding and clients from a large domestic market. Proportion Women were underrepresented however, making up only around 30 per cent of managers in the professional, scientific and technical sector, whereas they occupied 40pc of leadership positions in Ukraine overall in 2017-2022, according to a study by the United Nations Development Programme. The study highlighted that the proportion of Ukrainian women leaders nonetheless outstripped a figure of 35pc for the European Union and 29pc globally. Separate figures by Eurostat show around 17pc of major tech jobs are held by women in the European Union. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen venture capitalists, tech founders and industry officials to document the critical – and often new – roles women have played in driving a sector seen as key to Ukraine’s economic prospects when the war ends. “Women’s leadership within the tech sector has become more pronounced after the full-scale invasion,” said Pavlo Kartashov, director of the Ukrainian Startup Fund (USF), a government-backed body that seeds startups. This rings especially true for ambitious startups looking to grow abroad, as many that have stayed in Ukraine focus on military or war-related technology such as drones, he added. The tech sector has proved resilient. While Ukraine’s GDP plummeted nearly 30pc in 2022, tech sector revenue rose nearly 1pc to $7.97 billion and was forecast to increase to $8bn in 2023, according to state statistics compiled by the Lviv Tech Cluster. The industry also accounts for nearly 5pc of Ukraine’s GDP with the number of tech specialists inside and outside Ukraine rising to 307,000 in 2023 from 285,000 in 2022. These numbers include the Lisbon-based founder of digital currency payment platform GeekPay. Veronica Korzh, who founded the startup three months after leaving Ukraine in February 2022, has witnessed a leap in female founders, due in part to increased access to investors outside Ukraine and accelerator programs targetting women funded by the EU, international bodies and tech multinationals. For many tech workers, Poland is a first stop as it borders Ukraine and the countries have long business and cultural ties. Anastasiia Smyk, 27, an aeronautical engineer, launched her aviation operations management software company Input Soft outside Ukraine in Warsaw, where she tapped a burgeoning refugee tech community. Her product is now used in the US, Latin America and Southeast Asia. “When talking to male investors, there were questions like ‘Why were you appointed CEO of this company?’ or ‘Please share if you have any male business partners’” she said. But she fought against the prejudice. “My job was to find investments, recognition in the global market, and international clients who would become our early adopters, which was not easy for a no-name startup company from Ukraine,” Smyk said. Looking at the startups founded by Ukrainian refugees she predicts many will return to the country when the war ends and give a huge boost."

(WV News) — As the technology sector becomes more and more prevalent nationally, West Virginia officials believe the state can capitalize on the growth and bring more companies here, although they noted that it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. For 30 years, the goal of the West Virginia High Technology Foundation — located in Fairmont — has been to bring more technology jobs to North Central West Virginia, and it has succeeded in landing federal agencies like NASA and NOAA to its doorstep and the I-79 Technology Park. West Virginia High Technology Foundation President and CEO Jim Estep said he “firmly believes” the state will suffer if the technology sector isn’t made a priority of economic development throughout the state. Estep “I know that’s a drum I’ve beaten for a long time, but it remains as true today as it did 20 years ago,” Estep said. “As I look around our region, I’d like to see more growth in our federal operations across the board. “However, at the same time, I’m very enthusiastic about what NOAA is doing here in the park. They launched basically a $300 million expansion here in the park just before Christmas, which is going to see an amazing upgrade of the infrastructure we have to support high-performance computing and the next generation of satellite ground systems.” John Deskins, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research in West Virginia University’s John Chambers College of Business and Economics, said he, too, sees the chance for West Virginia to capitalize on the national growth of tech. Deskins “I see opportunities because that’s a sector that’s growing nationally, and it’s a sector that will continue to be important as our economy evolves over time,” Deskins said. “There’s a pie out there to potentially grab a piece of.” He said that, generally speaking, the state shouldn’t be tightly holding onto a sector that’s shrinking nationally. But he added that while the technology sector may be a great investment for some parts of the state, it’s not the answer everywhere. “When we look for opportunities, we have to find things that we have a comparative advantage in,” Deskins said. “We have to go to a potential company and say, ‘This is why it would be in your best interest to come to West Virginia.’ In some places of West Virginia, we might have that comparative advantage that will be attractive to the tech sector. … “In North Central West Virginia, there is a lot of tech sector (growth) already. There might be a good reason why those companies can locate there. But, I doubt that applies to all counties in West Virginia.” Deskins said that if the technology sector doesn’t “fit in” with an area’s existing economy — especially regions of the state with poor broadband connections — it would be hard to convince a company to invest millions of dollars into building a facility there. “The competition is very stiff because every state is trying to attract tech jobs, so I wouldn’t want … some parts of West Virginia to focus on the tech sector to the detriment of other possibilities,”he said. “We’re not going to get companies to come here out of the kindness of their heart. It has to be in their best interest to come here.” Estep said that while his vision has received a lot of support from West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice — noting Justice’s support has been invaluable — it also hasn’t translated to the kind of support Estep believes is needed from the state as a whole. Estep said he believes in order for the state to reach its potential with the technology sector, the opportunities need to be recognized by policymakers and legislators in Charleston. “That has to be a central part of our economic development policy,” Estep said. “Secondly, significant investment needs to be made available for us to participate nationally. This takes real investment. This takes forward thinking strategy that is not just a press opportunity — a real investment in institutionalizing this type of industry in our state and economy.” While the technology is growing nationally, Deskins cautioned certain areas of the state against going after associated companies just because of the “sexy” appeal. “I wouldn’t want to get distracted by something that sounds (good) over something that’s more realistic or doable for certain parts of West Virginia,” Deskins said. “We want to be very balanced and objective. We don’t want to be overly focused on traditional energy jobs because that’s our history, but at the same time, we don’t want to throw our hands up and say ‘These jobs are going away so we need to focus on the tech sector.’ … “There has to be a balanced and objective approach to think about what will work for us over the next 20 years. It’s difficult.” Fairmont News Editor John Mark Shaver can be reached at 304-844-8485 or jshaver@theet.com . You must be logged in to react. Click any reaction to login.

https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2024/03/22/ukrainian-women039s-startups-drive-tech-sector-resilience-offer-economic-recovery-hope,,"Ukrainian women startups drive tech sector resilience , offer economic recovery hope",20240322T101500Z,,thestar.com.my,English,Malaysia,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - War in Ukraine has pushed women into more leadership roles in its growing tech sector, where they are gaining experience and contacts abroad that could help rebuild the economy when the conflict ends, some entrepreneurs, companies and investors say. With most men unable to leave Ukraine, women tech entrepreneurs like Anna Lissova, 30, who runs mental health startup Pleso Therapy, have taken charge of raising funds, finding new clients abroad and embracing other key roles. Before the war she focused on recruiting therapists in Ukraine. Now she travels abroad to pitch the company at conferences and has led product launches in Poland and Romania. ""I had to suddenly change my role and take over the public representation of the company. The war led to women taking more senior positions and power in startups,"" she said. Martial law prohibits most men of military age from leaving the country, creating a need and space for female tech entrepreneurs at home and abroad. They are able to build on a stronger representation by women in leadership positions in Ukraine than in the European Union and globally. Some say they still face prejudice in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry however, or describe their struggles to run a business while adapting to life as a refugee and having to raise families alone with fathers still in Ukraine. Over the past decade, Ukraine has boasted one of eastern Europe's fastest growing tech hubs with startups attracting funding and clients from a large domestic market. Women were underrepresented however, making up only around 30% of managers in the professional, scientific and technical sector, whereas they occupied 40% of leadership positions in Ukraine overall in 2017-2022, according to a study by the United Nations Development Programme. The study highlighted that the proportion of Ukrainian women leaders nonetheless outstripped a figure of 35% for the European Union and 29% globally. Separate figures by Eurostat show around 17% of major tech jobs are held by women in the European Union. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen venture capitalists, tech founders and industry officials to document the critical -- and often new -- roles women have played in driving a sector seen as key to Ukraine's economic prospects when the war ends. ""Women's leadership within the tech sector has become more pronounced after the full-scale invasion,"" said Pavlo Kartashov, director of the Ukrainian Startup Fund (USF), a government-backed body that seeds startups. ""We have witnessed a surge of female entrepreneurs who have stepped up to lead their companies and are driving growth."" This rings especially true for ambitious startups looking to grow abroad, as many that have stayed in Ukraine focus on military or war-related technology such as drones, he added. TECH RESILIENCE The tech sector has proved resilient. While Ukraine's GDP plummeted nearly 30% in 2022, tech sector revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $7.97 billion and was forecast to increase to $8 billion in 2023, according to state statistics compiled by the Lviv Tech Cluster. The industry also accounts for nearly 5 percent of Ukraine's GDP with the number of tech specialists inside and outside Ukraine rising to 307,000 in 2023 from 285,000 in 2022. These numbers include the Lisbon-based founder of digital currency payment platform GeekPay. Veronica Korzh, who founded the startup three months after leaving Ukraine in February 2022, has witnessed a leap in female founders, due in part to increased access to investors outside Ukraine and accelerator programs targetting women funded by the EU, international bodies and tech multinationals.

In the latter category, data storage mainstay Seagate Technology ( STX 2.05% ) had a bullish trading session, closing more than 1% higher against the S&P 500 index's 0.3% upward crawl. Seagate largely has one of its tech sector peers to thank for that. The Micron effect That peer is flash memory maker Micron Technology , which unveiled its latest set of quarterly results before market open. Happily for that company's shareholders and the elements of the tech sector affected by the memory market -- like Seagate's stock in trade, storage -- the results were impressive. Micron posted a heavy double-digit rise in revenue, while its non-GAAP (adjusted) operating profit flipped into the black. All things being equal, if the various chip segments in the tech sphere are doing well, storage also stands to gain. Robust demand for chips tends to indicate a hunger for more sophisticated products, and more sophisticated products tend to raise the need for larger-capacity and better storage solutions. It almost goes without saying at this point that much of the momentum behind such companies is due to the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. These require vastly more computing power, hence the need for cutting-edge processing hardware. Expand NASDAQ : STX Seagate Technology Plc Today's Change ( -2.05 %) $ -6.03 Current Price $ 287.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $63B Day's Range $ 283.69 - $ 296.03 52wk Range $ 63.19 - $ 296.03 Volume 171K Avg Vol 4.3M Gross Margin 36.86 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % A rosy, AI-powered future AI is only going to get more sophisticated in the coming months and years, and quickly. That should keep chip demand sustainably high, and storage solutions businesses like Seagate are poised to continue benefiting from the knock-on effect."

The investment activity has been driven primarily by significant funding in the ‘mobility’ and ‘energy’ sub-sectors, which collectively secured over 94 per cent of the total climate-tech investments in India from 2019 till the end of November 2023. This dominant trend underscores the critical focus on these areas within the broader climate technology field, according to the report by consulting firm FSG. “It highlights the role climate innovation and sustainable practices play in our nation’s future, underscoring the importance of prioritising climate solutions in our national agenda,” said Rishi Agarwal, MD and Head-Asia at FSG. The overall investment growth in the climate-tech sector in recent years can be attributed to several key factors. “Primarily, there has been a significant rise in awareness among citizens, businesses, and governments regarding the importance of embracing sustainable practices,” the report stated. Additionally, the government has steadily enhanced incentives in the sector, sparking interest among investors. “Despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term growth trajectory of India’s climate-tech sector remains promising, underpinned by increasing awareness and government incentives,” said Agarwal. –IANS na/svn Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Email Telegram Flip Copy URL Previous article ‘Star Wars: The Acolyte’ debuts with first trailer Next article Gulshan Devaiah: Anurag Kashyap has contributed a great deal to my career RELATED ARTICLES Redmi 13 5G India launch on July 9: Key specs confirmed July 9, 2024 Maruti Suzuki trains 8.5K commercial drivers in post-accident emergency care April 30, 2024 FirstCry refiles papers for IPO to raise Rs 1,816 crore April 30, 2024 Latest Kareena Kapoor & Jeh’s UNSEEN BIRTHDAY VIDEO S A PURE JOY‑RIDE-Goes VIRAL AND Fans Are Going GAGA!

Tencent's total net profit for 2023 stood at 115.2 billion yuan ($16.0 billion), according to a filing of annual results at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Decades of meteoric growth that turned China's tech industry into one of the most dynamic in the world came to an abrupt halt in 2020, when Beijing introduced more stringent oversight measures. Authorities have since relaxed their approach to regulating the vital domestic tech sector as broader concerns about the health of China's economy mount. Tencent -- one of the world's leading gaming firms and developer of China's ubiquitous messaging and services app WeChat -- announced Wednesday 609.0 billion yuan ($84.6 billion) in total revenue in 2023, up 10 percent year-on-year. The Shenzhen-based firm also announced plans to increase the size of its share repurchasing scheme, more than doubling in 2024 from last year to ""over HKD100 billion"" ($12.8 billion), the filing said. In 2022, Tencent saw its annual profit fall 16 percent on the heels of a fresh crackdown by officials on video game addiction among youth. And despite more recent signs of vigour in the sector, the regulatory hurdle for new games remains ""relatively large"", Li Chengdong, founder of Beijing-based tech consultancy Dolphin, told AFP. New games in China must first obtain formal approval from authorities before being released. The issuance of all new game licences was frozen for nine months in 2021, and approvals have not since returned to the speed and reliability of previous years. ""Even if (Tencent) develops new games, there's no guarantee it can distribute them,"" Li said. Tencent and several of its domestic competitors -- including Alibaba, Huawei and Baidu -- are now eyeing the promising field of artificial intelligence (AI). Last September, Tencent unveiled Hunyuan, an AI-powered chatbot intended to compete with the US's ChatGPT, whose services are not accessible in China. Wednesday's filing hailed Hunyuan as a ""top-tier foundation model with superior performance in numerical reasoning, logical inference, and multi-turn conversations"". But despite the push into AI, gaming still represents Tencent's most important business, Li told AFP, adding that ""in the short term, there's not much expectation that the revenue from AI products could cover the costs"". As many Chinese tech giants rush into AI, Tencent remains cautious about making big moves, Beijing-based tech expert Kevin Zhou told AFP. ""(Tencent is) slower in pouring investment and could be up to one or two years behind the first movers,"" Zhou said. The firm is seeking to enhance its position in the video games sector by acquiring stakes in emerging studios, particularly in Europe. Tencent, founded in 1998 in the midst of China's rapid economic development, is a key player in the country's tech sector as the parent of the WeChat ""super-app"". WeChat is on most mobile phones in China, where it is used for a wide range of purposes including messaging, calling, digital payment and social media. China © Copyright AFP 2025.

The IT skill development and empowerment initiative is intended to bridge talent supply gaps while providing individuals with the opportunity to meet their training goals and launch careers in the tech industry. About 40 young girls will receive full sponsorship from Unity Bank for the special training initiative, which was conceived as part of activities to commemorate this year’s International Women’s Day 2024.

All beneficiaries of the programme will be trained on different aspects of software development and provided with mentorship and resources that they need to succeed, including life skills like critical thinking, communication, innovation, & problem-solving. Speaking on the partnership, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun, said the initiative aligns with the theme of the IWD 2024, #InspireInclusion, adding that empowering young women reflects the bank’s commitment to driving inclusion, equality, and diversity across industries. She stated, “As a bank committed to fostering economic empowerment and gender equality, we are proud to partner with SkillPaddy on this initiative to contribute to the training and empowerment of 1,000 female software engineers. Through this programme, we are not only investing in the future of these talented women but also driving innovation and diversity within the tech industry.

This was stated in a report about the state of the Dutch tech sector released earlier this week. Young innovative companies can grow more easily if they have the government as a client, said the interest group. The Netherlands is lagging behind in this regard, the organization said. Techleap drew a comparison with Germany. Of all start-ups that received their first 100,000 to 10 million euros in venture capital investments in that country, 32 percent managed to grow into a scale-up with more than 10 million euros in capital raised. In the Netherlands, 19 percent of start-ups succeeded. This meant that the scale-up share was also lower than in France and the United Kingdom, according to Techleap's annual report on the tech sector. The government can change this by paying for services from start-ups. The Netherlands would mainly have to focus on deep tech, the term for the first applications of discoveries at universities and research institutions. The government could follow the example of the United States, where the government acts as a ""client of deep tech companies rather than their project manager."" The association concluded from its own calculations that venture investments in this segment of the tech sector increased by about 15 percent in the Netherlands between 2022 and 2023. This is while total investments in the Dutch tech sector fell by 25 percent last year, partly due to higher interest rates and a weakening economy. Techleap said attracting and retaining highly trained personnel is a big problem for young, innovative companies. Although the vacancies are not rising as fast as in the last few years, the job market is very tight. Workers from abroad are vital for this reason, and they believe that the government should keep the Netherlands as an attractive place for immigrants. The start-up association has been lobbying for favorable tax arrangements for a long time. They also say a great deal can be done in the areas of diversity and inclusive thinking in the technological sector. A survey of employees showed that 45 percent of staff members in the tech sector with a non-Western background feel like they face bias and unfair treatment. Reporting by ANP"

We have another four S&P 500 members on deck to report Q1 results this week, including Oracle ORCL on Monday, March 11 th , and Adobe ADBE on Thursday, March 14 th . The earnings reports from Costco and AutoZone and this week’s reports from Oracle and Adobe are for their respective fiscal quarters ending in February, which we and other research organizations count as part of the overall March-quarter or Q1 tally. In fact, by the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results on April 12 th , we will have Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members. Regular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our sanguine view of corporate profitability. We aren’t saying that the earnings picture is great, but we don’t agree with the doom-and-gloom projections either. Earnings growth remained under pressure in 2022 and through the first half of 2023 as a host of macro factors weighed on corporate profits. These factors included the post-COVID onset of inflationary pressures that compressed margins while the Fed’s extraordinary tightening moderated top-line growth. A loud segment of the commentariat saw these unfavorable trends culminating in a recession for the economy and a material hit to the overall earnings picture. However, the U.S. economy has proved resilient even as the Fed’s extraordinary tightening has put us on track for a happy resolution to the inflation issue. With the Fed now gearing up to start easing policy in the coming months, those extreme risks to the economy and corporate earnings have eased significantly. This is the macro backdrop in which we will receive the Q1 earnings results in the coming days. The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues, following the +6.1% earnings growth on +2.6% revenue gains in the preceding period. The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the quarter got underway. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that while the revisions trend has been negative, the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates compares favorably to what we had seen in the comparable period for the preceding quarter (2023 Q4). Story Continues Since the start of Q1, estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest cuts to estimates for the Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, and Transportation sectors. Estimates have modestly increased over this period for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the Retail, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech sectors enjoying notable positive revisions. Q1 earnings estimates for Oracle and Adobe that are reporting this week have largely remained unchanged since the quarter got underway. Embedded in current Q1 earnings and revenue estimates is a modest year-over-year decline in net margins, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research This chart shows that the extreme margin pressure we witnessed in 2022 and the first half of 2023 is now behind us. For 2024 Q1, net margins are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Basic Materials, Autos, and Medical sectors. Net margins are expected to be above the year-earlier level for 5 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest gains at the Tech and Utilities sectors. The Tech sector is now firmly back in the growth mode, and the trend is expected to continue going forward. For 2024 Q1, Tech sector earnings are expected to increase +18.9% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues. This would follow the sector’s +27.4% higher earnings in 2023 Q4 on +8.5% higher revenues. The sector experienced a period of post-COVID adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023, during which time it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture. Please keep in mind that Tech isn’t just any other sector; it is the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors being Finance and Medical, at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively. This means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023 but now appears ready to resume its historically positive growth role. You can see this growth profile in the chart below, which also shows that the sector’s 2023 Q4 earnings tally of $158.2 billion was a new all-time quarterly record. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q1. Excluding the sector’s substantial contribution, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3% from the same period last year (vs. +2.4% as a whole). Looking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.5% on +4.7% revenue growth.

Despite lacking a technical background, Loubna’s passion and resilience drove her to leadership roles, aiming to challenge gender norms. She reflects on overcoming imposter syndrome and highlights the joy of mentoring aspiring women in technology. Furthermore, she explores the future of technology and Logitech’s role in fostering inclusivity. Loubna emphasises the importance of purpose-driven innovation and encourages aspiring professionals to prioritise kindness and empathy in their endeavors. Listen to the full conversation on our podcast channel – Gulf Business on Spotify . Image credit: Supplied Excerpts: Q. Could you share your journey to becoming Head of Enterprise Business at Logitech? My journey spans over 25 years in multinational tech companies. Transitioning from a business administration background, I was driven by personal passion and the challenge to prove myself in the tech industry. Despite lacking a tech background, I pursued leadership roles, driven by a desire to empower women and leverage technology to enhance lives. Witnessing the impact of our solutions during Covid-19 pandemic reaffirmed the importance of our work in keeping people connected. Q. Reflecting on the challenges you faced, could you highlight one or two significant hurdles and how you overcame them? Initially, the tech industry presented challenges due to timing and societal norms. Being from Generation X, I encountered skepticism about my abilities due to a lack of technical background. Leadership positions were often reserved for those with specific technical expertise, sidelining qualified women. Overcoming these barriers required resilience and a commitment to challenging societal norms. While progress has been made, gender equality in tech remains elusive, necessitating continued advocacy and action. Q. Addressing the issue of imposter syndrome in women, have you experienced it in your career, and how did you navigate it? Imposter syndrome is undeniably real, particularly for women navigating male-dominated industries. Women often face internaliSed pressure to excel and fear failure, perpetuating a cycle of self-doubt. This phenomenon stems from societal expectations and ingrained gender biases, making it a pervasive challenge. Embracing vulnerability and reframing failure as opportunities for growth have been instrumental in overcoming imposter syndrome. Moreover, fostering a supportive environment that values diverse perspectives is crucial in empowering women to thrive. Q. On a positive note, could you share a significant achievement that brings you pride and joy? Teaching and mentoring aspiring women in technology has been incredibly rewarding. By advocating for inclusivity and challenging stereotypes, I’ve had the privilege of empowering the next generation of female leaders. Inspiring young women to pursue their passions, regardless of societal expectations, has been a profound source of fulfillment. Additionally, spearheading initiatives like the Connect and Elevate platform at Logitech underscores our commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the tech sector. Q.

The report was released by the Israel Innovation Authority in collaboration with the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy at Reichman University ahead of International Women's Day, which is on Friday. ""The tech sector has been at the forefront of the Israel i economy for many years, but there is still a way to go regarding gender equality. We see more women in core roles, but the growth rate is insufficient to reach gender parity goals,"" said Innovation Authority CEO Dror Bin. ""In 2023, about 3,500 positions were added for women in tech compared to about 6,700 positions for men. To bring about change, there must be a concerted long-term effort by the tech industry and relevant government entities to continue breaking the glass ceiling for women earlier in their career."" The report found that almost 40 per cent of women currently employed in the tech industry are engaged in R&D roles, marking a staggering 130 per cent increase since 2013. This upward trajectory reflects a consistent annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent, in line with that of men. However, women still only occupy a third of all high-tech positions, falling short of the 43% target set by the National High-Tech Human Capital Committee, for 2035. This gap is particularly pronounced for non-Orthodox Jewish women , with approximately 80,000 positions needed to meet the designated target. Moreover, the proportion of women in administrative and business development roles has decreased from 50.7 per cent in 2014 to 41.4 per cent in 2024, demonstrating an 18% decline in the last decade. ""From the research data, it is evident that gender gaps in tech positions and the tech industry's R&D positions are not a result of differences in ability or achievements between men and women , but rather stem from different choices made by them at various stages of the education system,"" said Dr. Sergei Sumkin, a senior researcher at the Aaron Institute. ""Access to tech studies should be provided to every student in Israel within the school framework or excellence centers. Additionally, attention should be paid to the professional explanation by the school staff regarding the contribution of tech skills to quality employment for female students,"" Sumkin added.

Is It a Buy Around $130 ? ,20240308T010000Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/768206/finger-about-to-press-a-green-dollar-sign-key-on-a-pc-keyboard.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"As the seemingly eternal leader in internet search, Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG +0.29% ) ( GOOGL +0.31% ) has made a great many investors richer over the course of its more than 25-year history. Lately, though, it hasn't been the most exciting stock, neither soaring higher nor crashing violently in price on the tech sector's gyrations. Some believe it's being unfairly ignored by the market, and the market is missing a chance to get a solid investment at a cheap price. Let's explore one analyst's bullish take on the company. Undervalued and underappreciated As February came to a close, Redburn-Atlantic's James Cordwell upped his price target on Alphabet's class A voting shares (the ones with the GOOGL ticker symbol). These should be worth $170 apiece, according to him, up from his previous level of $165. In making his change, Cordwell maintained his buy rating on the shares. That makes for a potential gain of around 30% on both classes of Alphabet's stock, given that they're hovering around the $130 level these days and they trade at basically the same level. Cordwell feels that Alphabet is priced more like a traditional blue chip stock in an unexciting industry than a leader dominating a corner of the tech sector. He wrote in a note that with ""Alphabet's forward P/E now just in line with that of the [ S&P 500 index] sentiment has clearly turned negative regarding Google Search's competitive position and ongoing growth potential."" Expand NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Today's Change ( 0.31 %) $ 0.90 Current Price $ 291.00 Key Data Points Market Cap $3501B Day's Range $ 287.33 - $ 291.90 52wk Range $ 140.53 - $ 291.92 Volume 793K Avg Vol 34M Gross Margin 59.18 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Taken for granted? It can be tough for a company that's been so firmly established in its niche to win investor love. With longevity, more people can take a business for granted and forget that it still might have powerful growth in front of it. Technological advances will make internet search more of a valuable resource, not less, and there's no meaningful competition to the powerhouse that is Alphabet. That makes Cordwell's latest take on the stock rather compelling and $130 looks like a cheap price for a company with a bright future."

China industry benefited, North Asia obviously benefited more from it,"" Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan said in a media briefing on Tuesday. The tech sector, which thrived during the Covid-19 pandemic as companies accelerated their digitalization efforts, underwent a slowdown in 2022 and 2023 as high inflation and interest rates softened consumer spending, hit product demand and led to layoffs. Global tech spending weakened in 2023 while layoffs rose, said Deloitte in a report on tech industry's 2024 outlook . ""But there are now glimmers of hope that a tech comeback may be imminent: Economists have lowered their assessments of recession risk, and analysts are optimistic that the tech sector could return to modest growth in 2024,"" Deloitte said. The recovery in tech is significant as other industries are still struggling.

U.S. chip design firm Nvidia saw a 265% jump in fourth-quarter revenue , thanks to skyrocketing demand for its graphics processing units, thousands of which are used to run and train OpenAI's ChatGPT . But the recovery is not uniform across the tech sector, JPMorgan said, singling out the semiconductor industry as the bright spot amid the AI boom. ""It is primarily in the semiconductor, dynamic random access memory sector. So we are seeing, for example, Korean production doing quite well. Taiwan is because of the logic chips we are seeing that do relatively well. So those are the two key beneficiaries in North Asia,"" Ong said. Taiwan's TSMC is the primary contract chip manufacturer for Nvidia and has benefited from Nvidia's performance and potential. South Korean DRAM chip makers such as Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have also benefited from the AI boom as large language models like ChatGPT require high-performance memory chips to generate human-like responses. ""Our equity analysts who oversee the sector remain quite positive simply because it's built out of broader digitization, data centers, AI, etc,"" Ong said. He also said Singapore was ""certainly seeing that lift"" from the semiconductor boom.

Pichai rarely weighs in on specific controversies. But he told the whole company last week that the scandal was “completely unacceptable.” There’s a new level of urgency on the inside. Pichai and Google co-founder Sergey Brin were spotted in tense meetings at the company’s Mountain View headquarters last week. Friday was supposed to be a day off for most employees but management instead called for volunteers over the weeked to be on stand-by “so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics.” The simplest way to explain this mess is that a team at Google was too heavy-handed with prompt engineering for photo generation. This is an industry standard technique that involves inserting extra words into a prompt behind the scenes — and without the user’s knowledge — that is then sent to the AI model to produce a more acceptable result. This kind of prompt engineering is relatively easy to undo, and Google has already said that photo generation should be back online in a couple of weeks. The harder thing to fix will be the text-based responses of Gemini are problematic, like when it suggested that Elon Musk was a worse person than Adolf Hitler . There’s also the obvious political bias to contend with. During a random appearance at an AI hacker house over the weekend, Sergey Brin admitted that “we haven’t fully understood” why the model “leans left.” After talking to sources at Google, I’ve come to the conclusion that these bad Gemini responses slipped through testing because everyone felt rushed to ship. An illustrative example: the photo generation in the Gemini app is not actually powered by the Gemini model. It’s an older, text-to-photo model that was tacked onto the Gemini user-facing experience to get the feature out the door faster. I’m told that there’s also a lack of alignment between Demis Hassabis’ research team building the underlying models and Prabhakar Raghavan’s search organization that’s putting them into user-facing products. Perhaps the coming “structural changes” Pichai hinted at in his memo to employees last week will address that. More bad news Elsewhere in the Googleplex, I’ve learned that layoffs hit CMO Lorraine Twohill’s marketing organization and the Play Store team last week. These are in addition to the layoffs that have been already reported in trust and safety and YouTube . Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini declined to comment on any specifics but said the company is focusing on “reducing bureaucracy and layers” and giving “employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances.” Pichai has at least been clear that these quiet, org-specific layoffs will continue for a while, which contributes to deflated morale and a general feeling of unease. But Google’s leaders have been much less upfront about more difficult news that the rank and file will hear this coming week, when managers begin sharing the results of annual performance reviews. While most employees will still be getting an overall increase to their compensation, the majority won’t be getting anywhere near as much of an increase as they have in years prior, according to internal emails and documents shared with managers that I’ve seen. For the “significant impact” rating that the majority of employees are assigned by their managers, there will be no salary increase in most cases. A key talking point shared with managers is that, this year, the company is more closely anchoring pay to “local benchmarks” — essentially the compensation for similar jobs at other companies in the same geographic area. In a lengthy slide deck shared with managers this week to help them talk about performance reviews with their reports, they are encouraged to focus on “the big picture, which is the macro economy, the state of tech” and “how Google fits into that landscape.” “Because we have a market-based pay philosophy, Googlers in roles and locations with the highest competition for talent will be modeled for increases comparable to recent years,” a Google HR exec told managers in an email that I saw. “But as we continue to align our pay to local markets, some modeled comp awards may be lower than last year’s for some Googlers. Managers will have additional discretionary funds to help reward strong performers you want to recognize and encourage, but the additional discretionary funds may be more modest than in previous years, particularly for bonuses.” The email also says that “Googlers in some roles and locations will see slightly lower equity refresh awards this cycle.” When Google revamped its performance review system in 2022, employees were told that it would lead to a higher increase in pay for most people. In retrospect, it seems designed to cut costs by forcing more people into lower rating tiers, according to multiple managers I’ve spoken with. “We continue to offer extremely competitive pay across salary, equity, leave, and a broader suite of benefits,” Google’s Mencini told me. Yes, there is a “sad violin” element to all of this that should be acknowledged. I’m sympathetic to the notion that Google employees should be pleased they are getting any raises at all given the mass layoffs that have swept across tech. At the same time, raises being lower than last year will further hurt morale. As one Google manager predicted to me last week: “I expect once comp [news] drops you’ll see a whole lot of uproar from the ranks, especially toward Sundar.” People moves Some interesting career moves I’ve noticed recently: Sridhar Ramaswamy , Google’s former head of ads and the ex-CEO of the search startup Neeva, is the new CEO of Snowflake, replacing Frank Slootman . Asha Sharma , the former COO of Instacart, has joined Microsoft to lead product for its AI platform group. Hugo Swart , Qualcomm’s VP of AR and VR, is leaving after two decades at the company for a “new journey.” Adam Presser is the new head of trust and safety at TikTok, reporting to CEO Shou Chew . He’ll replace Cormac Keenan , who will stay on as an advisor. Interesting links NPR’s deep dive into Marc Benioff’s ​​Hawaii empire. Ming-Chi Kuo’s latest research note on Vision Pro sales . The CTRL-labs team at Meta published a research paper on building a “noninvasive neuromotor interface for human-computer interaction.” I’ll be at SXSW next weekend, please let me know if you’ll be in Austin too and would like to meet up (or know of any parties I should stop by).

However, he does not see a major retreat ahead because of a key difference with previous bubbles. As tech giant Nvidia soars on hype around artificial intelligence, and global stock indexes notch record highs , debate has grown about whether the stock market has entered a ""bubble."" Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE That's generally seen as a period in which asset prices inflate rapidly, potentially beyond their core value — and risk crashing just as fast. Bob Parker, senior advisor at trade body International Capital Markets Association, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday he saw signs of a bubble based on two of three main characteristics. ""The first [characteristic] is obviously looking at valuations. If we look at the valuation of Nvidia, justifiably it is actually very high indeed,"" Parker said, adding that the second sign is investor positioning. ""Whenever you have a market bubble, investors are very clustered or very concentrated, either in one market or in one sector. ""And it doesn't matter whether you look at the U.S. or Europe or some of the Asian markets, you know, we've got this historic wide valuation between the tech sector, and obviously AI as a sub-sector of the tech sector, and the rest of the market.. Investors are very clustered in that tech sector,"" Parker said. The topic has been dividing market watchers. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC on Monday that he does not see AI as a bubble, emphasizing: ""When we had the internet bubble the first time around … that was hype. This is not hype. It's real."" Yet Torsten Sløk, chief economist at asset manager Apollo, published a chart this month, comparing the valuations of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 with their counterparts during the 1990s boom and calling the ""current AI bubble... bigger than the 1990s tech bubble."" While he acknowledged the signs of a bubble, Parker is less concerned that it is on the brink of a burst. His optimism is rooted in the third characteristic of a bubble — investor leverage, or the use of debt for funding. ""If you look at the bubbles in 1999-2000, and then in 2007, one key characteristic was investor leverage. And we had, whether it was retail investors or institutional investors, a very high level of leverage, and that was either through borrowings or it was through derivatives,"" Parker told CNBC. A major problem during the 2008 market crash, Parker said, was the opacity of derivative positions and trying to define risk management around complex financial products such as collateralized debt, bond and loan obligations, which caused the subprime mortgage crisis. ""The bottom line was very simple: it was just embedded leverage. So ... I don't think you're going to see a major market reversal like we saw in 2000, or like we saw in 2008, and the main reason for that is that investors don't actually have much leverage. ""Actually, if you look at investor cash positions, positions in money market funds, positions in corporate and investor liquidity, the cash positions sitting on the side are very high."" While he does not see a dramatic market crash, Parker does envision an investor rotation out of areas of concentration into the broader market. ""If you look at the States, will the [small cap] Russell 2000 over the next three to six months outperform the Nasdaq Computer index? Yes, I think it probably will. And that will be a function of this investor broadening out,"" he said.

Despite thousands of job cuts in Silicon Valley last year, a new report shows more jobs were created in the region. Joint Venture Silicon Valley recently released the latest numbers on the local economy and everything from people moving out of the area, to employees working from home. Watch NBC Bay Area News free wherever you are WATCH HERE The report also shows the tech sector is recalibrating, focusing on efficiency and heading in new directions including AI. The report also found the regions unemployment rate is at 3.3%. “Yes, there’s been a rash of layoffs in the tech sector, and yet the tech sector is streamlining some divisions and growing others so we’re still in a growth economy,” Russell Hancock, CEO Joint Venture Silicon. And the latest data shows 35% of employees are working from home most days and the rate is even higher the more money people make.

But the divide between the haves and have nots is growing. According to the report more than 10 thousand 500 people in the valley are unhoused. ""We're two valleys,"" Hancock said. ""There's the valley of the fabulously successful and there's a valley of people who are really struggling to get by. We have more than one-third of households in the region are not meeting self sufficiency standards. Homeless advocates says one of the biggest issues is a lack of affordable housing. “There’s very few buildings built for low income people. No one is building homes for families that built the valley of hearts delight, and those people now have nowhere to go and are living on the streets,” said Shaunn Cartwright with the Unhoused Response Group. After four years of a population decline in Silicon Valley, last year the population increased slightly with more people moving into the region, mostly from other countries. The report also found that most tech sector employees laid off last year were able to find new jobs in three months. A new report shows that the South Bay economy is still growing despite some job losses. Raj Mathai speaks with San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan on this.

However, despite this, women in this field still earn less than their male counterparts in most cities nationwide. Even in the highest-earning areas, women still cannot afford a median-priced home based on the 30% budgeting guideline . Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE To make it easier for women to decide where to work, RealtyHop conducted a study to find the best cities for women in tech. The study analyzed income-generating potential, housing markets, opportunities for women, and overall location to rank the top 100 cities. Ranked at #9 on the list, Garland, a North Texas city in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, offers an appealing option for women with the goal of homeownership. Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos. LEARN MORE According to the new report, Garland has the most affordable housing market in the Top 10 List, where women in tech spend only 38.28% of their income on a home. Homes come onto the market with a median list price of $339,000, and women spend $2,214.22 monthly on their mortgage payments and property taxes. This makes Garland an affordable option for women in tech who want to own their own home and enjoy the benefits of living in a thriving city. In addition to its prosperous job market, Garland is also a great place to live. The city has a vibrant downtown area with plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops. Residents can enjoy the Texas weather in many parks and outdoor spaces. Garland is also home to several great schools, making it an ideal place for families.

Bell Blue Raider Band to perform in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade These Are the Top 10 Cities for Women Looking for Jobs in Tech (RealtyHop) Key Findings The best city for women in the tech industry is Fremont, Calif. The town has a total score of 56.81 due to a high median income, five-year solid growth, and a higher percentage of women in the industry. Women in Fremont have a better chance of earning a good income and enjoying a high quality of life. The three cities where women outearn men in tech are Stockton, Calif., Santa Ana, Calif., and North Las Vegas, Nevada. These cities may be attractive to women looking to break into the tech industry. On the other hand, the worst city for women in tech is Riverside, Calif. The town has a high income gap compared to men, an unaffordable housing market, and a declining number of women working in the field. Women looking to work in tech may want to avoid Riverside due to these issues. The study found that women earn less than men in 97 out of the 100 cities analyzed. This sobering statistic highlights the need for more action to address the gender pay gap in the tech industry. It's worth noting that women hold more jobs in the tech industry in 57% of cities compared to five years ago. While this is a positive trend, there is still a long way to go to achieve gender parity in this industry. The cities that rank highly on RealtyHop's list may be attractive to women looking to work in tech. Still, it's essential to research and understand each location's unique opportunities and challenges. By being informed, women can make informed decisions and choose the best city for their individual life goals. To view the complete list, methodology, and data, kindly visit RealtyHop's website.

The New Mexico Tech Council is honoring the women making waves in the industry with its annual “ Women in Tech ” awards. The awards will be held on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., at Hotel Albuquerque. The council says, “The NM ‘Women in Tech’ awards recognize the remarkable women in New Mexico who are driving innovation and excellence in their tech-related fields and inspiring and empowering others to pursue careers in the tech industry.” The New Mexico Tech Council creates a space of collaboration, education, and networking for those involved in the state’s tech industry. The council’s upcoming awards ceremony will be the 16th annual event. Mia Petersen, the executive director of the council, says 2024’s awards will honor 12 women in the tech industry. “The New Mexico ‘Women in Tech’ awards is all about creating a space to recognize the impact that women are having in our local tech economy,” says Petersen. Two of this year’s honorees are Catherine Nicolaou, the broadband manager for the City of Albuquerque, and Lauren Trujillo, the senior advanced solutions consultant for Lumen Technologies. “There’s a lot of paths [into the tech industry], right?

We’ll publish several pieces throughout the year as the AI boom continues, highlighting key work that often goes unrecognized. Read more profiles here . Amba Kak is the executive director of the AI Now Institute, where she helps create policy recommendations to address AI concerns. She was also a senior AI advisor at the Federal Trade Commission and previously worked as a global policy advisor at Mozilla and a legal advisor to India’s telecom regulator on net-neutrality. Briefly, how did you get your start in AI? What attracted you to the field? It’s not a straightforward question because “AI” is a term that’s in vogue to describe practices and systems that have been evolving for a long time now; I’ve been working on technology policy for over a decade and in multiple parts of the world and witnessed when everything was about “big data,” and then everything became about “AI”. But the core issues we were concerned with — how data-driven technologies and economies impact society — remain the same. I was drawn to these questions early on in law school in India where, amid a sea of decades, sometimes century-old precedent, I found it motivating to work in an area where the “pre-policy” questions, the normative questions of what is the world we want? What role should technology play in it? Remain open-ended and contestable. Globally, at the time, the big debate was whether the internet could be regulated at the national level at all (which now seems like a very obvious, yes!), and in India, there were heated debates about whether a biometric ID database of the entire population was creating a dangerous vector of social control. In the face of narratives of inevitability around AI and technology, I think regulation and advocacy can be a powerful tool to shape the trajectories of tech to serve public interests rather than the bottom lines of companies or just the interests of those who hold power in society. Of course, over the years, I’ve also learned that regulation is often entirely co-opted by these interests too, and can often function to maintain the status quo rather than challenge it. So that’s the work! What work are you most proud of in the AI field? Our 2023 AI Landscape report was released in April in the midst of a crescendo of ChatGPT-fueled AI buzz — was part diagnosis of what should keep us up at night about the AI economy, part action-oriented manifesto aimed at the broader civil society community. It met the moment — a moment when both the diagnosis and what to do about it were sorely missing, and in its place were narratives about AI’s omniscience and inevitability. We underscored that the AI boom was further entrenching the concentration of power within a very narrow section of the tech industry, and I think we successfully pierced through the hype to reorient attention to AI’s impacts on society and on the economy… and not assume any of this was inevitable.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 W AITLIST NOW Later in the year, we were able to bring this argument to a room full of government leaders and top AI executives at the UK AI Safety Summit, where I was one of only three civil society voices representing the public interest. It’s been a lesson in realizing the power of a compelling counter-narrative that refocuses attention when it’s easy to get swept up in curated and often self-serving narratives from the tech industry. I’m also really proud of a lot of the work I did during my term as Senior Advisor to the Federal Trade Commission on AI, working on emerging technology issues and some of the key enforcement actions in that domain. It was an incredible team to be a part of, and I also learned the crucial lesson that even one person in the right room at the right time really can make a difference in influencing policymaking. How do you navigate the challenges of the male-dominated tech industry and, by extension, the male-dominated AI industry? The tech industry, and AI in particular, remains overwhelmingly white and male and geographically concentrated in very wealthy urban bubbles. But I like to reframe away from AI’s white dude problem not just because it’s now well known but also because it can sometimes create the illusion of quick fixes or diversity theater that on their own won’t solve the structural inequalities and power imbalances embedded in how the tech industry currently operates. It doesn’t solve the deep-rooted “solutionism” that’s responsible for many harmful or exploitative uses of tech. The real issue we need to contend with is the creation of a small group of companies and, within those — a handful of individuals that have accumulated unprecedented access to capital, networks, and power, reaping the rewards of the surveillance business model that powered the last decade of the internet. And this concentration of power is tipped to get much, much worse with AI. These individuals act with impunity, even as the platforms and infrastructures they control have enormous social and economic impacts. How do we navigate this? By exposing the power dynamics that the tech industry tries very hard to conceal. We talk about the incentives, infrastructures, labor markets, and the environment that power these waves of technology and shape the direction it will take. This is what we’ve been doing at AI Now for close to a decade, and when we do this well, we find it is difficult for policymakers and the public to look away — creating counter-narratives and alternative imaginations for the appropriate role of technology within society. What advice would you give to women seeking to enter the AI field? For women, but also for other minoritized identities or perspectives seeking to make critiques from outside the AI industry, the best advice I could give is to stand your ground. This is a field that routinely and systematically will attempt to discredit critique, especially when it comes from not traditionally STEM backgrounds – and it’s easy to do given that AI is such an opaque industry that can make you feel like you’re always trying to push back from the outside. Even when you’ve been in the field for decades like I have, powerful voices in the industry will try and undermine you and your valid critique simply because you are challenging the status quo. You and I have as much of a say in the future of AI as Sam Altman does since the technologies will impact us all and potentially will disproportionately impact people of minoritized identities in harmful ways. Right now, we’re in a fight for who gets to claim expertise and authority on matters of technology within society… so we really need to claim that space and hold our ground."

The anticipated slowdown from an 8.4 per cent expansion in the previous fiscal year to a modest 3.8 per cent in FY24 has set the industry on a recalibration course, prompting reflection on the factors steering this change. Nasscom’s cautious outlook points to many challenges, with delayed decision-making and restrained client spending standing out as the primary culprits. The ripple effects are palpable, with software exports experiencing a 3.3 per cent contraction to $199 billion, a stark contrast to the robust 11.4 per cent growth witnessed in the preceding year. Amid this recalibration, the industry’s job landscape is also undergoing a noticeable transformation. The projected addition of 60,000 jobs in FY24 marks an 80 per cent reduction from the previous year’s impressive figure of 290,000. This shift in employment dynamics raises questions about the sector’s ability to maintain its status as a key driver of job creation in the Indian economy. Advertisement The root cause of this deceleration, as highlighted by Nasscom, is the marked increase in uncertainties and a proclivity towards cautious decision-making. Projects that should have taken flight in a particular quarter are being grounded, pushing revenue growth downstream. Nasscom points to a “correction in spending” following the Covid-related boom, indicating that the industry is now navigating the aftermath of a period marked by accelerated digital investments. The pandemic served as a catalyst for a surge in digital investments, particularly in sectors like retail, banking, and financial services, driven by the constraints imposed on physical movement. Advertisement However, the euphoria surrounding these investments seems to be waning in the current fiscal year, ushering in a phase of global macroeconomic uncertainties that impact the tech sector’s growth trajectory. Yet, amidst these challenges, there is a glimmer of optimism. Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh alludes to a potential “reversal” of sentiments in 2024, citing the weakening fears of a US recession. This hints at the resilience embedded in India’s tech sector, which has historically demonstrated an ability to adapt and rebound in the face of global economic fluctuations. The industry’s total headcount increasing to 5.43 million from 5.37 million a year earlier signifies a steady growth in employment despite the reduced pace. This hints at the sector’s commitment to sustaining a workforce, albeit at a more measured rate, and underscores its significance as a cornerstone of India’s economic fabric. As India’s tech sector navigates the ebb and flow of economic tides, it becomes imperative to view this period not as a setback but as a recalibration towards sustainable growth. The emphasis on prudent decision-making and a nuanced approach to client spending may well position the industry for a more robust and resilient future, where quality trumps quantity, and adaptability becomes the hallmark of success in an ever-changing global marketplace.

Concerns surrounding Nvidia's high valuation have grown leading up to the announcement, as shares of the chipmaker have soared nearly 230% over the past year. The stock slid 2.85% on Wednesday. ""Can Nvidia hold up a market that is in need of a key catalyst?"" LPL Financial's chief global strategist Quincy Krosby asked, noting that expectations of interest rate cuts have been recently ""pulled from underneath the market."" That has left stocks without a clear catalyst, leaving earnings and guidance as the next-best catalyst for continued growth in equities, she said. ""The market is more discerning and increasingly voracious,"" Krosby said. ""Nvidia could deliver, as they did the last earning season, but it may not be enough for a market that is desperate for even more from the superstars — and Nvidia has been dubbed the superstar of the mega tech world.""

Nvidia's rapid rise over the past year has driven its market cap above $1.6 trillion and made it a large component of many exchange-traded funds that track indexes. That means that the direction of Nvidia's stock after the earnings report will have a sizable effect on how those funds trade on Thursday.

Veronne believes health-care stocks could potentially be a growth ""destination"" for any outflows out of the tech sector. ""It's too soon to say the HC vs. Tech pair has inflected, but we're watching it more closely (particularly given the fact you could drive a truck through the flows over the last several months),"" said Verrone. — Hakyung Kim Wed, Feb 21 2024 3:40 PM EST Nvidia is 'more vulnerable to the downside,' Barclays says Investors should be careful ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, according to Barclays. The artificial intelligence chipmaker could post a large move after releasing its latest results Wednesday after the close, especially given the level of optimism around the stock, Anshul Gupta wrote in a Wednesday note. The earnings-implied move of 10%, either up or down, for the stock would be the third-largest in two years, behind only moves in May 2023 and February 2023, of 24.4% and 14%, respectively. Meanwhile, options flow, which indicates the buying and selling activity of options contracts, continues to suggest bullishness around the stock. ""Option flow suggests that sentiment is bullish, with put-to-call OI ratio/short-dated skew at the lowest/flattest level in five years,"" Gupta wrote.

The West Texas Intermediate contract for April gained 87 cents, or 1.13%, to settle at $77.91 a barrel. April Brent futures added 69 cents, or 0.84%, to settle at $83.03 a barrel.

Tensions continued to simmer in the Middle East this week after Israel launched airstrikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthi militants struck another cargo vesse l Monday and as Iran now blames Israel for explosions that hit a natural gas pipeline in the Islamic Republic on Feb. 14. — Spencer Kimball Wed, Feb 21 2024 2:52 PM EST UBS' base case doesn't see the Fed cutting rates until June UBS updated its base case to reflect that the Federal Reserve would wait until June before cutting rates, rather than starting in May. Economist Brian Rose highlighted upside surprises to recent payrolls and inflation data as catalysts for the change. He believes the U.S. central bank is likely to cut rates once per quarter until the Fed's funds target range reaches between 3.25% and 3.5%. However, the economist added that there is still a degree of uncertainty around the Fed's actions. ""The Fed could be forced to stay on hold indefinitely if the labor and inflation data continues to run hot. On the other side, if the economy turns downward, the Fed would likely cut rates sharply since inflation should not be an issue in that case,"" Rose wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han Wed, Feb 21 2024 2:37 PM EST Boeing announces replacement for head of 737 Max program An aerial photo shows Boeing 737 Max airplanes parked on the tarmac at the Boeing Factory in Renton, Washington, on March 21, 2019.

The Fed officials left their key overnight borrowing rate unchanged and indicated that no rate cuts would occur until the Federal Open Market Committee has ""greater confidence"" that inflation is slowing down, according to the meeting summary. Officials expressed a tone of general optimism and caution, saying they wanted to see more progress before easing policy. ""In discussing the policy outlook, participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle,"" the minutes said. ""Participants generally noted that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.""

Teladoc recorded $661 million in the fourth quarter, less than the $671 million forecast of analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. For the current quarter, the company said to expect between $630 million and $645 million, while analysts anticipated $673 million.

The company also expects revenue growth to range between 15% and 16%. That's down from previous guidance that anticipated 18% to 19% growth.

But an asset bubble may not be in the cards. Those markers are all more than two-thirds of the way to where they stood when two of the four largest fragility events have taken place since 1928, analyst Vittoria Volta told clients. The two events were the February 2018 ""Vix-plosion"" and March 2020 Covid-19 pandemic shock. In the current market, Volta said fragility risks are high due to the pressure to chase momentum and fickle liquidity. But slides in volatility within the ""Magnificent Seven"" also show the market is ""far"" from an asset bubble, as volatility typically rises with prices in that situation. With depressed volatility and correlation, Volta said she continues to like owning options directionally, which aren't fully pricing the future drift of markets in either direction. — Alex Harring Wed, Feb 21 2024 9:55 AM EST Small-cap ETFs saw record inflows last week, Bank of America says Institutional clients were net buyers of U.S. equities last week, while hedge funds and retail clients were net sellers, according to Bank of America. Additionally, strategist Jill Carey Hall outlined that small-cap exchange-traded funds saw record inflows. ""Small cap ETF momentum continued, with inflows in 22 of the 23 past weeks, and largest weekly inflow in our data history since '17 (mainly Retail-driven buying). Despite more positive sentiment, positioning in small caps remains light and valuations remain inexpensive vs. history,"" she wrote. Sector-wise, communications services led last week's inflows, while health-care and tech stocks saw the biggest outflows. ""The last three weeks have been the three biggest weeks of Comm. Svcs. net buying in the history of the sector since '18. The sector also has the longest recent buying streak of any sector (16 weeks),"" Hall added. — Lisa Kailai Han Wed, Feb 21 2024 9:32 AM EST Stocks open in the red Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 1, 2024.

Strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients that the momentum trade is showing signs of weakening during the recent hiccup for stocks but that it was still too soon to call for a bigger reversal. Momentum is a trading factor that can serve as a bet that hot stocks will keep leading the market higher. ""While there could be some more near-term downside, we believe that the key event to derail the Momentum trade will be indications that AI demand and Tech fundamentals broadly are starting to soften. Along this vein, NVDA's report tonight has the potential to be a major market moving event — both to the upside and the downside,"" Senyek said. — Jesse Pound, Michael Bloom Wed, Feb 21 2024 8:23 AM EST Stocks making the biggest moves before the bell: Nvidia, SolarEdge and more These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading.

""U.S. tech exceptionalism has remained a massive theme, and should be underlined by Nvidia earnings this week…margin expansion for the second straight quarter is all about U.S. mega-cap tech firms,"" analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a Tuesday note. ""In sum, we believe that much of the equity rally is justified based on better earnings, and so is less vulnerable to a pullback."" Earnings per share growth year over year in the U.S. was 5%, higher than in Europe, Rajadhyaksha pointed out. Nearly four-fifths of the broader market has beaten on earnings per share expectations, while 68% has beaten on sales, he said. Nvidia, which is expected to post earnings after the bell Wednesday, has been the crown jewel of the market since last year amid the excitement around advancements in artificial intelligence, which also boosted shares of ""Magnificent Seven"" tech peers such as Meta and Amazon .

The key focus was on enterprise spending trends, seen as crucial to validate lofty valuations and pave the growth path for the year and beyond, as per the analyst. Recent earnings calls by major tech giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ), and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ) revealed an uptick in capital expenditure towards AI infrastructure, signaling the onset of AI monetization within the tech sector, Ives stated. Microsoft’s Copilot program exceeded expectations, indicating robust demand for AI deployments among its clientele. Attention now turns to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ), regarded as the pioneer of AI, as it prepares to announce its earnings and provide guidance, Ives said. The tech community awaits Nvidia’s insights with bated breath, anticipating another impressive performance and bullish outlook. Investors are particularly interested in the pace of data center AI spending, as Nvidia remains the primary choice for GPUs powering generative AI applications. Despite concerns over valuations, especially for AI-focused companies like Microsoft, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR ), and MongoDB, Inc (NASDAQ: MDB ), many investors recognize the transformative potential of these tech giants and their role in shaping the future. Projections suggest a substantial increase in AI spending, with an estimated $1 trillion in incremental expenditure over the next decade. Currently, discussions primarily revolve around enterprise-oriented generative AI, with consumer-centric AI initiatives also gaining traction among significant players like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. In summary, Nvidia’s earnings report holds immense significance for both the tech sector and broader markets. Analysts closely monitor GPU orders and demand trends from enterprises, viewing Nvidia and Microsoft as primary beneficiaries of the AI Revolution, with further derivatives of AI innovation anticipated to emerge throughout 2024. Last week, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $20.01 billion and $4.48 for Nvidia. The analyst backed up the projections, citing continued momentum in AI infrastructure spending and high demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Nvidia is expected to be the largest consumer of these components in 2024. He also flagged significant capital raises for AI startups.

(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group/TNS) X Email Reddit SMS By George Avalos The Mercury News Two years of wrenching tech layoffs have weighed down the Bay Area’s job market in a big way — but experts say the impact has been somewhat mitigated by an industry realignment that’s led to significant hiring even as thousands of positions have been cut. For decades, Silicon Valley has engaged in what tech insiders and sages call “creative destruction.” The current convulsions in the local economy may represent the latest iteration of that metamorphosis as companies execute lightning-quick shifts to artificial intelligence, clean tech and green energy industries. “Tech is seeking new kinds of skill sets,” said Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Campbell-based Creative Strategies, which tracks the tech industry. “Tech is in transition. Companies are rethinking their strategies and they are reinventing themselves.” Still, with the tech employment cross currents as a backdrop, one thing seems certain: The tech industry’s decades-long boom and bust patterns have once again arrived at the bust part of the cycle. The cuts have spanned the breadth of the industry, from management positions to rank-and-file software developers and others. “Many companies over-hired during the pandemic,” said Bajarin. “Questions are arising about the overall economy, with inflation, interest rates and so forth.” Despite the brutal impact of the ongoing regional layoffs, the current staffing reductions are nowhere close to the cataclysm that demolished the region’s tech industry during the dot-com meltdown two decades ago. Over four years, from December 2000 — the peak of the dot-com hiring binge — to December 2004 — roughly the depths of that downturn — tech companies jettisoned a whopping 193,200 jobs, a stark decline of 26.9%. About one-fourth of the region’s tech jobs were wiped out during that stretch. Now, during a stretch of slightly over two years — covering 2022, 2023 and the early weeks of 2024 — tech companies have slashed more than 36,000 jobs in the Bay Area, according to WARN layoff notices filed with the California labor agency. “What is going on now still hurts, but it’s not like we are losing an entire industry,” said Steve Levy, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. “Some divisions in tech companies are shrinking and some are growing.” During the dot-com era, countless dot-com companies beguiled investors with visions of profits conjured by business plans that in some cases were simply bad ideas, and in other cases were somewhat ahead of their time. The ensuing massive layoffs jolted Silicon Valley and the rest of the Bay Area. In this cycle, the tech industry’s woes aren’t the result of dot-com vaporware. Silicon Valley isn’t being engulfed by cascades of bankruptcies or business failures. Instead, household names in the tech industry, including Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook Inc.), Google and Cisco have purged jobs in a widespread quest to correct their over-exuberant hiring during the coronavirus pandemic. As the coronavirus erupted worldwide in 2020, wide-ranging business shutdowns prompted countless people to work from home or other remote locations. The shift away from the office unleashed a demand for services and hardware. That demand has cooled drastically as people return to work on-site, in stores and at restaurants. But other companies, and even some of those laying off workers, are hiring, meaning matters are far from hopeless, even for displaced tech workers. “Despite the layoffs, there’s a resilient job market for tech workers, especially for those with versatile skills and a willingness to pivot into new areas,” said Tony Avila, a franchise owner in the South Bay with Spherion, a staffing services company. A push is well underway to hire people for rising industries such as artificial intelligence. “We’ve observed a steady demand for specialized talent,” Avila said. “Many are finding opportunities in emerging sectors within the tech industry.” Some copycat activity may be a factor in the layoffs. The decision by Meta and its top boss Mark Zuckerberg to pursue massive layoffs encouraged other tech giants to do the same, experts say. Tech companies seek heightened efficiency, even if that means a reduced headcount, said Russell Hancock, president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a San Jose-based think tank. “Zuckerberg decided that 2023 would be the year of efficiency,” Hancock said. “A lot of companies decided that efficiency would be the new fad in Silicon Valley. Tech companies want less office space, fewer perks and fewer employees.” In 2023, tech companies chopped 14,600 Bay Area jobs, as measured by the technology industry’s job totals in the Bay Area, according to seasonally adjusted job numbers compiled by Beacon Economics that were derived from state Economic Development Department reports. During the dot-com meltdown, tech companies slashed an average of 48,300 jobs a year, based on the aggregate loss of 193,200 jobs during those four years. This means tech job losses in the Bay Area during the dot-com debacle were three times greater than the number of tech jobs lost in the nine-county region in 2023. While tech companies revealed plans to cut slightly less than 21,600 jobs in 2023, as reflected in the layoff letters sent to the EDD, there was a net loss of only 14,600 Bay Area tech jobs in 2023. This means plenty of tech companies are still hiring at the same time they are laying off workers. “There is nothing fundamentally wrong with Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “With a lot of these layoffs, people are finding a way to land on their feet within three months of losing their jobs.” These indications of growth at the same time cutbacks are occurring suggest Silicon Valley is again attempting to reinvent itself ahead of the next potential boom. “When one part of Silicon Valley turns down,” Levy said, “there always has been something else that rises to take advantage of Silicon Valley’s talent and access to capital.”"

OptionsDesk View Price & Profile Interest in Nvidia's 4Q results sparks more volatility in the tech sector - OptionsDesk Published: 14:57 19 Feb 2024 GMT OptionsDesk 's Sebastian Blanco discusses the upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) and the broader tech sector's volatility in an interview with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion. Nvidia, known for inventing the GPU in 1999, has seen its shares increase by over 50% in January and 23% last year, transitioning into a full-stack computing infrastructure company. The company is set to report its fourth-quarter end-of-year revenues, anticipated to be $20.5 billion, up from $18.5 billion in 3Q, potentially exceeding expectations. However, much attention is focused on Nvidia's future guidance amid high volatility levels, with the company's shares experiencing significant trading activity. Nvidia has surpassed Tesla as the most actively traded single share on the options market, with traders expecting a substantial share price swing around the Q4 earnings announcement. The tech sector's volatility, exemplified by the shares of Super Micro Computer surging and then significantly dropping, is a concern for investors. Supply-side constraints and demand outstripping supply are key issues. To protect portfolios against such volatility, Blanco suggests a 'protective put' spread strategy, which involves buying and selling puts at different strikes as an insurance policy against potential losses.

""Those stories just don't exist in society."" Kromah says boot camps can serve as an alternative pathway to a career in technology, while also inspiring others to create their own upward mobility. “Not only are we building technical talent, there needs to be more black entrepreneurship because a lot of times when you graduate from college you don’t have a lot of black communities to work for,"" Kromah said. ⏯ Subscribe to WCNC Charlotte on YouTube to be notified of new videos The boot camp is in-person and there is a cost.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Feb 16, 2024, 09:00am EST Feb 16, 2024, 02:33pm EST Share Save Andrei Neacsu is a cofounder and managing partner at HyperSense . getty More than 191,000 tech workers were laid off in 2023 alone. In 2022, more than 93,000 suffered a similar fate. The layoffs of the last couple of years follow a period of intense growth in the industry during the pandemic, with many companies engaging in near-record hiring. Needless to say, the recent layoffs have caused much hand-wringing and concern within and outside of the industry, with some questioning what the future holds. However, it's important to put these layoffs in the proper context to better understand the state of the industry at large. Downturns Can Lead To Positive Change The tech industry has experienced a number of downturns over the last few decades, often corresponding to downturns in the overall economy. In some cases, such as in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic downturn reveals mistakes, over-extensions or weaknesses in the tech industry. For example, companies hired personnel at near-record levels during the pandemic to keep up with the digital transformation and the move to remote work. As the economy slowed post-pandemic, companies realized they had over-hired thousands—even tens of thousands—of unnecessary staff, leading to the mass layoffs that began in late 2022. While the layoffs caused a great deal of consternation, experts widely view them as a necessary adjustment to the tech industry, bringing it back to reality . The result is stronger, leaner, faster-moving companies that are better poised to capitalize on future trends. This is by no means an isolated example. The dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, as well as the 2008 financial crisis, led to changes in the tech industry that resulted in stronger, more resilient companies. Disruptions In The Tech Industry Create Opportunities Tech industry disruptions are often accompanied by a great deal of hand-wringing as older technologies are phased out and replaced. While this can impact employees and companies, it provides a unique opportunity that companies can capitalize on. One example of this is the streaming market. For years, Blockbuster dominated a thriving video rental industry until Netflix helped revolutionize how people watched videos. Blockbuster was unable to adapt and continued to decline until it went bankrupt. While some may lament the demise of Blockbuster, it is important to view this disruption in the context of the overall industry. At its peak in 1994, Blockbuster was valued at $8.4 billion . In contrast, Netflix's valuation at the time of writing is more than $240 billion, and Netflix is only one company among many in the streaming market. Disney, Apple, Peacock, Hulu, Max and others compete in the same space. When viewed from the lens of the larger tech industry, Blockbuster's demise coincided with a burgeoning market that far outpaced and eclipsed Blockbuster in its heyday. This scenario is repeated over and over again in the tech industry, with legacy companies, products, platforms and services being replaced with newer options. The companies that thrive are those that can identify these shifts in the industry and capitalize on them, often reaching all-new heights in the process. Surviving These Transitions On An Individual Level While periods of disruption and the natural ups and downs of the tech industry may benefit the industry at large, that knowledge is little consolation to individuals who may be on the verge of losing their jobs or being phased out. In my experience, there are a couple of things individuals can do to improve their job security. Everyone, but especially managers, should make sure they are part of a core team, preferably a large one. In my observations, managers and members of small teams—under 10 people—are in the most danger of being phased out and/or laid off. Alternately, teams that are working to develop the next big thing within a company are often naturally insulated from the ups and downs that befall the industry. The second thing individuals can do is to be adaptable, becoming experts in the latest tech. For example, artificial intelligence is currently taking the industry by storm, being deployed in everything from computers to appliances. This provides employees an opportunity to future-proof their skills and make themselves invaluable. Moving Forward As the tech industry continues marching forward, it is on the verge of several major transformations. These include the aforementioned AI revolution, the rise of virtual/augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, continued cloud adoption and more. Rather than viewing these developments with apprehension, companies, business leaders and employees should see these changes—and the associated ups and downs—as the opportunities they are and a natural part of the tech industry and its built-in resilience.

Cisco has announced plans to cut 5pc of its global workforce, more than 4,000 jobs, as layoffs continue to mount in the tech sector. The tech multinational said this restructuring plan aims to “realign the organisation” and enable Cisco to invest more in key priority areas. The company expects the majority of these layoffs to occur over the next three months – Cisco’s third fiscal quarter of 2024. These layoffs are expected to cost Cisco roughly $800m from severance, termination benefits and “other costs”. Cisco expects to spend around $500m in its next fiscal quarter on this restructuring plan. Cisco employed nearly 85,000 staff worldwide as of July 2023. The announcement comes amid Cisco’s second fiscal quarter results, which showed a decline in both revenue and net income compared to the same period last year. Despite this, Cisco CFO Scott Herren claims the company had “strong margins” and solid top and bottom-line results for the quarter. “We are making good progress in our business model shift to more recurring revenue while remaining focused on financial discipline, operating leverage and shareholder returns,” Herren said. Cisco was in a period of expansion last year, as it snapped up cybersecurity company Splunk in a deal valued at $28bn. Towards the end of 2023, Cisco shared plans to acquire Isovalent , a networking and security company with headquarters in California and Zurich. The deal is for an undisclosed sum but is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024. Cisco’s layoffs could impact Irish jobs, as the company has offices in Dublin and Galway. Job losses in the tech sector appear to be mounting this year. Last month, PayPal announced plans to reduce its global workforce by 9pc to “right-size” its business and cut costs. Other announcements of layoffs could lead to more Irish job losses. Tencent-owned Riot Games shared plans to cut 11pc of its workforce – 530 jobs globally – as part of adjustments to its business. Riot Games employs hundreds of staff in Dublin. Digital printing company Xerox also announced it is cutting thousands of staff this quarter, as part of a “reinvention” strategy that could lead to Irish job losses.

The timing of this endeavor comes exactly a year after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, a notable supporter of OpenAI, added Copilot AI tools to Bing, aiming to make the search giant ""dance."" While details remain somewhat murky, OpenAI's foray into web search is seen as a strategic move to broaden its impact in the tech industry. It raises questions about whether the search engine will be a standalone entity or integrated into existing OpenAI platforms, such as ChatGPT. The potential integration with Bing, a Microsoft-owned search engine, signifies a collaborative effort to compete with Google's search capabilities. The integration of Copilot AI tools into Bing last year marked a significant step in Microsoft's attempt to challenge Google's technological supremacy. Satya Nadella's declaration, ""I want people to know that we made them dance,"" hinted at the determination to disrupt Google's dominance. OpenAI's current move appears to be an extension of this partnership, with the shared goal of offering users a compelling alternative to Google's search services. OpenAI enters an increasingly crowded dance floor, with Google's Bard and Gemini, innovative AI tools like Copilot, and newcomers such as Perplexity vying for attention. Google, long unchallenged in the search engine arena, now faces formidable competitors as technological advancements redefine the landscape. The potential emergence of a robust web search engine from OpenAI could have far-reaching implications for users and the tech industry as a whole. A viable alternative to Google could foster healthy competition, spurring innovation and improvements across the board. Users may benefit from diverse search experiences, enhanced features, and a renewed focus on privacy and security. OpenAI's move into web search, coupled with its collaboration with Bing, signals a pivotal moment in the evolution of technology. As the dance floor fills up with contenders like Google's Bard and Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, and new players like Perplexity, the tech industry is witnessing a dynamic shift that promises to redefine the way we search, interact, and navigate the vast expanse of information on the internet. Whether OpenAI's search engine becomes a standalone force or integrates seamlessly with existing platforms, its entry into the web search arena will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the competitive landscape."

Carlo Allegri/Reuters The S&P 500 would have to climb another 25% to 6,250 to reach dot-com-era ""irrational exuberance,"" SocGen said. Investors aren't overvaluing stocks as much as they were at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Though gains are concentrated, market breadth is improving. The magnificent gains of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have brought an onslaught of dot-com era comparisons from Wall Street. Nvidia is like Cisco , the AI hype is like the internet craze, and so on. But crunching the numbers, Societe Generale says the S&P 500 would still need to surge by another 25% to reach the levels of ""irrational exuberance"" that fueled the tech bubble in the 90s. ""Applying the peak of the [technology-media-telecoms] bubble maths to the Nasdaq-100, the S&P 500 would have to reach 6,250 to price in the same level of irrational exuberance,"" analysts Manish Kabra and Alain Bokobza wrote in a note on Wednesday. The benchmark index was trading around 4,966 on Wednesday afternoon. The math Kabra talks about is the tech sector's profit share of the S&P 500. At the peak of the dot-com bubble, the tech sector was trading at twice its profit share of the S&P 500, and the benchmark index had a price-to-earnings ratio of 25x. Today, the Nasdaq-100 is trading at 1.25 times its share of profits (40% of S&P 500's earnings per share), and the S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio is 20x. In other words, investors aren't overvaluing stocks as much as they were at the peak of the dot-com tech bubble. Irrational exuberance at the peak of the dotcom-bubble versus today Societe Generale It's not that the S&P 500 isn't concentrated — stocks like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are a huge part of its stellar performance in the last year, and the Magnificent Seven accounted for 45% of the index's gain in January. ""There is no doubt concentration is one of the biggest risks,"" Kabra wrote. ""The index weights of the top 10 US stocks are even higher today than they were in the [dot-com]-bubble."" But the rally so far has been driven by ""rational optimism"" instead of irrational exuberance, he said. More stocks are participating in the market rally instead of the coterie of seven tech stars, and equities around the world are being boosted up by strong profits.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: Total Q4 earnings for the 369 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +5.8% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenues, with 79.1% beating EPS estimates and 64.8% beating revenue estimates. The Tech sector is solely responsible for keeping the Q4 earnings growth pace in the positive territory. Had it not been for the Tech sector's strong growth, the +5.8% earnings growth for the companies that have reported already drops to a decline of -0.1%. The Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the Q4 earnings growth pace, with the Energy sector pulling it down and the Tech sector giving it a boost. Excluding the ‘Magnificent 7’ – Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, Nvidia NVDA & Tesla TSLA – whose Q4 earnings are on track to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues, total earnings for the rest of the index would down -2.9% on +1.8% higher revenues. In this space, we have discussed the impressive earnings performance of the Magnificent 7 companies in the ongoing Q4 earnings season and how these strong growth numbers validate these companies’ market leadership. Using estimates for Nvidia, which reports quarterly results on February 21 st , with actual results for the other 6 members of the group, total Mag 7 earnings for Q4 are on track to increase +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3. You can see the group’s earnings and revenue growth picture in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As you can see in the chart above, the group is currently expected to achieve +30.4% more earnings in 2024 Q1 on +12.8% higher revenues, with earnings growth in 2024 Q2 expected to be up +18.2%. The Mag 7 companies combined are on track to account for 22.8% of all S&P 500 earnings in Q4; they account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization. Had these 7 stocks been a sector, they would have the second biggest weight in the S&P 500 index, behind the Tech sector, which currently accounts for 37.5%. The Finance sector, which at one time was the biggest sector in the index, currently accounts for 12%. The chart below shows the group’s growth picture on an annual basis. Story Continues Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Importantly, the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving, as the revisions chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The revisions trend for the broader Tech sector also remains positive, even though the aggregate revisions trend is modestly negative. The chart below shows how the aggregate 2024 earnings estimate for the Zacks Tech sector has evolved. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Beyond Mag 7, Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +5.5% above the year-earlier period on +3.2% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% increase in index earnings in 2023 Q3 on +2.3% higher revenues. The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Below, we show the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. But the +4.7% revenue growth expectation is hardly aggressive, considering that the U.S. economy produced a nominal GDP growth rate in excess of +6% last year. The rest of the 2024 earnings growth is coming from margin expansion, with 2024 net margins for the index going up to +12.4% from last year’s 11.7%. Embedded in this margin expectation is the view that the inflation cycle has run its course, with easing cost pressures letting net margins return to the 2022 level. We don’t see this margin (or revenue) outlook as unreasonable or out-of-sync with the economic ground reality. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earnings aren’t great, but then again, no one expected corporate profitability to be great. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears. With quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 9 th , here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed. First , the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters. The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods. For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9 th , total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 80.5% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 65% have beaten revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 338 index members in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Second , companies are making good progress on the margins front. The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods. The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net margins. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research At the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance and others. On the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Medical, Autos, Energy and Transportation sectors. Third , the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward. For the 64.5% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +21.5% on +6.4% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates. Story Continues Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.4% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues. The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture. Please remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector, as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.5% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively. What this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture, both negative as well as positive. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role. You can see this growth profile in the chart below, which also shows that the sector’s Q4 earnings are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record of $155.7 billion. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.5% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results. Fourth , related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA. Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector. Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues. The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%. The chart below shows the Mag 7 earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Five , the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4. Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others. The chart below shows how the earnings growth expectation for the period has evolved in recent months.

Salt Lake City is among several Utah communities to be rated among the best in the U.S. in terms of growth and resilience. | Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Utah’s economy is distinguished as the best in the nation for its strong business environment and job creation growth. The Best-Performing Cities 2024 report by the Milken Institute focuses on sustainable growth and resilience in U.S. metropolitan areas, and showcased Utah once again. The 403 cities surveyed in the report were placed in their rankings regarding opportunities for job growth, wages and high-tech industry growth. Utah stood out in the report for making two out of the top five spots in this year's rankings for large city growth and fourth in the small cities growth category. Top 5 large cities: Austin-Round Rock, Texas. Raleigh, North Carolina. Boise City, Idaho. Salt Lake City, Utah. Provo-Orem, Utah. Top 5 small cities: Idaho Falls, Idaho. Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Gainesville, Georgia. St. George, Utah. Twin Falls, Idaho. Salt Lake City’s jump in the ranks Utah’s capital has seen remarkable growth, particularly in high-tech GDP and wages over the past five years, which propelled the city up in the rankings, surpassing Provo for the first time since 2012. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Salt Lake City’s low economic inequality has allowed it to thrive during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, giving it the bolster it needs to combat future economic shocks. However, “A slowdown in job growth during the later part of 2022 and early 2023, partially caused by tech layoffs, is cause for concern for the Salt Lake City economy, which in the past has been bolstered by strong growth of the high-tech sector,” the report found. Related From Gen Z to the baby boomers, 2023 was bad when it came to housing The impact of the U.S.’s ‘No Vacation Nation’ reputation on employee wellness Provo-Orem loses No. 1 ranking The popular college area lost its three-year reign as the top-performing large metropolitan area, dropping to fifth place. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Although Provo boasted one of the country’s most rapidly expanding employment sectors, securing the second spot in job growth and the third in wage increases over a five-year period, other factors caused the Provo-Orem area to lose its lead. “This year’s drop in Provo’s position on the BPC ranking is due to notable falls in its one-year job and wage growth,” according to the report. “The slowdown in Provo’s labor market performance has extended into mid-2023 as signaled by its relatively low (compared to last year) performance in short-term job growth, which accounts for employment growth from August 2022 to August 2023.” Provo-Orem still maintains a prosperous tech sector with a significant presence of tech giants like Qualtrics and Vivint. The area has faced challenges from tech layoffs and tightening in the high-tech sector, similar to Salt Lake City, impacting its labor market performance. St. George, a robust small city The southern Utah city went down one ranking from 2023 to 2024 but continues to show strong labor market performance, ranking second among small cities in five-year job and wage growth. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Despite its small high-tech sector, the city has seen rapid growth in high-tech GDP, mainly attributable to its computer systems design and architectural/engineering sectors. That being said, the city is not without its challenges. “Its housing supply has struggled to keep pace with demand, with the city ranking 125th among small cities in housing affordability. St. George also faces an uncertain water future,” the report said. The report added, “The city relies on the Virgin River (a tributary of the Colorado River) for the predominant share of its water supply. Recent droughts, combined with the area’s high growth, have put an excessive burden on the Virgin River’s capacity, leading city officials to warn that water shortages could limit the city’s future growth.” About Our Ads"

Also: notes on Google’s Gemini, Disney tying up with Epic Games, and more. by Alex Heath Feb 8, 2024, 4:26 PM UTC Link Share If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge, Photo by Bloomberg/Getty Images Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. It has been, needless to say, a rough week for Snap. The pain started Monday, with the announcement of layoffs impacting 10 percent of employees . On Tuesday, the company reported weak earnings that sent the stock price tanking 30 percent. You could hear the solemness in CEO Evan Spiegel’s voice on the earnings call, which lasted an unusually brisk 30 minutes. As I wrote in an October issue , the question of what happens to Snap remains a big one that many inside and around the company are wrestling with. On one hand, Snapchat has achieved a reach — 414 million daily users last quarter — that is rivaled only by a handful of other companies in the world. On the other, as the team at the investing research firm MoffettNathanson put it this week, “It is hard to see how Snap’s competitive position and financial profile gets materially better.” Snap has fascinated me for years, in part because of how Spiegel has positioned it against the rest of social media. That approach will be on display again this weekend during the Super Bowl, when the company’s “less social media, more Snapchat” ad will air. There are other ways Snap is acting differently from everyone else. Spiegel is still spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year on the hardware division making Spectacles, I’m told. The plan is to release another pair of the AR glasses either later this year or in 2025. Meanwhile, the much bigger players in this space, namely Apple and Meta, don’t see true AR glasses really hitting until toward the end of this decade. Google just decided to kill its first-party AR hardware because the technology was too far out from being commercially viable. Even still, Spiegel sees building AR glasses as being existential. “We need our business to be strong enough and profitable enough to deliver the future of computing in augmented reality,” he told employees last month . He’s not alone in thinking AR will be the next platform shift. He just looks increasingly outgunned . On the business side, he seems set on the idea that increasing revenue growth will appease investors and lift his stock price, though he has yet to prove it. The tech companies performing the best right now are focusing on the bottom line, and Snap is nowhere near being close to actual profitability. Even if the ads business gets turned around and starts growing again, more revenue by itself is a hard pitch when Meta is growing revenue faster at a much larger scale and also producing a lot of profit. (A wild stat: Snap’s stock-based compensation last year was 29 percent of its revenue. Meta’s was 10 percent.) Back when interest rates were low and he was the de facto head of product for Mark Zuckerberg , Spiegel could get away with Snap being the underdog, money-losing operation. Now, he’s playing catch-up on generative AI and is late to flattening his org chart. Who is copying whom , exactly? Morale inside public companies tends to trend with the stock price, and Snap has certainly been a rollercoaster since it went public. But after the events of this week, the question is whether Spiegel can convince others to stay on the ride with him. Notebook My thoughts on what else is happening in tech right now: Bard becomes Gemini: Google can’t stop renaming things. The real news here is that Gemini Ultra, Google’s answer to GPT-4, is finally out and being bundled in a new Google One $20 a month subscription plan. The Gemini mobile app only being available on Android is a choice that I would like to know more about. If you read last week’s issue , you knew that Google Assistant was going to become Bard / Gemini soon. That’s starting today. It’s a big deal for where Google is heading. But I think OpenAI can rest easy for now. Also: Here’s CEO Sundar Pichai on CNBC today addressing my story about the company’s tense all-hands meeting last week: “I don’t think most companies engage with employees in the transparent way we do, and I think that creates some of this conversation outside. But I’ve always viewed it as a source of strength for the company and we’ll work through this moment.” Epic and Disney, sitting in a tree: Disney’s putting $1.5 billion into Epic Games makes it one of the largest shareholders next to CEO Tim Sweeney , who a spokesperson says will continue to maintain voting control after the transaction closes. Epic was valued at $31.5 billion when it last raised money in 2022, before it did layoffs and s aw its business growth slow . I’m told this Disney round is being done at a solid discount from that last known valuation. (Epic has historically touted its up-and-to-the-right valuation in press releases for funding rounds but didn’t mention it this time.) Still, having Disney’s IP in the Fortnite universe is a huge win for Sweeney and a blow to Roblox. Props to Disney for finally realizing that it needs to have a bigger presence in video games, where young people have been spending their time for a while. And this may be the beginning of Epic’s comeback; I’ve heard that the fourth quarter was its best ever in terms of revenue. Glasshole redux? I’m not sure Apple wants the free marketing it is getting from people wearing the Vision Pro in all sorts of ill-advised situations. Sure, it’s great for Apple that people want to wear the thing in the wild, and T-Pain is gonna T-Pain , but the optics of dudes (and let’s be honest, it’s all dudes) driving with them and walking down the street while gesturing is cringe. Several friends have sent me the Cartier Buffs meme . I’m guessing we are one turn away from coffee shops, gyms, and the like banning headsets. Don’t miss: My story on Bluesky , a decentralized rival to X and Threads that I hyped early on in this newsletter , opening up for anyone to join. (Plus: this new paper on its underlying AT Protocol.) I also interviewed Meta’s Nick Clegg about the company’s new effort to label AI-generated content: “Do I think that there is a possibility that something may happen where, however quickly it’s detected or quickly labeled, nonetheless we’re somehow accused of having dropped the ball? Yeah, I think that is possible, if not likely.” People moves Some interesting career moves I’ve noticed recently: Some of the senior people who were laid off at Snap: content partnerships VP David Brinker ; developer partnerships VP Konstantinos Papamiltiadis ; Spotlight director Sam Corrao Clanon ; and content engineering VP Ding Zhou . Zhang Nan , the CEO of ByteDance’s China version of TikTok, Douyin, is moving inside the company to run CapCut, its AI-powered video editing app. Ahmad Abbas , an ex-engineering manager for the Vision Pro, is Midjourney’s first head of hardware. “We will make the orb.” Huh. Reema Batta recently started as VP of growth marketing at Figma. Melika Carroll joined Cohere to lead government affairs and public policy. A couple of recent OpenAI additions: Varun Shetty , a former partnerships director at Meta, is now running media partnerships. And Tom Cunningham , a former senior data scientist at Meta and Twitter, also joined. Erik Schluntz , co-founder of Cobalt Robotics, has joined Anthropic’s technical staff. And Ashwin Vaswani joined Google DeepMind as a multimodal research engineer. Interesting links YouTube CEO Neal Mohan’s annual letter .

Experts however, believe that they are set to terminate more people as they face as economic uncertainties Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google The tech sector has kicked off 2024 with another round of job reductions, further scaling back following widespread layoffs in the preceding year. According to Layoffs.fyi, a startup monitoring industry job cuts since the onset of the pandemic, approximately 32,000 tech professionals have been displaced so far this year. Founder of Layoffs.fyi, Roger Lee, explained that tech firms are still adjusting their workforce sizes in response to over-hiring during the pandemic surge, exacerbated by prolonged economic challenges and a downturn in the tech sector. Lee identified two primary waves of job cuts: the initial spike coinciding with the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, and a subsequent trend beginning in the second quarter of 2022, influenced by rising interest rates. While this year’s layoffs are characterised as more targeted and smaller in scale compared to those of the previous year, economic factors remain the driving force behind these decisions. Additionally, companies are redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, reflecting a broader industry trend. An analysis by CompTIA revealed a notable increase in job postings requiring AI skills, signalling a shift in hiring priorities. Despite the downsizing, the tech sector is simultaneously experiencing heightened recruitment activity in certain areas. CompTIA reported a substantial month-over-month increase in active job postings in January, indicating ongoing demand for talent within the industry. Bert Bean, CEO of Insight Global, a staffing company, expressed optimism about the industry’s potential for recovery but highlighted lingering uncertainties. He anticipates a period of continued market volatility until the Federal Reserve takes decisive action to adjust interest rates. Recent announcements from companies like Snap Inc. and Okta Inc. underscore the persistence of workforce reductions in the tech industry. Snap Inc. disclosed plans to cut approximately 10 per cent of its workforce, while Okta Inc. announced a 7 per cent reduction, echoing cost-saving measures implemented by other prominent tech entities including Amazon.com Inc., Salesforce Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc.

TechPoint on Thursday released its 2023 Indiana Tech Venture Report, which showed that the tech sector saw small gains last year despite a slowed economy. The report says tech-specific venture capital investments in Indiana totaled about $278 million through 115 deals last year. The number of deals was up 20% compared to 2022, but the total investment declined by 40%. The venture activity was highest among health-tech companies with 35 deals worth nearly $74 million, followed by ag-tech and hard tech companies each with 11 deals worth $38 million. TechPoint says the majority of VC activity took place in central Indiana, but every Indiana region saw at least one deal last year. Among the deals highlighted in the report are the $20 million Series B round announced in January 2023 by Indianapolis-based Authenticx, as well as $17.5 million Series A round last June from New Albany-based RxLightning. Chelsea Linder, vice president for innovation and entrepreneurship at TechPoint, said they are optimistic for the tech sector’s outlook in 2024. “We’re heartened by indications that interest rate cuts are coming in 2024 and we know there’s a lot of dry powder out there,” Linder said in a news release. “We expect a return to growth this year.” You can connect to the full report by clicking here .

These organizations aim to help close the diversity gap in tech. Credit: Olu Eletu Despite diversity being a much-discussed topic in the tech industry, representation for Black tech workers is still not where it needs to be, with African Americans holding just 7% of the positions and only 2% of tech executive roles, according to data from the 2022 Diversity in High Tech report published by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Moreover, Black IT pros, even those in leadership positions, still encounter unique challenges both in the workplace and in their career paths. And maintaining a conversation around the importance of diversity is more crucial than ever, with the recent Trump administration implementing sweeping anti-DEI executive orders, laying off all federal DEI workers . It becomes increasingly important to address as we’ve seen major tech organizations such as Amazon and Meta quietly roll back and eliminate internal DEI programs and initiatives , which shows a jarring pivot since, just a couple of years ago, these same companies publicly claimed they were at the forefront of DEI, leading the way to champion and bolster tech diversity. However, such programs barely had time to get off the ground in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement before being brought to a screeching halt in 2025. While the onus of change rests in large part on employers to alter their approaches to hiring and fostering inclusivity in the workplace, the following 16 professional organizations are dedicated to advancing the careers of Black IT pros, and increasing Black representation in the tech industry at all levels through training, networking resources, and more. American Association of Blacks in Energy The American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) ensures African Americans and other minorities have input and a voice in the discussion and development of energy policies, regulations, R&D technologies, and environmental issues. AABE annually awards $350,000 in scholarships to students in energy-related tech fields, and offers a career center for job seekers and employers. There’s also the AABE Institute, which provides training, technical assistance, market information, supplier and partnership opportunities, and business solutions. The AABE Institute’s goal is to be a leading resource for energy issues in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Diaspora, with a focus on sustainable development. Black Code Collective The Black Code Collective (BCC) was started in 2016 to create a safe space and community for Black software engineers. Many Black technologists find themselves to be one of the only Black employees on their team or in the room. And according to BCC, workspaces are often started and run by white people, which brings an unspoken burden for Black people. This inherent bias, which runs through the industry, is what makes groups like BCC so important. It gives Black technologists a space to connect with peers who understand their situation, and who can help ease some of the stress that can come from navigating predominantly white workspaces. BCC advocates for taking the necessary steps to retool the IT and tech talent pipelines, and how to take the right steps to ensure Black tech workers have the same opportunity, sponsorship, and equity as their non-BIPOC peers. Black Data Processing Associates Founded in 1975, the Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA) is an international organization that serves as a network for underrepresented minorities working in the IT and computer science fields. The BDPA organizes technology conferences, local chapter events, continuing education and professional development events, academic scholarships, and mentoring and career opportunities for Black IT professionals. The BPDA also organizes community outreach programs for students, including the Student Information Technology Education and Scholarship (SITES), National High School Computer Competitions (HSCC), and Youth Technology Camp (YTC) to increase representation in tech and create pipelines for future talent. Black Tech Nation (BTN) Black Tech Nation (BTN) helps Black technologists gain access to valuable resources, networks, and opportunities in the tech industry. It was started in 2017 after its founder, Kelauni Jasmyn, noticed that after graduating a coding bootcamp, she didn’t see many other software developers who looked like her in the local tech scene. She later received a grant to create BTN as a community for other Black technologists who also felt isolated in their careers. The organization offers companies a pipeline to Black tech talent, supports the next generation of Black tech entrepreneurs, highlights impactful Black techies, and helps create community hubs in cities for Black technologists to connect, network, and find support. Black Tech Pipeline Black Tech Pipeline started with a viral tweet. The organization’s founder, Pariss Chandler, asked followers “What does Black Twitter in Tech look like?” and the response was overwhelming, according to an article from TechCrunch. Not long after, Chandler was contacted by companies looking to recruit Black tech workers, and although she had never worked in recruiting before, she quickly developed a talent database and connected candidates with potential employers. Launching the Black Tech Pipeline in 2020, Chandler partners with companies and offers various services to help connect them with Black technologists looking for new jobs. But she soon recognized the tech industry also has a retention problem, especially with Black tech workers, so she expanded her services to include a consulting package, conducting biweekly check-ins during the first 90 days to see how new Black Tech Pipeline hires are doing at their new jobs. The goal is to prove there isn’t a pipeline problem — that there are plenty of skilled and experienced Black technologists available who are eager to work at every level for equitable and diverse organizations. For more on Black Tech Pipeline, see “ Black Tech Pipeline connects Black IT pros to DEI-committed employers .” Blacks in Technology Black workers in the tech industry typically experience underrepresentation, which bleeds into career growth, pay equity, and mentorship opportunities. Non-profit organization Blacks in Technology (BIT) aims to “stomp the divide” Black workers face in the IT industry to help level the playing field through training, education, networking and mentorship with the support of allies, partners and sponsors, according to the organization. BIT has chapters across the US and internationally where members can attend events, trainings, and tech summits designed to uplift and connect the Black tech community. Members also get access to career support, networking, and tech resources. Membership is open to any Black woman or man who works in tech, making it the largest community of BIPOC tech workers in the world. For a spotlight on Blacks in Technology, see “ How Blacks in Technology is ‘stomping the divide.’ ” Blacks United in Leading Technology (BUiLT) Blacks United in Leading Technology (BUiLT) is a non-profit professional organization that offers community-focused activities, events, and programs that focus on Black technology workers and highlight the importance of diversity, equity, and equality in the tech industry. BUiLT believes in “equity for Blacks in tech, in where they work, with those who buy our products, and investors who support our ventures,” according to the website. You can find BUiLT chapters across the US, with locations in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Miami, North Texas, San Diego, and more. Members enjoy free and discounted technical training, including discounted rates for Lean Six Sigma certifications , along with free training for the cybersecurity PenTest+ certification. Members also get access to a large network of other entrepreneurs, founders, senior business leaders, and other professionals dedicated to increasing representation of Black people in technology. Membership also includes professional development courses, mentorship opportunities, events, speaking opportunities, engagement with corporate sponsors, private events, and optional website listings for business owners. For more on BUiLT, see “ How BUiLT unites Black IT pros and builds equity .” Black Professionals in Tech Network (BPTN) The Black Professionals in Tech Network (BPTN) was started as a way for Black tech professionals to connect with one another to build communities. Its network currently consists of more than 50,000 Black professionals who network, connect, share resources, and grow their careers together. Members get access to mentorship, events, summits, skill-building opportunities, and a strong peer network to support career growth. The goal of BPTN is not only to connect Black tech professionals, but help corporations strengthen diversity in the talent pipeline. BPTN also helps corporate partners understand how to attract, hire, retain, and promote Black tech talent by changing the way they hire and their internal culture. CODE2040 CODE2040 is a non-profit that connects and mobilizes the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle structural barriers that prevent the full participation and leadership of Black and Latinx technologists in the innovation economy, according to the organization. It achieves this through events, training, early-career programs, and knowledge sharing to ensure Black and Latinx technologists have the tools and network to enable racial equity throughout the tech industry. DevColor DevColor bills itself as a global career accelerator for Black software engineers, technologists, and executives, and serves as the go-to accountability partner for the companies who invest in, employ, and are led by them. DevColor is dedicated to creating a community for Black leaders in IT, by offering career development and networking resources. They offer several unique programs, including the A* program that matches participants with a small cohort of six to eight Black software engineers and managers for a year to build accountability, career mapping, and community. For a spotlight on DevColor, see “ DevColor’s cohort approach to uplifting Black IT careers .” DigitalUndivided (DID) DigitalUndivided (DID) is an organization focused on fostering more inclusivity in entrepreneurship for Black and Latinx women. It started as a conference for Black women founders in tech, which led to it growing into a focus fellow (FF) program, and eventually it turned into an eight-week virtual accelerator program. DID didn’t stop there. It later took on research projects that uncovered how Black and Latinx female founders receive less than 0.2% of all venture funding. After the report was released, the number of startups led by Black women tripled and funding increased 500%. DID has since continued to expand its offering of programs, initiatives, and research to uplift Black and Latinx female founders in tech. Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF) The Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF) offers career-advancing programs for Black IT professionals. The ITSMF was formed in 1996 by a group of technology executives who wanted to improve diversity in the technology industry all the way to the executive level. The mission of the ITSMF is to increase representation of Black professionals at senior levels in tech, and to impact organizational innovation and growth. The ITSMF offers programs for executives, managers, and an “emerge” program specifically designed to increase representation of women of color at senior levels in the tech industry. For more on ITSMF, see “ ITSMF: Growing Black IT careers through leadership programs.” National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) is a professional organization for underrepresented minorities working in engineering and STEM roles, and provides college scholarships for those interested in pursuing a degree in STEM. The goal is to increase representation of BIPOC in tech by providing scholarships, resources, and opportunities for high-achieving, underrepresented minority college students pursuing careers in engineering and computer science, it affirms. NACME’s focus is on helping students become qualified candidates for in-demand tech jobs. National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is a student-governed organization with 500 chapters and nearly 16,000 active members in the US and abroad. The non-profit comprises collegiate and pre-collegiate students and technical professionals in engineering and technology. The mission of the NSBE is “to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community,” according to the organization. Technologists of Color Technologists of Color was established in 2012, and its goal is to build a community of Black tech workers in Atlanta, Georgia, while also offering various services and programs to its members. The organization offers meetups, happy hours, and conferences for members, as well as coding programs and resources to equip members with laptops and other necessary equipment. The organization has held several types of events, including coding workshops, meet-up events for members to build their networks, app showcase events, and coding events for youths in the community. We Build Black Non-profit We Build Black was founded in 2017 by Devin Jackson, who was feeling isolated as the only Black software engineer in his company. Unable to find an established community to connect with other Black developers, Jackson decided to take matters into his own hands by starting the Black Software Engineers of NYC Meetup. The event was hosted every Saturday afternoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, eventually growing to 1,000 members within six months. From there, Jackson and his fellow Black software engineers knew they had something special and wanted to grow the group into a full-blown organization. We Build Black also hosts the Mavens I/O: Black Women in Tech conference each year, and brings coding programs to schools, pilots a recidivism awareness program, and works to connect members to new job opportunities.

The three tech sectors featured in this poster release—EV Charging, Renewable Energy, and Transmission—are essential to the broader clean energy transition, where deployment of established emissions-reduction technologies is a crucial part of the nation's path forward. The development of a robust electric vehicles (EV) charging sector in the U.S. is a key component of decarbonizing the nation's transportation sector. LPO financing programs can assist in the manufacture and deployment of EV charging infrastructure to help address “range anxiety""—a signifiant barrier to EV adoption—making zero-emissions vehicles a more attractive option for drivers and fleets of all sizes. To learn more, see LPO's EV Charging tech sector page: https://lnkd.in/g3-bMHt5 and EV charging infrastructure eligibility page: https://lnkd.in/gtCRrf7 ""Renewable energy"" as a tech sector describes a broad category of primarily mature emissions-reduction technologies such as geothermal, hydrokinetics, hydropower, onshore wind, and photovoltaic solar that are proven methods for clean energy generation when deployed at scale. As of November 2023, LPO has split this reporting category into two—Clean Energy Supply Chain & Renewables Deployment—to better reflect market realities and increased applicant interest in the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) program (see: https://lnkd.in/g7MMhauW ) which has significantly increased LPO's authority to help utilize existing energy infrastructure for the deployment of proven, emissions-reduction technologies at scale. To learn more, see LPO's Renewable Energy tech sector page: https://lnkd.in/gwqD9Nzt A modernized transmission system provides the crucial link between a rapidly changing power generation sector and increasing demand from end-users. It enables more efficient distribution of renewable energy and enhanced grid reliability, powering the transition to sustainable energy. LPO can support transmission project financing across a number of its loan and loan guarantee programs. To learn more, see LPO's Transmission tech sector page: https://lnkd.in/gtXuefvK , electric grid projects page: https://lnkd.in/gHc8RcU5 , and watch a webinar previewing DOE's forthcoming Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report on grid deployment: https://lnkd.in/gYQAC-6j You can find downloadable print versions of these latest illustrated posters and all previous ones at: Energy.gov/LPO/Posters , learn more about the 14 LPO tech sectors at: Energy.gov/LPO/MAAR , and about LPO and all of its financing programs at: Energy.gov/LPO ."

""Senator Warren took to Twitter to criticize the downsizing, reminding followers of her previous warnings against the merger. “I warned that this deal would hurt workers,” she wrote. “These layoffs are a stark reminder that corporate mergers are bad for workers. The FTC should keep up the fight to unwind this merger.” Activision Blizzard employees have described the layoffs as a “bloodbath” on social media.

Agree 2 Disagree 0 ▼ ✖ - + SPAM Inappropriate VariantAEC 652d ago This has less to do with Capitalism and more to do with simple greed. Capitalism is an economic system. Greed is the want of money. The current global market including Communist markets and other economic systems are all plugged into the wider monetary trade which has NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH ANY ECONOMIC SYSTEM. You can blame Americans or the Western world at large for the utter ridiculousness of chasing endless growth of wealth. However the monetary trade has nothing to do with Capitalist, Communist, Socialist or any other economic platforms. Capitalism is offering services for money. Microsoft does do that many companies do but their service used to be selling us operating systems and productivity software. Today MS leases us everything. You might own your PC hardware, but you're a half step away from renting Windows (the software that controls everything about your PC) these days. In order to be successful in a Capitalist economy you need to offer something people want. If people really want something you can provide you can increase prices as a means to slow demand so you can keep up with supplying the goods. That is how Capitalism works. MS doesn't work in that system anymore. Most companies traded publicly don't which is also how MS was able to capture ABK without a hostile takeover. Generally speaking, crashing a competitors stock value without a hostile takeover... well I think MS just broke ground there in acquiring ABK they way they did. Anywho... MS were able to do that not because the company purchased them at full price but because they helped tank their stock valuation to a price they could afford and ABK's leaders couldn't afford to pass up. That's not Capitalism and we know it isn't because Microsoft doesn't make good games which ABK used to and still could... before the acquisition. The latest CoD campaign suffered in part due to the damage MS imparted on ABK (as well as several other projects) via the stock manipulation. We know this happened because MS leaked their past endeavors including actively manipulating ABK's stock value. How the FTC was unable to stop the merger when that information was part of discovery is baffling to me... but we're in clown world now.

Whenever there is a merger or acquisition between two companies there are always layoffs. ALWAYS. Stop pretending like this situation is an outlier. I grew up in Massachusetts's. Elizabeth Warrern is one of the least respected politicians in this county, and that is saying a lot. She's an absolute idiot who does nothing but complain, without offering viable solutions, and jump on any hot button issue that passes her way.

It's obvious that you're one of those nitwits that only thinks in binary terms, Democrat vs Republican, PlayStation vs Xbox etc. Putting people in readily defined boxes makes it much easier for shortsighted individuals like yourself to understand complicated issues. The problem is that this type of behavior leads to a myopic viewpoint, bias and group think. Why exactly are you bringing political matters (foreign to you) into this discussion? We can disregard anything that Elizabeth ""Kooky Aunt"" Warren has to say on the topic as she is simply jumping on the daily bandwagon. She's already forgot about it and has moved onto the next newsworthy topic. Your primary argument is that Microsoft is ""evil"" because it laid off workers after the merger. As I stated this happens EVERY TIME there is a consolidation of companies. At no point did I say I supported or ""cheer on"" this action. I'm not even sure how a rational person would make that assumption. If I did say I was in favor of layoffs, then show me the evidence. Downsizing and layoffs are always an unfortunate circumstance for the workforce, but inevitable whenever there is a merger or acquisition. BTW, I'm not a Republican. One would think that an ""intelligent"" person like yourself would know that Massachusetts is an overwhelmingly Democratic state. Stay in your lane, which appears to be hating on a rival video game company, you pathetic, immature fanboy.

Sony will always have their 1st party with their heavy hitters but i would also personally want to see them invest more into AA, bring in younger talents, incorporate more experimental ideas to game design and prototyping like the early days with PS and PS2, maybe instead of investing 200-300+ million in bombastic cinematic experiences, invest atleast half of that into creating new teams for other genres you're currently lacking in to diversify your portfolio such as platfomers, jrpgs, horror, rythm, arcade racer, FPS, hell, maybe even a strategy game or two.

The longer they wait to release the ps6, the stronger it will be. People can wait. Just let Kojima finish Physint as a ps6 launch title. That should take at least another 4 years.

In the meantime, their fanbase is so filled with PR talk that they can’t see past their knees. I hope their gaas only and walled garden service future collapses as hard as it seems it is.

Sony will always have their 1st party with their heavy hitters but i would also personally want to see them invest more into AA, bring in younger talents, incorporate more experimental ideas to game design and prototyping like the early days with PS and PS2, maybe instead of investing 200-300+ million in bombastic cinematic experiences, invest atleast half of that into creating new teams for other genres you're currently lacking in to diversify your portfolio such as platfomers, jrpgs, horror, rythm, arcade racer, FPS, hell, maybe even a strategy game or two.

Looking at Death Stranding 2 and Yotei, and anticipating GTA6 and Wolverine will also blow away graphics expectations, I don’t think devs are constrained by the ps5 yet. The longer they wait to release the ps6, the stronger it will be. People can wait. Just let Kojima finish Physint as a ps6 launch title. That should take at least another 4 years. That would be the lifecycle at 9 years, which would be the longest lifecycle yet, but not by much.

Here Are 3 Tech - Heavy ETFs to Buy in 2024 . ,20240126T121500Z,https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/5fc019f755cc567fb2db8c4ee0e397cc,finance.yahoo.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"The Tech Sector Just Hit an All-Time High. Here Are 3 Tech-Heavy ETFs to Buy in 2024. Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool January 26, 2024 6 min read ^GSPC TSLA GOOG AMZN MSFT After a steep sell-off in 2022, the technology sector rocketed higher in 2023 and just reached a fresh intraday record high on January 22. It's easy to see why. Over the last five years, Apple is up 394% and Microsoft is up 267%. These two companies alone have gotten so big that they both top $3 trillion in market capitalization, making them the two biggest companies in the world. If you're interested in the tech sector, but don't know which stock to choose, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be the best and least expensive way to achieve diversification and exposure to different industries. Here's why the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK) , the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) , and the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VOO) stand out as three easy ways to invest in tech stocks . Image source: Getty Images. Betting on the tech sector With over $58 billion in net assets, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is one of the largest pure-play sector ETFs out there. It's heavily concentrated, though, with 69.7% of the fund allocated to just 10 holdings. Company Weight in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund Microsoft 22.6% Apple 21.2% Broadcom 5.4% Nvidia 5.2% Advanced Micro Devices 2.9% Adobe 2.9% Salesforce 2.8% Accenture 2.4% Cisco Systems 2.2% Intel 2.1% Data source: State Street Global Advisors. The tech sector is heavily concentrated in consumer electronics, software, and semiconductors. However, you may notice a few big names missing from the list -- namely Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Tesla , and Netflix . Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Netflix are in the communications sector. Meanwhile, Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. So, although these companies are commonly referred to as ""big tech stocks,"" it's important to note the distinction regarding sector weights. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has a mere 0.1% expense ratio, making it a low-cost way to invest in tech, especially if you're interested in Apple, Microsoft, and the major semiconductor stocks. A simple yet effective way to invest in megacap growth Unlike a tech sector ETF, the Vanguard Growth ETF includes the major growth stocks I mentioned above. Company Weight in the Vanguard Growth ETF Apple 13% Microsoft 12.8% Alphabet 6.9% Amazon 6.5% Nvidia 5.3% Meta Platforms 3.6% Tesla 3.1% Eli Lilly 2.3% Visa 1.8% Mastercard 1.6% Data source: Vanguard. Compared to the tech ETF, which has 48.9% concentration in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, the Vanguard Growth ETF has practically the same allocation, or 51.2%, invested in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which is Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. So if you want the Magnificent Seven and not just Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, it's better to go with the Vanguard Growth ETF. Story Continues Now, here's where the funds diverge by quite a bit. The Vanguard Growth ETF includes top growth stocks from pockets of the market that are traditionally value- or income-oriented. The eighth-largest holding is Eli Lilly, a drugmaker that has become the largest healthcare company by market cap. Next comes Visa, the second most valuable financial company behind Berkshire Hathaway and ahead of JPMorgan Chase . The basic idea of the Vanguard Growth ETF is to achieve sector diversification but only through the lens of growth. For example, the 11th-largest holding is Costco Wholesale , which achieved strong growth despite being in the historically stodgy consumer staples sector. If you're looking for exposure to the Magnificent Seven more so than just tech, and like the idea of picking top growth names from other sectors, then this fund and its 0.4% expense ratio may be right for you. The S&P 500 got a makeover The Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund has close to $1 trillion in net assets, making it one of the largest ETFs in the world. Now you may be wondering why a generic S&P 500 index fund would be a good way to invest in the technology sector. Well, the valuation expansion of tech stocks has made the tech sector a staggering 28.9% of the S&P 500. But if you add in Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- which again aren't in the tech sector -- then the weight is actually 39.8%. Sector Weight Information technology 28.9% Financials 12.9% Healthcare 12.6% Consumer discretionary 10.9% Industrials 8.8% Communication services 8.6% Consumer staples 6.2% Energy 3.9% Real estate 2.5% Materials 2.4% Utilities 2.3% Data source: Vanguard. I'm still wrapping my head around the fact that 40% of the S&P 500 is in the tech sector plus those big four companies. It makes sense, given how massive these companies are and their ability to generate high cash flows from high margins. It's hard to put an exact number on it, but there's no denying that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence added trillions of dollars in value to the tech sector and tilted the balance of the entire market. If you want to invest in the tech sector but don't want to necessarily overdo it, then this S&P 500 index fund and its 0.03% expense ratio is probably the most well-rounded option. The tech sector is unavoidable There are two key takeaways to this article. The first is that there are several inexpensive ways to invest in tech and growth in general. The second is to understand market dynamics, namely what the tech sector is made of, what isn't in the tech sector, and that the S&P 500 is more tech-heavy than ever before. The ETFs discussed contain heavy concentration in the most valuable U.S.-based companies. The market is less diversified than it used to be. As long as that continues, the market trajectory, for better or for worse, will be determined by just a handful of companies. Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Desk Updated Jan 26, 2024 1:06 PM IST The decision to lay off staff comes as part of the company's ongoing efforts to navigate challenges in the tech industry. Salesforce is laying off about 700 employees across the company in the latest round of sackings to hit the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The layoffs represent about 1 per cent of Salesforce's workforce, which currently stands at around 70,000 employees. This move follows a similar decision made a year ago when the company reduced its staff by 10 per cent, letting go of around 8,000 employees. At that time, the decision was prompted by investor pressure to trim expenses. Advertisement Salesforce, known for its cloud-based customer relationship management software, is adjusting its workforce in response to the dynamic nature of the tech landscape. The downsizing comes at a time when various tech companies are facing similar challenges, and the industry is witnessing a series of layoffs. It also comes a day after Microsoft's move to let go of 1,900 employees within its video-game divisions, a move that includes Activision Blizzard. Microsoft had only recently acquired Activision for $69 billion in a deal that concluded late last year. At the WEF, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the tech industry is setting down safety protocols and establishing trust principles in relation to the developing AI software that has taken the world by storm to avoid a “Hiroshima moment.” Advertisement “We don’t want something to go really wrong. That’s why we’re going to, like, that safety summit. That’s why we’re talking about trust,” Benioff said, referencing a U.K. event last year. “We don’t want to have a Hiroshima moment. We’ve seen technology go really wrong, and we saw a Hiroshima. We don’t want to see an AI Hiroshima. We want to make sure that we’ve got our head around this now.” For Unparalleled coverage of India's Businesses and Economy – Subscribe to Business Today Magazine Published on: Jan 26, 2024 1:06 PM IST # Salesforce Follow Us on Channel Post a comment 0 TOP STORIES Novo Nordisk cuts Wegovy prices by 37% to counter Lilly’s Mounjaro 'Stay 10 km away from India-Pak border': UK issues travel alert amid Red Fort blast probe Tata Trusts inducts Neville Tata, Bhaskar Bhat to Sir Dorabji Tata Trust board, Venu Srinivasan’s tenure revised to 3 yrs Adani Enterprises discloses details of Rs 24,930 crore rights issue at 24% discount; check details BSE Q2 results: Profit jumps 61% to Rs 558 crore; revenue rises 44% TOP VIDEOS 2:02 Bharti Airtel Share Price: Promoters Selling Stakes Amid Recent Rally - Time To Book Profits? 2:46 Tea Seller Fulfils Daughter’s Dream, Pays ₹1.1 Lakh In Coins For New Scooty 4:51 How Technology Is Redefining War: India’s CDS On Convergence Warfare 3:57 Delhi CM Rekha Gupta On Pollution: GRAP-3 in Force, Primary Classes Go Hybrid 4:25 SoftBank Exits Nvidia with $5.8 Billion Sale.

Amanda Kay Oaks | Published: Feb 19, 2024 03:49 pm As you level up in Palworld , you earn Technology Points that can be used to unlock new facilities and items for your base and beyond. There are several new Technology items for every level reached and players will have to decide how they want to spend their points. Recommended Videos With so much new Palworld technology unlocked with each new level, players will constantly wish for more tech points to spend on these new features. To help you make the decision, we compiled a full Palworld Technology List so you can spend those Technology Points and Ancient Technology Points wisely. We’re also covering those special items, such as Legendary Armor and Legendary Weapons, that can only be unlocked by finding Item Schematics. Related: Best Pals to Farm Iron, Ore & Paldium in Palworld (Mining Pals) Palworld Technology List: All Technology Point Unlocks New levels bring new Palworld Technology to the table, along with the Technology Points you’ll need to unlock it. Here’s a full Palworld Technology list breaking down what gets unlocked at each level, how many Technology Points you’ll need to gain access to it, and the item’s basic use category. Some items in your Technology list will likely be marked as “Unknown Item.” These items relate to specific Pals and their skills, which means they won’t show up in your Technology list until you’ve caught that Pal. Also, keep in mind that there are some slight differences to this list between Steam and Xbox Game Pass versions of Palworld, though most of the differences have been fixed in recent game updates. This list was created using the Xbox GamePass version.

Technology Points in Palworld If you want to unlock everything in the Technology list, you’ll need hundreds of Technology Points. There are three ways to get Technology Points: level up, discover fast travel points, and use Technical Manuals . If you’re still early in the game, the easiest way to earn Technology Points is to uncover the map by exploring and quickly level up by catching 10 of every new Pal you come across. But as you progress further in the game, you’ll start finding Technical Manuals, which is by far the easiest way to farm Technology Points during the endgame. Technical Manuals can be found as a random drop from some high-level Pals and inside chests around high-level areas. There are a few different kinds of Technical Manuals, but the ones you want to aim for are the Future Technical Manuals . Future Technical Manuals will reward you with an extra three Technology Points to use in Palworld ‘s Technology list, and you’ll find them in chests at the end of dungeons . All you need to do is run around a high-level area like the snowy mountains located north among the Palpagos Islands, enter any dungeon you discover, run toward the back while grabbing any chests you see along the way, defeat the dungeon boss, and open the chest at the end. Rinse and repeat, and you’ll have more Technology Points than you’ll know what to do with in no time. Palworld Ancient Technology List: All Ancient Technology Point Unlocks As you reach higher levels in Palworld, you’ll get access to Ancient Technology. There are fewer of these items overall, and the Ancient Technology Points are harder to come by, earned primarily by battling bosses. Their rarity also means these items are incredibly useful tools for caring for, protecting, and leveling up your Pals. Here’s the full list of Ancient Technology items in Palworld , along with the Ancient Technology points you’ll need to earn to unlock them.

You can earn Ancient Technology Points by beating various bosses in Palworld . There are three types of bosses in Palworld : Alpha Pals, dungeon bosses, and Syndicate Tower bosses. Defeating Alpha Pals and dungeon bosses will net you one Ancient Technology Point each upon first defeat, but the Syndicate Tower bosses will get you a whopping five Ancient Technology Points, making them the most effective way to progress in your Ancient Technology list. How to Get Upgraded and Legendary Technology: Palworld Technology Schematics In addition to the technology you unlock with Technology Points and Ancient Technology Points, you’ll also find item schematics as you explore the world. These schematics give you access to uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary versions of armor and weapons. In other words, schematics unlock upgraded versions of these items, with slightly better stats than those you’ll get from the base technology list. I’ve found schematics in chests around the map and dropped as rewards in dungeons and other boss fights. The Wandering Merchant also sells certain lower level schematics. The rarer schematics, especially Legendary Schematics, are found only in boss fights. Schematics aren’t used up when you craft the item, so you can use them multiple times or share them with friends on a shared server. One important note: you’ll need to have a schematic in your inventory when you head to the crafting bench in order to access that recipe. Just having it in a chest at your base isn’t good enough. Here’s a breakdown of the schematics we’ve found so far and what items they’ll unlock.

Chip equipment maker ASML – a bellwether for the industry’s health – rose as much as 7.5pc, the biggest increase since November 2022. ASML CEO Peter Wennink said he sees positive signs in the semiconductor industry after marking a trough. His comments and ASML’s strong orders drove the likes of ASM International and BE Semiconductor Industries higher. SAP’s cloud-order backlog saw robust growth in the fourth quarter, signalling strong demand for its cloud-based software. With valuations of the European tech sector still below five-year averages, these reports leave more room for gains. Plus, the strong outlook from these stocks give investors a reason to cheer, especially after the bar for fourth-quarter expectations was lowered in recent weeks. Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Wealth, expects earnings upgrades to support a continuation of stock gains. “Technology has rallied massively, but the stocks are not much more expensive than last year, as earnings growth has been the driver, rather than multiple expansion in many cases.” The Stoxx 600 Index had gained 1pc by noon on Wednesday in London, on the eve of the first European Central Bank rates decision of 2024. Mining and real estate stocks were other outperformers in a broad risk-on rally in the region. Among other stocks, utilities and renewables were boosted by Siemens Energy’s strong beat. EasyJet shares also rose after the airline’s trading update. Beyond some positive earnings, there are reasons to be cautious, with private-sector activity in the euro area contracting for an eighth month in January. Data showed S&P Global’s purchasing managers’ index inched up to 47.9, just shy of the 48 predicted by economists and the closest to the 50 level that marks expansion since July.

Photo by Adrian Childress Search our comprehensive guide to things to do in Queens for more local events — or submit your own ! Queens Borough President Donovan Richards is set to host the second annual Queens Tech and Job Fair , reinforcing his commitment to diversifying the tech industry and connecting communities of color to this growing sector. The fair will be held this Saturday, Jan. 27 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Jamaica Performing Arts Center, located at 153-10 Jamaica Ave. The event aims to transform Queens into a top tech hub, focusing on creating opportunities for historically marginalized communities. “We need to expand employment and entrepreneurship opportunities right here,” said Richards. “This fair is a step towards making Queens a national leader in tech and innovation.” The fair will feature a variety of interactive activities and resources for residents aspiring to join the tech industry. Participants can look forward to a free job skills assessment by AI firm Skyhive, job training information from workforce development partners like All Star Code and Per Scholas, hiring stations in partnership with entities like Con Edison and Verizon Wireless, tech workshops and one-on-one mentoring with industry leaders. Deputy Borough President Ebony Young emphasized the importance of tapping into the talents of all communities, stating, “We are dedicated to creating a borough rooted in equity and prosperity.” The fair addresses significant demographic and gender disparities in NYC’s tech workforce. A 2020 HR&A Advisors study highlighted that while nearly 30% of city residents are Latin and 24% are Black, they hold just 12% and 11% of tech jobs, respectively. Additionally, women, who make up half of the city’s population, fill only 35% of tech roles. Close Get the Full Story News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Thank you for subscribing!

That wasn't necessarily the case on Friday with its stock, as the shares rushed to close nearly 3% higher. This was more than double the 1.2% rate the S&P 500 index rose on the day. A researcher's upgrade was the key reason for the pronounced upward move. Evercore ISI raises IBM to the equivalent of buy The IBM upgrader was a team of Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani, which changed their recommendation on the stock for the better. The analysts now feel IBM rates an outperform (buy, in other words), one notch up from in line (hold). The prognosticators also raised their price target on the shares, to $200 apiece from the previous $165. In their view, IBM is currently well poised to reap the benefits of bullish developments in the tech sector this year. They feel that businesses will raise their IT spending in order to improve productivity. Additionally, the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) apps and functionalities should ramp up spending on segments such as consulting and software. IBM is active in both. That said, the company isn't necessarily associated with the rapidly emerging technology. The Evercore ISI team characterized it as ""an overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption.""

But it keeps laying off humans,20240115T183000Z,https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbHJiNXF1bG4wMDA2M2I2aDJ1aW45cjV1-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NscmF1eGNhNDAwMGs4M25vYzAzeTN4bnQ.jpg,mercurynews.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech industry,"By CNN.com Wire Service PUBLISHED: January 15, 2024 at 7:16 AM PST By Catherine Thorbecke | CNN The tech sector has kicked off the new year with a spate of fresh job cuts that are coming at the same time as the industry is doubling down on investments into artificial intelligence . While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers. But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts. The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead. More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024 The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups. Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic. Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers. All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi . And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand. There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year. Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.” The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession. While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.” Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing . More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom. As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead. Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice. The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet. Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.” “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.” Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.” Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers. A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN. “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said. The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods.

But it keeps laying off humans CNN Business · Anchalee Phanmaha/Moment RF/Getty Images Catherine Thorbecke, CNN January 15, 2024 5 min read GOOG The tech sector has kicked off the new year with a spate of fresh job cuts that are coming at the same time as the industry is doubling down on investments into artificial intelligence . While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers. But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts. The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead. More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024 The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups. Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic. Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers. All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi . And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand. There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year. Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.” The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession. Story Continues While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.” Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing . More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom. As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead. Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice. The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet. Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.” “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.” Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.” Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers. A coalition of more than two dozen Black lawmakers led by Democratic Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN. “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said. The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/01/13/history-says-the-nasdaq-could-soar-in-2024-heres-w/?source=iedfolrf0000001,,History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar in 2024 : Here What I Would Buy Before Then,20240113T181500Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/760551/gettyimages-168580604.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"Last year was great for the Nasdaq Composite , surging 43% to lead all major indexes. This was a notable turnaround after the index lost a third of its value in 2022 amid rising inflation and recession fears. One thing about history is that it often repeats itself, including in the stock market. If that continues to be the case, investors should be encouraged heading into 2024. The last few times the Nasdaq Composite finished a year in the negative (2002, 2008, 2011, and 2018), it bounced back with at least two straight positive years. Year of Decline Decline Percentage Gains One Year After Decline Gains Two Years After Decline 2008 (40.5%) 43.9% 16.9% 2011 (1.8%) 15.9% 38.3% 2018 (3.9%) 35.2% 43.6% 2022 (33.1%) 43.4% TBD Data source: Nasdaq Composite historical data. Percentages rounded to the nearest tenth percent. There's no way to predict market movements, and past results don't guarantee future performance, but many of the catalysts responsible for the Nasdaq's 2023 bounceback -- such as AI and cloud computing -- are still relatively early in what they can become and should carry momentum through the year. To get ahead of the game, here's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) I'd buy. Let top tech companies lead the way for you The Nasdaq-100 is a subset index of the Nasdaq Composite that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Invesco QQQ ETF ( QQQ 0.27% ) is an ETF that mirrors the Nasdaq-100 and is the second-most traded ETF on the U.S. stock market. Expand NASDAQ : QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Today's Change ( -0.27 %) $ -1.66 Current Price $ 621.57 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 617.52 - $ 622.72 52wk Range $ 402.39 - $ 637.01 Volume 45M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A Much of the appeal of the Invesco QQQ ETF is its composition. Below are its top five holdings and how much of the ETF they account for (as of Jan. 5, 2024): Apple : 8.95% Microsoft : 8.68% Amazon : 4.77% Broadcom : 4.02% Meta Platforms : 3.95% The Invesco QQQ ETF is undoubtedly tech-dominant (57% of the fund), but the companies cover a lot of areas within the tech sector. They cover consumer electronics (Apple), social media (Meta Platforms), software and services ( Adobe , Alphabet , Intuit ), semiconductors ( Advanced Micro Devices , Intel , Nvidia ), electronic design automation ( Cadence Design Systems , Synopsys ), and a handful of other subsectors of tech. Many of the Invesco QQQ ETF's top holdings are industry leaders who will be shaping the future of technology and innovation -- especially the "" Magnificent Seven ."" Investing in individual companies comes with inherent risks, including company-specific and industry-specific issues and downturns, but I trust them, as a whole, to drive sustainable long-term growth. A reach that goes beyond the tech sector The Invesco QQQ ETF is often associated with tech, but it goes beyond that. Below are non-tech sectors represented in the ETF and how much of it they make up: Consumer discretionary: 18.73% Healthcare: 7.12% Telecommunications: 5.48% Industrials: 4.87% Consumer staples: 4.23% Utilities: 1.24% Energy: 0.69% Real estate: 0.27% Basic materials: 0.27% The tech sector will lead the charge, but it's good to have other sectors to balance out the ETF. The tech sector isn't immune to slumps, so any diversification benefits investors. Energy, real estate, and basic materials won't have tangible effects on the ETF, but sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare can be great to balance out the cyclical nature of other sectors like tech and industrials. The Invesco QQQ ETF has market-beating potential Maybe most important is that the Invesco QQQ ETF has proven results. Since its March 1999 inception, the Invesco QQQ ETF has far outperformed the S&P 500 , with 695% gains compared to the S&P 500's 270% gains over that time frame. The performance is even more impressive when looking at returns over the past decade. ^SPX data by YCharts There's no way to predict if the Invesco QQQ ETF's 16.5% average annual returns from the past decade will continue, but it has market-beating potential when considering the companies it has leading the way. For investors interested in investing in Nasdaq stocks in 2024, the Invesco QQQ ETF is an ideal choice. It contains notable sector leaders, has non-tech sectors to help against downturns, and has proven historical results. It's a 3-for-1 ETF that can play a key role in investors' portfolios."

Data indicates more than 5,500 people have been laid off in the tech sector less than two weeks into 2024. Anchalee Phanmaha/Moment RF/Getty Images CNN — The tech sector has kicked off the new year with a spate of fresh job cuts that are coming at the same time as the industry is doubling down on investments into artificial intelligence . While AI tools putting workers out of jobs has been a major point of anxiety in Silicon Valley and beyond over the past year, not all the recent layoffs in the tech industry are directly linked to AI tools simply replacing workers. But many of the recent job cut announcements have come on the heels of those same companies disclosing major investments into AI technology as they look to reallocate resources, and a growing number of tech firms have explicitly cited AI as a reason for rethinking head counts. The continued labor upheaval unfolding in the very industry creating AI could point to more unrest to come as the technology is forecast to reshape the broader business landscape in the years ahead. More than 5,500 tech layoffs less than two weeks into 2024 The latest rounds of tech job cuts are occurring across a range of roles and in both Big Tech companies and smaller startups. Tech giants Google and Amazon both announced sweeping layoffs this week impacting hundreds of workers across various business divisions. News of the job cuts at Google and Amazon come months after both companies separately announced multi-billion-dollar investments into AI startup Anthropic. Also this week, social platform Discord said it was trimming 17% of its staff. Unity Software, the maker of technology used in popular mobile games such as Pokemon Go, said it was cutting 25% of its workforce. And the language-learning app Duolingo said it laid off around 10% of its contract workers.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images Silicon Valley’s greatest minds misread pandemic demand. Now their employees are paying for it. All told, there have been more than 5,500 tech employees who have lost their jobs less than two weeks into 2024, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi . And the latest cuts in tech come after a very painful two years for the industry, marked by hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs amid a reset in pandemic-induced demand. There were some 262,682 tech industry layoffs recorded in 2023, per Layoffs.fyi data, after 164,969 cuts the previous year. Pandemic demand recoils as AI anxiety takes hold Roger Lee, a startup founder who has long been tracking tech industry layoffs via his website Layoffs.fyi, told CNN that many tech companies are still trying to “correct for their overhiring during the pandemic surge.” The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to skyrocketing demand for digital services as people around the world were forced to work, socialize and shop from home. Against that backdrop, the tech industry went on a remarkable hiring spree. But as pandemic restrictions eased in the years that followed and broader macroeconomic uncertainty set in, the tech industry saw its greatest retraction since the dotcom bust of 2000, cutting tens of thousands of jobs in rapid succession. While Lee says the high interest rate environment and tech downturn have lasted longer than initially expected, he adds that “an increasing number of tech companies have cited AI as reason for layoffs.” Last year, companies including Chegg, IBM and Dropbox cited the onset of AI as a reason to rethink staffing . More recently, Duolingo and even Google have suggested the same as they seek to mobilize resources to capitalize on the AI boom. As the full extent of AI’s impact to the labor market is still revealing itself, researchers have said that hundreds of millions of jobs globally could be impacted, though the tech could simultaneously have the potential to create new and different jobs in the future. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note last March that as many as 300 million full-time jobs around the world could be lost or diminished by the rise of generative AI technology and that white-collar workers appeared to be most at risk. Separate research also indicates that women’s jobs could be disproportionately impacted by businesses’ adoption of AI in the years ahead. Disparate impacts of tech job cuts come under scrutiny As the tech industry layoffs continue, labor advocates and even lawmakers are taking notice. The Google workers who lost their jobs this week were shocked to find out via email that they were being laid off, according to Parul Koul, a Google software engineer and president of the grassroots Alphabet Workers Union, a CWA-affiliated group that is organizing workers throughout Google’s parent company Alphabet. Koul slammed the layoffs as “unnecessary and counterproductive” in a statement to CNN on Friday that blasted “corporate greed.” “The layoffs introduce chaos and instability into the workplace and force workers to make do with less,” Koul added, saying even those that remain on the job “work in constant anxiety that they will be next.” Google, for its part, has said that the cuts were to help the teams “become more efficient and work better,” and that it is supporting impacted employees “as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond.” Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have recently taken aim at reports of the tech layoffs’ disparate effects on certain workers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addresses a speech during a meeting, at the Station F in Paris on May 26, 2023. Altman, the boss of OpenAI, the firm behind the massively popular ChatGPT bot, said on May 26, 2023, in Paris that his firm's technology would not destroy the job market as he sought to calm fears about the march of artificial intelligence (AI).

The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods."

Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Barbara Lee of California expressed concerns over the “impacts of widespread layoffs within the tech industry and its disproportionate impacts on the African American community and women” in a letter late last month to acting Labor Secretary Julie Su that was obtained by CNN. “Recent findings have consistently shown that minorities and women are vastly overrepresented in industry layoffs,” the letter said. The lawmakers pressed the Department of Labor to pay closer attention to these ongoing mass layoffs and to do more to protect the workers most at risk of losing their livelihoods."

The number of non-EEA nationals seeking and being granted the permission required to work in technology in the State last year dropped by more than 50 per cent – from 10,832 to 5,009 - and accounted for more the half the total reduction in 2023 permits granted, which fell from 39,955 to 30,981. Minister for State at the Department of Enterprise Neale Richmond, believes the numbers will be back at around the 40,000 mark this year, likely driven in part by the new roles recently added to the critical skills list and others removed from the ineligible occupations list. A number of trades and social care roles are among those that will now be eligible for general employment permits. That review followed a consultation to which there were 112 separate submissions.

Valeo’s Irish unit an obvious sale target after overseas deals splurge Housing is certainly a factor at all levels of the migration issue, with employers struggling to find accommodation for the staff they need just as the Government is finding it endlessly difficult to offer shelter to international protection applicants, those fleeing the war in Ukraine and many of its own citizens. And while the challenges experienced by the global tech sector in 2023 clearly contributed to a fall-off in demand for new recruits during the year, there have been reports too of a growing number of firms with bases here being unable to bring in the numbers they want to because of the housing situation. It has to be noted, of course, that that 10,832 figure for 2022 was exceptional. The corresponding number was slightly below 5,000 in both 2020 and 2021, but with the sector among the very best paid – average hourly earnings were half as much again as compared with the health sector generally in the third quarter of 2023 according to the CSO - the Government will be anxious to see numbers bounce back swiftly.

Maya Levin for NPR hide caption toggle caption Maya Levin for NPR Israeli soldiers work on artillery after coming out of Gaza and across the border into Israel on Dec. 28, 2023. Maya Levin for NPR TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli army has announced that it is pulling thousands of troops out of Gaza and sending them home to their families and jobs. The reasons go beyond battlefield tactics. ""This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities,"" said Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, ""as the fighting will continue and they will still be required."" It's a reminder of the war's heavy economic toll — not only in Gaza, where it has been devastating, but also in Israel, the most developed economy in the Middle East. Analysts say the war has caused the economy to shrink and created a labor shortage. Raz, 29, is an upbeat software engineer who works in a key engine of the Israeli economy, the tech sector. He's also a member of the Israeli army's special forces reserves. Early on in the war, Raz was at his base within a few miles of the border with Gaza preparing for a mission, while simultaneously talking on his phone with an overseas customer about a software project. ""I had to juggle between those two,"" recalls Raz, sitting in his company's glass-walled office with a view of the Mediterranean Sea in the distance. ""I remember it being super, super hard."" Israeli aircraft were firing guns overhead while Raz was talking business with a client. ""One of the customers asked, 'What's this noise?' and I had to explain that this is shooting sounds,"" Raz recalls. Raz, whose unit forbids him from giving his full name for security reasons, has spent the last three months splitting his time among military missions, training and developing software. "" Being a soldier is harder than being a software engineer,"" he says matter-of-factly. But, he adds, ""I also think that preserving the high-tech sector in Israel is a very important mission."" High tech is Israel's most productive sector but now faces a labor shortage Israel is home to one of the world's top tech sectors. The country's best-known tech products include Waze, the driving directions app. High technology is also Israel's most productive sector. It employs about 12% of the workforce, and it accounts for 18% of gross domestic product and half of the country's exports, according to the Israel Innovation Authority, a government agency that supports the sector's development. Tens of thousands of Israeli tech workers like Raz are also reservists who have been called up since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, which means tech has faced a major labor shortage in recent months. The firms hold the reservists' jobs open, waiting for their return. At the beginning of the war, the Israeli army said it was mobilizing 360,000 reservists — more than it has for any previous war this century. The Bank of Israel estimates the economy shrank by 2% in the final three months of 2023, and it expects the war to cost about $58 billion. ""While it's common to talk about the international pressure that's increasing on Israel to reach a cease-fire,"" says Dan Ben-David, who teaches economics at Tel Aviv University, ""there is also going to be increasing internal pressure by people who need to work.""

Tamir Kalifa for NPR The war has spooked some foreign investors Rami Ben Efraim, a retired air force general and tech firm owner, has felt the labor pinch, though he says his business remains resilient. More than half the workers at Planet Nine, one of his tech companies, are reservists. That includes the firm's chief operating officer, who flies an F-16, leading a group on bombing missions and close air support. Ben Efraim says when the war started, his message to his chief operating officer was simple: ""Just go to the air force. ... I'll call you once a week. I'll tell you what is happening here. You don't have any tasks."" Enlarge this image Rami Ben Efraim, a retired Air Force general, has felt the war's labor pinch at his tech company, Planet Nine, in Tel Aviv.

Frank Langfitt/NPR Another of Ben Efraim's employees serves in a cyber unit, splitting his seven-day workweek between the company and the military, including night shifts. ""I'm just trying to make sure that they're not exhausted,"" Ben Efraim says. ""I'm telling them ... the military is more important than us right now. If you have some extra time, please come and help us here."" Ben Efraim's company has had to push back some projects, but his firm focuses on applied R&D projects in cyber and artificial intelligence, so demand remains robust regardless of the war. Tech companies have managed the labor shortage by hiring new employees and subcontracting some work to other firms at home and abroad. Things are much harder for newer companies. The war has spooked some foreign investors, and hundreds of early-stage startups have not been able to access the investment they need to keep operating. Dror Bin, who runs the Israel Innovation Authority, says it is offering a total of $100 million in funding to help keep them afloat as part of a new government program started after Oct. 7. ""If the company is successful, they will pay us back the loan as a royalty from their revenues,"" he says. ""If they fail, the money is gone."" Even before the war, Israeli politics also made investors wary The war is just the latest drag on tech investment. Last January, the government launched plans to reform the country's judiciary, which many Israelis saw as an attempt to undermine democracy. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets. Foreign investors worried about the country's rule of law. ""Founders that started companies were told by their investors that they should form the companies outside of Israel, because if Israel has no independent court system, then you want the companies to be incorporated elsewhere,"" says Gigi Levy-Weiss, a leading tech venture capitalist based in Tel Aviv. Enlarge this image Gigi Levy-Weiss is a venture capitalist and household name in Israel. He says the government's judicial reform legislation, which many in Israel see as undemocratic, hurt the country's tech sector. ""If the courts are not going to be independent here, do you think that Intel is going to continue investing billions in Israel?"" Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption toggle caption Ayman Oghanna for NPR Gigi Levy-Weiss is a venture capitalist and household name in Israel.

Ayman Oghanna for NPR Instead of launching 1,300 or 1,400 new companies annually, as it typically does, Israel's tech sector formed only about 400 last year, Levy-Weiss says. He adds that this is about the same number per year as Israel's tech sector produced two decades ago. In the wake of the Oct. 7 attack, which Israel says killed more than 1,200 people, and the subsequent war in Gaza, where Israel's offensive has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, the Israeli government says it has shelved its judicial reform plans — for now. Tech leaders are bullish on the sector's resilience and say bursts of innovation tend to follow wars here, but Levy-Weiss still has concerns. ""I worry that unless we create full certainty, many investors that loved investing in Israel are going to say, 'I need to see for a second what's happening,'"" Levy-Weiss says. ""'I need to see that the war is really over. I need to see that there's a solution for Gaza. I need to see that there isn't a [judicial] reform anymore.'"" As for Raz, the software engineer, the army released him from reserve duty this month. He's moving to Southeast Asia and is excited about a new job as a project manager. He'll still be with an Israeli company but now back to working full time. Eve Guterman contributed to this report in Tel Aviv, Israel. Israel high tech Israel-Gaza war Facebook Flipboard Email"

Amazon is reportedly cutting 5 per cent staff at Audible, in addition to the thousands of people from Prime Video, Twitch, MGM etc Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google Yet another Amazon is reportedly cutting 5 per cent of its workforce at Audible, the audiobook and podcast division, according to a memo from the division’s CEO, Bob Carrigan, cited by Business Insider on Thursday. This news follows Amazon’s recent announcement of layoffs in its streaming and studio business, as part of a broader trend of major job cuts within the tech industry extending into 2024. In the memo, Carrigan stated, “I want you to know that we’re making these decisions to strengthen our business for the long term.” This downsizing at Amazon coincides with similar moves by other tech giants. On Wednesday, Google-parent Alphabet also disclosed plans to lay off hundreds of employees across various teams. The ongoing job cuts in the tech industry occur as major players like Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms allocate significant investments into generative artificial intelligence, inspired by the success of projects such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Amazon faced significant job reductions last year, cutting over 27,000 positions in response to a broader wave of layoffs across the US tech sector. These cutbacks followed a period of intense hiring during the pandemic. As the tech industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing market dynamics, companies are making strategic decisions to optimize their operations and maintain long-term competitiveness.

It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. The UK is well placed to remain a major global player in the tech sector because of its reputation as a good regulator, the country’s tech envoy to the US has said. Joe White said the UK’s international reputation as “sensible” and “reasonable” had also helped the Government organise last year’s AI Safety Summit, where the Prime Minister looked to place the UK at the heart of the global discussion on the emerging technology. Speaking during the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, Mr White said the perception of the UK among US tech giants was that it was an “incredibly important market, both in terms of economic size, but also in terms of, frankly, its regulatory freedom”. “This is characterising, but often the US is seen as quite light on regulation, the EU is often seen as overly heavy and the UK therefore is seen as somewhere that is going to regulate, but in a way that you could actually have reasonable conversations with,” he told the PA news agency. He added that many US tech giants felt that if they were to engage with regulators on an issue, where regulation in that country could create a roadmap for a wider global rollout of similar laws, “the UK is a great place to do that with”. Mr White said this reputation meant that as emerging technologies, most notably AI, come under increased scrutiny, the UK was in a strong position to shape global policy and place itself at the forefront of the conversation. During the CES tech show, artificial intelligence integration has been come of the most common themes among the major product announcements from industry heavyweights and smaller start-ups. “The opportunity for the UK is to be the sensible, flexible cornerstone of choice for some of these new landscapes and we did that well with AI, we need to carry on building with that, and the companies certainly do recognise that,” Mr White said. At the AI Safety Summit in the November, major tech and AI firms agreed to work with newly created AI safety institutes – the first of which is in the UK – to assess and monitor new AI models before they are released to the public. Mr White added that the Government’s AI White Paper – published in early 2023 – also enhanced the UK’s reputation in Silicon Valley and “gave us credibility” to organise the AI Safety Summit. The White Paper proposed asking existing regulators to take on the role of AI regulator in their area of expertise, rather than create a single new AI regulator working across all sectors. Mr White said this was seen as “sensible” among tech firms in the UK and as a result meant it was “not a hard sell” to get companies to engage with the UK on AI safety discussions. The tech envoy said he believed the UK was therefore in a position to maintain its prominent role in AI and the wider tech sector, helped by the country’s established history of innovation and research. “The UK has the strongest tech sector in Europe – it’s the only trillion dollar tech sector outside of the US and China,” he added.

Speaking during the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, Mr White said the perception of the UK among US tech giants was that it was an “incredibly important market, both in terms of economic size, but also in terms of, frankly, its regulatory freedom”. “This is characterising, but often the US is seen as quite light on regulation, the EU is often seen as overly heavy and the UK therefore is seen as somewhere that is going to regulate, but in a way that you could actually have reasonable conversations with,” he told the PA news agency. He added that many US tech giants felt that if they were to engage with regulators on an issue, where regulation in that country could create a roadmap for a wider global rollout of similar laws, “the UK is a great place to do that with”. Mr White said this reputation meant that as emerging technologies, most notably AI, come under increased scrutiny, the UK was in a strong position to shape global policy and place itself at the forefront of the conversation. During the CES tech show, artificial intelligence integration has been come of the most common themes among the major product announcements from industry heavyweights and smaller start-ups. “The opportunity for the UK is to be the sensible, flexible cornerstone of choice for some of these new landscapes and we did that well with AI, we need to carry on building with that, and the companies certainly do recognise that,” Mr White said. At the AI Safety Summit in the November, major tech and AI firms agreed to work with newly created AI safety institutes – the first of which is in the UK – to assess and monitor new AI models before they are released to the public. Mr White added that the Government’s AI White Paper – published in early 2023 – also enhanced the UK’s reputation in Silicon Valley and “gave us credibility” to organise the AI Safety Summit. The White Paper proposed asking existing regulators to take on the role of AI regulator in their area of expertise, rather than create a single new AI regulator working across all sectors. Mr White said this was seen as “sensible” among tech firms in the UK and as a result meant it was “not a hard sell” to get companies to engage with the UK on AI safety discussions. The tech envoy said he believed the UK was therefore in a position to maintain its prominent role in AI and the wider tech sector, helped by the country’s established history of innovation and research. “The UK has the strongest tech sector in Europe – it’s the only trillion dollar tech sector outside of the US and China,” he added.

But this isn’t 2023 anymore. The early winners of the previous year are facing a stark reversal, with tech stocks tumbling from the market’s grace. This shift in sentiment is a wake-up call to the risks of excessive valuations and the tech sector’s vulnerability in a changing economic environment. The tech sector’s descent is emblematic of a broader market recalibration. In previous years, the promise of innovation led to a meteoric rise in tech valuations. Investors were eager to back the next big breakthrough. But consider now that the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLK ) has a forecast price-to-earnings ratio of 26x according to YCharts. That’s not exactly cheap. And as 2024 unfolds, the landscape is beginning to look markedly different. The reality of economic tightening, the delayed impacts of rising interest rates, and a potential resurgence of inflationary pressures are eroding the easy path to a “soft landing” that many investors had hoped for. Large-cap technology stocks, which have been the main drivers of the market’s growth, are now at the forefront of its challenges. These companies face a confluence of headwinds including regulatory scrutiny, a potential slowdown in consumer spending, and a shift in investor preference toward value and cyclical stocks. These factors are compounded by the need to continuously invest heavily in innovation to stay relevant, which becomes increasingly difficult in a cost-conscious environment. What Does the Downturn in Magnificent 7 Stocks Mean? The tech downturn has implications that can ripple across the entire market. As tech stocks have grown to comprise a significant portion of major indices, their decline drags down the broader market. Additionally, the tech sector’s downturn can dampen consumer and business sentiment, given its role in driving modern efficiencies and advancements. A prolonged slump in tech could signal a broader economic slowdown, which is a concern for investors and policymakers alike. The Bottom Line The tech sector’s reversal of fortune in 2024 may end up serving as a cautionary tale of the cyclical nature of markets and the perils of overvaluation. Investors are now forced to grapple with a new reality where the easy gains of the past are replaced with the prospect of a more challenging and nuanced investment landscape. While the tech sector may struggle to regain its former glory in the short term, the fundamentals of innovation and progress remain. The companies that can adapt, manage costs, and continue to innovate may well emerge stronger and ready to lead the next market upturn. For now, both investors and tech companies must navigate this new terrain with a blend of caution and a forward-looking strategy to weather the storm of 2024’s challenging market dynamics.

Historically, the tech industry has been male-dominated, resulting in women being underrepresented in both the workforce and leadership positions. Speaking to The Express Tribune, SI Global Solutions CEO Noman Said highlighted, “To foster increased women’s participation in the tech industry, we must institute targeted mentorship programmes, advocate for inclusive educational policies, and cultivate a supportive ecosystem that dismantles gender barriers, ensuring equal opportunities for all aspiring professionals. There are just a few examples of many women who have made a significant impact in the tech industry. Their work and achievements serve as inspiration for future generations. Increased gender diversity at the corporate level has led to things like increased skill diversity in upper management and less gender discrimination throughout the firm, which has improved the ability to recruit top talent.” Troy Group of Companies CEO Yasmin Dadabhoy stressed the need to create Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics scholarships, mentorship programmes, and networking events to promote women’s participation in Pakistan’s tech industry. She highlighted the importance of diversity policies in companies to ensure equal opportunities. “We must also showcase female role models and advocate for flexible work arrangements,” she said, emphasising that mentorship programmes at all levels of education are the most effective way to boost confidence in young women or fresh graduates for startups. “The total percentage of women entrepreneurs in Pakistan is 1%. Of this value, less than 20% are engaged in the IT sector. To quote the old adage, ‘seeing is believing.’ The women of this country need to see their role models thriving in the corporate workplace as entrepreneurs and business leaders. Another important factor to consider is the resources we need to provide women-led start-ups to enable them to actually conceive and execute their ideas into tangible companies,” she added. Read Alvi for women’s economic empowerment Dadabhoy highlighted the challenges faced by women in the IT sector, including gender bias, funding issues (venture capitalist), leadership representation, work-life balance, and networking hurdles, as the difficulty in establishing connections within a predominantly male industry affects collaboration and business growth. Alpha Beta Core (ABC) Analyst Sarwat Khan noted that the tech industry in Pakistan has predominantly favoured males, with limited women’s involvement in STEM fields at the college and graduate levels. To rectify this, efforts should be initiated early on to encourage girls to pursue tech-related fields and dismantle societal stereotypes. Initiatives like “She Loves Tech” and “Women in Tech” programmes in Pakistan are moving in the right direction, promoting female inclusion in the startup ecosystem. Success stories, such as Sehat Kahani, an all-female-led Pakistani company that recently secured $2.7 million in a Series-A funding round, and other women-led tech startups like BusCaro, EduFi, and BizBi making strides with recent funding, attest to this positive trajectory, she said. However, women-owned businesses still remain in the minority in Pakistan, facing challenges such as defying social expectations, limited access to funding, and a lack of support networks. Empowering women requires ensuring equal opportunities and addressing unconscious bias to create an inclusive and supportive environment, she said.

Supplied. Short Url https://arab.news/6hfty Updated 09 January 2024 Arab News January 08, 2024 16:40 Follow Saudi health tech firm Clinicy secures Series A funding round Updated 09 January 2024 Arab News January 08, 2024 16:40 Follow RIYADH: Saudi health tech startup Clinicy has secured substantial investment in a seven-figure Series A funding round, led by Middle East Venture Partners and structured by Gate Capital. The exact amount remains undisclosed. However, the deal, with the participation of additional investors, is noted as one of the largest in the history of the Kingdom’s health tech sector, as per the company’s press release. Established in 2017 by Prince Mohammed Al-Faisal, Abdullah Al-Obaid, and Saud Al-Obaid, Clinicy is a Saudi-based tech startup specializing in digital solutions for medical institution management. Speaking about the impact of this funding, Al-Faisal said: “Clinicy is already making a real, tangible impact on redefining healthcare in Saudi Arabia, enhancing digital experiences for one million patients across the Kingdom.” He added that the latest investment “underpins our vision to deepen the quality of engagement with medical institutions and patients, ensuring that our technology makes healthcare more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly.” The newly acquired capital will be utilized to further Clinicy’s expansion plans across the Saudi market, which is valued at SR7.2 billion ($1.9 billion), according to the press note. Clinicy’s services aim to address critical issues in the healthcare sector, such as high patient “no-show” rates and administrative inefficiencies, which, the release added, cost over SR3 billion annually. The company claims that its solutions have led to a 75 percent reduction in missed appointments among its clients. “Clinicy is proud to support the nation’s digital growth and align with Vision 2030 to improve accessibility to healthcare by prioritizing innovation and financial stability. We are proud to receive the prestigious backing of Middle East Venture Partners, Gate Capital, Kafou Group, and Fadeed Investment, and look forward to accelerating the future of healthcare across the Kingdom and region,” Al-Faisal said. Walid Mansour, co-CEO at MEVP, commented on the growth of Saudi Arabia’s health tech sector, attributing it to the digitally-savvy population and the continuous improvement of government standards. Munther Hilal, CEO at Gate Capital, also expressed enthusiasm about Clinicy’s role in driving digital transformation in the industry. “This investment marks our first foray into the Saudi market, following the recent establishment of our Riyadh offices.

The ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey is based on feedback from 420 employers across Ireland. It asked whether employers intend to hire additional workers or reduce the size of their workforce from January to March. Used internationally as a bellwether of labour market trends, the net employment outlook – calculated by subtracting the percentage of employers who anticipate reductions to staffing levels from those who plan to hire – now stands at 21 per cent. The outlook has weakened by 10 percentage points since the previous quarter and by two points when compared with the same time last year. This indicates weaker hiring sentiment tracking back towards average ranges for the past three years.

Valeo’s Irish unit an obvious sale target after overseas deals splurge The survey shows hiring optimism in the tech sector has declined from 55 per cent two years ago to -8 per cent. This was in response to slower-than-expected growth and companies preparing for continued business stagnation. Despite the reduced hiring expectations, the survey also reveals that 90 per cent of businesses in the IT sector are having difficulty finding candidates with the skills they need for the jobs they are advertising despite recent redundancies. This is up 11 percentage points year on year. Across all sectors, IT and data skills are hardest to find – especially in the IT sector – with 69 per cent of tech companies struggling to source candidates with the IT and data competencies they require. Housing in 2024: ‘several more years before we see the quantity of houses we need’ Listen | 31:21 “Ireland’s tech sector has entered a period of contraction following a period of significant over-hiring,” said John Galvin, managing director of ManpowerGroup Ireland. “Tech companies, especially multinational software companies, have had to respond to slower-than-expected growth and reducing global demand. “Most of these redundancies have been mid-level business support roles like HR and customer experience, hired in anticipation of massive growth which did not materialise in 2023.” The tech sector downturn is most pronounced in Dublin, where IT employers report a net employment outlook of -20 per cent, down from +53 per cent two years ago. However, 88 per cent of IT businesses in Dublin city report difficulty finding the skills they need in candidates, while 35 per cent of employers report IT and data skills are the most difficult to find. “We continue to see vacancies for specialist, high-skilled tech roles like cloud architects, cybersecurity specialists, developers and data engineers, where employers are still looking to fill vacancies despite the wider downturn,” said Mr Galvin. “This talent shortage is being driven by demand for specialist skills rising faster than the economy can supply, but we know those with more generalist skills are encountering a much tighter labour market. “Companies are also turning to more contracting and interim hiring strategies to compensate for permanent candidate shortages in the short term, but employers have to introduce and utilise upskilling programmes for tech candidates in the new year if they plan to overcome this talent shortage.” The communication services and transport, logistics and automotive sectors report a net employment outlook of +48 per cent, with the fast-growing healthcare and life sciences sector following at +40 per cent. However, each of these sectors report facing record skills gaps, making optimistic hiring intentions difficult to turn into filled vacancies.

Microsoft Corp ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) View Price & Profile Microsoft taking the clear lead in the AI arms race - analyst Published: 06:10 02 Jan 2024 EST 2024 is the year of the dragon in the Chinese Zodiac. Similarly, there’s a fire inside the technology sector in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and its flames are growing ever larger. Such is the importance of AI in the tech sector that it will be the key to tech stock growth and overall demand in the year ahead, according to a recent enterprise survey conducted by Wedbush. According to the poll, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) “is taking the clear lead in the AI arms race” given its close association with ChatGPT developer OpenAI . Microsoft’s exclusive integration of ChatGPT into its suite of products is now well underway and “the company has a significant AI monetisation opportunity” within its Azure cloud-computing service, said Wedbush. Though Microsoft is a frontrunner in the AI revolution, Wedbush analysts believe the tech sector as a whole stands to benefit from the burgeoning field of innovation. The analysts said: “In our opinion, the new tech bull market has now begun and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 led by Big Tech, software, and the overall chip sector as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector. “We believe now the rest of the tech sector joins the Magnificent 7 party in this rally into 2024 with AI tailwinds abound.” Among the Magnificent 7 stocks, Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) was also viewed by survey participants as a major generative AI player as it further improves its core technology platform. Wedbush also predicted a “tidal wave” of mergers and acquisitions in the software and microchip sectors. Outside of the Magnificent 7, Wedbush cited Palo Alto, Palantir, Zscaler, CyberArk, Crowdstrike and MongoDB as major AI beneficiaries in the year ahead. Continue reading"

Microsoft Corp ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) View Price & Profile Microsoft taking the clear lead in the AI arms race - analyst Published: 11:10 02 Jan 2024 GMT 2024 is the year of the dragon in the Chinese Zodiac. Similarly, there’s a fire inside the technology sector in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and its flames are growing ever larger. Such is the importance of AI in the tech sector that it will be the key to tech stock growth and overall demand in the year ahead, according to a recent enterprise survey conducted by Wedbush. According to the poll, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) “is taking the clear lead in the AI arms race” given its close association with ChatGPT developer OpenAI .

https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/01/climate-tech-job-market-2024/,,Climate tech might be the hot job market in 2024,20240101T174500Z,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1089895298.jpg,techcrunch.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"One of the major stories that defined the tech sector in 2023 was layoffs . Companies large and small shed over 240,000 jobs in the last year, and while the trend has cooled of late, it hasn’t stopped, with nearly 7,000 jobs cut in November alone. But there have been bright spots. Climate tech is one sector that has been hiring , and 2024 looks like it will be continuing the trend. Clean energy jobs have grown 10% in the past two years, outpacing the economy as a whole, according to a report by industry group E2 . Through 2032, when the Inflation Reduction Act is set to expire, the fastest-growing job fields include wind turbine technician (45% growth) and solar photovoltaic installer (22% growth), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . For startups, 2023 was more muddled. As investors closed their pocketbooks, founders had to make hard choices about how to extend their runways. Some had to resort to layoffs, but not everyone. Many founders I’ve spoken with continue to emphasize that they’re hiring for a variety of roles. Deal Dive: Training the workforce for the clean energy transition For those laid off from the general tech sector, climate tech would appear to be an appealing pivot, and for many, that’s proving to be true. Nearly every company needs software developers, project managers and designers. Is there a need for 240,000 of them? Probably not yet. And some that look like a close fit might require a bit of climate or energy knowledge on the part of the applicant.

The economy of the last century-plus has been oriented around burning fossil fuels; the economy of the 21st century won’t be. Even if you have skills that port from the old to the new — like oil rig operators switching to geothermal — there’s some amount of relearning that has to take place. That, coupled with the fact that expats from the general tech world have been increasingly interested in climate tech jobs, has fueled the growth of a very particular type of business: climate tech job career sites. Several have popped up in recent years, including Terra.do , Climatebase , MCJ Collective (which is also a venture capital firm), and Climate Draft . To varying degrees, these sites offer not just job postings, but also networking events, educational resources, even training cohorts that help job seekers recognize how their skills fit into the climate tech world while teaching them new ones. As if to underline the importance of these companies to the climate tech sector, venture capital firm Lowercarbon bought Climate Draft in September. In the past few years, climate tech jobs have skewed toward those needed by early-stage startups. In the coming years, as they move toward commercialization, they’ll be hiring for a broader range of roles — and more of them. It won’t just be scientists and engineers, but sales, service and support staff, too. Tech jobs are just a fraction of what’ll be needed, of course. There will be a need for wind turbine technicians and solar installers, as the BLS helpfully points out, but also geothermal borehole drillers, hydrogen plant operators, EV charger technicians, battery recyclers and heat pump installers . The move toward climate-friendly jobs has been in the works for years, as E2’s data shows. Simple economics have been pushing things in that direction, driven mostly by the falling costs of solar, wind and batteries, and the labor market has been responding. But as new government policies fall into place, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in the U.S. and the Green Deal in the EU, the job market in climate tech is certain to get even hotter. Between those three alone, the U.S. and the EU are investing over $800 billion in climate and environment initiatives, a figure that is likely to be conservative when the final tally is complete. It’s a gusher of money that has taken a while to uncork, but as it starts to flow in earnest, the demand for labor will only increase. Where the money goes, so do the jobs."
