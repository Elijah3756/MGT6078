Despite the potential risks of lengthy litigation and financial and operational issues, assets facing bankruptcy proceedings are much cheaper in a market where hospital properties command premium valuations — an enterprise value (EV) of more than 25 times the Ebitda on an average. The average valuation of listed hospitals is around 27 times. There have been several such deals in the past year and a half where strategic investors have acquired stressed assets. In mid-December, the bankruptcy court in Mumbai approved Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Ltd’s Rs 202 crore bid to acquire Karkinos Healthcare Ltd under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Karkinos is building a 150-bed multispecialty cancer hospital in Imphal, Manipur. Reliance Industries Ltd owns Reliance Strategic Business Ventures. In October, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal closed the insolvency proceedings against Jaypee Healthcare Ltd after hospital chain Max Healthcare settled the dues of financial creditors by paying Rs 1,035.29 crore. Live Events In August, Nishkala Healthcare announced the acquisition of Suash Health Care Foundation, which runs a 400-bed multi-speciality hospital in Navi Mumbai, for Rs 189 crore through an insolvency resolution process. Large healthcare chains such as Narayana Healthcare too had shown interest in Suash Health. “We are seeing an increasing interest from some of our clients to acquire functioning hospitals, diagnostic firms or other ancillary healthcare firms through the insolvency resolution process,” said Nishith Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP & Legal. “In a post-pandemic era, people have realised the importance of healthcare and further penetration of mediclaim and insurance have drawn investors’ interest in the sector.” In July, Chennai-based MGM Healthcare acquired 300-bed SevenHills Hospital in Visakhapatnam for over Rs 170 crore. Investors and strategic buyers are also closely observing the resolution process of SevenHills Healthcare Pvt Ltd's 1,500-bed Mumbai hospital as well as that of Mumbai-based Four Care Hospital Pvt Ltd and Uttung Health & Wellness Pvt Ltd. “The clean slate theory (the acquirer doesn’t have to worry about previous claims) and promising returns of the healthcare industry are attractions for the desired,” said Nipun Singhvi, managing partner of law firm NSA Legal. “Further, a large number of schemes launched by the government have also given impetus for buying in this sector.” ""We have M&A teams that closely look at each and every hospital asset, including those under IBC,"" said an executive at a large South Indian hospital chain. The executive, who didn't want to be named, said the assets under IBC could be turned around through infusion of capital, branding and operational efficiencies of a large hospital chain. On the flipside, not all assets under the IBC come cheap. Max has agreed to acquire Jaypee Healthcare at an enterprise valuation of Rs 1,660 crore which was 24 times of Ebitda. ""We stay away from auction processes. Auctions can lead to what is called the winner's curse. You may end up paying a valuation which is not justified,"" said Abhishek Kabra, chairman, Marengo Asia Healthcare and Partner, Samara Capital. ""Our model is very clear, we look for existing hospitals in good locations, doing good clinical work but not running to full potential,"" he added. Marengo Asia is a hospital platform built on a string of acquisitions. The healthcare sector, particularly hospitals, witnessed major expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, after the situation eased, it became difficult for many standalone hospitals to sustain their businesses. Now, such hospitals are seeing interest from two sets of bidders — those already in the industry and seeking to expand and those who want to turn around such entities before they sell to someone else. Last year, the bankruptcy court’s Chennai bench approved ASG Hospital’s Rs 520 crore revival plan for debt-laden Vasan Eye Care, a chain of eye care hospitals across the South. Vasan's other suitors included MGM Healthcare, Maxivision Eye Hospital and Dr Agarwal's Health Care. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Experts emphasized AI's potential to simplify health communication, empower patients, and ensure accessibility. However, they stressed the need for balancing technology with human empathy for compassionate, patient-centred care. ET Online Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising everything from patient care to health communication and AIIMS, Delhi, is investing over Rs 300 crore in digital infrastructure to ensure that every stakeholder -- patients, doctors, and researchers -- benefits from this innovation, the premier institute's director Dr M Srinivas said. ""By integrating AI, we can improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enable world class research,"" he said at a recently held event at AIIMS here. Dr Srinivas also emphasised that leveraging AI to simplify and disseminate health information will empower patients and improve their engagement with healthcare systems, ultimately leading to better health outcomes. At the event, leaders in healthcare, technology, and policy shared insights into how AI is poised to bridge critical gaps in health communication, making information more accessible, reliable, and patient-centric. Dr Kavita Narayan, senior technical advisor, HRH for Health Systems at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said that a good health system is one that isn't reliant on individuals. ""AI can play a vital role in making healthcare more accurate, compassionate, and equitable. To truly make a difference, we must integrate technology thoughtfully and ensure collaboration between policymakers, technologists, and healthcare providers,"" Dr Narayan said. A standout example of AI's application in healthcare communication is Humeta, a custom-trained AI model introduced by Mr Daleep Singh Manhas, cofounder and CEO of Healthpresso. Speaking about its potential, he explained, ""Healthcare is a sensitive field where credibility is paramount. Humeta is trained on over a million data points from trusted medical sources like The Lancet and PubMed, ensuring that the information it generates is both accurate and up-to-date."" Manhas further elaborated on how Humeta tackles the challenge of accessibility. He said 63 % of people find it difficult to understand medical content. ""With Humeta, we simplify complex medical concepts into digestible and credible formats -- text, visuals, and interactive tools -- ensuring that patients are empowered with reliable information they can trust,"" he said. By combining accuracy, real-time data retrieval, and compliance with global healthcare standards, AI tools like Humeta are paving the way for a more inclusive and informed healthcare ecosystem. Although AI offers unprecedented potential, experts caution against overdependence on technology at the expense of human connection. Dr KP Kochhar, Head of the Physiology Department at AIIMS, stressed the importance of balancing innovation with empathy in healthcare. She remarked, ""While AI can enhance precision and efficiency, we must preserve the human touch in healthcare. Compassion and technology must work together to create systems that prioritise the well-being of patients."" The insights shared by experts at AIIMS underscored the emerging and pivotal role of AI in transforming health communication. By addressing long-standing challenges in accessibility and trust, AI promises to empower patients with knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions about their health. The discussions culminated in a collective call to action for responsible and ethical integration of AI in healthcare systems, urging policymakers, technologists, and healthcare providers to collaborate in leveraging AI for the greater good. As AI continues to evolve, experts agree that its thoughtful application has the potential to create a future where healthcare communication is more inclusive, reliable, and patient-centric. By bridging gaps in health awareness and patient education, AI is shaping a more informed and healthier society. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

http://www.econotimes.com/What-steps-will-Donald-Trump-take-to-address-healthcare-infrastructure-challenges-1698155,,What steps will Donald Trump take to address healthcare infrastructure challenges ? ,20241231T034500Z,https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/12/3tetowlxmy.jpg,econotimes.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"Donald Trump’s return to the White House has reignited intense discussions about the future of healthcare in the United States. As part of his second-term agenda, Trump has pledged to address significant challenges within the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. While his proposals aim to modernize healthcare facilities and expand access, critics remain skeptical about their feasibility and impact. Trump’s Vision for Healthcare Modernization Trump has positioned healthcare reform as a cornerstone of his administration’s second-term priorities. His plans reportedly include a substantial increase in federal funding to upgrade aging hospitals, expand telehealth services, and strengthen rural healthcare networks. Additionally, Trump’s team has indicated that partnerships with private companies will play a critical role in accelerating innovation and improving healthcare delivery. One of the key proposals involves allocating resources to repair and modernize existing facilities, particularly in underserved areas. Advocates for the plan argue that this focus could significantly improve outcomes for millions of Americans. “Healthcare infrastructure is long overdue for a transformation,” said Dr. Linda Matthews, a healthcare policy expert. “If these initiatives are executed properly, they could bridge longstanding gaps in access and quality.” However, critics have expressed concerns over funding sources and the potential redirection of resources from other vital programs. “Infrastructure improvements sound great on paper, but the details of execution will determine their success,” said Matthews. Mixed Reactions from Public and Experts Reactions to Trump’s healthcare initiatives have been mixed, with some expressing optimism and others cautioning against potential pitfalls. Public debates online have further amplified the divide. User @HealthcareHero tweeted, “If Trump delivers on healthcare infrastructure, it could transform rural communities. This is exactly what we need right now!” Another commenter, @PolicyCritic, countered, “Bold promises, but where’s the money coming from? We’ve seen grand plans fall apart before.” Others focused on the potential benefits for telehealth services. “Telehealth expansion is critical. Rural America needs these advancements yesterday,” wrote @RuralHealthAdvocate. Meanwhile, @SystemicFix pointed out, “Infrastructure isn’t the only problem. Without addressing affordability, these changes won’t help the people who need it most.” Veterans’ healthcare also emerged as a hot topic. “Our VA hospitals are in desperate need of upgrades. This could be Trump’s chance to truly support our veterans,” tweeted @VetCareChampion. Conversely, @HealthRealist questioned, “Will veterans really see change, or is this another hollow promise? Action speaks louder than words.” Challenges on the Horizon Despite the ambitious scope of Trump’s healthcare agenda, significant hurdles remain. Securing bipartisan support in Congress could prove difficult, particularly given concerns about funding and implementation. Furthermore, experts have highlighted the complexity of addressing systemic issues, such as workforce shortages and inequities in healthcare access. The success of these initiatives will ultimately depend on effective collaboration between federal, state, and private stakeholders. As details of Trump’s healthcare policies continue to unfold, the nation remains divided on whether these proposals will meet the country’s pressing needs."

Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy Expands Women's Physiotherapy Services Get the latest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . The new services offered by Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy are set to advance women's wellness and address pelvic health needs. Advertisement Wynnum. Australia, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pelvic floor prolapses, pelvic pain syndrome, endometriosis, and urinary incontinence were once almost treated as taboo subjects. Many women suffered in silence or, worse, were ignorant of any treatment options available. The increase in awareness of pelvic health needs has led women to physiotherapists who specialise in these health conditions, such as the women's health physiotherapists at Advantage Healthcare and Physiotherapy. With the increase in demand for skilled women's health physiotherapists, the leading women's wellness centre has decided to take on additional women's health physiotherapists. Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy Advertisement Anna Oh, one of the specialists at Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy , began her career as a general physiotherapist but found her passion in addressing women's health issues. Inspired by the profound impact physiotherapy could have on women's lives, Anna transitioned into the field of women's health physiotherapy, dedicating her practice to improving her patients' well-being. Anna works alongside Eleni Cody, a highly experienced pelvic floor physiotherapist who specializes in tailoring treatments to meet individual needs. Together, they assist patients with a range of concerns, including fitting and managing pessaries for pelvic support, retraining overactive or underactive bladders, strengthening pelvic floor muscles, and treating urinary incontinence. With a team of expert physiotherapists, the clinic is committed to providing compassionate, effective care that empowers patients to regain control and confidence in their daily lives. Pelvic floor exercises are widely recommended as the first line of treatment for urinary incontinence, often proving effective before more intensive measures like medication or surgery are needed. After childbirth or with aging, many women mistakenly accept a little leakage when laughing or coughing as a normal part of life. As a result, they often rely on pads to manage these leaks, even though such measures may be unnecessary. While it may be a little embarrassing to seek help, many cases can be improved after a few sessions and a little direction from Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy. By adopting certain habits and performing targeted exercises, women can achieve transformative, life-changing results. Advertisement Those receiving physio during pregnancy or postpartum (post-childbirth) often benefit from another of Advantage Healthcare's specialised services: paediatric physiotherapy. This relatively new offering was introduced a few years ago when two physiotherapists expressed a keen interest in helping children reach their full potential. Advantage's Paediatric Physiotherapists address conditions like developmental delays, toe walking, and general clumsiness, which can sometimes leave children lagging behind their peers in school or social activities. These challenges may lead to social isolation, difficulty keeping up with schoolwork, or exclusion from games and sports. However, the dedicated pediatric physiotherapists at Advantage Healthcare, Amie Rice Mooyman and Jenny Kim, have witnessed remarkable improvements in the children they treat. Many young patients achieve milestones their parents once thought unattainable. Advantage Physiotherapy also works with children facing more complex challenges, including cystic fibrosis, head trauma, or other conditions such as autism. Advertisement ""Helping children with disabilities is a fulfilling job,” said Jenny. ""Helping make a difference in their lives and seeing the joy on their faces when they achieve what they previously couldn't is amazing.” Learn more about Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy by visiting their website at https://advantagehealth.net.au/ .

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Dec 30, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save Virgil Bretz is co-founder and CEO of MacroHealth , a healthcare fintech platform. getty Your mission (should you choose to accept): Create a detailed budget for you and 10 of your closest friends for all the food you will collectively consume over the next year. How much will this cost? Which sellers will you buy food from? How do you estimate the needs of each person? This seems like a tough mission. Fortunately, you have something to make your task easier. You have magically gathered your friends’ detailed grocery, restaurant, DoorDash and other food-related receipts from the past two years and compiled them into a tidy database. Using this data, you could analyze their purchasing habits and create a budget for the year to come. Now imagine scaling this concept to the $4.5 trillion U.S. healthcare marketplace . That sounds like an impossible mission. This would be quite possible if you had access to healthcare purchasing data similar to the detailed grocery receipts in our analogy. Fortunately, there is an abundance of this exact type of data throughout healthcare, but it is not systematically organized or delivered where it is needed to support market efficiency. This data, properly leveraged, opens opportunities for massive cost savings, innovation and better care outcomes. Leveraging Marketplace Strategies In Healthcare We often treat healthcare services differently than other industries, assuming healthcare is too important for normal market mechanisms that efficiently balance supply and demand. In certain cases, this might be true, such as the rules ensuring that adequate emergency services are available close to wherever people live, without regard to the ability to pay . However, considering our food analogy, access to nutrition is at least as important to life and health in our society as healthcare. While we rightly provide targeted social support for access to food, the marketplace for food is predominantly structured as a free market, with market-based demand and supply mechanisms such as the ability to compare prices and easy access to product availability information. In the food industry, detailed market transaction data is employed to inform suppliers what to sell, stock and distribute. Further up the supply chain, market data guides what to produce and grow. Extensive data is provided to buyers, whether they are individual consumers or bulk buyers like restaurants or stores, in the form of granular availability, price and quality data. This helps buyers create their purchasing strategies. At more than three times the size of the food industry and representing more than 17% of the U.S. economy , we need every successful tool and strategy possible to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. This includes leaning harder into adopting free market practices that help other industries more effectively balance supply and demand. Healthcare Markets' Need For Market Data These market principles can apply in healthcare. With a shift to market-based thinking, consumers can evolve from ""I need to go to a doctor"" to “I need to make a critical, informed purchase of healthcare."" A claims manager at a health insurance company can elevate from “reactively paying millions of dollars in medical claims” to “intelligently purchasing millions of dollars of healthcare services.” In these examples of healthcare marketplace decision making, these buyers need to optimize their decisions for access, cost and quality. This information needs to be accurate, timely and understandable at the moment of their decision. Ubiquitous Healthcare Data, Everywhere The healthcare market data we need is everywhere, all around us. But it reminds me of the line "" Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink ."" We can start with the healthcare bills we receive as consumers—all the bills from medical providers, all the ""explanations of benefits"" (which confuse more than explain) from our insurers. Billions of these documents are created every year. For the health market professionals working at America’s provider and insurer organizations, this data is pervasive, almost unavoidable. But exposing and organizing this information to use at the points of decision making has been difficult so far. Barriers To Health Market Data Hoarding: Quality, access and especially price information has been carefully guarded by healthcare payers and providers for decades. The price of a medical treatment is typically unknown until well after a treatment has been completed, and the patient has guaranteed they will be responsible for the unknown charges. Generally, health market information has only been provided when mandated by governmental regulation. Complexity: The U.S. healthcare system generates exabytes of data annually, spanning patient records, insurance claims and billing codes. There are more than 9 billion healthcare claim transactions annually; the average hospital manages 50 petabytes of data in electronic health records, imaging and billing systems per year; and there are 71,000 diagnostic and 82,000 procedural codes . Inertia: Legacy IT systems are deeply embedded in healthcare. Seventy percent of healthcare organizations still use fax machines to send and receive many medical records. Most data is transmitted using 40-year-old EDI protocols that would make modern, real-time marketplace applications found in other industries—like Uber—impossible. Trust: Much of the data that needs to be cleaned, shared and analyzed is patient data. This data must be anonymized and secured. Utilizing Ubiquitous Data In Micro And Macro Settings The scale, heterogeneity and regulatory complexity of healthcare data make it uniquely challenging to manage and analyze. Reducing this complexity can be accomplished with standardized data-sharing protocols, AI-driven tools for automation and investments in consumer experience. When this data is simplified and provided to consumers when they need it most—at the micro point of making a personal healthcare purchasing decision—that consumer’s use of this information for their own benefit immediately contributes to a more rational healthcare marketplace. At a macro scale, payer and provider access to this data pinpoints demand and supply mismatches, reduces pricing inconsistencies and optimizes costs, leading to a smarter and more affordable healthcare system. Our industry’s health market professionals can leverage data, technology and relationships to measurably improve healthcare access, cost and quality. To make this happen, we have a lot of work and opportunity ahead of us. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?

New Mexico’s overall health care ranking is 43rd out of the states, an ongoing issue that needs improvement. It is necessary to expand New Mexico’s statewide health care programs, prepare more medical professionals, increase funding, upgrade equipment and improve telehealth and facilities. These changes would encourage and provide an incentive for doctors, nurses and specialists to stay in New Mexico and improve the state’s medical system. Additionally, these expansions would provide more financial support and attract health care providers to New Mexico and hopefully allow the state to retain the providers trained in New Mexico. While many communities have limited access to health care, others have none, which creates an issue that requires continuous efforts to improve. Many people in New Mexico do not have equal or timely access to health care facilities and need to travel long distances to access care, causing them to spend excessive amounts of time traveling, even crossing state lines, to seek care. Shaping the future of health care is essential for New Mexicans to be able to receive the health care services they need. To do so, it is crucial to better coordinate and strengthen the state’s health care network and patient outreach. Setting the goals of shortening the time it takes to schedule appointments with primary care physicians and making it easier to find a primary care physician and obtain timely referrals to specialists in larger health care systems should also be considered. Nearly all counties in New Mexico are facing health care professional shortages. Nursing shortages in New Mexico, for example, can be considered significant when compared with national trends. Shortages can result in New Mexicans not being able to receive proper care. In Las Vegas, N.M., efforts have been made to improve the nursing shortage that the Alta Vista Regional Hospital is experiencing. These efforts include providing a place for the local nursing students from New Mexico Highlands University and Luna Community College to receive training while the hospital staffers seek potential future nurses. Generally, New Mexico can expand more residency programs in all parts of the state to prepare future providers as well as add and enhance the quality- of-life opportunities for families of health care professionals to keep them in New Mexico communities, regardless of size. Complex community needs in New Mexico come with additional challenges because of the need to expand clinical education and clinical research. In addition, culturally competent care is required for the diverse population that exists within New Mexico. Taking care of the aging and youth populations is an important aspect to consider when shaping the future of health care. Mental and physical health is also important for all patients, as there has been a growing need for mental and behavioral health care within communities. Communication is a key aspect in shaping the future of health care in New Mexico. Medical and legal teams must work together with the public for improvements in health care to occur. This is going to take consistent and continuous efforts from all sides of the political spectrum, given that improving and shaping the future of health care is not an easy fix. As technology is set to continue advancing, it is important the state continues to use validated, evidence-based technology within the health care system. Technological advances regarding health care, such as telehealth, can grant more New Mexicans access to the health care services they need. All areas of the state have unique offerings to attract and retain health care professionals. When we work together, solve health issues affecting us and build a strong system of care, New Mexico’s families and its economy benefit. Sen. Pete Campos, a Democrat from Las Vegas, N.M., has served in the state Senate since 1991. Dr. Christian Bowers, a neurosurgeon and clinical researcher, formerly was program director and vice chairman of clinical affairs at the University of New Mexico.

Mudit Dandwate, CEO and co-founder of Dozee, observed that health AI is poised to drive the next wave of innovation and impact. “For Indian startups, the opportunities are immense,” he said. “The country’s diverse and demanding healthcare landscape serves as fertile ground for developing solutions that can drive global transformation. While healthcare challenges vary across regions, innovations proven effective in India have the potential to address critical healthcare needs worldwide. The time is ripe for positioning India not just as a participant but as a launchpad for scalable, world-class innovations that can make a significant global impact,” added Dandwate. Typically, new technologies take time to penetrate the healthcare industry and gain a patient-centered focus. The experts noted that the AI wave, which began in recent years, is being recognized for its potential in the health sector. Padmini Janaki, CEO and co-founder of the health tech company Mind and Mom, noted the growing understanding of AI’s ability to bring meaningful improvements. “Patients, doctors, and healthcare providers are becoming more open to its applications. I see 2025 as the year of widespread acceptance for AI and technology in healthcare,” she said. Surjeet Thakur, Founder & CEO of TrioTree Technologies, notes that India's healthcare market, valued at over $370 billion in 2022, is projected to exceed $610 billion by 2026. “This growth is driven by increased private equity and venture capital investments, which exceeded $1 billion in the first five months of 2024—a 220% rise from the previous year. Key areas attracting investment include healthcare delivery, pharmaceuticals, and health-tech innovations. The preventive health-tech sector, for instance, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21%, reaching a market size of $197 billion by 2025. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare is anticipated to reach $1.6 billion by 2025, enhancing diagnostics and patient care.” Health tech founders reflected that 2024 was a challenging year for startups across sectors, including healthcare and pharma. “However, it also underscored the resilience and strategic vision of organizations dedicated to innovation and meaningful impact,” said Dandwate. He added that although many startups faced funding constraints, companies with a clear vision, robust foundation, and focus on tangible outcomes demonstrated that even the most turbulent times can be navigated successfully.

Looking ahead, Dandwate predicted a growing demand for healthcare services in tier-2 cities, driven by key hospital acquisitions in 2024, signalling a shift toward decentralizing access to quality care. “Consolidation within the hospital market and the rapid expansion of hospital bed capacity underscore the sector’s readiness for large-scale transformation. Additionally, the eldercare and chronic care management markets are experiencing unprecedented growth, fueled by India’s ageing population and the rising prevalence of long-term health conditions. Health insurance penetration is on an upward trajectory, though it still offers immense opportunities for expansion,” he explained. Dr Santosh Bhargav D.B., co-founder and director-CTO of SpOvum Technologies, noted that 2025 promises to be a pivotal year for witnessing significant strides in personalized medicine. “To fully leverage the potential of AI analytics, robotics, and genomics in healthcare, we need scalable solutions that foster collaboration, address real-world challenges, increase accessibility for all, and ultimately improve health outcomes for individuals and communities,” he said. Dr Bhargav observed that robotics and automation in embryology will improve precision and scalability, time-lapse imaging systems will enhance clinical decision-making, and AI-powered remote consultations will expand access in underserved areas. “Genomic integration in treatments will further revolutionize personalized care,” he said. Janaki, meanwhile, highlighted the potential for significant growth in preventive healthcare in 2025. “Until now, healthcare was often seen through a reactive lens—people visited doctors only when unwell or facing a problem. However, this mindset is shifting. With advancements like AI, though it’s just one tool, people are increasingly focusing on prevention and longevity. It’s not just about living to 80 or 90 years but living those years healthily and vibrantly,” she said. This shift was driving interest in preventive measures, starting with basics like regular blood tests and proactive health monitoring. She cited the growing popularity of health rings, watches, and other tracking devices as reflections of this increased awareness. According to Dr Bhargav, the ‘Make in India’ initiative will play a transformative role in this journey, driving domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge medical technologies and fostering an ecosystem of innovation. “By promoting local production of advanced medical devices, eco-friendly materials, and sustainable practices, the initiative aligns with global ESG standards while creating cost-effective solutions tailored to India’s unique healthcare needs,” he added. However, health tech experts cautioned that challenges persisted in the sector. “Patient safety remains undervalued across the industry, compromising outcomes and escalating costs. Technology adoption, though improving, still lags behind expectations, with only 35% of Indian hospitals currently utilizing EMR systems. Addressing these gaps is essential to unlocking the full potential of healthcare innovation,” Dandwate asserted."

Indeed, it has emerged as one of the best investment opportunities in 2024, with investors increasingly being drawn to innovations in diagnostics and treatments that tackle critical health challenges while offering robust financial returns. The cancer crisis in India: A growing concern India faces a cancer burden. Alarmingly, it is now being detected in younger populations, a shift driven by lifestyle changes, environmental factors, and limited awareness of preventive measures. Despite these challenges, India’s healthcare infrastructure remains underdeveloped, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This gap highlights the urgent need for investment in critical healthcare, particularly in early detection technologies. Bridging these gaps presents an unparalleled opportunity for profitable healthcare investments that combine purpose with profit. Previu Health: Transforming cancer care Previu Health is one such company that is transforming cancer diagnostics with its solutions. Its flagship multi-cancer detection technology can identify up to 35 types of cancers at stages 0 and 1, utilising advanced mRNA sequencing. This technology enables detection even before tumours form, giving patients a greater chance at successful treatment. Live Events Healthcare investment: The future The healthcare sector is known for its resilience, even during economic downturns. Cancer care, in particular, is poised for exponential growth due to increasing demand for advanced diagnostics and treatments.

Companies such as Previu Health are uniquely positioned to address these challenges with tech-enabled and scalable solutions.

They are making early detection accessible nationwide, addressing the gap in early screenings, and creating investment opportunities. Healthcare investment: Why now India’s healthcare sector is at a pivotal moment.

Richard Brown , health coverage , health industry , health insurance , health insurance companies , healthcare , Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America Health insurance companies have been growing in influence since the professionalization and centralization of American healthcare in the early 20th century. By the 1970s, health insurance companies had begun challenging other corporate interests for more economic and political power over the medical industry. The unrestrained influence health insurance companies have over medicine has driven healthcare spending up to catastrophic levels – and employers expect costs to keep increasing in 2025. Health insurance companies continue to prioritize profits by shifting the burden of costs onto hospitals and patients through a variety of strategies, including denying claims and leaving hospitals with billions in unpaid medical bills. The dominance of health insurance companies in the American healthcare industry is one of the major reasons for massive health spending – and its roots can be traced to the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Without significant reforms, healthcare costs are expected to continue surging into 2025 . This is according to the book ""Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America"" by E. Richard Brown . First published in the late 1970s, the book chronicles the history of American healthcare and the massive growth in spending that Americans at the time were already experiencing – an average of around $4,300 per person in 1979, adjusted for inflation . Brown argues that, in the late 19th century, American medicine remained decentralized: Medical professionals lacked power, wealth and status, and the state of healthcare was determined by its distance to sources of power and wealth, making it heavily fragmented and at times ineffective and poorly regulated, with low earnings for healthcare practitioners. (Related: Mike Adams calls for DECENTRALIZATION of America's collapsing health care system .) From the 1900s to the 1930s, medicine entered an era of massive change, becoming a tightly controlled profession through licensure, accreditation and the growing influence of the American Medical Association and the groundbreaking changes brought about by the 1910 Flexner Report which reported on the poor state of medical education in the United States. Physicians started gaining higher incomes and started gaining a higher social standing due to the sudden exclusive nature of medicine and the fact that this new generation of medical professionals were solidly in the middle and upper classes. By the 1970s, physicians reached the top of America’s class structure, with median incomes placing them in the top percentiles. They became highly trusted and, Brown argues, ranked alongside Supreme Court justices in occupational status. However, soon the authority of medical professionals started getting challenged by corporate interest groups, namely hospitals, medical schools , government agencies seeking to rationalize and bureaucratize healthcare and, most importantly, health insurance companies. Lack of control over health insurance companies leading to massive growth in healthcare costs Hospitals, now under the purview of special interests, especially health insurance companies, became central to healthcare, consuming 40 percent of health expenditures. At the same time, health insurance companies started gaining significantly more economic and political influence. The unrestrained influence of health insurance companies in American healthcare has led to the massive explosion in healthcare costs – and U.S. employers only expect costs to increase. In 2025, employers reportedly are bracing for an eight percent increase in costs, according to a survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. This projection surpasses the seven percent increases seen in 2022 and 2023, signaling a continued upward trend in healthcare expenses. Furthermore, health insurance corporations are figuring out new strategies to further shift the burden of spending to hospitals and patients . Excessive prior authorization, fail-first policies and nearly insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles not only prevent patients from receiving care, but it also shifts the burden of spending away from insurers all the while driving up healthcare costs. One report indicated that more than half of all hospitals in the U.S. have more than $100 million each in accounts receivable for claims older than six months, and over a third of American hospitals have reported over $50 million in foregone payments because of denied claims . Watch this episode of the ""Health Ranger Report"" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, argues that the solution to reforming American healthcare lies in decentralization .

United States Food, Drugs, Healthcare, Life Sciences Dianne Pledgie To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. As the December 23, 2024, compliance date approaches for the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule (""Final Rule""), below are three areas where HIPAA covered entities, including health centers and behavioral health care providers, should focus: Identify the protected health information (PHI) related to reproductive health care in your organization : The Final Rule requires covered entities and business associates (""HIPAA regulated entities"") to obtain an attestation when they receive a request for PHI potentially related to reproductive health care when the care is lawful and when the request is for certain purposes (described below in more detail). The Final Rule defines reproductive health care as ""health care...that affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes"" (45 C.F.R. 160.103). Covered entities should identify the PHI they consider to be related to reproductive health care. Such PHI might be identified by ICD-10 code (encounters for contraceptive management, general counseling and advice on contraception, etc.), by provider type (OBGYN) or by the type of visit (gender affirming care). Understand reproductive health care that is legal in your state and develop a procedure for tracking changes at the state and federal level: Under the Final Rule, HIPAA regulated entities are prohibited from using and disclosing PHI related to reproductive health care for investigations and imposing liability when the reproductive health care: Is lawful under the law of the state in which the health care is provided; Is protected, required or authorized by Federal law, including the U.S. Constitution; or Was provided by another provider and fits within the presumption of lawfulness. For multiple reasons, covered entities should provide clear guidance to staff on the types of reproductive health care that are legal in your state and on the federal level (for example, contraception) and designate a process for tracking changes and challenges to the lawfulness of such care. Changes may come through state and federal law and regulation, and challenges may come through lawsuits at the state and federal levels. Attestation requirement: HIPAA regulated entities are required to obtain an attestation when they receive a request for PHI potentially related to reproductive health care when the request is for the purposes of health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, and disclosures to coroners and medical examiners. To comply with this requirement, HIPAA regulated entities should develop an attestation form and procedure. Earlier this year, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a model attestation . The procedure may be part of a separate policy and procedure or may be incorporated into current procedures on disclosures for health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, and disclosures to coroners and medical examiners In early December, OCR sent an email reminding HIPAA regulated entities about the compliance date for most provisions of the Final Rule. It is not yet clear whether the Final Rule will survive the current legal challenges ( see State of Texas v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, et. al. ) or how it will be modified by the incoming Trump Administration. HIPAA regulated entities should stay tuned for updates from OCR via their webpage on HIPAA and Reproductive Health . To support health centers in meeting their compliance requirements, the Confidentiality for Health Centers Toolkit has been updated to include the following: New document: Attestation for Use and Disclosure of PHI Potentially Related to Reproductive Health: Sample Policy and Procedure Revised documents: Disclosures about Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence: Sample Policy and Procedure Uses and Disclosures for Health Oversight Activities: Sample Policy and Procedure Disclosures for Judicial and Administrative Proceedings: Sample Policy and Procedure Disclosures for Law Enforcement Purposes: Sample Policy and Procedure Uses and Disclosures about Decedents: Sample Policy and Procedure Designation and Authority of Personal Representatives: Sample Policy and Procedure Contents of the Notice of Privacy Practices: Sample Policy and Procedure The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Dianne Pledgie"

Dr. Boateng highlighted how the integration of AI and big data analytics is revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnostics, treatment planning, and disease management. He explained that as healthcare systems face increasing pressure to enhance efficiency and accessibility, AI has emerged as a crucial tool to address these challenges. Dr. Boateng, also an AI researcher, noted in a media interaction that his work in medical diagnostics—particularly the creation of SqueezeCapsNet, an advanced AI framework—positions him at the forefront of this transformative process. He explained that SqueezeCapsNet enhances diagnostic accuracy, enabling the early detection of diseases such as pneumonia, cancer, and COVID-19. This reduces diagnostic errors and expedites treatment decisions. Dr. Boateng underscored how AI empowers healthcare professionals with data-driven insights, leading to improved patient outcomes and cost reduction. Beyond diagnostics, he noted that AI models are used for patient monitoring and predictive analytics, identifying high-risk individuals and facilitating preventive care. Moreover, Dr. Boateng emphasized the profound economic impact of AI in healthcare, noting that it automates routine tasks, reduces operational costs, and allows medical staff to focus on critical care. Additionally, he highlighted how AI technologies support telemedicine, extending quality healthcare to rural and underserved areas. This aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which focuses on Good Health and Well-being. Dr. Boateng concluded that his groundbreaking research serves as a testament to the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, ensuring healthier communities and a more efficient medical infrastructure.

Increasing awareness about the impact of daily habits on health is encouraging people to adopt more proactive approaches to their well-being. This shift from focusing solely on treatment to emphasising prevention is gradually shaping the industry. Demand for solutions such as wearable health monitors, fitness applications, and wellness programs is on the rise. Alongside advancements in medical technology, these changes are paving the way for a more consumer-driven and personalised approach to healthcare. Increased focus on preventive health and wellness Consumers are becoming more proactive about their health, emphasising preventive measures over-reactive treatments. This shift is driven by a growing awareness of the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent chronic diseases. The wellness industry is responding with products and services that promote longevity and overall well-being. For instance, the popularity of health-tracking devices and supplements aimed at enhancing life quality is on the rise. Adoption of digital health technologies The integration of technology into daily life has led to the widespread adoption of digital health tools. Telehealth services, wearable fitness trackers, and mobile health applications enable individuals to monitor their health in real-time and access medical consultations remotely. This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the convenience and necessity of remote healthcare services. The telehealth industry, for example, has seen substantial growth and is expected to continue expanding, offering cost-effective and accessible healthcare solutions. Emphasis on mental health There is a growing recognition of the importance of mental health, leading to increased demand for mental health services and support. Employers and healthcare providers are prioritising mental well-being, integrating mental health services into primary care, and offering digital mental health platforms. This focus is reshaping healthcare offerings to include comprehensive mental health support, acknowledging its integral role in overall health. Personalised and consumer-centric healthcare Consumers are seeking personalised healthcare experiences tailored to their individual needs and preferences. This demand is driving the healthcare market towards more customised services, including personalised medicine, individualised wellness programs, and patient-centred care models. The shift towards consumer-centric healthcare is fostering a more responsive and adaptable healthcare system that prioritises patient satisfaction and outcomes. Rise in health-conscious consumer behaviour Post-pandemic, consumers are more intentional about their spending, focusing on products that offer immediate and long-term health benefits. This behaviour is evident in the popularity of wellness trends and products that promote health and balance. The wellness industry is thriving, with consumers seeking products and services that enhance their quality of life, indicating a shift towards health-conscious consumption. Ageing population and chronic disease management The ageing global population is increasing the prevalence of chronic diseases, necessitating effective management strategies. Lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, are essential in managing and preventing chronic conditions. Healthcare providers are focusing on integrated care models that address the complex needs of older adults, emphasising preventive care and lifestyle interventions to enhance quality of life. Integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and streamlining administrative processes. AI-driven healthcare information delivery is becoming more prevalent, providing patients with tailored health guidance and improving overall healthcare delivery. The integration of AI is expected to continue shaping the healthcare landscape, offering innovative solutions to complex healthcare challenges. Shift towards value-based care There is a growing emphasis on value-based care, which focuses on patient outcomes rather than the volume of services provided. This approach encourages healthcare providers to offer high-quality, efficient care that improves patient health. Lifestyle changes that promote health and prevent disease are integral to value-based care models, aligning incentives with positive health outcomes. Health policy and regulatory changes Health policies are evolving to support the integration of technology in healthcare and to address rising healthcare costs. Regulatory changes are facilitating the adoption of telehealth and remote patient monitoring, enabling more flexible and accessible healthcare delivery. Staying informed about policy developments is crucial for healthcare providers and consumers to navigate the changing healthcare landscape effectively. Economic factors influencing healthcare access Economic considerations, including rising healthcare costs and inflation, are influencing consumer behaviour and access to healthcare services. Employers and policymakers are seeking strategies to manage costs while ensuring access to quality care. Lifestyle changes that reduce the risk of chronic diseases can alleviate some of the economic burdens associated with healthcare, highlighting the importance of preventive health measures. In a nutshell, lifestyle changes are set to influence the healthcare market in 2025 significantly. A focus on preventive health, the adoption of digital technologies, increased attention to mental health, and consumer-driven demand for personalised care are among the key factors driving this transformation. The healthcare industry is adapting to these changes, striving to provide accessible, efficient, and patient-centered care to meet the evolving needs of society.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Dec 27, 2024, 07:00am EST Share Save Fran Rosch is the CEO of Imprivata, a digital identity company for life- and mission-critical industries. getty Despite ramping up cybersecurity investments, a March 2024 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report found that healthcare systems experienced a 264% increase in ransomware attacks over the previous five years. Healthcare spends the most compared to other industries when remediating attacks, with the average cost of a data breach in healthcare exceeding $9.7 million . These attacks also lead to disruptions in care, risks to patient safety, compliance infractions and reputational damage. As the industry continues navigating this rapidly evolving landscape in 2025, the situation will only worsen unless organizations can effectively improve cybersecurity. To be truly effective while working with limited budget and resources, healthcare IT and security leaders will look to innovate with solutions that make improving security simple—with technologies like passwordless authentication, mobile devices, AI and third-party security rising in popularity. Increasing Health IT Budgets Signal Push For Digital Maturity I attended the CHIME24 Fall Forum, a conference led by the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) that brings together digital health leaders to develop initiatives to advance healthcare. At the conference, CHIME released its 2024 National Trends Report evaluating the progress of digital health in the U.S. The findings predicted a future with greater IT budget allocations, more focus on cybersecurity and infrastructure, and continued expansion in technology use to improve healthcare outcomes and efficiency. As I spoke to healthcare professionals about their organizational challenges and initiatives, I was left with an overarching takeaway: Healthcare organizations, now more than ever, need simple and effective security. With increased health IT budgets, it's crucial for organizations to not just invest in technology but to do so strategically by tailoring their cyber strategy to healthcare's unique and complex characteristics. The Need To Enhance Efficiency, Mobility And Security A 2024 Verizon report found that mobile malware and phishing attacks targeting devices have increased , with attackers exploiting weaker defenses on these platforms. This is a growing concern for IT and security leaders, especially as a 2024 Ponemon Institute research report we sponsored found that 64% of healthcare organizations are unable to protect data and privacy by locking down devices between each use. Security measures must secure access to protected health information (PHI) without impeding the workflow of clinicians. However, this is a delicate balance to achieve, as security protocols effective in other sectors may not be suitable for a healthcare environment. The Ponemon report found that only 40% of healthcare organizations described the end-user experience on mobile devices as satisfactory. AI Innovation Takes Center Stage To no surprise, GenAI has become a widely popular time-saving tool, being used in many ways like clinical decision-making and predictive analysis. However, GenAI also raises concerns about data privacy breaches due to the large amounts of sensitive patient data needed to utilize it. In addition to GenAI, all forms of AI are becoming more pervasive in healthcare, underscoring the need for greater education about the risks and opportunities associated with it. For example, AI and machine learning (ML) tools can be leveraged to improve threat detection and response times. However, with so many unknowns surrounding this new technology, any AI strategy must be carefully tailored to the unique cybersecurity and compliance needs of the healthcare industry, being mindful of stringent regulatory requirements like HIPAA. Vendor Security Is Paramount The CHIME report also underscores the need for improved vendor security in healthcare, as recent supply chain attacks indicate. From vendors to partners to contractors, third parties are a vital and inevitable part of today's business environment. While all industries use vendors, healthcare is especially reliant on help from outside vendors given the global shortages of healthcare staff and other resources. Each of these interactions introduces potential vulnerabilities, especially if third-party providers do not adhere to stringent cybersecurity practices themselves. The increasing reliance on third parties for critical services amplifies the risk of breaches through external entities, as 56% of organizations reported having experienced a third-party data breach in 2022. Yet despite the significant and acknowledged risk, more than half of organizations say they do not have effective controls for mitigating third-party access risk. Preparing Healthcare For The Threats Of Tomorrow, Today As healthcare organizations adapt their tech strategy for the trends of 2025, it is paramount for IT and security teams to collaborate cross-functionally with clinicians during this process. This is essential to ensure any technology deployed to enhance security is tailored to meet the unique clinical workflow needs required for patient care. For instance, while complex passwords are a common cybersecurity best practice, they slow down clinicians who may access the electronic health records (EHR) system and other applications hundreds of times per shift. Each access requires authentication, and if this involves manually typing a username and complex password on a mobile device, it can create barriers and frustrations. To overcome these challenges, IT teams should look for solutions that streamline and secure access. Passwordless authentication can help by eliminating the need for time-consuming logins. IT teams should ensure their access management strategy is capable of enforcing identity-based security policies, monitoring device usage and ensuring compliance. Tools leveraging AI and ML can also help organizations make informed decisions about workflow improvements by providing visibility into user behaviors and system usage. This includes addressing failed login attempts, adoption issues and user efficiency—which can help track security risks, drive technology adoption and save on IT operational costs. This ultimately contributes to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. To address the risks that an increased reliance on vendors introduces, healthcare organizations must adopt a comprehensive vendor access management strategy. This should include a rigorous vetting and procurement process and a thorough security assessment for any new vendor. Organizations can also reduce risk by considering vendor consolidation where possible as well as implementing strict access controls, monitoring third-party activities and employing the principle of least privilege access. By taking a strategic, collaborative approach, the healthcare industry can build a resilient environment that protects patient data, ensures compliance and maintains trust—safeguarding patient care and organizational reputation.

Through barcode technology under GS1 standards, health manufacturers and distributors can easily record data in clinical systems, it said. Healthcare professionals can also use barcodes for patient identification, medication administration, and the tracking of medical supplies and equipment. “At GS1 Philippines, we believe that adopting streamlined barcode technology in healthcare is crucial for enhancing patient safety and improving the efficiency of healthcare workflow,” GS1 Philippines’ Roberto S. Claudio was quoted as saying. “This innovation empowers health professionals to deliver better care by having a tool for data integration and interoperability.” “Integrating barcode technology is not just about digitalization — it’s about creating a safer, more transparent healthcare system that improves patient care, reduces errors, and ensures an efficient supply chain of authentic medicines and medical products, protecting patients from counterfeit goods,” Teodoro B. Padilla, executive director of the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines, added. The push for modernizing healthcare processes comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) recently highlighted the transformative potential of digital transformation on healthcare. Under the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025, tools specializing in data storage and exchange, remote data capture, and virtual care can enhance medical diagnoses, treatment decisions, digital therapeutics, and clinical trials. “There is a growing consensus in the global health community that the strategic and innovative use of digital and cutting-edge information and communications technologies will be an essential enabling factor towards ensuring that one billion more people benefit from universal health coverage,” it said. — Beatriz Marie D.

By Peter Charalambous December 23, 2024, 9:01 PM Manhattan, New York -- As Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder charges in Manhattan Criminal Court this morning, protesters from all walks of life assembled outside the courthouse to show their support for the alleged killer. While their reasons to bear the 11-degree weather varied -- including personal healthcare issues, concerns about inequality and distrust of the media -- they were seemingly united in their support for the 26-year-old whose alleged actions have ignited a nationwide conversation about healthcare. Pushing her 1-year-old son, Emmanuel, in a stroller, 37-year-old Alicia Thomas from the South Bronx said her experience giving birth while on Medicaid helped her relate to Mangione's grievances with the healthcare industry. Suffering from a postpartum hemorrhage, she said she wanted to spend more than two days in the hospital after giving birth but couldn't afford care beyond what Medicaid provided. People demonstrating against the healthcare industry stand outside Federal Criminal Court as Luigi Mangione, suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, appears during an arraignment hearing, Dec. 23, 2024, in New York. Charly Triballeau/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Thomas said she believes Mangione is innocent -- framing him as a victim of the healthcare industry and justice system -- but said his case has brought light to the need to improve healthcare. ""It sparked a catalyst to think about what kind of world we are going to leave our children,"" she said, showing a Justo Juez prayer candle she plans to light for Mangione. ""Our generation has seen so much devastation throughout the years, and our children are going to suffer at the hands of corporate greed."" Prosecutors allege that Mangione meticulously planned and carried out the murder of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel on the morning of Dec. 4 before fleeing the state to Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days later at a McDonald's. According to the federal complaint, Mangione was in possession of a notebook in which he expressed hostility to healthcare executives, described the insurance industry as his target because it ""checks every box,"" and laid out his intent to ""whack"" Thompson at UnitedHealthcare's investors conference. While Mangione did not have family in court on Monday, about two dozen women attended the arraignment in the public section of the gallery, many of them voicing support for Mangione. ""This is a grave injustice, and that's why people are here,"" one of the women, who said she arrived at the courthouse at 5 a.m., told ABC News. Outside court, protestors rallied for Mangione, chanting ""Eat the rich,"" ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, these CEOs have got to go,"" and ""Free, free Luigi."" Nicholas Zamudio, 33, said he came to the protest after spending over $100,000 out of pocket for his treatment after an electric injury in 2021. Holding a sign that read ""United States Healthcare Stole My Livelihood. Prosecute Malicious Profiteers,"" Zamudio said he doesn't know if he will be able to afford his ongoing treatment for nerve damage. ""I don't have insurance, I've drained my 401K. I've drained everything that I have, and come January I will be trying to keep a roof over my head by couch hopping amongst friends. I've lost everything and that's what brought me out here,"" he said. MORE: Luigi Mangione's attorney blasts police, mayor for using the accused CEO killer as 'political fodder' Zamudio said he found comfort in Mangione's writings about his spinal injury, noting they both received similar spinal fusion operations. ""He talked about not being able to sleep, laying in pain, things like that,"" he said. ""I guess a lot kind of resonated with me in regards to the pain and not getting help with the healthcare system. I think murder is obviously wrong, but it did bring us to a point we needed to get to."" Law enforcement has raised concerns about the outpouring of support for Mangione and hostility towards healthcare industry since Thompson's killing, with multiple police bulletins warning about the increased risk to healthcare executives. UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty appeared to acknowledge the public sentiment, writing in an opinion essay in the New York Times earlier this month that he ""understand people's frustrations"" with healthcare and vowed to ""to find ways to deliver high-quality care and lower costs.""

No employees — be they the people who answer customer calls or nurses who visit patients in their homes — should have to fear for their and their loved ones' safety,"" Witty wrote. While the specifics of Mangione's grievances with the healthcare injury remain unclear -- and we do not know if his personal issues with the healthcare system motivated his alleged actions -- many of the protesters came to their own conclusions about what motivated the alleged killer. A 26-year-old woman from Queens who preferred to go unnamed said she related to Mangione after she fell off her parent's healthcare plan and couldn't afford COBRA coverage. Having gone uninsured for months, she said she believes the healthcare system is broken based on her inability to find a good plan despite days of effort calling different insurance companies. Protestors hold signs outside of Manhattan Criminal Court on December 23, 2024, in New York City. Adam Gray/Getty Images ""I spent an entire month -- 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with three phones in front of me -- waiting on the phone on hold to get access to these people. They put me through circles and circles and circles,"" she said. Another woman from Brooklyn said she came to court because she believed Mangione was bringing attention to the need for universal healthcare in the United States . She added that she didn't trust the media coverage of Mangione's case and wanted to see the proceedings with her own eyes to draw conclusions. ""There was a lot of support from where we were in the back [of court],"" she said after attending the arraignment in person. ""I believe it's a conversation that a lot of people are having now, and whatever we can do to help progress this conversation is worthy of participating in."" Bill Dobbs, who lives in Manhattan, said he was motivated to support Mangione after federal prosecutors charged the 26-year-old with a crime that carries the death penalty. He held a sign that read ""Justice not Vengeance."" ""It's very alarming there could be a death penalty,"" he said. ""Punishment has got to leave a chance for change, and the death penalty doesn't."" MORE: Defense fund established by supporters of suspected CEO killer Luigi Mangione nears $200K Mangione's disdain for the healthcare industry only added to his reasons to support the alleged killer, Dobbs said. ""What's going on in the private healthcare industry is scandalous,"" he said. While most of the protestors said they believed Mangione was innocent, their support for Mangione carried an implicit incongruence -- Is Mangione an innocent victim or a martyr for confronting the healthcare industry through his alleged actions? Many protestors who spoke with ABC News reconciled the beliefs by referencing the plague of mass shootings impacting the United States, claiming that the attention on Mangione and terrorism label is evidence of a broken justice system. ""He's an alleged shooter, but how many school shooters are labeled with terrorism. How many?"" asked one protestor.

Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""It sparked a catalyst to think about what kind of world we are going to leave our children,"" she said, showing a Justo Juez prayer candle she plans to light for Mangione. ""Our generation has seen so much devastation throughout the years, and our children are going to suffer at the hands of corporate greed."" Prosecutors allege that Mangione meticulously planned and carried out the murder of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel on the morning of Dec. 4 before fleeing the state to Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days later at a McDonald's. According to the federal complaint, Mangione was in possession of a notebook in which he expressed hostility to healthcare executives, described the insurance industry as his target because it ""checks every box,"" and laid out his intent to ""whack"" Thompson at UnitedHealthcare's investors conference. While Mangione did not have family in court on Monday, about two dozen women attended the arraignment in the public section of the gallery, many of them voicing support for Mangione. ""This is a grave injustice, and that's why people are here,"" one of the women, who said she arrived at the courthouse at 5 a.m., told ABC News. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Outside court, protestors rallied for Mangione, chanting ""Eat the rich,"" ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, these CEOs have got to go,"" and ""Free, free Luigi."" Nicholas Zamudio, 33, said he came to the protest after spending over $100,000 out of pocket for his treatment after an electric injury in 2021. Holding a sign that read ""United States Healthcare Stole My Livelihood. Prosecute Malicious Profiteers,"" Zamudio said he doesn't know if he will be able to afford his ongoing treatment for nerve damage. ""I don't have insurance, I've drained my 401K. I've drained everything that I have, and come January I will be trying to keep a roof over my head by couch hopping amongst friends. I've lost everything and that's what brought me out here,"" he said.

""He talked about not being able to sleep, laying in pain, things like that,"" he said. ""I guess a lot kind of resonated with me in regards to the pain and not getting help with the healthcare system. I think murder is obviously wrong, but it did bring us to a point we needed to get to."" Law enforcement has raised concerns about the outpouring of support for Mangione and hostility towards healthcare industry since Thompson's killing, with multiple police bulletins warning about the increased risk to healthcare executives. UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty appeared to acknowledge the public sentiment, writing in an opinion essay in the New York Times earlier this month that he ""understand people's frustrations"" with healthcare and vowed to ""to find ways to deliver high-quality care and lower costs."" ""[W]e also are struggling to make sense of this unconscionable act and the vitriol that has been directed at our colleagues who have been barraged by threats. No employees — be they the people who answer customer calls or nurses who visit patients in their homes — should have to fear for their and their loved ones' safety,"" Witty wrote. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While the specifics of Mangione's grievances with the healthcare injury remain unclear -- and we do not know if his personal issues with the healthcare system motivated his alleged actions -- many of the protesters came to their own conclusions about what motivated the alleged killer. A 26-year-old woman from Queens who preferred to go unnamed said she related to Mangione after she fell off her parent's healthcare plan and couldn't afford COBRA coverage. Having gone uninsured for months, she said she believes the healthcare system is broken based on her inability to find a good plan despite days of effort calling different insurance companies.

(Adam Gray/Getty Images) ""I spent an entire month -- 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with three phones in front of me -- waiting on the phone on hold to get access to these people. They put me through circles and circles and circles,"" she said. Another woman from Brooklyn said she came to court because she believed Mangione was bringing attention to the need for universal healthcare in the United States . She added that she didn't trust the media coverage of Mangione's case and wanted to see the proceedings with her own eyes to draw conclusions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""There was a lot of support from where we were in the back [of court],"" she said after attending the arraignment in person. ""I believe it's a conversation that a lot of people are having now, and whatever we can do to help progress this conversation is worthy of participating in."" Bill Dobbs, who lives in Manhattan, said he was motivated to support Mangione after federal prosecutors charged the 26-year-old with a crime that carries the death penalty. He held a sign that read ""Justice not Vengeance."" ""It's very alarming there could be a death penalty,"" he said. ""Punishment has got to leave a chance for change, and the death penalty doesn't."" MORE: Defense fund established by supporters of suspected CEO killer Luigi Mangione nears $200K Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Mangione's disdain for the healthcare industry only added to his reasons to support the alleged killer, Dobbs said. ""What's going on in the private healthcare industry is scandalous,"" he said. While most of the protestors said they believed Mangione was innocent, their support for Mangione carried an implicit incongruence -- Is Mangione an innocent victim or a martyr for confronting the healthcare industry through his alleged actions? Many protestors who spoke with ABC News reconciled the beliefs by referencing the plague of mass shootings impacting the United States, claiming that the attention on Mangione and terrorism label is evidence of a broken justice system. ""He's an alleged shooter, but how many school shooters are labeled with terrorism. How many?"" asked one protestor.

We'll describe an options play to capitalize on the price action as 2025 kicks off. Over the past 10 to 20 years, the health-care sector in the United States has grown significantly relative to the broader economy, as measured by its share of gross domestic product. Health-care spending accounted for approximately 15.7% of U.S. GDP in 2003. Over the next 10 years, that share grew by roughly 1.7% to 17.4% of GDP in 2013. Today, it is estimated to be about 18.4% of GDP, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates health-care spending could represent approximately 20% of U.S. GDP by 2030. This steady increase reflects the growing demand for health-care services, advancements in medical technology and rising costs. An aging population — baby boomers entering retirement — significantly increases demand for health-care services, and longer life expectancies have led to more years of health-care utilization. Another important cause of increased costs is the burden of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity, which also drives higher health-care costs, and the latest innovations in diagnostics, treatments and pharmaceuticals tend to be more expensive. XLV YTD mountain The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) in 2024 Expanding insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid increased access to health care. Most would agree that's a good thing. However, as demand for goods and services increases, so do prices. Hospital services, physician fees, prescription drug prices, and administrative expenses have often outpaced those in other sectors of the economy. Macroeconomic, political, and regulatory factors, not just demographics, influence the profitability of health-care stocks. The health-care industry's percentage of the economy has grown, and health-care companies' revenue growth has outpaced that of the broad market over the past five years, up nearly 61% versus revenue growth of just over 38% for the S & P 500 overall during the same period. However, the sector has materially underperformed the broad market index, which benefited from the explosive growth in the technology sector. As 2025 approaches, investors may ask themselves: If the health-care sector is growing faster than the economy, why have these stocks underperformed, and does this represent an opportunity to play the group as a possible catch-up trade in the new year? As the charts above reveal, part of the problem is margins. Profit margins within the health-care sector have fallen over the past five years and are now well below the 20-year average. Another concern? President-elect Donald Trump and some of those closest to him, such as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have emphasized cost-cutting and ""efficiency."" The burden of health-care expenses may rank highly on the cost-cutting agenda. The health-care sector has underperformed the S & P 500 by more than 10% since the presidential election. Indeed, the incoming Trump administration's efforts to curb government spending and improve efficiency could have mixed effects. Streamlining approval processes at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could expedite drug and device launches, benefiting innovative companies. Tax cuts and deregulation could boost profitability and cash flow across the sector. On the other hand, reduced government health-care spending could pressure hospitals, Medicare-reliant companies and insurers. Pushback on drug pricing and efforts to curb wasteful expenditures could hurt profit margins, especially for large pharmaceutical companies. Uncertainty regarding the Affordable Care Act, long a target for Republicans on Capitol Hill, could create unpredictability for insurers. The options trade On balance, if an investor assumes that well-managed companies can stabilize margins here, or better yet, even return them to 6% or so, still well below the long-term average, the sector looks cheap relative to the broad market. Of course, while fundamentals are important from a long-term investing perspective, they are not a very good short-term trading signal, and the short-term technicals, as of Friday's close, remain weak. A call calendar offsets the cost of a longer-term purchase by selling nearer-dated calls against it. This strategy anticipates the price action to be range-bound in the near term. If technicals improve, one might adjust the short strikes higher when it comes time to roll or hold the long call position, depending on the technical setup.

Partners University of Galway provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.xqeg9qspj Speaking at the 16th International Aids Conference in 2006, the then UNAids executive director, Peter Piot , remarked: “Since the beginning of the epidemic, stigma, discrimination and gender inequality have been identified as major causes of personal suffering, and as major obstacles to effective responses to HIV.” Now, in the fourth decade of the HIV crisis, this statement remains largely true. Despite the leaps and bounds that have been made in the treatment and prevention of HIV, stigma and discrimination continue to harm the lives of people living with HIV, and hinder efforts to stem the epidemic globally. HIV today: a changed landscape HIV is now an extremely treatable condition with excellent outcomes. Those living with HIV who are on treatment can expect to live a healthy life with a normal lifespan . Crucially, medications are so effective that they reduce the amount of the virus in the body to undetectable levels. This means people living with HIV cannot pass on the virus to others – a condition known as “U=U”, or undetectable equals untransmittable . The evidence supporting this is robust and spans over 20 years . The most comprehensive evidence for U=U stems from the Partner and Partner II studies, which aimed to determine the risk of transmission between HIV positive and HIV negative partners when the positive partner is virally suppressed. These large observational studies tracked a combined 2,020 couples – both heterosexual and gay – over several years of follow-up. Between the two studies, participants reported 134,000 acts of condomless sex, however no HIV transmissions between couples were recorded. The evidence was incontrovertible and study authors concluded the risk of transmission when a person is virally suppressed is zero. This is extremely reassuring for people living with HIV, who can feel confident that they cannot pass the virus on to their partners. It is also good news for public health, with the World Health Organization endorsing the U=U message and affirming the importance of treatment as a vital preventative tool in the ongoing HIV epidemic. Stigma: a persistent obstacle Despite these extraordinary medical advancements, HIV-related stigma remains a persistent obstacle that negatively affects the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV . The first European-wide community survey of people living with HIV , published by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in 2023, reported that among the 3,272 respondents, one in three had not told a single family member their diagnosis for fear of rejection. In the same study, a third of respondents also reported experiencing stigma in healthcare settings, with almost a quarter reporting having healthcare refused or delayed as a result of their HIV status. A subsequent ECDC study of HIV-related stigma among over 18,000 European healthcare workers, published in July 2024, found that almost two-thirds worried about drawing blood from patients with HIV and a quarter reported using double gloves with such patients. That HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings is so prevalent and commonplace is particularly troubling. Such experiences create distrust between people living with HIV and their healthcare providers This can lead people living with HIV to avoid attending healthcare services, which has obvious knock-on effects for health. Moreover, there is evidence that experiences of HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings are associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral medication and treatment failure. This is bad for individual health, but also may have negative impacts on public health , given that treatment is such a vital prevention tool. Reducing HIV stigma in healthcare settings A range of factors including fear of HIV, negative attitudes, lack of policies and a lack of training of healthcare workers can drive HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. In Ireland, where my research is based, as part of a wider project in 2022 we carried out a survey of 295 healthcare workers to measure stigma in Irish healthcare settings. Our findings , published earlier this year, provide tentative new evidence for the potential of the U=U message to reduce HIV-related stigma. Like other studies, we found that fear of HIV was a major driver of stigma in healthcare settings in Ireland. Just over half of our survey respondents said they would worry about drawing blood from a patient living with HIV, and over a quarter reported using special measures they would not use with other patients, such as double-gloving. What was unique about our study was that, for the first time, we also measured knowledge of U=U among healthcare workers. We found that, while other factors were relevant, knowledge of U=U was the most powerful protective factor against fear of HIV and stigmatising behaviour. In other words, healthcare workers who are confident in the U=U message are much less likely to stigmatise against people living with HIV. Stigma is a complex social phenomenon, and no single intervention will be fully effective against it. However, our research suggests that increasing awareness and acceptance of U=U would be an effective, low-cost and scalable action that might inch us closer to a stigma-free future.

Thasongyang Hospital Reports of an unusual spike in the number of patients from neighbouring countries seeking treatment at hospitals along the border have raised concerns about the ability of the nation's public healthcare system to handle the increased burden. In an interview with the Bangkok Post, deputy permanent secretary of the Public Health Ministry Montien Kanasawadse said the system was designed to ensure everyone on Thai soil access basic healthcare, regardless where they come from. Dr Montien said the government has created various funds to cover the expenses and is constantly working with various international organisations that could provide assistance on the matter. He dismissed concerns about the influx of foreign patients, saying only three groups of non-Thai nationals are eligible to access free healthcare services in Thailand, he said. They are stateless people in the process of verifying their Thai nationality and who have a 13-digit Thai identification number; foreign workers with work permits and are registered under a social security programme by their Thai employers, and migrant workers under the foreign health insurance fund. Montien: Not everyone is eligible 'PUBLIC CONCERNS' Public concern about the influx of foreign patients began with a post on a Facebook page, Drama-addict, which claimed border hospitals are facing difficulties due to a spike in visits by non-Thai patients from neighbouring countries who want to take advantage of the kingdom's universal healthcare coverage. The post also claimed an increasing number of pregnant migrants are turning up at Thai hospitals to give birth so their children can have Thai citizenship. Dr Thiravat Hemachudha, a member of the national committee on public healthcare reform, said the Public Health Ministry is ignoring a growing problem that could jeopardise the public healthcare system. He said the ministry should realise that the government is already struggling to provide public healthcare services to Thais due to its limited resources, adding a surge of foreign patients along the border would only add to the strain on medical facilities and staff. The situation had gone beyond ""humanitarian aid"" because it is becoming a business, he said. Many migrants had paid for fake job employment papers which could get them the right to free public healthcare under Thai law. ""If the government fails to tackle the problem, our public healthcare system could fail under the added strain. ""International agencies should develop a better healthcare system in these countries. Thailand shouldn't be responsible for their citizens,"" Dr Thiravat said. Thiravat: Healthcare service under pressure REALITY ON THE GROUND A senior doctor at Mae Sot Hospital in Tak province who declined to be named said the situation is not new. The hospital, located near the Myanmar border, regularly sees non-Thai patients, who account for 40% of all patients, due to the limited service and treatment capacity in their hometown. Most pay for the service. Some with no ability to pay were brought to the hospital by international NGOs which take charge of their medical bill. ""The situation hasn't caused a strain on our finances. The hospital can operate with support from the 30-baht universal healthcare scheme as well as healthcare fund for stateless people and other financial support schemes,"" he said. However, he said, it would be a lot better if Myanmar developed its own public healthcare service to meet local needs. Dr Supakit Sirilak, director of the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), said the government allocates money each year for a public healthcare fund to support hospitals along the border and care for stateless people in the country. They include 700,000 people whose Thai nationality is in the process of being verified. When these people claimed healthcare rights at the hospital, misperceptions might arise among the public, he said. ""This shouldn't cause any tensions,"" he said, before reminding that not all foreign patients are eligible. Meanwhile, Nimit Thian-Udom, director of the Aids Access Foundation, said hospitals should maintain a flexible approach for individuals suffering from sickness, regardless of where the come from. He said the government should put more effort into providing medical services to alien workers to improve their well-being. Dr Montien, the Public Health Ministry deputy permanent secretary, said migrants who are unable to pay for medical services may request assistance from the healthcare unit, which will consider their based on humanitarian principles. The expenses that cannot be collected from the patients will be partly covered by contributions from humanitarian organisations, he said.

All rights reserved. Nebraska Attorney General Michael T. Hilgers has filed a lawsuit against Change Healthcare, its parent company UnitedHealth Group and its operating entity Optum, following a data breach that exposed the personal and medical information of an estimated 575,000 Nebraskans. The lawsuit , filed in Lancaster County District Court on Tuesday, alleges that the companies violated state consumer protection laws and mishandled the incident, causing widespread disruption to the healthcare system. The breach, described in court documents as a ""preventable disaster,"" allegedly compromised millions of patient records across the United States and halted critical healthcare services for weeks. Change Healthcare processes billions of medical claims annually and is a key link in the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. In a statement to TechCrunch , a UnitedHealth spokesperson said: “We believe this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.” and that the review of the stolen data by Change Healthcare was “in its final stages.” Forbes 100 Million Americans' Medical Records Exposed In Massive Data Breach By Lars Daniel The Data Breach and Its Fallout According to the lawsuit, the breach began on February 11, 2024, when login credentials for a low-level employee were posted in a Telegram group known for selling stolen information. Hackers reportedly used these credentials to infiltrate Change Healthcare's systems, creating administrator accounts and installing malware. Over the following nine days, attackers allegedly exfiltrated terabytes of sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, financial information, and electronic health records. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The attackers' presence went undetected until February 21, when the ransomware group BlackCat encrypted Change Healthcare's systems, forcing the company to take its operations offline. The court filing claims the disruption brought the U.S. healthcare system to a standstill, with hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics unable to process insurance claims or access vital patient information. As stated in the complaint, healthcare providers faced significant financial and operational challenges. Larger systems reportedly lost millions of dollars per day, while smaller rural hospitals—critical to Nebraska’s healthcare network—struggled to stay afloat. Patients reportedly experienced delays in care, denied prescriptions, and scammers allegedly took advantage of the chaos by impersonating healthcare providers to steal financial information. Alleged Security Failures The lawsuit accuses the defendants of negligence in their cybersecurity practices, asserting that the breach was preventable. It highlights several alleged vulnerabilities in Change Healthcare’s systems, including: Outdated Infrastructure : Change Healthcare’s systems reportedly relied on decades-old technology, as stated by the lawsuit. No Multi-Factor Authentication The complaint alleges that the compromised systems lacked Multi-Factor Authentication, or MFA, a basic security measure. Poor Segmentation : The lawsuit claims that a lack of data segmentation allowed hackers to move freely within the network. UnitedHealth Group, which acquired Change Healthcare in 2022, was allegedly aware of these vulnerabilities. The complaint cites congressional testimony from UHG’s CEO, who acknowledged that Change Healthcare’s legacy systems were outdated and relied on physical servers instead of more secure cloud-based solutions. Delayed Notifications The Nebraska Attorney General's office alleges that Change Healthcare delayed notifying affected individuals, with some residents still unaware of the breach months later. The complaint claims that while the breach occurred in February 2024, Change Healthcare did not begin issuing notifications until late July and only after the Attorney General requested an update. The lawsuit argues that the delay violated Nebraska's Financial Data Protection and Consumer Notification of Data Security Breach Act, which requires prompt notification of affected individuals. The Attorney General also claims that the lack of transparency hindered healthcare providers’ ability to respond effectively to the crisis. The Cost to Nebraska's Healthcare System The complaint details the financial strain caused by the breach, stating that healthcare providers were forced to take drastic measures to maintain operations. Some reportedly took out loans or liquidated assets, while others incurred significant costs transitioning to new claims processors. Many hospitals and clinics faced delayed reimbursements or outright claim denials due to missed deadlines caused by the outage. Rural hospitals, operating on slim margins, were particularly hard-hit, the lawsuit states. The filing alleges that Nebraska’s 62 critical access hospitals suffered disproportionately, with some relying on cash advances or reserve funds to continue operations. Legal Action and Broader Implications The Nebraska Attorney General is seeking civil penalties, restitution for affected residents, and injunctive relief to prevent similar incidents. The lawsuit emphasizes the importance of accountability, arguing that the defendants failed to meet basic data protection standards despite handling some of the most sensitive personal and medical information. This case could set a precedent for how states address large-scale cybersecurity failures in critical industries. As the legal battle unfolds, it will likely serve as a focal point for discussions around data security in healthcare and corporate responsibility in the aftermath of breaches. The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office is urging healthcare providers in the state who may have been impacted by this cyberattack to come forward. Providers can share their contact information with the Attorney General’s Office through the website ProtectTheGoodLife.Nebraska.gov .

https://www.aol.com/places-most-least-health-insurance-144323441.html,,Places With the Most and Least Health Insurance Coverage – 2025 Study,20241218T173000Z,https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_smartasset_312/efcdade017c818ff4e3bb0650fbe49c6,aol.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Jaclyn DeJohn, CFP® December 18, 2024 at 9:43 AM 0 Copied While health insurance can prevent emergencies and catastrophic conditions from decimating your financial plans, the premiums and out-of-pocket expenses can also take a toll on your wallet. In 2024, the average annual premium for a single individual was nearly $9,000 – and an estimated $25,500 for a family of four. While many workplaces subsidize these premiums, and the Affordable Care Act opened access to healthcare for Americans not covered by employer plans, health insurance is still often a costly budget item that some individuals may forgo. In these cases, Americans may be making tradeoffs between their health and their financial wellbeing. With this in mind, SmartAsset ranked 810 U.S. counties based on the rate of people under age 65 who were insured in 2024. Annual changes in coverage, coverage of children, and the relative presence of primary care physicians in each county are also examined. Key Findings These Texas counties have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage nationwide. More than any other county, 32.0% of residents in Hidalgo County don’t have health insurance. Cameron County (30.1% uninsured), Webb County (29.7%), Starr County (29.0%), Ector County (25.3%), Potter County (24.4%), Dallas County (24.2%), Harris County (23.8%) and El Paso County (23.5%) are also among the top 10 uninsured counties nationwide. More than 96% of the population has health insurance in this state. Massachusetts dominates the rankings for high rates of health insurance coverage. Norfolk County has the highest rate of insurance at 97.6%. Statewide, more than 98.5% of children under age 19 have health insurance. These counties have the highest and lowest rate of primary care physicians. Orange County, TX, ranking 84th overall for lowest rate of health insurance among the population, has 6,053 residents per primary care physician – more than any other county studywide. On the other hand, 18th place Smith County, TX has the smallest number of residents per primary care physician studywide at 1,014. The biggest swings in coverage year over year happened in these counties. Relative to the population, Tom Green County, TX (25th highest rank of uninsured residents) saw the biggest drop in insurance coverage, going from 17.5% uninsured in 2023 to 20.2% uninsured in 2024. Meanwhile, Elkhart County, IN saw the biggest relative improvement in insurance coverage, going from 16.6% uninsured in 2023 to 13.3% uninsured in 2024.

Generate Key Takeaways Dec. 17—U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, D-Va., is applauding the passage of a bill that will expand access to health care for veterans. Kaine co-sponsored the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act, which has passed the U.S. Senate. Kaine said the bipartisan legislation will cut down on wait times for veterans seeking health care, expand access to home and community-based services for veterans — allowing them to remain in their homes and communities — and improve pay for Department of Veterans Affairs health care employees. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Southwest Virginia that Kaine represents is home to many veterans. ""We have a responsibility to care for our nation's veterans and ensure they can access high-quality health care,"" Kaine said in a prepared statement. ""I'm glad the Senate unanimously passed this bipartisan legislation I cosponsored to allow veterans to more quickly access care, stay in their homes as they age, and provide much-needed support to VA health care workers. I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this bill as quickly as possible."" The legislation is named in honor of former Senator Elizabeth Dole, who has been a leader in supporting veterans and their caregivers. Specifically, the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act would: — Require the VA to coordinate with local Programs for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), to help ensure any veteran enrolled in the VA health system can access such services. — Require the VA to develop a plan for timely scheduling of appointments at medical facilities, to include same-day appointments. — Improves pay for VA health care employees, by giving the VA the authority to provide retroactive pay to health care employees who exceeded annual pay caps between January 8, 2006, and December 31, 2017; require each VA physician, podiatrist, optometrist, and dentist to get an annual pay evaluation; and give the agency additional flexibility to offer recruitment, retention, and relocation bonuses. — Bolster veterans homelessness assistance by increasing the per diem rate the VA can pay to organizations that provide short-term housing from 115% of costs to 133%. — Expand access to home and community-based alternative care programs to veterans at all VA medical facilities. — Increase the amount the VA will pay for health care from 65% to 100% for alternatives to nursing home care, such as home health care, adult day care, and assisted living. — Create a pilot program to provide home health aide services for veterans who reside in communities with a shortage of home health aides.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defended Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for her remarks about UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s shooting and the country’s health care system, calling it “outrageous” Thompson was killed. Sanders joined NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday and was asked about Warren’s comments that the “visceral” response to Thompson’s death is a “warning” about how Americans view the industry. Warren later clarified and noted all violence is wrong. “Elizabeth Warren obviously understands killing and murder and shooting somebody in the back is totally unacceptable,” Sanders said in remarks highlighted by Mediaite . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “But what I think has happened in the last few months is that — what you have seen rising up is people’s anger at a health insurance industry which denies people the health care that they desperately need while they make billions and billions of dollars in profit,” he continued. Thompson was shot and killed earlier this month outside a Manhattan hotel where his company was hosting its annual investor conference. The suspect fled, and a days-long manhunt ensued. Twenty-six-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania last week as the suspected killer . He was arrested on gun charges in Pennsylvania and been charged with murder in New York but is fighting extradition. Mangione has seen a flood of online sympathy and support, with many on social media expressing grievances with the U.S. health care system. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Warren argued in an interview with HuffPost last week that violence is never the answer but acknowledged “people can be pushed only so far.” She said the killing was a warning that if people are pushed far enough, “they lose faith” in government to make change and lose faith in the health care system. Sanders agreed, noting it’s “outrageous” to kill anyone, and “nobody should applaud it.” “I think what we need to ask ourselves when we talk about health care is why we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, why we have a life expectancy which is significantly lower than in other countries, why working-class people die five to 10 years shorter than the people on top,” Sanders said. The Vermont senator said he feels “very strongly” about the issue and said it was “long overdue” for the country to guarantee health care for its citizens.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Chief Analyst & CEO, NAND Research. Follow Author Dec 16, 2024, 02:19pm EST Dec 16, 2024, 03:16pm EST Share Save Comment Healthcare Industry Getty Images As healthcare providers face growing demands, from managing patient care to increasingly complex administrative workflows, the industry seeks transformative solutions to drive efficiency and improve outcomes. AI is one of the most powerful technologies to rise to the challenge, with the potential to revolutionize everything from patient interactions to administrative processes. Generative AI, in particular, promises to change the face of patient care. However, successfully adopting AI in healthcare requires more than just advanced technology—it demands expert integration that ensures the technology fits seamlessly into existing systems and meets regulatory requirements, both on-prem and in the cloud, all while enhancing the patient experience. This is where global system integrators like NTT Data, Deloitte, and Cognizant come into play. These industry giants have deep expertise in AI, cloud and healthcare, making them the natural choice for healthcare providers looking to modernize or deploy AI-based solutions. And they’re already helping to change the face of healthcare. Domain Expertise in Healthcare and AI GSIs have a unique combination of domain knowledge and technological expertise, enabling them to design AI solutions tailored to healthcare providers' needs. NTT Data, for example, has healthcare-specific AI solutions ready to be adapted to new solutions. It recently partnered with Amelia , a leading enterprise Conversational AI platform, to enhance patient engagement and streamline healthcare operations. Amelia provides patients with 24/7 personalized interactions, automating tasks such as appointment scheduling, reminders, and real-time responses to inquiries. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor NTT Data also has its comprehensive digital framework for healthcare, Nucleus for Healthcare , which can be leveraged to create new customer solutions. The framework integrates data, automation, and AI as a centralized platform, consolidating disparate data sources to enable seamless access and analysis for healthcare providers. Deloitte also has a Frontline AI Teammate platform that leverages Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform to create lifelike digital avatars to enhance patient interaction. These alleviate the administrative burden by answering patients' preadmission questions to provide support throughout their healthcare journey and allow medical staff to focus on critical care tasks. Cognizant, another prominent GSI, recently partnered with Google Cloud to deliver healthcare solutions that use large language models to streamline administrative processes such as contract management, appeals resolution, and call center operations. This expertise in blending healthcare-specific AI solutions with real-world operational needs allows healthcare providers to trust that the solutions will be effective, scalable, and compliant with industry regulations. Customization and Integration with Existing Systems One key challenge in deploying AI solutions in healthcare is ensuring the new technologies integrate seamlessly with existing IT systems, workflows, and data architectures. GSIs like NTT Data specialize in precisely this kind of complex integration. NTT Data’s partnerships with forward-thinking healthcare providers, such as Duke Health, focus on building AI-based home care delivery systems that integrate automation, device interoperability, and remote patient monitoring, creating a robust infrastructure for delivering in-home healthcare services. By developing custom AI tools that work with a healthcare provider’s existing platforms, GSIs can ensure smoother transitions, less downtime, and quicker deployment—allowing providers to realize the benefits of AI more rapidly. This ability to tailor solutions to the unique needs of each healthcare organization is a critical advantage that GSIs bring to the table. Compliance and Security Expertise Healthcare is one of the most highly regulated industries in the world, with strict requirements for data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like the HIPAA in the U.S. GSIs are well-versed in these regulatory frameworks and know how to implement AI solutions that protect patient data and comply with legal standards. For instance, Cognizant’s AI solutions for healthcare leverage Google Cloud’s secure infrastructure to protect sensitive data while complying with stringent privacy standards. The GSIs also focus on responsible AI principles to ensure AI is deployed ethically and transparently. This attention to regulatory compliance helps healthcare organizations avoid legal pitfalls while still benefiting from cutting-edge AI innovations. NTT Data’s lead for data-driven health, Dr. John Frownfelter, agrees. He told me that bringing AI into the healthcare realm is fraught with challenges, many related to regulatory compliance. AI opens the door to a world that HIPAA and other regulations didn’t envision. Healthcare regulation in the age of AI is a work in progress. The FDA, for example, provides regulatory oversight for AI in the diagnostic process but not for use in patient records or patient engagement. Yet those data sources need to blend seamlessly to provide a consistent experience for the patient. It simply makes sense for healthcare providers to work with solution providers with the resources and expertise to navigate such a rapidly evolving regulatory and compliance environment. Scalability and Global Reach Another advantage GSIs bring is their ability to scale AI solutions globally. Healthcare systems vary widely between regions, and global system integrators have the experience and resources to adapt solutions to fit different regulatory environments, healthcare models, and cultural expectations. For example, Deloitte's Frontline AI Teammate can have natural, human-like conversations in multiple languages, addressing patient concerns and administrative needs in healthcare systems worldwide. This level of customization and scalability is critical for large healthcare organizations that operate across multiple regions or serve diverse populations. Additionally, GSIs can support healthcare organizations at every stage of their AI journey, from strategy and planning to full-scale deployment and long-term maintenance. This comprehensive approach ensures that AI solutions continue to deliver value as the healthcare provider’s needs evolve. Reducing Administrative Burden and Improving Patient Outcomes The deployment of AI in healthcare is not just about technology—it’s about solving real-world problems, such as reducing the administrative burden on healthcare workers, improving patient satisfaction, and enhancing clinical outcomes. AI-powered digital agents, like those developed by Deloitte and NTT Data, can automate time-consuming tasks like scheduling appointments, answering patient queries, and managing administrative workflows, freeing healthcare providers to focus on more critical aspects of patient care. In the case of NTT Data's collaboration with Duke Health, the focus is on creating a more holistic, AI-driven model of care that allows patients to receive more of their care at home. This reduces strain on hospital resources and offers patients greater convenience and comfort, improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction. I recently asked Emily Norboge, the chief research informatics officer for the Duke Cancer Institute, why Duke partnered with NTT Data for its solution. She said it was simple: using a GSI like NTT Data “removes the roadblocks” to deploying complex systems, allowing the healthcare provider to focus on the business of taking care of patients. At the 2024 HLTH Conference in Las Vegas, NTT Data introduced Wound AI in collaboration with Vantiq and Telemedicine Solutions. This cutting-edge clinical decision support platform uses NTT DATA’s Smart Management Platform to provide comprehensive analytics tools that enhance the speed and accuracy of wound assessments. NTT Data’s Dr. Frownfelter told me that the ultimate ROI for AI-driven healthcare systems “is the patient experience.” It’s easy for anyone who’s had to navigate the US healthcare system to be cynical about that sentiment, but these aren’t empty words for NTT Data and its customers. Beyond the patient's well-being, providers have very real financial incentives to improve the experience. Healthcare providers often don't get paid by insurance companies if a patient is re-admitted after a visit, for example, making post-visit care elemental to the process. AI agents and other generative AI tools will allow better engagement with patients throughout a visit and into aftercare. Dr. Frownfelter pointed me to a recent study that said that, in healthcare environments, AI-powered virtual agents can exhibit empathy comparable to or even exceeding that of human agents. Meanwhile, Cognizant's solutions streamline complex administrative workflows like contract lifecycle management and appeals resolution, driving greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in healthcare organizations' backend operations. Analyst’s Take As healthcare providers increasingly turn to AI to solve critical challenges, GSIs like Deloitte, Cognizant, and NTT Data are the natural partners in this transformation. Their expertise in healthcare-specific AI applications and their ability to integrate, scale, and secure these solutions make them invaluable allies in modernizing healthcare. AI in healthcare is not a one-time deployment; it’s an ongoing journey that requires continuous innovation and support. GSIs, with their broad technological partnerships and deep R&D investments, are perfectly positioned to provide long-term support to healthcare providers. The ability to stay at the cutting edge of AI technology ensures that healthcare organizations can continue to innovate and evolve their AI capabilities over time. But it’s ultimately about more than just the technology. GSIs also offer managed services, ongoing maintenance, and future upgrades to ensure that the AI solutions remain secure, compliant, and optimized for performance as new challenges and opportunities arise in the healthcare sector. By partnering with a GSI, healthcare providers can confidently navigate the complexities of AI adoption and the related technological and regulatory challenges while improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes in the process. With GSIs leading the charge, the future of AI in healthcare is bright, and the benefits for both healthcare providers and patients are already being realized.

I believe that health care reform will likely focus on market-based solutions that empower consumers to make informed decisions, such as evaluating treatment options, utilizing health savings accounts, and choosing their health care providers. Health care reform Trump has long advocated for replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a model driven by free-market principles, which could involve increasing competition among insurance providers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This approach might better meet Americans' coverage needs at a lower cost, aligning with a broader strategy to shift the health care system toward private sector solutions and consumer choice. Lowering medication and health care costs Prescription drug prices continue to be a pressing issue. Trump may push for Medicare to negotiate drug prices or support importing more affordable options from other countries. However, as a pharmacist, I believe we must also incentivize pharmaceutical companies to continue developing innovative medications. Additionally, promoting Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) could help consumers set aside tax-free money for medical expenses and better prepare for unexpected health crises. Expanding telehealth Telehealth grew significantly during the pandemic and remains vital for those in rural areas or with limited mobility. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump may seek to make telehealth more accessible and covered by insurance. Tennessee has already taken several steps in this area, requiring private insurance plans to cover telehealth services, expanding Medicaid for telehealth, and easing restrictions on remote care. This expanded access has especially benefited mental health services in underserved areas. Encouraging innovative care models Trump might aim to reduce regulations on health care providers to foster innovation and lower costs. In Tennessee, we’ve worked to streamline the Certificate of Need (CON) process, which regulates new healthcare facilities, to encourage competition and expand care access. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Simplified licensing for providers and emergency regulatory adaptations have also allowed quicker responses to health care crises, demonstrating the potential benefits of regulatory reform. More: Opinion: Hurricane Helene exposed and exacerbated health disparities in Appalachia Greater state control over Medicaid Increased state control over Medicaid through block grants could be another focus of the Trump administration. Tennessee, for instance, has already adopted a block grant model with TennCare, which allows the state to use savings to reinvest in its Medicaid program. By focusing on preventive care, this approach aims to manage costs while improving health outcomes. Expanding mental health access Mental health services are essential, and Trump’s administration might work to integrate mental health support into primary care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Tennessee has made strides by funding mental health resources, establishing crisis programs like the 988 Mental Health Crisis Hotline , and incorporating mental health services in schools. These efforts reflect a commitment to expanding access and addressing the growing demand for mental health support across the state. Promoting individual health responsibility Beyond government policy, individual responsibility in managing personal health is crucial. ""Outlive"" by Peter Attia, a New York Times bestseller, discusses extending “health span” through balanced nutrition, regular exercise, quality sleep, mental wellness, and proactive health screenings. Focusing on these areas can significantly impact both lifespan and quality of life. Adopting a holistic approach to health that includes mental and emotional well-being, along with regular check-ups and screenings, allows individuals to take control of their health. Looking forward, I am optimistic about the health care innovations that the next four years will bring. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As a state senator and health care business owner, I am proud to contribute to advancing health care solutions and addressing the challenges facing Tennessee and the nation. This period presents an opportunity to implement effective, sustainable health care reforms that enhance access, control costs, and empower individuals to lead healthier lives.

Article Insights Foley & Lardner are most popular: within Government, Public Sector, Insurance and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) The Massachusetts Senate proposed an amendment on Monday December 2, 2024, that would delay implementation and enforcement of the 2021 Patients First Act addressing health care cost transparency. Section 31 of the amendment would replace the current implementation date of January 1, 2025, with January 1, 2027, providing an additional two years for providers to prepare for the additional notice requirements accompanying the law. Governor Charles Baker signed into law An Act Promoting a Resilient Health Care System that Puts Patients First (Patients First Act) on January 1, 2021, to address perceived concerns regarding out-of-network (OON) billing. Under the Patients First Act, health care providers will be required to notify patients if the provider is in or out of the patient's health plan. The Patients First Act has been the Massachusetts legislative attempt to address the challenges in private insurance and health care coverage market — a compliment to the Federal No Surprises Act, discussed in prior blog posts here and here . Recognizing the challenges of implementing this law, the Commonwealth had already extended and re-extended the implementation and enforcement date for the Patients First Act. With the most recent extension, implementation and enforcement will now begin January 1, 2027, and health care providers will be required to notify patients about charges and payments for proposed admissions, procedures, services, and referrals that are specific to the patient's health insurance carrier. Failing to comply with these requirements may lead to penalties of up to US$2,500 for each instance of noncompliance issued by the Department of Public Health (DPH). Impacted Health Care Providers The requirements of the Patients First Act apply to health care providers, defined to include doctors, dentists, registered nurses, social workers, pharmacists, chiropractors, psychologists, hospitals, clinics — including community health centers — and nursing homes. Notice Requirements The Patients First Act requires health care providers to notify patients or potential patients, verbally or in writing, of whether the provider participates in the patient's health plan. This notice must be given upon scheduling an admission, procedure, or service that is related to a non-emergency medical condition or upon request by the patient. Once the initial notice is given, patients can waive this requirement for subsequent admissions, procedures, or services that are part of a continued course of treatment. The notification also varies based on whether a provider is in-network, meaning the provider does participate in the patient's health plan, or out-of-network, in which case the provider does not participate in a patient's health plan. If a provider is in-network, at the time of scheduling an admission, procedure or service that is not for an emergency medical condition, the health care provider must provide notice that the provider participates in the patient's health insurance plan. The patient may request the following information from their provider: The allowed amount and any facility fees for the admission, procedure, or service, to be disclosed by the health care provider within two days of the patient's request; and If a provider is unable to quote a specific amount due to the inability to predict specific treatment or diagnostic codes, the provider must disclose the estimated maximum amount and any facility fees. Patients may also obtain additional information in real time about applicable out-of-pocket costs from their insurance carrier's toll-free number or website. If a provider is OON, and if the appointment was scheduled more than seven days in advance of the admission, procedure, or service: the health care provider must inform the patient that the health care provider does not participate in the patient's health plan verbally and in writing at the time of scheduling (no less than seven days before the appointment). Providers who fail to provide this notice are prohibited from billing the insured beyond any applicable copayment, coinsurance, or deductible that would be payable if the insured received the service from a provider who participates in the patient's health plan. If a provider is OON, and if the appointment was scheduled less than seven days in advance of the admission, procedure, or service: the health care provider must verbally inform the patient that the health care provider does not participate in the patient's health plan, at the time of scheduling (no less than two days or as soon as practicable before the appointment). The provider must also give written notice upon the patient's arrival for the appointment. Providers who fail to provide such notice are similarly prohibited from billing the insured beyond any applicable copayment, coinsurance, or deductible that would be payable if the insured received the service from a provider who participates in the patient's health plan. Regardless of the timing of the appointment scheduling, if a provider is OON, the health care provider must give notice of the charge and amount of any facility fees for the admission, procedure, or service at the time of scheduling. The provider must also give the patient notice that the patient will be responsible for the charges not covered through the patient's plan and notice that the patient may be able to obtain the admission, procedure or service at a lower cost from a health care provider who participates in the patient's health plan. Referral Requests: In the case of referrals, requirements depend on whether a provider is referring the patient to another provider or whether the provider is directly scheduling, ordering, or otherwise arranging health care services for a patient with another provider. When a provider refers a patient to another provider, the referring provider must: Disclose if the referred provider is part of or represented by the same provider organization 1 as the referring provider; Inform the patient that the referred provider may not participate in the patient's health plan, that there may be applicable out-of-network rates, and that the patient has an opportunity to verify whether the referred provider participates in their health plan prior to making an appointment or agreeing to use the provider's services; and Provide the patient with sufficient information about the referred provider so that the patient may obtain additional information about whether the referred provider participates in their health plan and any applicable out-of-pocket costs should the patient use the referred provider's services. If a provider is directly scheduling, ordering, or otherwise arranging health care services for a patient with another provider, before doing so, the referring provider must verify whether the referred provider is in-network and notify the patient if the referred provider is either OON or the referring provider cannot verify whether the referred provider is in-network. Penalties The law authorizes DPH to penalize health care providers who fail to comply with these requirements, with a penalty of up to US$2,500 in each instance. Effective January 1, 2027, the Department will accept and investigate complaints. The initial penalty amount will be US$0 to give providers time to come into compliance. Any patient who has not received the required notice may submit a complaint, in writing, to the health care provider's professional licensing board, or in the case of a licensed facility, to the DPH Bureau of Health Care Safety and Quality. The board will notify the health care provider of the complaint and give the provider ten days to submit written documentation demonstrating compliance with the notice requirements. Moving Forward With increasing discourse about pricing transparency in health care costs nationwide, the Commonwealth's choice to pass the Patients First Act supplements similar efforts made in the federal government. However, the recurring extensions of implementation and enforcement reflect the extraordinary complexities that come with proper application of this law to providers. Moving forward, these challenges may serve as a guide for other states — particularly in New England — for responding to conversations surrounding health care pricing and anticipating the difficulties that come with resolving such a complex matter. Providers and policymakers in other states should take the necessity of extending implementation of this new law by six years as evidence that even a well-intentioned transparency law such as this should be carefully considered and discussed with the provider community before being enacted. Footnote 1. G.L. c. 111, s. 228 specifically references G.L. c. 6D, s1, which defines ""provider organization"" as follows: ""[A]ny corporation, partnership, business trust, association or organized group of persons, which is in the business of health care delivery or management, whether incorporated or not that represents 1 or more health care providers in contracting with carriers for the payments of heath care services; provided, that ""provider organization"" shall include, but not be limited to, physician organizations, physician-hospital organizations, independent practice associations, provider networks, accountable care organizations and any other organization that contracts with carriers for payment for health care services.""

On April 22, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights announced its final rule entitled ""HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy"" (the ""Reproductive Health Care Privacy Rule"" or ""the Rule""). The Rule goes into effect on December 23, 2024. The following is a summary of the Reproductive Health Care Privacy Rule as it relates to strengthening privacy protections for reproductive health services (including abortion): Covered health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses (""Covered Entities"") and their Business Associates are prohibited from disclosure of protected health information (""PHI"") for either: (i) conducting a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into or imposing criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided; or (ii) the identification of any person for the purpose of conducting such investigation or imposing such liability. The prohibition on disclosure applies where the Covered Entity or Business Associate has reasonably determined that one or more of the following conditions exist: (i) the reproductive health care is legal in the state where it is provided; (ii) the reproductive health care is protected or authorized by Federal law, the U.S. Constitution regardless of the state law in which the health care is provided; or (iii) the reproductive health care was provided by a person other than the Covered Entity and the Covered Entity has no knowledge that the reproductive health care was unlawful (e.g., it would be unlawful for a service to be provided by an unlicensed person). Covered Entities and Business Associates, when receiving a request for PHI related to reproductive health care, must obtain a signed attestation that the use or disclosure is not for one of the prohibited purposes described above. The attestation requirement applies when the request is for: Health oversight activities; Judicial and administrative proceedings; Law enforcement purposes; Disclosures to coroners or medical examiners. The attestation puts the requestor on notice of the potential criminal penalties. A model attestation can be found at https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/model-attestation.pdf . Covered Entities must revise their Notice of Privacy Practices (""NPP"") to address the privacy protections for reproductive health care services. Please also note that providers who create or maintain Substance Use Disorder treatment records subject to 42 C.F.R. Part 2 are also required to revise their NPPs to align their privacy practices with HIPAA under the Part 2 Final Rule published earlier this year. Disclosures to law enforcement as currently set forth in HIPAA have not changed. However, such disclosures are permissive and not mandated. Consequently, such disclosures to law enforcement where the individual is suspected of having obtained reproductive health care services are only permitted when all three of the following conditions are met: The disclosure is not subject to the prohibition discussed herein; The disclosure is required by law; and The disclosure meets all applicable conditions of HIPAA. If a Covered Entity is making a disclosure required by law, the law must compel the Covered Entity to make a disclosure. For example, when law enforcement has a court order requiring the Covered Entity to produce PHI regarding reproductive health care services, HIPAA permits - but does not require - the Covered Entity to disclose PHI. However, if the Covered Entity does disclose PHI, it must be limited to what is expressly authorized by the court order. While the Reproductive Health Care Privacy Rule permits Covered Entities to disclose PHI when necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public, Covered Entities should proceed with caution. According to the American Medical Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, it would be inconsistent with professional standards of ethical conduct to make such a disclosure of PHI to law enforcement or others regarding an individual's interest, intent, or prior experience with reproductive health care.Ultimately, the issue of disclosure will require a factual and legal analysis and for that reason, consultation with counsel is recommended. If you believe that someone's health privacy rights have been violated, you can file a complaint in the OCR complaint portal at https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/smartscreen/main.jsf .

(NASDAQ:APLS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLS) is a biotech company focusing on complement therapeutics. The company sells two drugs. The first is subcutaneous pegcetacoplan for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) which was approved in 2021. The second, approved in February 2023, is Syfovre for the treatment of Geographic Atrophy (GA). Syfovre has shown compelling data out to 36 months and its launch has been going extraordinarily well. Outside of Empaveli and Syfovre, Apellis also has a growing pipeline of complement therapeutics focused on rare disease and ophthalmology. Weakness the past several months is attributed to lack of approval of Syfovre in Europe, the launch and marketing messages of a competitive drug from Astellas Pharma named Izervay, reimbursement dynamics between the two drugs and a slower than expected growth of the overall GA market. While we believe the market opportunity for GA and that growth in the treated GA patient population is large enough to support solid growth for both drugs, we have also come to appreciate that the safety issues seen with Syfove in the Summer of 2023 have complicated the marketing message for these new drugs. This has led to slower growth in the treated GA patient population than we expected, which has led us to decrease our position in Apellis. We continue to believe in the ultimate opportunity of Syfovre but have decreased our position size to more appropriately align with our updated view of the revenue growth and peak sales potential for Syfovre.” A biomedical scientist in a lab coat conducting research on biopharmaceutical compounds.

(NASDAQ:PHAT) is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company that markets vonoprazan under the brand name Voquezna, an oral once a day pill for GERD. The drug was approved for erosive GERD in November 2023 and recently received approval for non-erosive GERD. This is the first new mechanism for GERD in 30+ years and the company aims to capture the patients that are not sufficiently addressed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This was a name that had fallen off investors radars because the company had pre-approval manufacturing issues and they are launching into a genericized market. However, these manufacturing issues were resolved before the drug launched and our early physician work indicated a high unmet need and a strong desire to prescribe despite the availability of generics PPIs. The Voquenza launch has been strengthened in recent months driven by the robust and rapid commercial payer coverage, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a second indication for a larger patient population (non-erosive GERD (NERD)), and positive patient and physician experiences with the drug. We believe we are in the early innings of the launch and that current consensus is not reflective of the ultimate potential off the drug.” A scientist in a laboratory smiling with a test tube in hand, representing the company’s research in biotechnology.

But this year’s International Health Coverage Day comes amid global failures to dedicate adequate public resources to health care, undermining the right to health for people around the world. UHC, a framework developed by the UN where everyone has access to affordable, good quality health care, can further the realization of the human right to health. Governments have made public commitments towards this goal, reflecting their human rights obligations to prevent and treat infectious and noncommunicable diseases, and to ensure the availability and accessibility of quality healthcare facilities and services, including maternal and postpartum care. Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Expenditure Database earlier this year found that, when governments spent more on health care through public means, people had greater access to these essential healthcare goods and services. But we also found that most governments were falling short of key public healthcare spending benchmarks, and that many were scaling back public support for health care. Shockingly, we found that in 47 countries, individuals and their households collectively paid more out of pocket for health care than their governments spent on it in 2021. These out-of-pocket expenses generally increase inequalities and create discriminatory barriers to health care based on income, widening gaps in quality of life and life expectancy. The cost of these user fees can also put other rights at risk, including public participation, housing, water, and education. Countries around the world ought to take this year’s International Universal Health Coverage Day to heed the calls of billions around the world who lack full health care access, and ensure officials dedicate proper resources for the realization of the right to health through UHC. This means spending the equivalent of at least 5 percent of GDP or 15 percent of government expenditures on health care and reversing reductions in funding. And to increase public resources for health care, governments need to look at eliminating tax abuses and focus on progressive taxes. It is also an opportunity for creditor governments and institutions to assess what they need to do to ensure the governments they financially support can fund their healthcare systems.

By Kiara Alfonseca December 11, 2024, 5:56 PM The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with the alleged grievances of the suspect charged in his murder, have thrust the country's health care industry into the spotlight. At the time of his arrest, suspect Luigi Mangione reportedly had with him writings that criticize companies in the U.S. health care industry for being the most expensive in the world, according to law enforcement. The writer also allegedly suggests that the U.S. continuously ranks lower than other developed nations in life expectancy, reportedly stating: ""They continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it."" The events surrounding Thompson's murder have spurred a national conversation about the rising cost and, for some, inaccessibility of health care, which has been a longstanding concern for Americans. The U.S. on average spends twice as much or more per person on health care per capita than some comparable high-income countries, according to KFF , a nonprofit health policy research, polling and news organization.

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Health costs have generally grown faster than inflation, according to researchers , contributing to the struggles faced by many Americans to afford health care and drugs, even with insurance. One 2019 study published in Health Affairs found that despite spending more on average for health care, Americans aren't getting more or better care than residents in other developed countries. About half of U.S. adults said it is hard to afford health care costs, according to a KFF study – forcing some to skip or postpone needed care. One in four adults said that they have skipped or held off on health care they needed because of the price tag, KFF reported; of the uninsured adults surveyed, 61% said they have gone without needed care because of the cost. A KFF study also found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults reported having medical or dental debt, which translates to an estimated 100 million adults. About 1 in 5 said they might never be able to pay off their debt, and about 1 in 7 say they have been denied access ""to a hospital, doctor, or other provider"" because of those unpaid bills. This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. UnitedHealth Group via AP Kaye Pestaina, the vice president at KFF and director of the Patient and Consumer Protections program, told ABC News there's a laundry list of frustrations Americans face in the country's health care system. ""Folks are happy when they do have coverage, and then the expectation is, when they need it, it'll be there for them,"" she said, while explaining that it isn't always the case. She lists examples like when patients are told their prescribed care isn't medically necessary or are denied coverage , when there are more out-of-pocket costs than expected or when care they need isn't covered by insurance. An analysis of HealthCare.gov data found that roughly 17% of in-network claims were denied by insurers in 2021.

""The system is so complicated for most people, we don't have the time or the information that we need to get our problems addressed,"" said Pestaina. U.S. adults owe at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to one analysis of Survey of Income and Program Participation data. Meanwhile, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies have racked up billions in profits annually.

Mike Bradley/Bloomberg via Getty Images Pestaina believes the for-profit health care system has contributed to increasing prices. Harvard professor David Cutler points to several key contributors to higher costs – including the administrative costs and price hikes of drugs and hospital care. Harvard Medical School researchers found that administrative costs alone account for up to 25% of health care costs: ""Running the whole system is more expensive in the U.S. than elsewhere,"" Cutler said. Cutler has pointed out that the ability for pharmaceutical companies to price their medications ""without constraint is a recipe for premature death"" -- with prices being higher in American than other countries. The U.S. Governmental Accountability Office found in 2020 that the estimated prices for 20 selected brand prescription drugs were more than 2 to 4 times higher than prices in other countries such as Australia, Canada and France. Researchers say Americans are right to feel frustrated about all this when it comes to health care. ""It's not just: Push a button and the thing goes away. But it's not undoable either, and we shouldn't be okay with doing nothing,"" said Cutler.

The global Healthcare IT market is projected to reach USD 834.35 billion by 2029 from USD 420.23 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 14.7% from 2024 to 2029. The widespread adoption of technology advancement solutions is accelerating the growth of the healthcare IT market. According to the Healthcare article published in August 2024, AI-powered clinical decision support systems assist oncologists by making evidence-based therapy recommendations. It was found that AI helped in improving the dignaostics accuracy by 10 - 15%. Moreover, increased adoptions of EHRs improve data accessibility and drive the demand for advanced healthcare IT solutions. The telehealth solutions segment is projected to be the largest segment in the clinical healthcare IT market Based on the type of clinical HCIT solutions, the telehealth solutions segment is projected to be the largest segment during the forecast period. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for significant changes in many sectors, particularly in the healthcare industry. One of the most notable transformations has been the rapid adoption and scaling up of telehealth solutions. This is majorly attributed to the government initiatives for eHealth across the globe. For instance, the WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025, the Slaintecare Action Plan, the HSE Corporate Plan, and Healthy Ireland government initiatives are promoting the development of telehealth solutions. Thus, there is an increasing need to improve the quality of care, growing consolidation among healthcare providers, and the rising adoption of digital and connected healthcare technologies.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways If Americans think healthcare in the United States is bad, they should “go to Canada and try to find a specialist,” suggested Dana Perino on “The Five” Tuesday night. “Go to Scotland. Go to England. It is a disaster, right?” she added. Perino insisted that her late step-mother-in-law struggled to find medical treatment for a UTI, presumably in Canada, Scotland, or England, for 18 weeks. “And I can understand how frustrated people get on all sides of the thing, but when you say that health care is a right, as Bernie Sanders did today, he said he disagreed with the violence, but he said, but he’s showing us what people have come to know, that healthcare is a right. Okay, if you believe that, how are you paying for it?” Perino added. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Of course as is usual for right wing claims about health care, what Perino says isn’t actually true. In fact, the United States regularly ranks behind other developed nations in health care outcomes. For instance, in 2021 the Commonwealth Fund, a U.S.-based private nonprofit foundation that offers grants for health care and financially backs health-related research, compared the healthcare systems of 11 high-income countries. In the first section of the report the country’s health care system performances were assessed across five categories: access to care, care process, administrative efficiency, equity and health care outcomes. The list of countries included Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The US ranked last in every category except care process, in which the country clocked in as the second-best. The overall ranking of the United States’ health care system was 11/11 – last place. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The fourth section of the report also revealed that while the United States is a leader in health care spending, the country is again in last place in terms of health care system performance. “The U.S. has the poorest performance on the affordability subdomain, scoring much lower than even the next-lowest country, Switzerland (Exhibit 5). Compared to residents of the U.S., residents of the Netherlands, the U.K., Norway, and Germany are much less likely to report that their insurance denied payment of a claim or paid less than expected,” the report’s authors found. “Residents of these countries are also less likely to report difficulty in paying medical bills.” Of course, there is always the possibility Perino meant what she said positively. Perhaps she actually was advising Americans who are fed up with the overpriced, often cruel system they’re stuck in to check out something better instead. We’ll keep an eye out for further commentary on this topic. You can watch the clip from “The Five” in the video below.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 continues to send shockwaves through corporate America, and raised fears it will deter highly qualified candidates from aspiring to the role of chief executive. All of this compelled Andrew Chastain, the CEO of the health care-focused search firm WittKieffer, to publicly speak out on the threats of violence against workers in the industry that have become all too common in recent years. “Leadership is hard. It requires courage and conviction to make decisions you feel are in the best interest of your organization and those you serve. While weighing the risks of decisions and options, health care leaders should not have to worry that these decisions could make them targets,"" wrote Chastain in a public letter posted on Tuesday to LinkedIn by WittKieffer’s CFO, Erin Lavelle. Chastain added that, following Thompson's murder, he's heard from many of the leaders expressing a ""newfound fear of simply doing your jobs and serving as the public face of your organizations ... 'Could it happen to me?’ you wonder.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He went on to describe Thompson's killing as “symptomatic” of a wave of hatred directed at health care workers across organizations, especially physicians, nurses, and staff who tend to patients at their bedside. “Violence aimed at health care workers is on the rise,” Chastain writes. “These things weigh on all of us who work in health care, and especially those of you who live it on a daily basis.” He encouraged the health care leaders to remember why they chose the work that they do and the impact they have on people’s lives. The killing of Thompson has also resulted in a wider discussion of many Americans struggling to receive and pay for medical care . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “There’s been a push and pull between the health care organizations, insurance companies, and the government on how things are funded and paid,” Chris Cozzoni, partner and U.S. health care investment co-leader at Mercer, previously told Fortune . And that’s going to continue going forward, he said. On top of increased violence, health care executives are also facing financial strain in the health care industry right now. Post-pandemic, government support went away, and at the same time, there was a huge amount of inflation, especially wage inflation within health care, Cozzoni said “They’re still working to get over that, and that’s not going away in the short term,” he said. Mercer projects a deficit of over 100,000 health care workers in the U.S. by 2028. Luigi Mangione was charged on Tuesday with murdering Thompson, according to an unsealed criminal complaint from New York, and he is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, Fortune reported .

Democrats and Republicans have opposing views on the government providing health care. The poll shows that a little more than half of the country approved of the Affordable Care Act. A recent poll shows that 62% of Americans say it’s the federal government’s responsibility to make sure everyone has health care coverage. Gallup gathered its results for the poll from telephone interviews conducted Nov. 6-20, with a sample of 1,001 adults 18 years and older living in the U.S. and Washington, D.C. Results of the survey are from Gallup’s annual Health and Healthcare survey. RELATED: Americans' view of health care quality and coverage hits 24-year low, poll finds The poll found that between 2000 and 2008, a majority of Americans believed that the government should make sure all people in the nation have health care coverage. Among political parties, 32% of Republicans believe the government has a responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, while 90% of Democrats say the government should ensure everyone has health care coverage. Additionally, 65% of independents say the government is responsible for making sure everyone has health coverage. According to Gallup, Democrats and Republicans have opposing stances on the best ways to provide health care, with 71% of Democrats supporting a government-run health care system and 20% favoring a private system. But 76% of Republicans endorse private insurance and 21% favor a government-run system. Meanwhile, 47% of independents want a government system, and 49% prefer a private one. Separately, Gallup noted that the country's views changed during President Barack Obama’s time in office as he worked to enhance health care coverage in the country with the Affordable Health Care Act. Approximately, 54% of Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act. But support has hovered around 50% or more since Obama left office in 2017, but the health care law was less popular during his tenure, ranging from 37% to 48% approval, the poll shows. Moreover, approximately 94% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans approve of the health care law compared to 53% of independents who support the law. With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January, Gallup noted that support for the Affordable Care Act is higher today than it was during Trump’s first term in office. Trump and Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he even discussed replacing it during this year’s presidential campaign, but the poll noted that it may be a tough task for him to change the law.

Mayhew PUBLISHED: December 9, 2024 at 1:26 PM EST Long wait times for health care appointments are not only frustrating, but they can also be detrimental to health outcomes. As consumers, we expect relatively short wait times for an MRI or CT scan. We hope to see the cardiologist, neurologist or psychiatrist with minimal delay. We anticipate that our hip replacement surgery can be scheduled soon to ease our pain. For our primary care physician or pediatrician, timely appointments are vital. But when it comes to an emergency or traumatic event with an urgent need for hospital care, it is crucial that our hospital’s emergency department assesses our needs quickly and has staffed beds available for immediate inpatient care.

Mayhew) Meeting these expectations is heavily contingent upon the availability of doctors, nurses, imaging technicians, phlebotomists, behavioral health professionals and so many other health care staff. More than two years after emerging from the pandemic, hospitals continue to address historically high health care workforce vacancy rates and turnover rates. And that means Florida’s hospitals must be laser-focused on growing, supporting and retaining staff members to meet the Sunshine State’s growing population of people whose health care needs must be met today and tomorrow. There are several, simple reasons for the nationwide shortage in nurses following the pandemic. Many nurses opted to travel around the country in response to the pandemic, some retired early, and others transitioned from 24/7 hospital care to physician practices or left the health care profession altogether because of the stress and intensity of the pandemic. As a result, Florida’s hospitals need to train and retain health care professionals to meet the health and wellness needs of the many individuals and families who have migrated to our great state over the last several years. Hospitals have adopted a multifaceted approach to address these workforce challenges. The good news is that hospitals’ recruitment and retention efforts are paying off. The state’s nurse vacancy rate is down more than 60% this year, and the turnover rate has fallen 45% since 2022, according to a survey conducted by the Florida Hospital Association. Florida’s health care workforce is outperforming the nation, with a hospital nurse vacancy rate of 7.8%, compared to the nation’s 9.9%, and a 17.5% nurse turnover rate, lower than the national rate of 18.4%. We’ve seen similar decreases in vacancy and turnover rates among many health care-related fields. Fortunately, students remain highly interested in pursuing various health care professions. Partnerships between hospitals and their local community colleges and universities are helping to expand nursing and other health programs and grow the future pipeline of these critical professions. Hospitals have established earn-while-you-learn programs to support their staff members aspiring to advance their degrees. Many hospitals provide scholarships and tuition reimbursement programs to support local high school students and staff pursuing health care. Additionally, hospitals are partnering with local high schools to offer health care certificate programs, including certification for nursing assistants. By fostering the initial health care career ladder, these students can graduate from high school with their certificate and immediately be employed in the health care industry. Beyond growing the future pipeline of health care staff, hospitals recognize that a positive and supportive workplace environment is essential to recruiting and retaining exceptional health care professionals. Hospitals continually evaluate their hiring and training programs to reinforce the confidence and capabilities of new staff. Hospitals also often offer nurse residency programs, apprenticeships, expanded days and times for student clinical rotations, and implement numerous other efforts to retain staff. For nurses considering retirement, hospitals offer opportunities to leave the intensity of the bedside while continuing to provide care through remote patient monitoring. As health care technology rapidly changes, hospitals are leveraging these emerging technologies to reduce the administrative burden so their staff can spend more time with patients and less time completing paperwork. The Florida Legislature and Gov. DeSantis consistently demonstrate leadership, creating and funding educational and training programs that support the Sunshine State’s health care workforce needs. Together, we can make Florida the national leader in building and supporting a strong health care workforce that achieves the shared goal of providing the right care at the right time and at the right location for the best possible outcomes.

By Eric Muschler December 7, 2024 at 11:31PM Chris Lundegaard (Provided) Comment Gift Share Listen Opinion editor’s note: Strib Voices publishes a mix of guest commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute, click here . ••• One year ago, my brother-in-law, Chris Lundegaard, was murdered. He was stabbed to death at a bus stop in Edina, waiting to ride home after picking up some groceries the night before Thanksgiving. The stabbing was an act of random violence. Chris had no affiliation to Adam Garcia, the man charged in his killing. Garcia had become homeless, is schizophrenic and had a history of minor brushes with the law, including trespassing, loitering, and peeing in public. When I watched the TV news report of the murder I might have registered the tragedy and moved on, as we all do from terrible stories of violence we see on the news, were the victim not my brother-in-law. After all, this is the narrative that many hold regarding homeless individuals — the desperation of living on the street and the “bad character” of people who put themselves into that position in the first place. I know better. My family experience tells me otherwise. My oldest brother, Jeff, was schizophrenic. At his worst when he was self-medicating (meaning stopped taking his medicine), he became paranoid, screwed his apartment windows shut and bought a gun. Off his meds, he disassociated himself from his family, leading him on a downward spiral toward, very likely, homelessness. Health care systems and affordable housing providers know the impact that stable housing has on the health and well-being of an individual and a community. They are inextricably linked. Housing is health care. In Jeff’s case, his erratic behavior and the advocacy of his family led to his placement in the state mental hospital in St. Peter. That is probably the most expensive form of stable housing, behind only the emergency room, where we see many homeless individuals end up. Jeff got back on his medication and was released after a few months. He settled in Winona in a Section 8 apartment close to a nearby drop-in center where he went to take his meds daily. I am pleased to say that with stable housing and minimal support, he lived a content and happy life in the Winona community for 20 years. He read, wrote poetry, dabbled in photography and remained an important part of our family, always there to celebrate the holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas, his favorites. When we would visit, he loved taking us to the Minnesota Marine Art Museum or the Great River Shakespeare Festival. He had relationships with other residents in his building and with drop-in center staff. When he died of a heart attack during the pandemic, it was that support system in the community that alerted us. I believe this family history led me to my current job as the director of housing and health equity at the nonprofit Greater Minnesota Housing Fund (GMHF). I work to bring together two complex systems — health care and housing. In partnership, we explore new and innovative ways to link and advance investments in housing that improve community health outcomes while at the same time reducing health care costs. Post-COVID, the link between housing stability and health has become more widely acknowledged. Health systems now accept that housing stability is the foundation for addressing multiple social determinants of health. Research shows these determinants, such as education, nutrition, socio-economic status and housing, account for 80% of a person’s or family’s health. Our health care systems are working to understand these factors more. However, 96% of health care financial resources are still targeted at supporting medical services in doctor’s offices, clinics and hospitals, while only 4% are targeted at the 80% of community health factors that dictate a person’s health, according to one estimate. This is an obvious mismatch. Health care systems are now beginning to shift focus to prevention, which is a much-needed change. I believe deeply that Chris’ death was preventable. His assailant could have been my brother had he been in a stable housing situation instead of spiraling at a bus stop. Had he had a place to live, with support that stabilized his life, that up-front investment could have prevented the pain, loss and spiraling costs that Garcia now drives in treatment, jail (housing) and court systems. (Garcia is still in the court system awaiting evaluation, determination of competence and a murder trial.) My organization knows exactly how difficult it is to build and sustain affordable housing with support services given the resources available within the housing and community development sector. This is where health care funding and housing finance should come together. The affordable housing industry in Minnesota has been a leader in connecting housing and services that provide stability. Our community built some of the country’s earliest supportive housing developments. Supportive housing is a highly effective strategy that combines affordable housing with coordinated services to help people struggling with chronic physical and mental health issues maintain stable housing and receive appropriate health care. Because of the link between housing stability and health outcomes, the health care industry benefits from service-enriched housing, as Jeff himself did. Minnesota has an opportunity to lead the way in how we continue to build better housing with health and stability, driving integrated investments to build and operate supportive housing. But more action is needed. Currently, there are a few separate reviews exploring health-care-related support for housing in Minnesota. One is a process led by the Office of Medicaid in the Minnesota Department of Human Services that is creating a road map to implement interventions to address unmet health-related social needs, including housing, which could be reimbursed by using existing funding through Medicaid. Another is a review of an existing state program, Housing Stabilization Services, which should be more useful to supportive housing developments given its goals. The housing industry would be able to leverage these opportunities to deliver and build on successful supportive-housing models. These efforts could provide insights to the Minnesota Legislature in 2025. The report with recommendations for a road map is due to the Legislature in March. Medicaid waivers are increasingly being used around the country to support housing-related services that help individuals and families stabilize and sustain their housing as the most critical social determinant of health. Currently, 19 other states have been approved for health-related social needs (HRSN) waivers, allowing them to expand the use of Medicaid resources to provide housing-related services. Four of those (Arizona, New York, Oregon and Washington) have approval to use Medicaid to pay for up to six months of rent/temporary housing and utility costs while individuals are transitioning from homelessness to housing stability. Medicaid spending on housing stability is a wise investment for health care systems at a time when Minnesotans need housing the most. More committed investment from Medicaid and the health care industry in the housing industry can keep other systems from absorbing the rising costs related to homelessness, encampments, policing, prisons and the courts. Funding through the health care industry for stable housing will improve people’s health, help affordable housing to be more financially sustainable, and make communities safer and healthier places for all. Linking these complex systems and providing sustainable supportive housing for people like Garcia and my brother Jeff can offer a life-changing path for our most vulnerable citizens.

The AHS Department of Pediatrics was selected from a highly competitive pool of entries and honored in the care redesign category. The Quality Leaders Awards are administered by the California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (CAPH), in partnership with the California Health Care Safety Net Institute (SNI), to celebrate public health care systems that demonstrate outstanding efforts in advancing quality, equity, and access to health care for California’s underserved populations. AHS is the safety-net health care system of Alameda County. Its Department of Pediatrics operates four pediatric clinics across Alameda County at the Wilma Chan Highland Hospital Campus, Eastmont Wellness Center, Hayward Wellness, and Newark Wellness. In 2021, AHS’ Department of Pediatrics convened an interdisciplinary workgroup to analyze quality metrics, identify health disparities among its patient population, design interventions, and implement them across the health system. Their efforts resulted in significant improvements in all metrics of quality pediatric care, such as completion rates of well-child and adolescent visits and rates of up-to-date immunization. In addition, the racial disparities found in rates of well-child visits and adolescent immunizations among Black pediatric patients were significantly reduced. The Department of Pediatrics metric performance puts them in the top 90th percentile in the delivery of quality care. “I’m extremely proud that our team successfully identified and addressed inequities in these key measures of the health care we provide to children in our community. The Pediatric Department’s success has been recognized by the State of California and our Medi-Cal managed care health plan, which invited us to share our strategies with other pediatric practices in the county. I hope the best practices we’ve identified will be helpful to pediatric departments across the county and beyond,” said Dr. Pamela Simms-Mackey, chair of pediatrics and chief of graduate medical education at AHS. Watch a video about AHS’ Department of Pediatrics care here . “Ensuring Alameda County children are healthy is critical to our mission of caring, healing, teaching and serving all,” said AHS CEO James Jackson. “Our children deserve the best care we can provide, and by significantly reducing racial disparities in wellness checks and immunizations, we demonstrate our commitment to providing high quality, equitable care to all. Congratulations to our entire pediatrics team for this remarkable achievement.” The Quality Leaders Awards were established over 20 years ago to recognize and celebrate public health care systems that go above and beyond in delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. Awarded annually, the Quality Leaders Awards shine a light on initiatives that address pressing community health challenges through innovative, evidence-based approaches. Each submission is reviewed by a panel of health care experts who evaluate entries based on key judging parameters, including innovation, equity, impact on population health, care redesign, and measurable improvements in patient outcomes. “Our award recipients are true leaders, showing what’s possible when innovative thinking and a deep commitment to health equity come together,” said Giovanna Giuliani, executive director of SNI, and Erica Murray, president and CEO of CAPH, in a joint statement. “These public health care systems set a high standard for quality, access, and compassion, demonstrating the critical role of public health care in addressing the needs of California’s underserved communities.

https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/12/04/opinion-the-power-of-workplace-health-care/,,Opinion : Bring health care nearer to – or into – Maine workplaces,20241204T093000Z,,centralmaine.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"This time of year, many employers begin “open enrollment,” where employees explore and choose health care benefits for the following year. With the complexity of health care today, this process can often be confusing, stressful and costly. According to a Kaiser survey (2018-2024), annual health insurance premiums for family coverage increased from $6,438 in 2000 to $25,572 in 2024. Despite this discouraging news, there are creative solutions evolving in the marketplace that can help manage costs and increase access to care for both employees and employers. Employers are often forces for good beyond the business at the core of their mission. An increasing number of employers are implementing alternative solutions to traditional health care, like onsite and near-site clinics, making health care more affordable and accessible to their employees. Data over the years confirm that preventive care provided where people work reduces the overall cost of health care and saves lives. In Maine today, several companies offer their employees access to care, at no or low cost to the employee, at or near their place of employment. This approach reduces the cost of health care for employees and saves them time and money by providing access through the convenience of same-day appointments. Many employers know employees can’t easily leave the job for medical care. By bringing health care directly to them, this model removes barriers to access. In addition, this model maximizes the value of employers’ health investments ensuring employees get the care they need, when they need it – without disrupting their work or daily lives. It also helps with recruitment, boosts employee engagement and retention and reduces emergency room visits. These clinics are a visual reminder that an employer sees employees as their greatest asset. How does this model work? When partnering with Maine employers, the goal is more than simply setting up onsite clinics. The aim must be to build strong, lasting relationships that integrate the onsite care team with the company’s overall health and wellness strategy. These partnerships then create the trust needed to support employees on their personal health journeys. Advertisement Preventive care is at the heart of this delivery model. From routine screenings to wellness programs, the approach is designed to catch potential health issues before they become significant concerns. Recently, InterMed’s own onsite clinic played a crucial role in disease identification that ultimately saved the lives of several Maine employees. These instances underscore the importance of having accessible, onsite health care services and reinforce the tangible benefits of our collaborative approach. An important evolution in onsite health care is that it is no longer just for large employers. Services are now scalable for each employer and span from one nurse, a few hours a week, to full primary care clinics, allowing employers of all sizes and industries to bring health care to the worksite and experience the benefit. As these programs continue to advance, it will take continued collaboration between clinicians and businesses in Maine to pursue new opportunities and perfect how we provide care. At InterMed, we continue to innovate and look for new ways and collaborations to transform how we deliver health care services and meet patient demands in southern Maine. Helping to drive the next generation of care in Maine will remain at the forefront of what we do. While we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to health care, as we continue to look at how we provide care, workplace health should be part of that discussion for the value and affordability it offers both employees and employers. In the end, the goal is simple yet profound: to ensure that every employee has the opportunity to lead a healthier, more fulfilling life."

Generate Key Takeaways Downtown Demopolis, Ala. is seen on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. The state's first health care boarding school in Demopolis plans to address rural staffing shortages, opening to ninth graders in 2026. (Will McLelland for the Alabama Reflector) A board overseeing the creation of the state’s first residential high school focused on health care laid the groundwork Monday to select a leader and prepare a curriculum. The Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences, located in Demopolis, is scheduled to enroll its inaugural ninth-grade class in 2026. The school aims to address Alabama’s health care staffing crisis, particularly in rural parts of the state, by training students for roles across the medical field. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Rob Pearson, interim president of the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences Foundation, said Monday that the school will offer “certification levels beyond what’s currently available in Alabama high schools” for those looking to become health care professionals. “We want to find them to become the nurses and the X-ray technicians, and the different things that we’re going to be producing in the state,” he said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX Bloomberg Philanthropies’ initiative to establish high schools focused on health care is providing $26 million of the estimated $80 million needed to build the dormitory and campus facilities, with a groundbreaking expected by mid-2025. The five-story dorm will be the tallest building in Demopolis. Pearson said that the school is the only rural residential school funded by Bloomberg. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement There are severe health care provider shortages in rural Alabama , with rural counties having far fewer primary care physicians per resident than urban areas. With rural population in decline, particularly in the Black Belt, those who remain are older adults who face growing obstacles to accessing health care. In 2020, Alabama averaged one physician per 1,520 residents, but rural counties like Wilcox and Lowndes have far worse ratios, with one physician serving 5,103 and 9,641 residents, respectively. These provider shortages lead to health disparities. The Black Belt experiences some of the state’s worst health outcomes, and Alabama already ranks among the lowest nationally. Life expectancy in every Black Belt county is below the state average of nearly 75 years, with Wilcox County residents living an average of 69.8 years. The board will convene a curriculum committee in December to finalize curriculum requirements aligning with high school graduation requirements and health care certifications that will be presented to the board for discussion, said Pearson. He added that the curriculum will involve partnerships with community colleges and regional hospitals where students can get clinical hours. State Superintendent Eric Mackey said the school’s recruitment strategy will focus on drawing students from across the state to build a workforce pipeline beyond those wanting to attend medical school, like nursing. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Essentially all the recruitment is going to be done in middle schools, and you’re telling people ‘Send your child off at age 14 to a boarding school’ and ‘Here’s what we offer,’ then you’re going to have to have a pretty robust package to get people to do that,” Mackey said. The Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences will join a network of specialized boarding schools, including the Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering. Pearson expressed optimism for the project despite challenges. “Bloomberg is really interested to see how this goes, because that may become the model nationwide. Their goal is to perfect the 9th through 12th experience to meet the health care needs of the future,” Pearson said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Gov. Kay Ivey initially proposed the school in her 2023 State of the State address, presenting it as a way to address the state’s critical shortage of health care workers “to fill a broad spectrum of health care jobs or pursue a higher education.” The board plans to reconvene in February 2025 to review progress on the presidential search and curriculum development.

Today both residents and visitors are spoilt for choice with the ubiquitous healthcare facilities on offer across the Emirates. Currently, the UAE boasts some of the best names in healthcare from around the world and is fast becoming a leading healthcare hub. According to Dr Mujtaba Ali Khan, Chief Executive Officer of Burjeel Medical City, Abu Dhabi, the UAE’s leadership in global healthcare stems from a visionary approach and a relentless commitment to innovation and excellence. Dr Mujtaba Ali Khan He explains, “Several factors contribute to it. In the country, healthcare has been prioritised as a key aspect of national development, supported by strategic frameworks like Vision 2031 and Vision 2071. The government’s proactive investment in cutting-edge infrastructure, combined with a focus on nurturing public-private partnerships, has established world-class hospitals and centres of excellence across the nation. These collaborations bring global expertise and advanced technologies, setting a benchmark for quality care.” Transformation continues As part of the 2031 plan, it has been deemed that a high-quality healthcare service should be available to everyone. There are also plans for the UAE to become a global destination for specialised care and be a leading centre for medical research globally, which in turn would place the UAE as a leading healthcare destination. Although there are ambitious plans in place for the future, the country has already succeeded in many of these areas within the healthcare sector. “Innovation is at the heart of the UAE’s healthcare evolution. The adoption of artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine has redefined patient care, offering precision, efficiency, and accessibility,” says Dr Khan. “Furthermore, the UAE’s medical tourism initiatives have positioned the country as a premier healthcare destination. Another key factor is the nation’s focus on preventive care and health education. National campaigns addressing chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases improve public health and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. With robust regulatory frameworks, a diverse and highly skilled workforce and a culture of continuous innovation, the nation has created a healthcare model that not only serves its population but inspires the world.” While there are many attributes that have helped the UAE evolve into a world-class healthcare destination, investments into key areas have also created advancements throughout the industry. Vision for healthcare excellence “Investments have resulted in world-class institutions that serve both the local and international patients seeking specialised care, particularly in orthopaedics, fertility, mental health, rare diseases therapies and primary care,” says Dr Shanila Laiju, Group CEO of Medcare Hospitals and Medical Centres. “The UAE’s reputation as a medical tourism destination is strengthened by its ability to offer specialised treatments where other countries face shortages,” she says. Dr Shanila Laiju “The country’s dynamic visa programmes, like the Golden Visa, attract top healthcare professionals, ensuring high-quality care. The UAE’s commitment to innovation is demonstrated through global collaborations and participation in events like Arab Health, which saw record-breaking deals and increasing international interest. These efforts have helped the UAE rank at the top of the Legatum Prosperity Index for healthcare in the GCC and among the top 50 globally, positioning the country as a hub for world-class medical services, research and innovation,” Dr Laiju points out. Advanced medical research With the focus on becoming a leading medical hub, advances in medical research and a strong emphasis on wellness have already been implemented. “The UAE is making significant progress in advanced medical research with initiatives such as the upcoming Dubai Diabetes Centre, set to open in 2026. This new centre will provide world-class care and services, aligning with Dubai Health’s commitment to the Dubai Social Agenda 33, promoting healthier lifestyles and enhanced preventive healthcare,” says Dr Laiju, adding, “The UAE’s commitment to research is evident in its participation in global clinical trials and its pursuit of innovative therapies, positioning it as a competitive alternative to established global healthcare hubs like Singapore, Germany and the United States.” Research and preventive measures are certainly necessary to prevent future health issues but, for anyone dealing with a current cancer diagnosis, hospitals in the UAE, such as the Advanced Care Oncology Center (ACOC), are providing a holistic approach along with high-tech treatments. Bashir Abou Reslan, Executive Director of Advanced Care Oncology Center, says, “At Advanced Care Oncology Center, we are dedicated to providing world-class healthcare services, specialising in advanced treatments for cancer. Our holistic approach includes a wide range of cutting-edge therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy and more, all delivered by experienced oncologists and highly trained healthcare professionals.” Bashir Abou Reslan In addition to experienced healthcare professionals, artificial intelligence is also helping save lives. Reslan says, “The use of artificial intelligence is an integral part of our future plans in healthcare, particularly in areas such as radiation therapy. “At ACOC, we continuously refine our processes, leveraging artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to enhance patient outcomes and improve the precision of our treatments.” Innovation at core In Abu Dhabi, M42 is another valued leader in the healthcare sector and provides artificial intelligence-powered technology and innovative solutions. The organisation has played a vital role in the success of the sector. “As we celebrate the 53-year journey of our country and its visionary leadership, it is important to pause and recognise the incredible achievements that our nation has made across different industries and sectors,” says Hasan Jasem Al Nowais, Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer of M42. Hasan Jasem Al Nowais “In just half a century, the UAE has achieved the impossible, becoming a global benchmark for preventive and holistic healthcare. This transformation has been driven by consistent and strategic investments in human capital, healthcare infrastructure, research and development, and in world-class artificial intelligence and technology,” he says. “As the largest healthcare company in the Middle East and a global health leader, M42 is proud to be a key contributor to this inspiring story of growth. We are driven by the conviction that better health leads to better lives and a better future, and we strongly believe that Abu Dhabi and the UAE will be the standard bearer for the world in healthcare,” Al Nowais adds. With the world changing at a rapid pace, it’s difficult to predict what the future holds next for the medical field. However, the one thing that’s certain is that the UAE is demonstrating to the world what first-class healthcare should look like.

MONTREAL – A new Crown corporation has officially taken the reins of Quebec’s health-care system as part of the provincial government’s effort to reduce emergency room wait times and surgery wait lists. The agency, called Santé Québec, will manage all health-care facilities in the province and will become the sole employer of 330,000 health-care workers. The agency is a key part of the Quebec government’s plan to reform the province’s health-care system and improve access to services.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot Geneviève Biron, president and CEO of Santé Québec, says in an open letter that she plans to “optimize” the network by reducing the duplication of work and sharing tools and best practices between institutions. But the agency has also been tasked with eliminating a $1.5-billion deficit in health-care spending, which Health Minister Christian Dubé has acknowledged will affect services. One of Quebec’s largest trade unions has criticized the new agency, saying grouping health facilities under one roof will have little impact on health care, while spending cuts will hit hard.

https://kevinmd.com/2024/12/how-physicians-can-get-started-in-digital-health-and-health-care-innovation.html,,How physicians can get started in digital health and health care innovation,20241201T124500Z,https://kevinmd.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2466378257.jpg,kevinmd.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Share Tweet Share In the rapidly evolving landscape of health care, the urgent need for innovation has never been more critical. As a physician, you are uniquely positioned to drive transformative changes that can improve patient outcomes, enhance care delivery, and reduce costs. However, despite the opportunities, stepping into the realm of digital health and health care innovation can seem daunting. The importance of understanding the imperative for innovation in health care Health care systems worldwide are grappling with rising costs, an aging population, and the growing burden of chronic diseases. The United States, for instance, spent $3.8 trillion on health care in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the GDP. Given the aging population projected to reach 2 billion globally by 2050 and chronic diseases causing 71 percent of all deaths, the need for innovative solutions is evident. Furthermore, health inequities persist, with racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately affected. These challenges highlight the urgent need for innovation in health care to address the issues mentioned. Opportunities for innovation The following key areas offer promising opportunities for health care innovation: 1. Digital health technologies. Telemedicine, wearable devices, and health apps provide new avenues for remote monitoring, personalized care, and patient engagement. The global digital health market is projected to reach $379 billion by 2026. 2. Data analytics. The power of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) enables predictive analytics, precision medicine, and population health management. The global health care analytics market is expected to reach $84.2 billion by 2027. 3. Patient-centered care. Innovations that prioritize patient needs and preferences, such as shared decision-making tools and patient portals, enhance care delivery and satisfaction. 4. Value-based care models. Shifting from fee-for-service to value-based care incentivizes quality outcomes and cost-effective care delivery, driving innovation in care delivery models. The role of physicians in driving innovation Physicians play a crucial and pivotal role in driving health care innovation through: 1. Clinical expertise. Physicians bring valuable clinical insights and expertise to the innovation process, ensuring that solutions are evidence-based and patient-centered. 2. Advocacy. Physicians can advocate for policy changes and health care reforms that support innovation and improve health care delivery. 3. Entrepreneurship. Some physicians choose to become innovators themselves, founding startups or collaborating with industry partners to develop and implement health care solutions. ADVERTISEMENT 4. Continuous learning. Embracing a culture of innovation requires physicians to stay abreast of emerging technologies, best practices, and opportunities for collaboration. Initiating your journey into digital health and health care innovation 1. Education and training. Begin by enhancing your knowledge of health care innovation. Enroll in courses, attend workshops, and participate in webinars that focus on digital health and innovation. For example, the “Healthcare Innovation: An Introduction for Physicians” course provides a robust foundation in health care innovation, tailored strategies for engagement, and an extensive network to support your aspirations. 2. Networking and mentorship. Building a network is crucial for success in health care innovation. Attend industry conferences, join professional organizations, and connect with innovators and leaders in the field. Platforms like InnovatorMD and AdoctorsJourney offer networking opportunities and mentorship programs that can provide valuable guidance and support.

Consider serving as an advisor to health care startups. Your clinical expertise can provide critical insights and validation for innovative solutions. Many health care startups highly value the input of medical advisors due to their critical insights and validation of innovative solutions. Additionally, this role can offer financial and professional rewards to physicians. 4. Investment opportunities. Explore avenues for investment in health care startups, such as angel investing, venture capital, and strategic partnerships. Engaging in investments not only offers potential financial returns but also allows you to influence the development of innovative health care solutions. 5. Entrepreneurship. If you have a passion for innovation, consider founding your own health care startup. Identify a problem within the health care system that you are passionate about solving and develop a viable solution. The journey from ideation to entrepreneurship involves several steps: Ideation : Identify gaps and inefficiencies in health care that can be transformed into opportunities for innovation. Your clinical experience and understanding of patient needs will form the basis for your ideas for health care innovation. Business planning : Develop a comprehensive business plan that outlines your vision, target market, competitive landscape, and financial projections. A solid business plan is essential for attracting investors and partners. Legal and ethical considerations : Address legal, ethical, and regulatory issues early in the process. Compliance with health care regulations is crucial for the success and sustainability of your startup. Fundraising : Secure funding through various channels, including angel investors, venture capital, grants, and crowdfunding. Successful fundraising is essential for turning your innovative ideas into reality. Team building : Assemble a diverse and skilled team that shares your vision and complements your expertise. A strong team is the backbone of any successful startup. Market entry : Develop a go-to-market strategy that includes marketing, sales, and distribution plans. Understanding your target audience and how to reach them is key to gaining traction and achieving success. 6. Leveraging digital tools and platforms. Leverage digital tools and platforms actively to amplify your innovation efforts. For instance, telemedicine platforms can expand access to care, while data analytics tools can provide insights into patient outcomes and health care trends. Adopt technology that aligns with your goals, enhancing your capacity to innovate effectively. 7. Continuous improvement and adaptation. Innovation is an ongoing process. Stay updated on emerging trends, technologies, and best practices in health care. Continuously evaluate and improve your solutions based on feedback and changing market dynamics. Adaptability is crucial for long-term success in the ever-evolving health care landscape. Conclusion Stepping into digital health and health care innovation is an exciting and impactful journey for physicians. By leveraging your clinical expertise, advocating for change, and embracing entrepreneurship, you can drive meaningful improvements in health care delivery and patient outcomes. Start by educating yourself, building a network, and exploring advisory and investment opportunities. Whether you choose to advise startups, invest in innovative solutions, or start your own venture, your involvement in health care innovation can lead to a healthier and more equitable future. Embrace the transformative journey of innovation, filled with challenges and opportunities for impactful change. Maintain your curiosity and dedication, and, most importantly, focus on the goal of improving health care for the better. Embark on your journey as a physician and innovator, starting today.

While urban centres often have multiple healthcare options, rural areas still need to improve their access to specialized medical care, especially in obstetrics and women's health. The Alberta College of Family Physicians recently highlighted achievements in developing sustainable healthcare solutions with their Recognition of Excellence award, emphasizing the importance of effective approaches in bridging these healthcare gaps. Dr. Stephanie Efua Sobotie, recipient of this recognition, brings unique experience in developing healthcare solutions across diverse settings. From responding to critical needs in Ghana's Kuntanase Government Hospital, where she established a blood bank after personally donating blood to save a patient's life, to helping develop the obstetric program in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, her work demonstrates the impact of targeted healthcare initiatives. Now, as a family physician with a Certificate of Added Competence in obstetric surgical skills at Bow Trail Medical Clinic in Calgary and a clinical lecturer at the Cumming School of Medicine, she continues to address healthcare accessibility challenges. We sat down with Dr. Sobotie to explore what it takes to create compelling healthcare solutions and how connecting rural and urban healthcare experiences can improve medical care delivery. Image Courtesy of Dr. Stephanie Efua Sobotie Dr. Sobotie, as the first female physician in your family, what does 'redefining women's healthcare' mean to you? When I consider redefining women's healthcare, I envision creating a truly accessible system that addresses unique medical needs that have been historically overlooked. This vision was sparked early in my life when I noticed I could be the first woman physician in my family. At Bow Trail Medical Clinic in Calgary, we've built a women's clinic that goes beyond primary care to address comprehensive health concerns throughout every life stage. But meaningful change requires reaching underserved communities, too. In Ghana's Kuntanase Government Hospital, we established a program that successfully reduced maternal mortality rates in the Ashanti region. This work continued in Canada, where we've focused on bringing essential services to areas with limited healthcare access. Redefining healthcare also means preparing future generations of medical professionals. Through my role at the Cumming School of Medicine, I work to ensure that tomorrow's healthcare providers understand the importance of advocating for women's health needs and creating sustainable, accessible care systems. From Ghana to Canada, you've seen various challenges in medicine. In your opinion, what obstacles still exist for women in healthcare - both for doctors and patients? Based on my experience working across different healthcare systems, I've observed that access to specialized care remains a significant challenge, particularly in rural and underserved areas. This became evident during my time at Kuntanase Government Hospital, where we faced critical resource limitations - like not having a blood bank, which could have devastating consequences for women requiring emergency care. There are still barriers for women physicians in specific specialized fields. While I initially wanted to specialize in Trauma and orthopaedic surgery, my journey led me to family medicine, where I could make the most significant impact. However, I obtained additional qualifications, like my Certificate of Added Competence in obstetric surgical skills, to provide comprehensive care, especially in underserved areas. From my current perspective at the women's clinic in Calgary, I see how these challenges manifest differently but persist even in well-resourced settings. Mental health support accessibility, for instance, remains a critical issue. I've witnessed firsthand how delays in accessing mental health services can have severe consequences for patients. These experiences have shaped my approach to creating more inclusive and comprehensive healthcare programs that address immediate medical needs and long-term wellness support. As part of Bow Trail Medical Clinic, you've helped establish a specialized women's health division. What unique healthcare challenges are you aiming to address through this initiative? Through our women's clinic in Calgary, we're addressing several critical needs I've identified throughout my career. Working as a primary care physician in rural and urban settings, I've seen how crucial it is to provide comprehensive women's healthcare beyond essential medical services. Our clinic focuses on providing continuous care throughout a woman's life journey. Hospital privileges allow me to offer complete obstetric care, including surgical deliveries when necessary. This comprehensive approach is critical given my experience establishing obstetric programs from Ghana to Saskatchewan, where I've seen how integrated care can significantly improve outcomes. Additionally, based on my experience as a family physician with obstetric surgical skills, I recognized the need for specialized services that bridge the gap between primary care and specialized obstetrics. This is especially important as we aim to reduce barriers to accessing quality healthcare. We're creating a model where women can receive coordinated care, from routine check-ups to more complex procedures, all within a familiar and supportive environment."" You received the Recognition of Excellence from the Alberta College of Family Physicians for contributing to family medicine. How does this experience help you create a more inclusive healthcare environment? Recognition of Excellence reinforced my commitment to building inclusive healthcare systems. This recognition reflects our success in implementing comprehensive care approaches that I've developed throughout my career. As a Family Practice Assessor for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, I work to ensure high standards of care across diverse medical environments. This experience, combined with my clinical teaching at the Cumming School of Medicine, helps me promote inclusive practices among the next generation of physicians. You've created sustainable medical solutions in different settings, from establishing a blood bank in Kuntanase Hospital to developing the obstetric program in Kindersley. How do these projects help overcome systemic barriers to healthcare access? Each project emerged from real, urgent needs I witnessed firsthand. I'll never forget that critical moment in Kuntanase when I had to donate my blood to save a patient with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. That experience wasn't just about saving one life – it revealed a systemic gap that needed addressing. Establishing the blood bank wasn't just about creating a facility; it was about ensuring that no other woman would face that same life-threatening situation due to a lack of resources. In Kindersley, Saskatchewan, we faced different challenges but similar underlying issues of access to care. Developing the obstetric program there wasn't just about adding services – it was about creating pathways for family physicians to gain advanced obstetric skills, ensuring sustainable care in rural communities. I've learned from working in these diverse settings that sustainable solutions must grow from local needs while maintaining consistent quality standards. These experiences taught me that overcoming healthcare barriers isn't just about building facilities or programs – it's about understanding community needs, training healthcare providers, and creating systems that can continue serving people long after initial implementation. Whether in Ghana or Canada, the principles remain the same: Listen to the community. Identify the critical gaps. Build solutions that can stand the test of time. Your recent article in WJARR and upcoming publications in Arjonline explore essential aspects of women's health. How does your research contribute to changing approaches in women's healthcare? This research grew directly from my experience working with patients and seeing how physical Trauma during childbirth can have lasting effects on both mental and physical well-being. By publishing these findings, we're helping to highlight the interconnected nature of women's health issues. This is particularly important for healthcare providers in urban and rural settings, where understanding these connections can lead to better patient care. The research also supports what I've implemented in practice - the importance of considering both immediate medical needs and long-term well-being in women's healthcare. These publications contribute to a growing body of evidence supporting more integrated approaches to women's healthcare. These approaches move beyond treating isolated symptoms to understanding and addressing the full spectrum of women's health needs. What healthcare barriers for women do you plan to overcome shortly? I want to help people who previously did not have access to high-quality medicine. Based on my experience from Ghana to Canada, I aim to continue developing sustainable healthcare programs in underserved communities, focusing on integrating mental health support with primary care services. Through my teaching roles at the Cumming School of Medicine and clinical practice, I'm committed to training the next generation of healthcare providers to understand and address the unique challenges women face in accessing comprehensive healthcare. Imagining medicine 10 years from now, what should a truly inclusive and sustainable healthcare system look like? A truly inclusive and sustainable healthcare system should combine the best elements I've seen work in different settings - from rural Ghana to urban Canada. It should ensure that every woman can access comprehensive care, regardless of location. This means integrating primary care with specialized services, particularly in underserved areas, while maintaining strong connections between community clinics and larger medical centres. Mental health support should be readily available, and healthcare providers should be trained to deliver culturally competent care. Most importantly, it should be a system that grows and adapts with its communities, ensuring long-term sustainability. Published by Medicaldaily.com Join the Discussion"
https://borgenproject.org/diseases-impacting-togo/,,Universal Health Care : Improving Diseases Impacting Togo,20241129T190000Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/6280455_cdade6ab86_c.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"The top three diseases impacting Togo are lower respiratory infections, stroke and ischemic heart disease. However, Togo’s Universal Health Insurance program could be the solution to reducing the death rate of these diseases. Health Care in Togo In Togo, 45% of the population live below the poverty line, which means they face an economic barrier to accessing health care. Moreover, the health care system in Togo is heavily reliant on external funding and resources , so the current system cannot properly aid those suffering from various lethal diseases impacting Togo. This only furthers the need for a proper health care system. However, this need also increases the burden on the present system. There is less than one doctor for every 10,000 Togolese compared to 36 doctors for every 10,000 Americans. Therefore, there needs to be improvements to access to health care in Togo. This lack of adequate health care coverage is why diseases impacting Togo are the leading causes of death. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Lower respiratory tract infections make up 75 of every 100,000 deaths in Togo. As a result, they are the leading cause of death in Togo, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Lower respiratory tract infections occur when bacteria, viruses or fungi enter the lungs. Common lower respiratory tract infections include the flu, viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Anyone can develop a lower respiratory tract infection. However, young children, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk of contracting these infections and dying from them. Stroke The second leading cause of death in Togo is stroke; making up 66 of every 100,000 deaths, according to WHO. Strokes occur when the blood supply to the brain begins decreasing. The reduction of blood supply prevents the brain from receiving nutrients and oxygen, resulting in brain cell death within minutes. Blood leaking also results in strokes and occurs when leaking blood in the brain increases pressure on brain cells and damages them. Ischemic Heart Disease Ischemic heart disease causes 45 of every 100,000 deaths in Togo, according to WHO. This heart disease occurs when there is a lack of blood flowing to heart muscles, often caused by fat and cholesterol collecting in coronary arteries. This disease therefore commonly causes chest pain, trouble breathing and heart attacks, which is why it is the third leading cause of death in Togo. Improvements to Health Care All of these diseases are preventable and or treatable. Yet, until there is adequate access to health care in Togo, these diseases could continue to be the top causes of death. The Togolese government passed legislation in 2021 to begin developing universal health care and expects all resistance to have coverage by 2025. The program plans to provide health care for public and private sector employees, along with those on public assistance unable to pay. Employees will receive coverage through their and their employer’s contributions. While people unable to pay will revive funding through the government. The health care program already has 800,000 people enrolled , which is 50% more than the previous 470,000 covered by the former program. Investment in universal health care means investment in medical equipment, facilities and workers. Investing in these areas could increase the demand for workers. However, it could also increase the number of those seeking health care positions, which could lead to more health professionals able to help Togolese people. Therefore, with universal health care, comes help for those suffering from the diseases impacting Togo. – Nivea Walker Nivea is based in Elon, NC, USA and focuses on Good News and Global Health for The Borgen Project.

The loss of lives due to counterfeit or substandard medications, inadequate dosing, and misdiagnosis remains a pressing concern. Medicine failure – defined as the ineffective or harmful provision of healthcare services due to counterfeit or substandard medications, insufficient medical education, poor healthcare infrastructure, and inadequate regulations – has devastating consequences. Pakistan’s healthcare sector faces a dire phenomenon of vertical malfunction, where counterfeit medications, inaccurate diagnoses, and insufficient medical training exacerbate the crisis. The alarming proliferation of spurious or low-quality drugs, coupled with inadequate healthcare regulations and oversight, has eroded public confidence in the country’s medical infrastructure. In 2024, Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industry, valued at over $3 billion, continues to grapple with corruption, inadequate oversight, and poor enforcement. Reports suggest that up to 40 percent of medications in the country are substandard or counterfeit, flooding the market and putting millions of lives at risk. Approximately 10-15 percent of the population – around 20 to 30 million people – experience medication-related problems annually. Alarmingly, medication non-adherence rates stand at 60-70 percent, while 40 percent of chronic disease patients discontinue treatment within six months due to medicine failure. Funding for initiatives targeting medicine failure in Pakistan is projected to reach approximately $60 million in 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that a significant percentage of medicines in Pakistan are either counterfeit or substandard. This crisis leads to high morbidity, mortality, and economic burdens, further undermining the integrity of the healthcare system. According to key statistics, 80 percent of healthcare providers lack proper training, as highlighted by the Pakistan Medical Association, while medicine failure accounts for 20 percent of healthcare costs, according to the Ministry of Health. These issues not only burden families and the healthcare system but also erode public trust in healthcare services. Despite these challenges, there is hope. In 2024, funding for addressing medicine failure in Pakistan is expected to increase significantly. The WHO has allocated $15 million to strengthen the healthcare system, while UNICEF has committed $7.57 million for vaccine procurement and distribution. The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) plans to invest $3.5 million in quality control and research initiatives. Additionally, The Health Foundation Pakistan aims to contribute $2.5 million to improve access to healthcare services. The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) is set to receive $1 million from international donors to enhance its regulatory capacity. Moreover, the government of Pakistan has budgeted $35 million for overall healthcare expenditure, representing 1.7 percent of the GDP. Organizations such as the World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) are expected to contribute towards ending medicine failure and ensuring quality treatment. In total, funding for initiatives targeting medicine failure in Pakistan is projected to reach approximately $60 million in 2024. To address medicine failure, immediate steps include strengthening regulatory frameworks, enhancing inspections and monitoring of pharmaceutical facilities, improving medicine supply chains, and educating healthcare professionals and patients on the safe use of medications. Long-term solutions involve investing in pharmaceutical industry development, international collaborations, and enhancing healthcare system infrastructure and professional training. By focusing on effective medications, accurate diagnoses, and sufficient medical training, Pakistan can prevent medicine failure. These bold initiatives can transform the pharmaceutical landscape, ensuring improved medicine quality and safety, increased access to effective treatments, enhanced patient outcomes, and significant economic benefits. Collectively, these measures will reduce medicine failure rates, restore patient trust, and improve global health security. By implementing these solutions, governments, healthcare industries, and service providers can work together to overcome this crisis, ultimately saving lives and promoting healthier communities.

The report forecasts AI could lower the U.S. budget deficit by 1.5% of GDP by 2044. The incoming Trump administration raises questions as to how AI might be implemented in delivering health care services. Just_super | E+ | Getty Images Can artificial intelligence be so transformative as to solve one of the U.S. economy's biggest problems: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit? According to three economists at the Brookings Institution, the answer is yes — AI could prove a positive ""critical shock"" for the country's fiscal health. A working paper released last month by the Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings projects that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044, or about $900 billion in nominal terms, lowering annual budget deficits by roughly one fifth at the end of the 20-year span. ""The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system,"" the paper's authors, Ben Harris, Neil Mehotra and Eric So, wrote. While the authors name various channels through which AI can increase productivity, they highlight AI's potential to dramatically improve health care services and public health. Not only could AI make American health care more efficient, it might also ""democratize"" access to the system by giving people more options for preventative medical care — ""changing the 'who' and 'where' of health care,"" the economists wrote. AI could ease deficit pressure The economic impacts of a more efficient health care system, and giving individuals more paths to manage their own health, could ease pressure on the government's yawning fiscal deficit , which topped $1.8 trillion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. The national debt stands at $36 trillion . But adopting AI in health care services isn't a sure thing. Plenty of impediments stand in the way of widely implementing AI, largely tied to regulation and incentives. Economists' outlook on AI and health care is ""a mix of enthusiasm and despair,"" said Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management ,where he researches the economics of artificial intelligence. ""Enthusiasm because there's probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there's friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities,"" Agrawal said. ""So yes, there's lots of implementation challenges, and at the same time, the prize for succeeding at this is very big,"" Agrawal said. Health care and the deficit The federal government spent an estimated $1.8 trillion on health insurance in 2023, or around 7% of GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office . From 2024 to 2033, the CBO forecasts federal subsidies for health care will total $25 trillion, or 8.3% of GDP. The problem is that so much health care spending in the U.S. isn't tied to treatment or patient outcomes. Instead, about a quarter of all spending, public and private, is estimated to go toward administrative functions. ""Nearly every industry in the U.S. has experienced substantial improvements in productivity over the last 50 years, with 1 major exception: health care,"" according to a report by McKinsey analysts. This is one area where AI could improve operations, according to the Brookings Institution economists. Basic tasks such as appointment scheduling can be automated, while tasks such as patient flow management and preliminary data analysis can also be done by AI programs. While the three economists acknowledge that the impact of AI on federal spending is still ""highly uncertain,"" the coauthors believe it could ultimately be more transformative for the economy than past technological leaps, such as the use of personal computers in the 1990s. The current AI shock ""feels different. This isn't your typical technological shock,"" Harris told CNBC. AI is affecting ""how people receive health care,"" how the drug industry discovers new products and how researchers make medicine more precise, Harris said. Disease and death rates In particular, Harris underscored AI's impact not just on productivity, but also its potential to transform the cost of care and the rates of illness, disease and death. ""Such changes could have profound impacts on Social Security and public health program outlays,"" he and his coauthors wrote. To be sure, there is also the potential that AI advancements could counterintuitively increase federal spending if the average lifespan increases as a result of the technology. Not only could improved technology lead people to seek more medical care, longer lifespans might also result in a larger retired population. But the Brookings paper takes a more optimistic tack, predicting one of AI's largest benefits will result from accelerating the efficacy of preventative care and disease detection. This will create a healthier population that will need less medical intervention, the authors wrote — and might also increase labor force participation rates if a healthier workforce stays employed for more years. ""AI's ability to improve diagnostic accuracy can not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce wasteful spending on inappropriate treatments,"" the economists said. ""From a more optimistic perspective, existing AI systems may lower expenditures on all health spending, including Medicare, with cost reductions occurring through several channels—with personalized medicine being a prominent example."" Evaluating whether AI can ultimately translate into a positive or negative shock on fiscal policy will depend on what stage of the age distribution it affects, Agrawal said. Whether AI is ""having its bigger impact on retired people, or around working people,"" will answer how the numbers play out, Agrawal said. AI proliferating already So far, diagnostics has shown the most advances and greatest potential in applying AI in health care. Agrawal cited AI's influence throughout almost all the steps of diagnostic care, from receiving input data, medical imagery such as X-rays and MRIs, as well as doctor notes, charts. ""In almost every area of diagnosis, AI has, in some cases, already demonstrated what they call 'superhuman performance' — better than than most docs,"" Agrawal said. AI has also shown ""significant promise"" in better optimizing treatment plans for patients through data analysis. Machine intelligence can develop more effective and less costly plans for individual patients, according to the authors of the paper. Agrawal believes it's too early to say whether public or private health systems will take better advantage of AI. In the U.S., private insurers have generally been more keen on AI technology associated with preventative treatment, he said. There's been less interest in using AI in diagnostic applications, possibly that might lead to a rise in cases and more treatment, he said. ""There aren't clear economic incentives for the private sector to [implement] that,"" said Agrawal. ""In the public sector, even though there are incentives, there are a lot of frictions associated with privacy on the data side."" He believes public-private partnerships will be key in driving the rollout of AI across health care. The public health care sector ""will need very strong incentives in order to drive change, because otherwise, everybody is in their routine. There's a lot of resistance to change,"" Agrawal said. ""So to get over that resistance, you need a very strong motivator, and the private sector generally provides a much stronger motivator, either because the users are trying to reduce cost, or the creators of the technology are trying to generate profit,"" he continued. Large tech companies have already pushed forward in developing large language models specifically for health care services. Google's AI system, Articulate Medical Intelligence Explore (AMIE), mimics diagnostic dialogue. Its Med-Gemini platform uses AI to aid in diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical decision support. Amazon and Microsoft have their own projects underway to expand the application of AI programs in health services. Outlook under Trump President-elect Donald Trump's second term could alter the rollout of AI in health care, and ultimately, its economic impact. Trump has vowed to reduce government spending and formed an outside panel called the Department of Government Efficiency designed to "" dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies. "" Public health funding is one area that could reduced funding, frustrating the ability to roll out AI applications. ""Now, it is possible that if you do see a retreat in the federal government's role in providing health care to people, that more efficient AI could help compensate for the cost of that retreat,"" said Harris. ""If AI means that each dollar goes farther, then I think we've timed everything in a sort of lucky way."" There's also the chance that rolling back regulations under a second Trump administration could expedite the implementation of AI across health care. ""Many people are fearful of reducing regulation because they don't want technologies that are immature to be brought into the health care system and harm people,"" Agrawal said. ""And that's a very legitimate concern. But very often what they fail to also put into their equation is the harm we're causing people by not bringing"" in new technologies, he added. ""Some areas need a lot more technical development, but there are some domains in diagnosis that are already ready to go, and it's just regulation that's preventing them from being used,"" Agrawal said."

https://mg.co.za/thought-leader/opinion/2024-11-28-navigating-the-road-to-universal-health-coverage-in-south-africa/,,Navigating the road to universal health coverage in South Africa – The Mail & Guardian,20241128T111500Z,https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1235726044.jpg,mg.co.za,English,South Africa,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"The future of our healthcare system is in our hands; we approach it with responsibility, collaboration and a deep commitment to the well-being of all people. (Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg via Getty Images) With the signing of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act into law, South Africa stands at a pivotal moment in its healthcare journey. Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) promises equitable access to quality healthcare for all, regardless of income or location. But transforming this vision into reality requires much more than policy reflected in the NHI, it calls for robust planning, thoughtful resource allocation and, above all, collaboration across sectors. Our nation’s medical schools and higher education and training institutions are essential to the UHC journey in their support of South African’s human resources for health strategy. This strategy provides a foundation for advancing universal health coverage by ensuring healthcare professionals are appropriately trained to meet the demands of a redefined healthcare system. These institutions play an instrumental role in building a workforce ready to support the NHI system. Lessons from our response to the recent Covid-19 pandemic have already shown us the power of unity. This spirit of collaboration between the public and private sectors will be crucial in shaping a resilient and inclusive healthcare system that can achieve universal health coverage. The NHI Act sets out to provide universal access to quality healthcare services, bridging disparities and delivering equitable access to essential services. But the path to UHC also requires quality, efficiency and sustainability across a restructured healthcare landscape. The government’s role here is pivotal — responsible leadership, resource allocation and effective oversight are critical to building public confidence. This transition poses complex governance and constitutional challenges. Implementing the NHI Act requires establishing new accountability mechanisms, redefining roles and reassessing funding streams. Addressing these structural issues — especially in under-resourced and underserved regions — demands both strategic mindset and practical capacity to adapt quickly to evolving needs. Many people living in rural areas and townships face significant shortages in healthcare resources and access to quality services. For the NHI to succeed in these settings, dedicated efforts in providing adequate healthcare infrastructure and equipment, staffing and strong governance and leadership are essential. Achieving the ambitious goals of NHI without a solid foundation in governance and accountability would be a costly misstep. The success of NHI demands careful, evidence-based planning with clear goals and accountability. This approach will require decades of commitment, with the understanding that universal healthcare frameworks often take generations to mature fully. The NHI will not be a quick fix, but with meticulous preparation, it has the potential to become a sustainable, far-reaching health system intervention. Government planning must also account for the rapidly changing landscape of healthcare needs and technology. South Africa’s healthcare system must prepare not only for current demands but also for future challenges, including digital healthcare infrastructure and data security. Protecting patient information and ensuring uninterrupted services is paramount in a digital age where data breaches are a constant risk. Recent experiences with cybersecurity issues in the National Health Laboratory Services underscore the importance of proactive measures in this domain. The pandemic has taught us the power of unity in times of crisis. During Covid-19, South Africa’s public and private healthcare sectors demonstrated resilience, adaptability and a shared commitment to public health. This partnership was instrumental in resource-sharing, patient care and vaccine distribution. It serves as a powerful reminder that as the NHI system is implemented over the next 10 to 15 years, the system will benefit from a collaborative model where the expertise and resources of the private and public sectors complement each other in the public interest and wider community access. Collaboration between the public and private sectors must focus on expanding healthcare infrastructure, enhancing service delivery in underserved areas and integrating innovative technologies for more efficient patient care. By working together, public and private sectors can foster a healthcare environment that maximises strengths and mitigates gaps in service. To sustain the implementation of the NHI system, South Africa needs healthcare professionals equipped to handle both the scope and scale of this vision. Medical and health professions education must adapt and evolve to meet these challenges, training future healthcare providers not only in clinical skills but also in adaptability, empathy and resilience. The journey toward universal health coverage and the implementation of the NHI system is both inspiring and challenging. It is a bold declaration of South Africa’s commitment to affordable universal access to quality health care services and healthcare equity – and must be approached with open eyes and a steady hand. South Africa has a unique opportunity to build a healthcare system that is equitable and resilient. We can pave the way for a healthcare system that genuinely serves all people, one that fulfils the promise of the Constitution and reflects the spirit of democracy. The future of our healthcare system is in our hands; we approach it with responsibility, collaboration and a deep commitment to the well-being of all people.

According to a consulting firm, the sharp increase in medical costs in Thailand stems from profound shifts in health needs and healthcare delivery. Medical costs in Thailand, which have been skyrocketing since 2020, are projected to increase by another 15% next year, requiring sustainable solutions and joint efforts from individuals, the private sector and the government, say analysts. According to global consultancy Willis Towers Watson (WTW), the sharp increase in medical expenses stems from profound shifts in health needs and healthcare delivery. Many individuals who postponed routine care during the pandemic now require more complex and costly treatment. The medical community also observed higher infection rates, particularly in paediatric care, with children more susceptible to common illnesses as a consequence of reduced exposure to routine viruses during the lockdown periods. These factors caused a cascade effect, amplifying costs across all age groups and medical services, said Jeremy Lim, market leader for Thailand and Malaysia for insurance consulting and technology practices at WTW. Medical costs in Thailand are projected to increase by 14.2% in 2025, down from a 15.2% hike this year, but far outstripping the general rate of inflation of 1.2%, he said. ""The continual development and advancements in medical technology and delivery infrastructure have also contributed to an increase in healthcare costs,"" said Mr Lim. ""These challenges demand a unified response from consumers, healthcare providers and policymakers to build a more resilient and cost-effective healthcare system that ensures quality care remains accessible to all."" As healthcare needs and costs grow, public healthcare systems face more challenges and private insurers face increasing pressure to adapt their services and pricing models, he said. For years, life insurers providing health insurance maintained stable premiums, even during the height of the pandemic, while general insurers have historically been more likely to increase premiums. ""However, the cumulative impact of rising medical costs has made adjustments for the life industry inevitable to ensure coverage remains sustainable. One approach gaining traction is the repricing of health insurance policies, allowing insurers to accurately reflect current claims and trends, and maintain fair premiums across various age groups,"" said Mr Lim. Beyond repricing, insurers are encouraging consumers to play a more active role in managing healthcare expenses. By choosing cost-effective options, such as generic drugs over branded ones or home treatment for minor ailments, policyholders can help mitigate rising costs. He said health insurance plans with cost-sharing features, such as a co-pay scheme in which the consumer and insurer split the cost of the medical expense based on a specified percentage and deductibles, with the customer paying a specified amount and the insurer covering the remainder, promotes responsible healthcare spending. ""Ensuring the long-term sustainability of health insurance in Thailand requires cooperation from all key players in the healthcare ecosystem,"" said Mr Lim. Insurers can work to negotiate hospital discounts, provide access to specialised services, and review medical bills to verify necessity and control expenses. Hospitals can help by implementing cost-effective care protocols and focusing on reducing avoidable readmissions, he said. Mr Lim said the government's role is equally essential, from setting policies that encourage cost management to standardising the definitions of what a medical necessity is and regulating pharmaceutical prices. ""As healthcare costs continue to climb, repricing health insurance is not only a financial adjustment, but also a vital step towards a sustainable healthcare future,"" he said. If insurers, healthcare providers, policymakers and consumers work together, Thailand can create a resilient system that maintains access to quality care while managing costs responsibly, said Mr Lim.

News Flag Status - HALF STAFF Listen NEW CASTLE – The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) announced today enhancements to the C ostAware website , designed to help Delawareans understand how their health care dollars are spent by comparing the variation of average costs for different episodes of care and medical services based on actual medical claims in Delaware. In early 2020, DHSS and the Delaware Health Care Commission (DHCC) began working with Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) to develop and implement various health care cost and quality analyses. These analyses leverage data in the Delaware Health Care Claims Database (HCCD), established through legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2016. DHIN manages the HCCD and DHSS uses it to inform and support a variety of health care policy initiatives. The newest CostAware updates include the addition of data for calendar year 2022 and Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) beneficiaries, an enhanced report comparing costs for brand and generic prescription drugs by drug class and payer category (commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare), and new reports for treatment of psychosis and cervical cancer screening. New Data: This CostAware release includes results based on analysis of 2022 claims data. Results for 2023 claims data will be added before the end of this calendar year. Prescription Drug Costs compares the average daily cost of brand and generic drugs in Delaware by drug class and payer category based on 2022 pharmacy claims data. The enhanced report adds the ability to view results by gender and age group. Prescription drugs are identified by National Drug Code (NDC) and grouped into classes assigned based on the condition the drug is intended to treat. Psychosis is a new report that compares the average cost to treat psychosis episodes grouped by diagnosis (report in development, more details soon). Cervical Cancer Screening is a new quality focused report that highlights variation in the rate of cervical cancer screening (report in development, more details soon). “Delawareans can now view additional data and compare costs for brand and generic prescription drugs to help make better decisions around their health care,” said DHSS Cabinet Secretary Josette Manning , who is also a member of the Delaware Health Care Commission. “CostAware continues to be a valuable tool to provide transparency around the health care dollars that are spent by Delawareans and their insurers.” The most recent version of CostAware (last updated in September 2023) also includes: Average costs for episodes of care including C-section births, emergency department visits, knee and hip replacement, and vaginal delivery reported for Delaware hospitals. Average costs of imaging procedures including head CT, lumbar spine MRI, and screening mammography by care setting and for Delaware imaging centers. Average cost per visit for medical services including child wellness visits, mental and behavioral health services, diabetes care, cardiac procedures, adult doctor visits, and lab tests (blood and urine tests). Results reported by care setting including hospital outpatient facility, outpatient lab, professional office, urgent care facility, and telehealth. Multiple years of data: Results are reported for calendar years 2019 through 2022. Filtering of results by insurance category (commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare) and patient age group and gender (as appropriate) Early in his administration, Governor John Carney said one of the most important things he could do as Governor is to slow the growth of health care spending. The State health care spending benchmark—an annual per-capita-rate-of-growth benchmark for health care spending and multiple health care quality measures that are to be evaluated and adjusted every three years – was established through Executive Order 25 signed by Governor Carney in November 2018 and codified in August of 2023 through House Amendment 1 for House Bill 442 . In the most recent benchmark trend report released May 2024 for calendar year 2022, the per capita health care spending in Delaware increased 6.3% to $9,657, outpacing a 3% growth rate benchmark. The CostAware website was developed by DHSS and DHCC in collaboration with DHIN.

Devdiscourse News Desk | Nairobi | Updated: 26-11-2024 19:08 IST | Created: 26-11-2024 19:08 IST Dr. Barasa highlighted the importance of four new UHC laws, which have been instrumental in shaping Kenya’s healthcare framework. Country: Kenya SHARE The Ministry of Health reaffirmed its commitment to providing affordable and quality healthcare for all Kenyans during a meeting with faith-based healthcare stakeholders held at Landmark Plaza on 25th November 2024. Cabinet Secretary for Health, Dr. Deborah M. Barasa, highlighted the progress of the Taifa Care initiative and the roll-out of the Social Health Authority (SHA), key components of Kenya's Universal Health Coverage (UHC) strategy. Major Developments in Universal Healthcare Nationwide Access through SHA15.2 million Kenyans are now registered under Taifa Care, marking significant strides toward a fully publicly financed primary healthcare system. Through SHA, Kenyans can access free primary healthcare services across 8,336 contracted facilities, including: 5,210 government-owned facilities 319 faith-based facilities 2,807 private facilities Support for Faith-Based Healthcare Providers Faith-based organizations were recognized for their vital contributions, particularly in rural and underserved areas, where they often provide the only available healthcare services. Dr Barasa assured stakeholders of the Ministry's ongoing support, stating, “The Ministry is committed to ensuring every Kenyan has access to quality and affordable healthcare. Strategic collaborations, such as those with faith-based organizations, are instrumental in this mission.” To reinforce these partnerships, the Ministry has disbursed KES 938.6 million to faith-based facilities as part of a broader KES 5.05 billion payment to healthcare providers. These funds address financial obligations inherited from the defunct National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and support claims from October 2024 onwards. Strategic Collaboration and Problem-Solving During the meeting, stakeholders discussed challenges in SHA’s rollout, including delayed payments and resource mobilization for outstanding claims. The Ministry assured participants of its efforts to expedite processes, mobilize additional funds, and enhance operational efficiency in collaboration with SHA leadership. Dr. Barasa was joined by key figures, including Dr. Patrick Amoth, Director General for Health, and Dr. Mohammed Abdi, Chairperson of SHA, alongside leaders from the Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK). Progress through Legislation Dr. Barasa highlighted the importance of four new UHC laws, which have been instrumental in shaping Kenya’s healthcare framework. These laws enable partnerships with various healthcare providers and promote equitable access to services for all Kenyans, regardless of income or location. Vision for the Future As part of Kenya’s UHC agenda, the Ministry aims to expand access to essential health services, improve resource allocation, and strengthen partnerships with private and faith-based providers. Taifa Care and SHA continue to play pivotal roles in realizing the right to health for every Kenyan, as enshrined in the constitution. This meeting underscores the Ministry's focus on collaboration, inclusivity, and strategic planning to build a robust, sustainable healthcare system that serves all citizens.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (NASDAQ:TNDM) stands against the other oversold healthcare stocks. The Promising Outlook for Healthcare Investments in 2024 Investing in healthcare stocks during lean economic times is generally regarded as defensive.

Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Dr Oladoyin Odubanjo, said the already inadequate human resources for health have become even more ineffective than they were, such that in a big city in the South-West, thought to be a medical epicentre, people are beginning to experience difficulty accessing healthcare from appropriate personnel. He claimed that some high-profile cases of medical mismanagement in the news in the last year were all done by quacks. “The already grossly inadequate human resources for health have become even more inadequate than they were before, such that even in the city centres in the south where we thought people could at least access healthcare, they are beginning to find it difficult even to access healthcare from appropriate personnel now. However, he said reversing the situation in the health sector requires improving the operating environment to stop health workers’ emigrating, making local production of medical consumables and medicines easy and cheap, as well as a strong political will and purity of purpose to get the right things done. President of the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN), Professor Muhammad A. Mohammad, in reaction, said the cost of healthcare has gone up about five to seven times what it was before due to many factors, including the high cost of energy and medical consumables, inflation, and depreciation in the naira exchange rate. “For example, the cost of electricity in the last year has increased by about five to seven times what it was before. Hospitals have high energy consumption. So, you can think of the cost of running every machine in a hospital. The hospital is a place where you will not want to have one minute of power failure because it can mean the life of someone.” Professor Mohammad said although MDCAN, during a courtesy call to the president, had urged a special rebate on energy for hospitals and a 50 percent reduction on power costs to the hospitals, which was approved, it is yet to be implemented. He said access across the three tiers of healthcare delivery is poor, infrastructural provisions at the facilities are not enough, the number of functional primary healthcare centres is not enough for the population, and the waiting time is making people look for other options like consulting at the pharmacy. “The community members are discouraged from visiting these facilities. They feel that it is a waste of time to seek services at these places. It’s very strained and cumbersome to assess healthcare because there are a lot of bottlenecks and bureaucracies, and it’s quite expensive,” he added. A public health physician with the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Professor Tanimola Akande, said access to healthcare in Nigeria is low for various reasons, which include poor geographical access, particularly for those living in rural areas. “Some cultures require permission from men to access healthcare, and there are various cultural beliefs that prevent men and women from accessing healthcare. Health insurance coverage is meant to reduce this challenge, but the coverage of Nigerians is very low.” President of the University of Ibadan Students’ Union, Mr Damilola Aweda noted that access to healthcare services is non-negotiable and the right of everybody. “UCH, Ibadan, the foremost healthcare provider in the country, was out of electricity for almost four weeks, and nothing was done. The same thing happened to many other tertiary providers. It is very bad. “If that is happening in these foremost hospitals, you can imagine what is happening in the secondary and primary healthcare facilities. So, the government has to do a whole lot more in revamping the healthcare sector.” In a reaction, the President of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Professor Bala Audu, said despite Japa syndrome, quality of care is still high in the country, and there is no type of medical care that people require that is not available in Nigeria. “We have a private sector-driven, highly-specialised service in Nigeria that can compete anywhere. It depends on whether you know where to access it or if you can afford to access it. Everything they use is imported, from medications, reagents for tests, to machinery,” he added. Professor Audu claimed that healthcare services are extremely cheap in Nigeria and a high proportion of patients come in from other countries to seek treatment. According to him, “the cost of healthcare is a value that is equated to the value of the naira as it exchanges these for foreign currency. Virtually everything you utilise within the health sector is an imported product. With one dollar, one cannot buy paracetamol in the US. But with one dollar, you can buy a packet of paracetamol in Nigeria.” He said addressing access and cost of healthcare services will require a holistic approach given that health cannot be isolated from other sectors. “No cost will go down so long as all the factors that determine cost and demand are going up. It will not spare the costs within the health sector.” READ ALSO: Over 70 per cent of Nigerians don’t know their health status, not bothered —Abiodun Adeoye EXPOSED!!

With global and local pushes towards safer, smarter healthcare systems, it is time to truly begin to explore technology-driven solutions to improve patient care and reduce risks. From medication errors to fall prevention and infection control, various technological advancements are now available to enhance safety and streamline operations. These tools not only offer precision in addressing specific patient needs but also ease the workload on healthcare workers, so that they can focus on essential, personalised care. Among the notable smart technologies gaining traction in hospitals are automated medication dispensers, which can significantly reduce the risk of errors that can occur during manual medication administration. These devices store and dispense specific doses automatically, which helps to ensure that patients receive the right medication at the correct times, minimising human error. TACKLING FALLS Fall-related injuries are a common issue and so fall prevention remains an area of concern for medical staff and there are now smart beds to address the risk of this. These beds have sensors that can alert staff when a patient may be attempting to get out of bed unassisted. This is especially beneficial in wards with patients with mobility issues. The beds can also be equipped with digital monitoring systems, which continuously track patients’ vital signs, providing instant alerts to healthcare staff if a patient’s condition shows signs of deterioration. This enables them to swiftly interevent if and when required. INFECTION CONTROL Infection control is another area where smart healthcare technology can make a considerable impact. Automated sanitisation systems, such as ultraviolet (UV) light robots and automated dispensers for hand sanitiser, are increasingly found in healthcare settings. Air filtration technologies can also be integrated into hospitals to improve air quality and reduce airborne transmission risks, a need that has been highlighted following the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital hygiene monitoring systems further support these efforts by tracking staff adherence to hand hygiene protocols. With their ability to provide real-time data and feedback, these systems can play a crucial role in infection prevention, helping to address issues like antimicrobial resistance and the spread of infectious diseases within healthcare facilities. Technology is evolving and is being increasingly applied across industry. For years, health technology has been moving towards achieving better health outcomes for patients and easier and more efficient workflows for healthcare workers. It may take some time, but I believe that our hospitals and health centres can one day transition to fully “smart” healthcare facilities. With interconnected systems and real-time monitoring of patient health, a smart hospital could offer a comprehensive and seamless healthcare experience. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. For example, patients’ health data could be automatically tracked and analysed, so that healthcare professionals can make data-driven decisions quickly. Such a facility could also support integrated communication between departments, improving coordination and minimising delays in patient care. While this vision of a fully smart hospital is ambitious, it is not unrealistic, given the continued advancements in healthcare technology and the rising focus on patient safety. A partnership between the Government and private sector could play a crucial role in realising this vision. Investment in health technology infrastructure, as well as in training healthcare workers, are essential for us to move towards a more technology driven healthcare sector. Patient safety is paramount, and smart healthcare technology has the potential to make a profound impact on healthcare outcomes. The Government has started the process of digitising some hospitals and it is my hope that in the next few years they will continue to build on this vision, and thus move us closer towards achieving fully smart health facilities. Prioritising funding, training, and ongoing maintenance will be important to ensure the success of these initiatives. Smart technologies can enable us to have a safer, more efficient, and better equipped healthcare facilities fully ready to meet the needs of our growing population.

CSA Images/Getty Images Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways You have scheduled an appointment with a health care provider, but no matter how hard you try, no one seems to be able to reliably tell you how much that visit will cost you. Will you have to pay US$20, $1,000 – or even more? Patients are increasingly on the hook for health care costs through deductibles, co-pays and other fees . As a result, patients are demanding credible cost information before appointments to choose where they seek care and control their budget. Yet, in spite of recent legislation and regulations , upfront information on patient out-of-pocket costs is still difficult to obtain from both health care providers and insurers. Predicting out-of-pocket costs Why is it so difficult to tell patients in advance how much their care is going to cost? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This is a question health economists like me try to answer. Although the fundamental reason is simply the unpredictable nature of health care, the fact that it translates to unpredictable out-of-pocket costs for patients is a policy choice. Health insurance plans in the U.S. such as Medicare and Medicare Advantage , as well as most individual and group plans , leave a percentage of the cost of care for patients to settle out of pocket. These include deductibles – the amount patients have to pay for a service before their insurance kicks in – or coinsurance , a percentage of the cost of care that patients must pay after they have met their deductible. Understandably, most patients want to know their out-of-pocket costs before a doctor’s office visit or a trip to the hospital. However, the cost of care – and thus the percentage of the cost patients will pay – often isn’t available until after care has been delivered. This is because of the way health care providers are paid for their work. How many health care services you’ll need for a given illness or procedure can be unpredictable. DNY59/E+ via Getty Images Health care providers typically seek payments for each patient retrospectively, based on the volume and intensity of services they have delivered. But both are hard to predict. A physician usually needs to see a patient before deciding how to address their health care needs. Sometimes, an extra test or imaging scan is needed to confirm a diagnosis or plan treatment. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Crucially, a variety of unexpected complications can occur even during routine procedures. Addressing these unforeseen complications often requires providing unanticipated services and involving other health care providers who might not have been part of the visit otherwise. And these extra services cost money. As long as policymakers keep health care payments tied to the volume and intensity of performed medical services – which are uncertain – and patient cost-sharing tied to health care payments, patients will not be able to know what their out-of-pocket costs will be in advance. Simply making health care service prices publicly available will not change that. What can be done to guarantee out-of-pocket costs before patients have their appointments? Health care delivery as a supply chain One idea researchers have proposed is to reorganize health care delivery into a supply chain . This would shift production risk to health care providers similarly to how other complex products are offered to consumers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Consider air travel tickets. Consumers taking a flight from one city to another receive services from multiple entities, such as airlines, airports, aviation fuel suppliers and catering companies. Many of these entities face operational uncertainties such as departure delays or variable fuel consumption due to unpredictable weather. But airlines – as the final link in the supply chain – provide consumers with upfront prices for the entire trip. In health care, the principal provider from whom a patient seeks care could serve as the price-guaranteeing entity. They would collect a single, guaranteed price for the appointment and compensate other providers involved as needed. Some researchers have proposed aspects of this idea as a potential way to reduce surprise billing from out-of-network emergency physicians working at in-network hospitals. However, such a major reorganization of health care delivery would be extremely challenging, as it would require all providers to enter into new contractual arrangements with each other. It would not only cause a legal undertaking of unprecedented scale, but it could also end up being financially devastating for small physician practices . Co-payment-only health plans There are other approaches to providing patients with reliable, upfront prices that would not require a complete overhaul of the health care system. The U.S. already has much of the needed infrastructure in place: health insurance. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A primary purpose of health insurance is to protect beneficiaries from financial shocks. Health insurers could modify the benefit design of policies to ensure patients obtain guaranteed out-of-pocket cost information before receiving care. One way to achieve that would be saying goodbye to deductibles and coinsurance and having insured patients pay for their care only in the form of co-payments – fixed dollar amounts per encounter, such as $20 per doctor’s visit, $35 per prescription drug fill or $500 per hospital stay. Some insurance plans already offer this. However, this approach removes incentives for patients to seek care from providers that offer quality services at a low price. It also could potentially increase monthly health insurance costs , also called premiums. Improving how health care is delivered could make for more transparent out-of-pocket costs for patients. skynesher/E+ via Getty Images Innovative health insurance design Based on my own research, I propose that an alternative solution to providing patients with reliable, upfront prices could be implementing episode-based cost-sharing into health insurance plans. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Under this model, health insurers would create bundles of services that patients may receive during a health care visit. This approach would provide patients with a single upfront price for the entire bundle based only on factors known in advance, such as their health insurance benefits and who their principal health care provider is. For example, you would have a guaranteed price tag for the cost of going to the hospital to give birth to a child or replace a joint. Any deviation from the ultimate cost of care due to unforeseen situations patients have little control over would be borne by the insurer. That is what insurers do for a living – they know how to manage risk. Such a modification to health insurance benefit design would protect patients from unexpected health care costs, while preserving the incentive to seek care with high-value providers. It would also help keep health insurance premiums intact. Seeking care for a health concern is already stressful. It does not have to be more stressful because of cost uncertainty. Several approaches to help patients know how much their care is going to cost in advance are available for policymakers to consider. In the meantime, patients may need to pick up the phone , call their hospital billing office and hope that the amount they obtain will be close to the amount they will eventually find on their medical bills.

I’ve seen the impact. It is time for Utah legislators to start making public policy that is informed by data and not by their personal code of conduct. (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A rally in the Capitol Rotunda in Salt Lake City on Tuesday May 21, 2019 was part of a nationwide series of protests to bring attention as a number of conservative states pass laws aimed at getting abortion before the U.S. Supreme Court. Editor’s note: Abortion remains legal in Utah up to 18 weeks, with some exceptions after that limit. In the coming years, we are likely taking some of the most significant steps backward for women, their well-being and their access to health care. It is critical that state governments that seek to limit access to reproductive health care — like Utah — begin to anticipate how their public policy impacts women’s well-being and state budgets. Social scientists like myself have long argued that restricting women’s reproductive health care not only has consequences for women’s physical health but also has critical implications for their mental health. In the upcoming legislative session, Utah legislators need to thoroughly consider the negative impact that restrictive reproductive health care policies have on women’s mental health or endure the consequences of a massive uptick in the need for mental health services. The latest science shows that, throughout human history, strong social networks are the foundation of a sense of safety, security and mental well-being. Social connectedness and social support have always been one of the primary determinants of survival, the means for reproduction and caregiving for humans. Our brains are biologically wired to constantly scan for potential threats to our close relationships. For people who live in unsafe environments, their brains do this mental scanning on overdrive — or what researchers characterize as “hypervigilance.” While chronic hypervigilance is critical for maintaining safety in harsh environments, it can also be harmful to mental health because it depletes mental resources, which can lead to mental health problems like anxiety or depression. Many women seek out reproductive health care services to maintain existing emotional, physical or financial support from their social networks. For example, a woman may choose to take emergency contraception if her family would disapprove of her becoming pregnant. On the other hand, a woman may seek out services to protect herself from unsafe social environments. For example, a woman may choose to end her pregnancy if becoming pregnant may put her at risk of domestic violence from her partner. Legislating women’s reproductive health care is often either reducing or eliminating a woman’s ability to maintain mental or physical safety in a social context. We also know that public policy conveys social norms and expectations; shows how our state values specific populations; and highlights the stigma people have against others. When legislators restrict access to reproductive health care, they are socially communicating that women are unable to make their own health care decisions, that women should feel shame when accessing reproductive health care and that women who do access care should not be socially supported by those who are close to her. In other words: When women are constantly monitored, stigmatized, scrutinized and, in some cases, criminally charged for how they choose to care for their reproductive health, legislators inherently create a social environment for women that tells their brain that they are unsafe — all of which increases their risk for mental health challenges. Even for women who live in states with protected access to reproductive health care or who can’t become pregnant, the symbolic nature of restrictive laws may have consequences for their mental health. Some researchers have already observed a direct increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms in women — particularly those of reproductive age — across the U.S. following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Other researchers have also found that women in states with limited access to reproductive health care had more symptoms of mental health problems than women in non-restrictive states. For a state like Utah, where mental health care resources are already overburdened , a sharp uptick in the need for mental health care could be catastrophic for providers and costly to the state. Dozens of states across the U.S. — including Utah — have and will likely continue to restrict access to reproductive health care services. Multiple states have gone beyond limiting access to abortion services, and it is possible that other states — like Utah — will follow suit this upcoming legislative session. For example, Oklahoma introduced bills to restrict access to emergency contraception. Idaho passed abortion criminalization , meaning women can face felony charges for having an abortion. Idaho also passed abortion trafficking laws, meaning residents can face felony charges for transporting or harboring minors seeking out abortion services. While investigation for how these specific pieces of legislation will impact women is ongoing, the existing data is clear: Women’s mental health and well-being suffer when we restrict their access to health care. As we approach the legislative session in January, it is critical to understand the nature in which legislating women’s health care will have consequences for women’s health and wellbeing. I urge Utah legislators to look to the evidence within social science when making any decisions about women’s access to reproductive health care this upcoming legislative session. When the evidence is clear, public policy should follow suit. It is time for Utah legislators to start making public policy that is informed by data and not by their personal code of conduct.

Over the past three months, 60% of the 40,000 healthcare job postings on the platform have specifically sought out women professionals. Advertisement This growing trend is reflective of the broader expansion in India’s healthcare industry, driven by increased government investment in public healthcare and the push by private players to build services in smaller cities. Advertisement The surge in healthcare jobs is particularly notable in Tier two and three cities, where job postings have jumped by 50%, compared to a 35% rise in Tier one cities. Cities like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Indore are emerging as new hubs for healthcare employment, with demand rising for roles such as nurses, attendants, medical representatives, and lab technicians. Meanwhile, in major cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi, there has been an uptick in demand for pharmacists, optometrists, dental assistants, and operation theatre technicians. This geographic and sectoral expansion of healthcare services is helping create more jobs for women, particularly in areas that were once traditionally male-dominated. Also Read: Changing weather and pneumonia: The lesser-known symptoms you should be aware of The influx of leading healthcare providers such as Medplus, Tata 1mg, Pharmeasy, and Apollo Pharmacy is accelerating this change, with many companies spearheading initiatives to hire more women in the workforce. Apna (dot) co’s Founder and CEO, Nirmit Parikh, pointed out that the rise in women’s participation in healthcare is crucial for the sector’s evolution. He noted a 30% increase in the demand for women in critical care, diagnostics, and home healthcare roles. “The growing demand for women across these essential areas is a testament to the integral role they play in transforming India’s healthcare system,” Parikh said. He also highlighted that by 2030, India’s private healthcare sector is likely to add eight million jobs, creating vast opportunities for women, especially in leadership roles. The expansion in job opportunities is not just about filling positions but also about creating a more inclusive and diverse healthcare system.

https://www.aol.com/healthcare-stocks-recession-proof-013830065.html,,Are Healthcare Stocks Recession - Proof ? ,20241121T023000Z,https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_smartasset_312/8b1ef6b3e4fb1981cc23547484fe3731,aol.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"SmartAsset Team November 20, 2024 at 8:38 PM 0 Copied An investor reviewing the performance of healthcare stocks in her portfolio. During economic uncertainty, investors often seek recession-resistant assets for stability. Healthcare stocks are seen as resilient since healthcare needs persist regardless of financial conditions. Unlike cyclical industries, healthcare is a non-discretionary sector where demand for medication, treatment and services remains steady. However, while healthcare stocks typically perform better during recessions, they are not entirely immune to downturns. A financial advisor can help you evaluate and choose recession-resistant investments. Recessions and Investing A recession is generally defined as a period of declining economic activity, often marked by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. During a recession, consumer spending typically falls and businesses cut back on spending. This usually results in job losses, decreased income and reduced corporate profits. For investors, recessions present a challenging environment as stock market volatility increases, and many industries experience declines in earnings and stock prices. Certain types of stocks, known as defensive stocks , tend to fare better in recessions because they are less sensitive to economic cycles. These include sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. Defensive stocks generally perform well because they provide essential goods and services that people continue to need regardless of economic conditions. This contrasts with cyclical stocks , such as those in the retail and automotive sectors, which depend heavily on consumer spending and are more vulnerable during economic downturns. Investing during a recession often requires a more cautious and strategic approach. Some investors may shift toward defensive sectors to protect their portfolios from significant losses, while others may take the opportunity to buy undervalued stocks in cyclical sectors. Diversifying across industries, including those traditionally viewed as recession-resistant, can help minimize risk and provide greater stability during periods of economic decline. How Healthcare Stocks Fare During Recessions Historically, healthcare stocks have shown resilience during economic downturns. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader S&P 500, with healthcare stocks declining far less than other sectors. This resilience can be attributed to the essential nature of healthcare services, as people require medical care regardless of the economy’s state. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain healthcare companies saw increased demand for products and services, particularly those involved in testing, treatment and vaccine development. While this was an unusual recession driven by a healthcare crisis, it further demonstrated the sector’s unique ability to adapt and thrive in challenging times. Are Healthcare Stocks Recession-Proof? An investor comparing different types of healthcare stocks. While healthcare stocks tend to perform well during economic downturns, they are not entirely recession-proof . After all, no investment can be said to be 100% recession proof; there’s always an inherent risk. Factors such as regulatory changes, drug approval delays and shifts in healthcare policy can impact individual companies and subsectors differently. And not all healthcare companies are equally resilient, either. For example, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that rely heavily on research and development may face setbacks if economic conditions lead to funding challenges or delayed approvals. In most recessions, healthcare stocks do tend to be more stable than those in discretionary sectors. However, investors should keep in mind that the sector is not immune to volatility and risks . While healthcare stocks can add defensive strength to a portfolio, they should still be part of a diversified investment strategy , as no single sector is guaranteed to be entirely recession-proof. Types of Healthcare Stocks Investing in healthcare stocks during a recession can provide stability, but understanding the different types of healthcare stocks can help you make more targeted investment decisions depending on current market conditions and outlook. The healthcare sector is diverse, with various segments that offer different risk and growth potential: Healthcare facilities and operators : This includes hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers that offer medical services. These facilities generate consistent demand for services, as people continue to seek care for routine and emergency health needs regardless of the economy. However, shifts in healthcare policy or changes in reimbursement rates can impact their profitability. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals : Companies in this category research, develop, and market drugs and treatments. While they can be lucrative due to the high demand for new treatments, they face unique risks, including regulatory hurdles and competition. Pharmaceutical companies with well-established products often fare better than biotech firms, which may depend on the success of a limited number of experimental drugs. Medical equipment : This category includes companies that manufacture essential medical devices and equipment, such as diagnostic tools, surgical instruments and healthcare technology. Demand for medical equipment remains strong during recessions, as hospitals and healthcare providers continue to require these products to deliver care. These companies may also benefit from long-term contracts and consistent demand. Health insurance and pharmacy benefit management : Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers play an important role in managing healthcare costs and providing coverage for individuals. While these stocks can be relatively stable, they are affected by changes in healthcare laws and insurance regulations. During recessions, demand for health insurance often remains steady, though profit margins can be influenced by policy changes. Bottom Line An investor reviewing her portfolio. Healthcare stocks are often considered a safer choice during recessions due to the essential nature of healthcare services. However, while they may offer some stability, they are not entirely immune to economic downturns or industry-specific risks. Investors looking for recession-resistant investments may find healthcare stocks to be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio, balancing growth potential with relative stability. Careful selection and a diversified approach can help manage risk and provide greater resilience during periods of economic uncertainty.

Roughly 40 years earlier, Max Planck had done something similar in physics by discovering the rules of quantum mechanics, reducing uncertainty in an unpredictable universe. These two minds, though working in entirely different fields, shared a common vision: to bring order out of entropy. Today, their legacies hold surprising relevance in one of the most advanced frontiers of modern medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. AI has become an essential tool in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and guiding complex treatments. Yet, despite the promise of precision, AI systems in health care remain susceptible to a dangerous form of entropy—a creeping disorder that can lead to systemic errors, missed diagnoses, and faulty recommendations. As more hospitals and medical facilities rely on these technologies, the stakes are as high as ever. The dream of reducing medical error through AI has, in some cases, transformed into a new breed of error, one rooted in the uncertainty of the machine’s algorithms. In Shannon’s world, noise was the enemy. It was any interference that could distort or corrupt a message as it moved from sender to receiver. To combat this, Shannon developed systems of redundancy and error correction, ensuring that even with noise present, the message could still be received with clarity. The application of his ideas in health care AI is strikingly direct: (1) the “message,” which is the patient’s medical data, is a series of symptoms, imaging results, and historical records; (2) the “noise” is the complexity of translating this data by artificial intelligence into accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. In theory, these health care artificial intelligence programs have the capacity to process vast amounts of data, identifying even the most subtle patterns while filtering out irrelevant noise, ultimately making valuable predictions about future behaviors and outcomes. Even more impressive, the software becomes smarter with each use. The fact that machine learning algorithms aren’t more prevalent in modern medical practice likely has more to do with limitations in data availability and computing power than with the validity of the technology itself. The concept is solid, and if machine learning isn’t fully integrated now, it’s certainly on the horizon. Health care professionals must realize that machine learning researchers grapple with the constant tradeoff between accuracy and intelligibility. Accuracy refers to how often the algorithm provides the correct answer. Intelligibility, on the other hand, relates to our ability to understand how or why the algorithm reached its conclusion. As machine learning software grows more accurate, it often becomes less intelligible because it learns and improves without relying on explicit instructions. The most accurate models frequently become the least understandable, and vice versa. This forces machine learning developers to strike a balance, deciding how much accuracy they’re willing to sacrifice to make the system more understandable. The problem emerges when health care AI, fed vast amounts of data, begins to lose clarity in its predictions. One case involved an AI diagnostic system used to predict patient outcomes for those suffering from pneumonia. The system performed well, except in one critical instance: it incorrectly concluded that asthma patients had better survival rates. This misleading result stemmed from the system’s reliance on historical data, where patients with asthma were treated more aggressively, skewing the predictions. Here, health care AI created informational noise, a false assumption that led to a critical misinterpretation of risk. Shannon’s solution to noise was error correction, ensuring that the system could detect when something was wrong. In the same way, health care AI needs robust feedback loops, automated methods of identifying when its conclusions stray too far from reality. Just as Shannon’s redundancy codes can correct transmission errors, health care AI systems should be designed with self-correction capabilities that can recognize when predictions are distorted by data biases or statistical outliers. Max Planck also brought precision to the unpredictable world of subatomic particles. His quantum theory was based on the understanding that the universe, at its smallest scales, isn’t chaotic but governed by discrete laws. His insightful genius transformed physics, allowing scientists and physicists to predict outcomes with extraordinary accuracy. In health care AI, precision is equally important. Yet the unpredictability of machine learning algorithms often mirrors the chaotic universe that Planck sought to tame. This lack of precision is akin to Planck’s early world of chaos, before his solutions in quantum theory provided order. Planck’s brilliance was recognizing that if we broke down complex systems into small, manageable units, precision could be achieved. In the case of health care AI, precision can be achieved by ensuring that the training data is representative of all patient demographics. If health care AI is to reduce medical entropy, it must be trained and retrained on diverse datasets, ensuring that its predictive models apply equally across racial, ethnic, and gender lines. Just as Planck’s discovery of quantum “packets” brought precision to physics, diversity in AI data can bring precision to health care AI’s medical judgments. Medical AI errors are unlike the traditional human errors of misdiagnosis or surgical mistakes. They are systemic errors often rooted in the data, algorithms, and processes that underpin the AI systems themselves. These errors arise not from negligence or fatigue but from the very foundation of AI design. It is here that Shannon and Planck’s principles become vital. Take, for example, a health care AI system deployed to predict which patients in the ICU are at the highest risk of death. If the AI system misinterpreted patient data to such an extent that it predicted lower-risk patients would die sooner than high-risk ones, the AI would prompt doctors to focus attention on the wrong individuals. One could envision how uncontrolled AI-driven medical entropy would cause increasing disorder in our health care system, leading to catastrophic results. Human lives are on the line, and each misstep in the AI algorithm represents a potential catastrophe. Much like quantum systems that evolve based on probabilities, health care AI systems must be adaptive, learning from their errors, recalibrating based on new data, and continuously refining their predictive models. This is how entropy is reduced in an environment where the potential for chaos is ever-present. While AI in health care promises to revolutionize medicine, the cost of unmanaged entropy is far too high. When AI systems fail, it is not just a matter of missed phone calls or dropped internet connections—it is the misdiagnosis of cancer, the incorrect assignment of priority in the ICU, or the faulty prediction of survival rates. Health care AI systems must be designed with real-time feedback that mimics Shannon’s error-correcting codes. These feedback loops can identify when predictions deviate from reality and adjust accordingly, reducing the noise that leads to AI misdiagnoses or improper AI treatment plans. Just as Planck achieved precision through a detailed understanding of atomic behavior, health care AI must reach its potential by accounting for the diversity of human biology. The more diverse the data, the more precise and accurate the health care AI becomes, ensuring that its predictions hold true for all patients. Claude Shannon and Max Planck taught us that accuracy matters. The health care AI systems we build must reflect their commitment to precision. Just as Shannon fought against noise and Planck sought order from chaos, health care AI must strive to reduce the entropy of errors that currently plague it. It is only by incorporating robust error correction, embracing data diversity, and ensuring continuous learning that health care AI can fulfill its promise of improving patient outcomes without introducing new dangers. The future of medicine, like the future of communication and physics, depends on our ability to tame uncertainty and bring order to complex systems. Shannon and Planck showed us how, and now it’s time for health care AI to follow their lead. In the end, reducing health care AI entropy is not just about preventing miscommunication or miscalculation—it’s about saving human lives. ADVERTISEMENT Neil Anand is an anesthesiologist.

(Photo Metro Creative Services) By Ed Gaskin PUBLISHED: November 16, 2024 at 12:56 AM EST On Sept. 28, 2022, the White House held its first Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years, marking an important milestone in addressing the connections between diet, health, and economic strength. Two years later a Food Is Medicine Policy Update conference was hosted by Validation Institute, Inc. The conference reflected an increased understanding of how poor nutrition, and the resulting diet-related diseases contribute to the U.S. healthcare crisis, creating a ripple effect on economic productivity, healthcare spending, and global competitiveness. With its significant purchasing power and policy influence, the U.S. government has a unique opportunity to address nutrition-related issues that contribute to high healthcare costs — a drain on the economy that Warren Buffett has aptly called a “tapeworm.” Despite spending more on healthcare than any other high-income country, the United States has the lowest life expectancy at birth, and the highest rates of multiple chronic diseases among wealthy nations. Buffett has highlighted the economic strain that high healthcare costs place on American businesses. Since 1960, healthcare spending as a share of GDP has surged from 5% to about 18%. This disparity means U.S. companies face a significantly higher financial burden compared to businesses in countries with lower healthcare costs, putting them at a global disadvantage. The U.S. spends nearly 18% of GDP on healthcare, a figure vastly higher than the 10-12% average of other OECD countries. The difference between what the US spends, and what other nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development spend is money that could be invested in America without having to raise taxes or cut programs. This disparity suggests significant room for improvement. These high costs make American companies less competitive globally, reducing their ability to invest in innovation, wages, and growth, as they bear a heavier financial burden, The economic impact extends beyond direct healthcare costs to lost productivity. Chronic illnesses linked to poor nutrition, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, contribute to an estimated $260 billion in lost productivity each year due to factors like absenteeism, disability, and reduced work performance. Addressing these health issues through better nutrition is essential to reducing these costs and enabling businesses to reallocate funds to critical areas like employee development and technology. In response to these challenges, the federal government has been exploring “Food is Medicine” initiatives, which emphasize the role of nutrition in preventing and managing diet-related diseases. These programs integrate nutrition into healthcare by promoting access to healthy food as a form of medical treatment, prescribing food-based interventions to prevent or treat chronic conditions. For example, some healthcare providers now offer “produce prescriptions” that allow patients to purchase fruits and vegetables instead of relying solely on medications. This approach has shown promise in reducing disease severity, cutting healthcare costs, and improving patients’ overall quality of life. The Food is Medicine model represents a shift toward preventive healthcare, where nutrition plays a central role in maintaining health and reducing reliance on costly medical interventions. The U.S. ranks among the highest for certain nutrition-related health issues, such as obesity and diabetes. The Global Nutrition Report shows that about 36.2% of American adults are categorized as obese — significantly higher than the global average — largely due to dietary factors like high consumption of processed and calorie-dense foods. If the U.S. were to improve its nutrition outcomes to align with other high-income countries, it could achieve substantial cost savings in healthcare. Here’s how enhanced nutrition could reduce healthcare spending and boost the economy: Reduction in Chronic Disease Rates Chronic diseases, driven largely by poor diets, account for about 90% of the $4.1 trillion spent annually on healthcare in the U.S. The CDC estimates that improving diet quality and reducing obesity and related conditions could significantly decrease the need for ongoing treatment, hospitalizations, and medications, resulting in billions of dollars in savings each year. Lower Demand for Acute and Long-Term Care Diet-related diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease increase the likelihood of acute events such as heart attacks and strokes, which require costly treatments and often result in long-term care needs. According to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease costs are projected to reach $749 billion by 2035 if current trends continue. Improved nutrition could mitigate these conditions, reducing the demand for both immediate and extended healthcare services. Increased Workforce Productivity and Reduced Absenteeism Healthier diets contribute to better physical and mental health, resulting in fewer sick days and increased productivity in the workplace. By reducing chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, businesses could see fewer productivity losses, which indirectly benefits the economy and strengthens American competitiveness. Reduced Government Healthcare Expenditure With Medicare and Medicaid covering a large share of chronic disease treatment, improved nutrition would reduce financial strain on public health programs. This could lower the taxpayer burden and free up resources for other priorities or improve healthcare services without increasing overall spending. Preventive Healthcare Cost Savings Countries with better nutrition outcomes have shown that investing in preventive health yields long-term savings. For every dollar invested in public health initiatives targeting lifestyle diseases, the CDC estimates a return of $5-$10 in reduced healthcare costs. By shifting toward preventive strategies, the U.S. could lower per capita healthcare spending over time, making the system more sustainable and equitable. In Finland, public health campaigns emphasizing dietary improvements successfully reduced heart disease rates, demonstrating the power of government-led initiatives to improve population health. Similarly, Singapore has incorporated nutritional programs into community health systems, often leveraging technology such as mHealth apps to support dietary compliance and monitor health outcomes. These efforts have improved health markers across populations, reduced healthcare spending, and fostered a culture of health consciousness that benefits both individuals and the broader economy.

United States Antitrust/Competition Law Courtney Bedell Averbach, Christopher Brennan, and Michelle Mantine Your Author LinkedIn Connections To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Key takeaways Outgoing head of DOJ Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter asserted health care consolidation has failed to deliver on promised efficiencies and outcomes. Kanter repeatedly compared the health care industry to Big Tech, which has been a massive enforcement target over the last four years. Health care entities should closely follow emerging antitrust approaches for technology and payment platforms to stay ahead of potential enforcement strategies. On November 12, 2024, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter delivered prepared remarks that criticized the ""platformization"" of health care and called on enforcers to ""fundamentally redefine"" how antitrust policy applies to health care companies and associated labor markets. Given the subject matter of his speech, it is apt that Kanter spoke at Carnegie Mellon University's campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as Pittsburgh has long been recognized as a hub for health care, life sciences, and technology. In his speech, Kanter painted a grim view of nearly all aspects of the U.S. health care industry, including federal Medicare programs, and argued that many of the procompetitive justifications for consolidation ultimately have resulted in ""less competitive, less efficient and more wasteful"" outcomes for patients and payors. Kanter criticized the interference of ""corporate middlemen"" in the delivery of care, which he asserted results in worse patient outcomes, higher prices, disillusioned providers, and stagnant wages for health care workers. Moreover, Kanter drew parallels between ""Big Tech"" and the emergence of ""Big Healthcare platforms,"" which he characterized as similar in terms of moat-building (i.e., the need for multi-level entry in order to compete against vertically integrated rivals); conflicts of interest (i.e., steering, self-preferencing, and other forms of exclusivity); and regulatory gamesmanship (i.e., the circumvention of medical-loss ratio requirements on insurers through increased spending among integrated affiliates). Focusing on how antitrust enforcers can combat this so-called ""platformization,"" Kanter emphasized the need to look beyond the rigid paradigms of traditional antitrust analysis, which historically have focused on simplistic models and discrete horizontal or vertical market definitions (e.g., provider markets or insurer markets), without considering the broader competitive interplays. Kanter emphasized that this approach, which he likened to playing ""Healthcare Tetris,"" was insufficient to address the real-word complexities of the health care industry. What does this mean for the health care industry – especially for major players who may be considering expansion and/or acquisitions in 2025? We offer the following observations: First , the bulk of Kanter's remarks were likely prepared in advance of the election. To the extent that this speech previewed new priorities in a Harris administration, Kanter acknowledged that his time overseeing the DOJ's Antitrust Division would soon be over. However, even though enforcement priorities will no doubt shift under a second Trump administration, we do not expect health care antitrust enforcement to die on the vine. Indeed, the more populist wing of the Republican party may see certain areas of the health care industry (e.g., pharmaceuticals) as appealing targets for continued antitrust activity. Second , the antitrust analysis of multisided markets and platforms continues to evolve, and we expect that evolution to continue during the Trump administration. Kanter posited that in the not-so-distant future, ""a few integrated health care platform stacks will amass a generational hold over health care,"" much like we have seen in Big Tech. Integrated health care entities should closely follow antitrust developments in payment platforms, app stores, social media ecosystems, and ecommerce marketplaces to stay ahead of the enforcement curve. Third , antitrust risks faced by the health care industry will remain high even if the Trump administration adopts a lighter enforcement touch. States retain broad enforcement powers over provider and payor acquisitions, and private parties will continue to file civil actions. In particular, new AI-based technology stacks may run afoul of price-fixing and other per se prohibitions under federal and state antitrust law. Kanter posited that in the not-so-distant future, ""a few integrated health care platform stacks will amass a generational hold over health care,"" much like we have seen in Big Tech.

Increasing demand for interoperability among healthcare systems is the main reason for the growth of this market; as the continuously rising amount of communication and data sharing across EHRs, laboratory systems, and billing software, the need for seamless integration becomes more critical. Moreover, government initiative, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, mandating that healthcare organizations improve their data-sharing capabilities. Further, advancements in technology such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence are enhancing interoperability that is, in turn, fuelling the expansion of the Healthcare IT market. A report from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) found that while hospitals in the U.S. can access health information from outside their own systems, less than half are integrating that data into individual patient records. This shows there's a big opportunity for growth in solutions that enable better interoperability.

The largest share of the healthcare IT market was held by the services segment in 2023. The growth can be attributed to the following factors: healthcare organizations rely heavily on service providers for consulting, storage, implementation, training, maintenance, and regular upgrade of technologies and solutions. Moreover, the introduction of complex software and the requirement for software integration and interoperability, which requires training and regular updates, fuelled the growth of the services segment. And the increasing demand for digital health solutions is driving patients towards distance health care services. especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need for safe care and efficiency more than ever. Based on end user, the healthcare provider segment is expected to register the fastest growth in the healthcare IT market. Significant share of this segment is attributed to the patient engagement as patients increasingly seek personalized and accessible care. This growth is fuelled by advancements in technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and telehealth, which is transforming how patients interact with their care. This increased engagement not only improves patient satisfaction but also enhances the overall efficiency of healthcare services, making it essential for providers to invest in these technologies to stay competitive. Moreover, Medication errors are a serious issue, causing nearly 150,000 deaths each year in the U.S. and costing the industry about USD 20 billion annually. Healthcare IT systems minimizing these errors by improving medication management, ensuring accurate documentation, and enhancing communication among healthcare teams. For instance, EHR systems can alert healthcare providers about potential drug interactions or incorrect dosages, making patient care safer and more efficient. Based on the region, the Healthcare IT market is segmented into five major regional segments, namely, North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. The North American region dominated the Healthcare IT market because of the increasing adoption of health information technology (IT) solutions across healthcare settings, especially the interoperability used in between laboratories, clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals, it can easily share patient information and allows doctors and healthcare providers to quickly access and exchange electronic health records. Moreover, government initiatives led by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). These initiatives focus on improving health information technology (health IT) systems, enhancing interoperability, and advancing data sharing across healthcare providers. For instance, the Assessing Use of Health IT by U.S. Physicians Providing Outpatient Care initiative received USD 425,000 in its first year to fund a five-year study. The Leading-Edge Acceleration Projects (LEAP) in Health Information Technology, which has various funding announcements each year focusing on innovative solutions in health IT. And the ONC has allocated funding for the Health Information Exchange (HIE) and Immunization Information System (IIS) programs, with a maximum award of USD 10 million aimed at enhancing data-sharing capabilities.

As healthcare infrastructure expands, particularly due to the rising demand for elder care and chronic disease management, the need for effective facilities management also grows. With the aging population in the U.S., which is expected to continue expanding over the next decade, healthcare facilities must manage the pressures of increased patient volume and maintain high standards of care. This is especially critical as healthcare systems strive to reduce operational costs without compromising quality. Moreover, technological advancements such as the adoption of smart building systems and integrated software for managing healthcare environments have revolutionized the facilities management landscape. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data analytics, and cloud-based management systems allows for predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, and energy efficiency optimization. These innovations help healthcare facilities operate more sustainably and efficiently, which is crucial in an era of rising energy costs and environmental concerns. Another important aspect influencing the growth of healthcare facilities management in the U.S. is the regulatory environment. Facilities must comply with rigorous standards set by bodies such as the Joint Commission, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). These organizations mandate strict protocols around infection control, waste management, safety, and patient care environments, driving demand for specialized FM services. As the healthcare sector continues to shift towards value-based care, where patient outcomes and satisfaction are prioritized, the role of facilities management becomes increasingly important in creating environments that promote healing, safety, and well-being. Consequently, the U.S. Healthcare Facilities Management Market is projected to grow steadily in the coming years, supported by the sector's need for improved efficiency, cost reduction, and technological adoption. Key Market Drivers: Aging Population and Increasing Demand for Healthcare Services Technological Advancements and the Integration of Smart Building Systems Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards Focus on Sustainability and Energy Efficiency Key Market Challenges: High Operating Costs Compliance with Stringent Regulations Workforce Shortages Technological Integration and Maintenance Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Pressure: Key Market Trends: Growing Adoption of Smart Building Technologies Outsourcing of Non-Core Healthcare Facility Functions Increased Emphasis on Sustainability and Energy Efficiency Regional Insights Northeast dominated the United States Healthcare Facilities Management market in 2023, due to several contributing factors that align with the region's unique demographic, economic, and healthcare infrastructure characteristics. One of the key drivers is the high concentration of healthcare facilities and leading academic medical centers in the Northeast. States such as New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania are home to some of the most prestigious healthcare institutions, including Johns Hopkins, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Pennsylvania Health System. These hospitals require comprehensive and sophisticated facilities management to maintain their complex operations, patient care quality, and compliance with regulatory standards. Additionally, the region's high population density and aging demographic play a crucial role in the demand for healthcare services. As the population in the Northeast continues to age, the need for well-maintained healthcare facilities increases, further driving the market for specialized management services. The growth of elderly populations often results in a higher demand for long-term care facilities, nursing homes, and assisted living centers, all of which require advanced facilities management to ensure operational efficiency, safety, and regulatory compliance. The Northeast is also characterized by significant government investment in healthcare infrastructure and stringent regulatory frameworks. Healthcare facilities in the region are subject to rigorous safety, hygiene, and operational standards, necessitating a high level of expertise in healthcare facilities management to maintain accreditation and ensure patient safety.

The Director-General of IMHL, Prof. Uwakwe Abugu, stated this during a press briefing ahead of the 2024 National Medical and Health Law Conference and the induction of new members. He noted that the out-of-pocket spending on health by many Nigerians results from poor health insurance coverage and called for steps to address this trend. He said, “Access to quality healthcare in Nigeria is largely determined by the funds allocated by the government. “Many provisions of the law aimed at improving the healthcare system, such as the National Health Insurance Scheme, are now online.” ALSO READ: NNPCL, Dangote Refinery sign 10-year deal to boost local gas production “However, despite these efforts, the healthcare system, particularly national health coverage, remains inadequate. “Currently, out-of-pocket expenses account for almost 100% of healthcare costs. This is far from ideal, and we still have a long way to go in achieving our healthcare goals.” Speaking on the theme of the 2024 conference, “Advancing Inclusive Healthcare Through Specialized Ethical Standards in Nigerian Medical Practice,” Prof. Abugu highlighted the poor understanding of citizens’ rights in accessing healthcare as provided by the 2019 National Health Act. He explained that the conference, which will feature the Nigerian Bar Association’s National President, Afam Osigwe, and the Founder of The All Rights Foundation, Jake Epelle, will explore ideas on how to promote equity and inclusivity in the Nigerian healthcare ecosystem. “Inclusivity is the global standard for healthcare, and it’s essential that we adopt this approach in Nigeria.” “Inclusive healthcare ensures that everyone has equitable access to quality health services, regardless of their health status, social standing, economic background, or any other factor that may lead to inequalities.” “At our Institute, we’re passionate about promoting healthcare rights, and we have the expertise and professionalism to support Nigerians in this area. “However, we’ve encountered a significant challenge: many Nigerians are still held back by cultural inertia, which hinders their ability to access and utilize quality healthcare services.” Prof. Abugu also lamented that Nigerians are not seeking legal protection in cases of rights violations while seeking healthcare, despite the availability of free legal services provided by the institute.

On this episode of Ropes & Gray’s Health Care Transaction Laws Unwrapped podcast series, health care attorneys Christina Bergeron, Devin Cohen and Natalie LaRue discuss recent developments in state health care transaction laws and their impacts on private equity investments in health care. With an increase in transaction laws specifically targeting private equity, including passed legislation in Indiana and bills that were considered in California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Minnesota, Christina, Devin and Natalie discuss the effects these laws have on the dealmaking landscape and key takeaways for these investors. Transcript: Natalie LaRue: Welcome to our podcast series, Health Care Transaction Laws Unwrapped . Today, we are discussing the impact of emerging state health care transaction laws on private equity firms, management service organizations, and dental support organizations. I’m Natalie LaRue, an associate in Ropes & Gray’s health care practice group. With me today are Christina Bergeron and Devin Cohen, partners in our health care practice group. Christina focuses on health care transactions and regulatory work—advising private equity health care portfolio companies, management services organizations, and dental services organizations. Devin represents providers, payors, management service organizations, vendors and industry investors in value-based care collaboration, alternative payment models, and vertical integration transactions. Christina Bergeron: Thank you, Natalie. We’re looking forward to revisiting this topic after our podcast last June. Since then, there have been a lot of new developments we’ll discuss today. Natalie LaRue: Great, let’s get started. We’re going to cover both state and federal health care transaction laws. Devin, can you tell us about some key themes in these laws? Devin Cohen: Sure. Traditionally, these laws were aimed at overseeing all types of investments in health care. However, more recent laws and proposed legislation have begun to specifically target private equity, including PE ownership and investment in health care through management services organizations (MSOs) and dental support organizations (DSOs)—those type of structures resulting from state-based corporate practice laws and related restrictions. Natalie LaRue: Interesting, and do we know what’s causing this shift in focus? Christina Bergeron: Yes, we believe the shift in focus is being driven by PE investments in health care that have failed due to management strategy. For instance, the Steward Health Care bankruptcy this year, whereby—allegedly—PE investors created deals that enriched themselves at the expense of the hospital, resulting in the hospital network filing for bankruptcy, is an example of what’s driving some of the focus here on PE in health care. Another example we’ve heard the federal government speak to is the Leonard Green & Partners investment in the hospital chain Prospect Medical. States want more oversight and control over for-profit investment in health care to ensure they oversee how the investment impacts things such as cost, quality, and access in their respective state. Now, whether these laws will accomplish this important aim is yet to be seen. Natalia LaRue: In what ways are these laws targeting PE-backed investments in health care? Christina Bergeron: States—as opposed to the federal government per se—are really leading the charge. Over the past year, as we’ve seen an increase in state laws targeting PE investment in health care (predominantly through PE investment in management services organizations or dental services organizations structures), there are a few states that stand out: California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon, and Indiana, to name a few, all of which we’ll discuss today. For instance, Indiana and Oregon have review processes that specifically call out and apply to private equity firms. Indiana’s process is a lot less arduous than Oregon. For instance, in Indiana, there’s a notification requirement—specifically, before certain transactions are completed in the state, it requires health care entities, including but not limited to medical and dental providers, insurers, administrators, and PE partnerships, before entering into transactions with health care companies, to notify the Indiana Attorney General (AG) 90 days before undergoing a merger or acquisition with another health care entity with a value of at least $10 million. Indiana is distinguishable from a few other states because it specifically, in its law, includes “private equity” in the definition of “health care entity.” It specifically captures, as a health care entity, any “private equity partnership, regardless of where it is located, seeking to enter into” a transaction with a more conventional health care entity if at least one of the entities is located or provides services in Indiana. Interestingly enough, MSOs and DSOs, which are typical platforms for PE investment, are not included in the statute’s definition of “health care entities.” Since this law came into effect in July of this year—so, very recently—we are still seeing how PE firms are implicated by the law, but given the breadth of the statute, it is picking up a number of transactions. Devin, do you want to address Oregon? Devin Cohen: Of course. Oregon is one of the more arduous states with respect to its requirements and is an approval, as opposed to a notice state, such as Indiana. If the health care transaction involves a site or any business in Oregon, it will be important to analyze how the law could impact the transaction and be able to really strategize that up front. Now, Oregon’s Health Authority (OHA) guidance states that private equity investors that own 25% or more of a health care entity subject to review are subject to notice requirements. That agency has also stated that MSOs and DSOs are included because they are “closely related” to health care entities subject to review. By maintaining relationships with local counsel in Oregon, we’re really able to stay clued in on regulators’ thoughts and interpretations as they develop. Natalie LaRue: We know a handful of the notices filed with OHA to date involve MSOs and DSOs. What can we learn from these filings? Christina Bergeron: Sure. So, about a fifth of the 30-plus notices filed with OHA did involve MSOs or DSOs. Three of those proposed transactions were approved, one was exempt, and one was approved with conditions. The conditions range from requiring the practice to retain decision-making authority over employment matters and clinical decisions affecting patients (to no surprise) to preventing the MSO from negotiating payor contracts with other entities that it owns or is affiliated with. Many MSOs and DSOs likely comply with many of these restrictions, as they are similar to those under corporate practice laws and similar regulations. Natalie LaRue: Thanks for sharing. It seems that states are charting their own paths in reviewing private equity and MSOs and DSOs. Are we seeing similar trends with proposed legislation elsewhere? Devin Cohen: Absolutely, though the approaches vary. For instance, California’s current law does not apply specifically to MSOs or DSOs or private equity per se, although the recent proposed bill that did not pass was specifically targeted at these structures. That proposed bill, AB 3129, it really caused a stir among our clients due to its potential to limit private equity groups’ abilities to control or contract with certain professional practices. The bill would have required parties to provide pre-closing notice to and obtain consent from the California Attorney General for a change of control or an acquisition of a health care facility or provider group by a PE group or a hedge fund. The definition of “change of control” was very broad and captured any arrangement where a private equity group assumed direct or indirect control over a health care facility or a provider. Additionally, the bill would have imposed restrictions on a PE firm’s ability to control physician, psychiatric, dental practices (in the MSO/DSO structure) and restricted the inclusion of non-competes and non-disparagement clauses in management contracts. Natalie LaRue: Interesting. And why did this bill ultimately fail? Christina Bergeron: Sure, so the bill, even though it passed both the California Senate and House, Governor Newsom ended up vetoing it due to concerns of its redundancy with California’s current law and the review process by the Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA). It was a bit of a surprise for everyone since the bill had gained so much momentum, but as we’ve discussed, California does have a law currently on the books that does review certain health care transactions. Devin Cohen: That’s right. And certain industries, like dental, they really lobbied to exclude their industry from being covered by the law and were quite successful in doing so. Christina Bergeron: That’s right. In California, we’ve seen dental practice and DSO models specifically carved out from health care transaction laws, mostly through effective lobbying. Natalie LaRue: Thanks, Christina. Now, going cross-country to Massachusetts, Devin, can you catch us up on any developments there? Devin Cohen: Yes, a few things jump out here. Since its oversight law was first implemented in January 2015, Massachusetts has required “covered entities” to provide 60-day pre-closing notice of certain “material change” transactions to the Health Policy Commission (HPC), the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the Center for Health Information and Analysis. These “covered entities” provide a wide range of services, including medical and dental. Under this regime, the HPC can order a cost and market impact review of a given transaction or refer it to the Attorney General for further action. Historically, the HPC really hasn’t been very aggressive, having ordered only 10 cost and market-impact reviews in the past nine years, though it has referred its reviews to the Massachusetts Attorney General, including the merger that created Beth Israel Lahey Health, one of the largest health systems in Massachusetts. Earlier this year, the Commonwealth issued new guidance that really expands on the types of transactions that constitute material changes and the categories of entities required to file notice. Natalie LaRue: I’m guessing that the guidance implicates at least some of the entities that are the focus of our discussion? Christina Bergeron: Yes, it absolutely does. The guidance states that MSOs representing a Massachusetts provider in payor contracting are considered “provider organizations” subject to material change notice filing requirements, even if the MSO is not a party to the third-party payor contract. So, to put it more directly, if the MSO has employees that assist the PC with payor contracting negotiations, etc., it gets picked up and is implicated. MSOs are implicated in other ways as well. For example, the guidance for Massachusetts clarifies that the materiality thresholds for covered entities require aggregating revenue across entire provider platforms, including that of all Massachusetts providers represented by the MSO in payor contracting, even if not owned by that MSO or generated through contracts with other payors without MSO involvement. DSOs can also be implicated in the same way if they negotiated with payors on behalf of dental services providers. Bottom line: you’re seeing Massachusetts really wanting to be clear on more expansive than less in terms of how they interpret their guidance. Natalie LaRue: Given that, it seems like MSOs could potentially fall within the Massachusetts HPC review process even when they have minimal contact with a state. Devin Cohen: That’s spot-on. Out-of-state MSOs should really be thoughtful about other states’ review processes as regulators continue to refine their reach through all types of legislative amendments, rulemaking, and other guidance. It’s extremely important for MSOs and DSOs, particularly those backed by private equity, to seek guidance early in Massachusetts to navigate this process. Natalie LaRue: I understand that a bill that would have increased Massachusetts’s oversight even more in this area was introduced but failed to pass this year. Could you share a bit more on what happened there? Devin Cohen: Sure. H4653 was introduced in the Massachusetts House in February 2024. The bill aimed to enhance regulatory oversight of private equity investments in health care and restrict the use of the friendly PC model in the state, by limiting the ability of MSOs to control or guide certain contracting, financial decisions, and clinical decisions on behalf of health care entities. The bill died in August when the House and Senate were unable to reach a compromise, though legislators may revisit the bill later in 2024 or again in 2025. And should it be reintroduced and passed, we’re prepared to move quickly to address the implications for our clients. Natalie LaRue: Thanks, Devin. It seems that each state is taking a nuanced or different approach from one another, particularly with respect to MSOs and DSOs and their relationship to the health care industry. Christina Bergeron: Yes, exactly. As mentioned, California’s health care transaction law does not capture the dental industry or MSO models. However, some states, such as Massachusetts, Oregon, and Indiana—as we’ve discussed—do pick up dental practices and DSO/MSO models in their relevant state law. In some states, like Connecticut, Minnesota, and New York, it’s unclear, and we’re staying tuned to evolving guidance and interpretations, including continuing lobbying efforts to modify the list of impacted health care entities. Not to mention, each state has different thresholds for whether there is enough “contact” with the state to trigger the relevant state law, often expressed in terms of revenue. Therefore, it’s important when analyzing transaction models involving MSO and DSO structures, a careful state-by-state analysis is required, particularly as there are developments in interpretation and subsequent legislation and regulations. Natalie LaRue: And adding to that nuance is the fact that we are also waiting to see which other states will pass similar laws. Devin Cohen: Yes, and we are keeping track of bills that are cropping up across the country. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature is considering three different bills to introduce health care transactions review processes, and two cover arrangements with provider organizations. The state’s legislative session concludes at the end of November, so we’re really watching it very closely for any last-minute movement. In Connecticut, this year, the state legislature considered a bill to develop a plan to address PE investment in health care facilities. Going even further, in Minnesota, a bill sought to prohibit private equity companies or real estate investment trusts from acquiring or increasing ownership interest in, or operational or financial control over, health care providers. Neither the Connecticut nor the Minnesota bill passed in the 2024 legislative sessions, but they could be re-introduced in 2025—although, we think from what we’ve heard from these legislative sessions, less aggressive versions of the bills would likely be introduced in those states. Natalie LaRue: I know we’ve covered a lot of the movement at the state level to oversee health care transactions, but what about at the federal level? Christina Bergeron: Yes, it’s a good question. At the federal level, nothing has passed yet; however, in March 2024, simultaneously with a workshop on PE investments in health care, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking public comments on the impact of private equity on health care providers. In May 2024, the FTC and DOJ issued another RFI regarding private equity serial acquisitions and roll-up strategies in health care and other industries. Our colleagues Tim McCrystal and Debbie Gersh discussed this in the first podcast in our series . So, in sum, it’s absolutely a focus of the federal government and multiple agencies. In terms of proposed legislation, we saw the Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act introduced by Massachusetts Senators Warren and Markey in the U.S. Senate in June 2024—that would authorize state AGs to claw back compensation from PE companies and portfolio company executives, and impose civil and criminal penalties on managers, if portfolio health care companies experience financial difficulties caused by “looting” of the company by the PE sponsors. In response to the Steward Health crisis, Senators Warren and Markey, along with others, also recently re-introduced the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, with updated text. This bill includes provisions to limit the role of real estate investment trusts in health care and would require more extensive public disclosures by PE funds. The bill has been introduced twice before but failed to pass in Congress each time, which is likely to be the case here as well. Natalie LaRue: Thanks, Christina. We know Senator Markey and Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal have also introduced other bills at the federal level. Could you tell us a bit more about those, Devin? Devin Cohen: Both Senator Markey’s Health Over Wealth Act and Representative Jayapal’s Health Care Ownership Transparency Act would require the Department of Health & Human Services to establish a task force to limit the role of private equity and consolidation in health care. They would also empower HHS to impose a moratorium on certain mergers and acquisitions that are pending review. The Health Over Wealth Act also seeks to require private equity firms to obtain a license to invest in health care entities. And the Health Care Ownership Transparency Act, introduced in March 2023, while it hasn’t really moved much, Senator Markey’s bill was introduced only this past July, and we are really continuing to monitor its progress. Natalie LaRue: In addition to the proposed legislation that we discussed, are we seeing movement in other areas on the federal level? Devin Cohen: That’s a good question. The Biden administration has prioritized improving patient care quality and affordability and reducing health care costs. Legislators and the Biden administration argue that private equity investments in the health care industry can drive up patient care costs and adversely affect the health care workforce and patient outcomes. To that end, they have expressed willingness to increase regulatory oversight of health care transactions across the board. Natalie LaRue: Thanks, Devin. On the federal level, it will also be interesting to see the impact of the new administration in this area. In sum, it sounds like private equity firms should anticipate further action on both the federal and state levels. How would you both advise private equity companies seeking to continue working in the health care industry? Christina Bergeron: It’s increasingly important for private equity investors to track these laws and their development closely and work with counsel to ensure continued compliance, including for their portfolio company investments and transactions. That said, these regulatory regimes shouldn’t deter private equity investors. We’ve successfully navigated instances with clients where thoughtful regulatory interpretation avoided unnecessary notice filings and minimized excess disclosures. Devin Cohen: Private equity firms really can partner with counsel for purposes of assessing the current investment plans and contracts with health care entities across their platforms. By ensuring ongoing activities align with key themes in these laws and bills—such as promoting better quality of care and increasing access—private equity firms can position themselves for continued activities in the industry exceedingly well, and we are here to help them think through their opportunities for doing so. Natalie LaRue: Thank you both again for all of your time and insights.

Between the Southern Chiefs Organization (SCO), Business Council of Manitoba , and provincial government, $450,000 is being set aside to help Indigenous students, who are a part of SCO member nations, become health care professionals. SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels said there is currently an under representation of Indigenous people in the field. “The most current stats show only 1.5 per cent of nurses in Canada are First Nations, and fewer than 1 per cent of doctors identify as Indigenous,” he said, noting it’s important to change those numbers. “First Nations health-care professionals understand our people, and our culture, and are able to take a holistic approach to health care. We believe this will make all the difference in reducing the 11-year life expectancy gap between First Nations and all other Manitobans.” Story continues below advertisement Daniels said the student funding will help break down economic barriers, which often stand in the way of First Nation youth fulfilling their career goals.

Imprint operated under license. | Paid Program Nov 12, 2024, 03:09pm EST Share Save On Veteran's Day this week, I reflected with gratitude on my 25 years of military service. getty On Veterans Day, I was proud to announce the release of my latest work, Smarter Healthcare with AI: Harnessing Military Medicine to Revolutionize Healthcare for Everyone, Everywhere , which Forbes Books released this week. This book captures an extraordinary journey—a story of being at the forefront of the AI movement and advancing transformative enterprise AI solutions to improve healthcare for our warfighters and communities across the globe. On this special day, I reflected with gratitude on my 25 years of military service, a time that defined my commitment to healthcare innovation and serving those who sacrificed so much. To all veterans, thank you for your service, your courage, and your dedication. This book is, in part, for you. I didn’t plan it this way. I didn’t plan on having my new book, my first book published by Forbes Books coincide with the celebration of Veterans Day. However, as I reflect on Veterans Day and the book’s release, I know my narrative charts the experience of my years in the United States Navy—from the decks of an aircraft carrier and the FOB (Forward Operating Base) tents in Afghanistan to the Ebola epidemic on the African continent and, last of all, within the walls of the Pentagon as part of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). So, its release this week makes perfect sense. Smarter Healthcare with AI highlights both AI’s potential for medicine and the work that I did in the military with AI and healthcare, which has a direct correlation and translation to the civilian sector. The book provides a glimpse of what the future holds for AI in healthcare and practical guidance around ethics and policy, helping to ensure that AI’s future in healthcare is equitable and upholds each individual’s digital sovereignty. Many of my fellow veterans were kind enough to endorse my book. Navy nurse practitioner and health science researcher Dr. Melissa Troncoso shared, “This book is for healthcare providers who want to enhance their capability and productivity without compromising equitable, personalized, and ethical care and … demonstrates how every healthcare team member can leverage AI to promote health, prevent disease, and improve patient outcomes.”A veteran and leader in healthcare technology, Dr. Keith Salzman comments on the book’s mission to balance the power of AI with the essential human values of purpose and compassion. My former JAIC colleague and spouse of a veteran, Michelle Padgett, wrote that the book’s “vision paves the way for a healthcare system that is more responsive, resilient, and equitable.” Another JAIC colleague and veteran Dr. Drew Plummer says the book “takes readers on a journey into healthcare’s future” as it “outlines a visionary framework for bringing AI into healthcare.” Indeed, this journey is about democratizing access to healthcare technologies and transforming healthcare delivery for everyone, everywhere. Former JAIC director, retired Lieutenant General Michael Groen noted how my combat experience, medical practice, and technical application of AI come together as “a transformational journey that extends well beyond the medical community,” not only for healthcare but for every field seeking to leverage AI responsibly and effectively. Smarter Healthcare with AI is a call to action. It is a roadmap to a future where healthcare is precise, equitable, and capable of reaching all who need it. I believe its vision will resonate with anyone passionate about AI's potential to elevate and humanize healthcare. Let’s honor the commitment of our veterans by exploring a future where healthcare is empowered by AI, rooted in human care, and aligned with the values and dedication they hold as veterans. This book is about transforming healthcare for everyone, all the people our veterans fought to protect and beyond. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

Allied health professionals are crucial members of the health care system, yet they are often defined by what they are not rather than the invaluable roles they play. Professions under the allied health categorization include dietitians, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and radiographers, all of whom provide vital services to patient care and the health care system. Allied health is commonly defined by exclusion, encompassing all health professions other than medicine and nursing. This can often detract from the vital diagnostic, therapeutic and direct care services these professions contribute to. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Allied health professionals provide specialized expertise that complements the work of doctors and nurses to enhance patient outcomes and contribute to robust team-based health care. This, in turn, infuses relief into the health care system, providing the specialized care necessary for a patient’s overall well-being and allowing doctors and nurses to focus on patient management and treatment.

Speaking at the 2024 National Scientific Conference of the National Association of Community Health Practitioners of Nigeria, NACHPN in Bauchi on Tuesday, the Emir, who co-chairs the Bauchi State Taskforce on Primary Healthcare, highlighted the essential role of CHEWs in delivering effective healthcare services across communities. According to him, the CHEWs are the first line of responders in primary healthcare centres, working tirelessly before other staff join in service delivery. The Emir called for a substantial increase in CHEWs to expand healthcare access in underserved areas, recalling how they have traditionally promoted hygiene and disease prevention in local neighbourhoods. In his remarks, Bauchi State House of Assembly Speaker, Abubakar Suleiman, who backed the Emir’s call noted that community health is a priority for everyone in Bauchi. The Speaker pointed out that with 323 primary healthcare centres across the state, CHEWs are the main drivers of healthcare services in every community.

Meanwhile, GenAI-powered customer service tools, such as automated response systems and enhanced chatbot capabilities, are improving patient engagement and accessibility. Interestingly, many firms are currently holding back on implementing GenAI in sensitive areas like fraud detection and cybersecurity . While GenAI’s potential in these areas is apparent, healthcare firms are cautious, prioritizing safer, less regulated applications in the near term to mitigate risks and maintain compliance. As GenAI adoption accelerates in the healthcare sector, firms are seeing substantial returns on their investments by focusing on innovation and customer service. But the cautious approach to GenAI in areas like fraud prevention and cybersecurity reflects a prudent strategy, balancing innovation with operational security. For healthcare firms, the challenge will be to keep scaling their AI capabilities strategically, making GenAI a valuable long-term asset that supports both technological and patient-centered objectives.

That translates to an average of three attacks a day, every day. The attacks have killed almost 2500 health workers, patients, and bystanders—one a day. To prevent and mitigate attacks on healthcare— one of the most disturbing aspects of today’s conflicts—we need renewed political, legal, diplomatic, and programmatic efforts. Attacks on healthcare are a global problem. While reporting is not exhaustive, most attacks over the past seven years have occurred in the occupied Palestinian territory, Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Syria. 1 Despite clear prohibitions under international law, not one person has been held accountable for any of the over 7400 attacks documented by WHO. Historically, only a handful of cases have led to charges and prosecution. The message is clear—current laws, accountability mechanisms, and diplomatic efforts are proving ineffective at protecting healthcare in conflict. 2 Impunity is the rule. And the public health implications are stark—attacks on healthcare severely disrupt access to life saving and essential health services for some of the most vulnerable communities. Urgent, collective action is required to tackle this problem that represents a terrible stain on our conscience. A major new report— In the Line of Fire: Protecting Health in Armed Conflict —analyses the situation in detail. 3 It proposes a series of concrete, actionable recommendations that, if consistently implemented, chart a course to preventing and mitigating attacks on healthcare in conflict. Devastating new norm Following the brutality and chaos of the second world war, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its “additional protocols” set international legal standards for protecting non-combatant individuals including civilians, medical staff, wounded and sick soldiers, and aid workers. Parties to conflict have obligations to protect healthcare and to allow health workers to perform their duties without interference. But in many conflict zones today, healthcare is no longer respected as a neutral entity. Violations of international law are widespread, and without intervention, the erosion of healthcare protections is fast becoming the new norm. While the number of incidents reported attracts attention, their implications don’t always come under the spotlight. Attacks on healthcare destroy more than infrastructure; they deny people their universally recognised right to health by disrupting essential services, undermining the trust in health systems, and worsening the suffering of already vulnerable populations. For example, in 16 conflict zones assessed by WHO, 17% of health facilities were damaged and 19% of health facilities were either partially functional or non-functional. In Gaza today, only 17 of 36 hospitals (47%) are partially functional. 2 In Khartoum, only 12% of 815 health facilities are at least partially functional. 2 In Afghanistan and Pakistan—the two remaining countries where polio is endemic—efforts at eradication have been severely constrained by deliberate targeting of health workers, resulting in serious immunisation gaps. 2 Culture of impunity The erosion of protections for healthcare in conflict zones represents a serious failure of global governance, stemming from a lack of effective diplomatic efforts, legal enforcement, and accountability mechanisms. International responses have largely been limited to public condemnation, with few tangible steps towards deterrence of attacks. Although data collection, reporting, and advocacy are essential, they are insufficient alone. Because of the failures to prevent or deter attacks, frontline health workers and communities are forced to find their own ways to mitigate attacks on healthcare. They do this by, for example, decentralising service delivery, reinforcing the physical infrastructure of health facilities, developing contingency plans for relocation of healthcare, and training staff on emergency procedures. This is an unjust responsibility to lay on health workers, who are often already working under extreme circumstances. Protection of healthcare is our collective responsibility. Way forward The challenge now is how to reset and strengthen existing mechanisms and reaffirm a collective commitment to uphold the right to health and the principles of international humanitarian law—including the protection of healthcare—in armed conflict. The In the Line of Fire report lays out a series of clear recommendations to prevent and mitigate attacks on healthcare in armed conflict. At global level, the report calls for the establishment of a global alliance for the protection of healthcare in conflict comprised of committed member states, UN agencies, and international, non-governmental, and civil society organisations. The alliance would leverage political, diplomatic, and legal mechanisms to promote greater respect for international humanitarian law and to advocate for greater accountability. The report proposes the establishment of a special rapporteur on the protection of healthcare in armed conflict to monitor and report on attacks and to facilitate advocacy and cooperation on safeguarding health. Intensified diplomatic efforts are also urged, including valid accountability mechanisms and the exercise of universal jurisdiction. Improved data collection, verification, and sharing is also vital. At the national level, governments are encouraged to build capacities of healthcare professionals on health and humanitarian diplomacy. They should also redouble efforts to train military personnel on their obligations under international humanitarian law and integrate humanitarian and human rights law into secondary and tertiary education, and to develop relevant policies and laws to enshrine respect for the right to health and humanitarian law. In conflict zones, special attention must be paid to responding to physical and psychological trauma among health workers. At local level, protection of healthcare should become integral to health and humanitarian programming. This includes ensuring that emergency response plans contain options for service continuity in the context of attacks on healthcare and potential health system disruption. Increased engagement of communities in the protection of healthcare is another vital measure. Not one single actor or organisation can ensure the protection of healthcare in conflict alone. Political leaders, judicial bodies, the global health community, policy makers, civil society, and others must move beyond words and actively protect healthcare in conflict zones. The stakes are too high to ignore; protecting healthcare in conflict is a legal obligation and moral imperative.

Article Insights This article from Fenwick is most popular: within Food, Drugs, Healthcare and Life Sciences topic(s) in United States What You Need To Know California health care service plans and disability insurers face new regulations January 1 covering how they employ AI and algorithms for utilization review and management processes. The law appears to apply to prospective, retrospective, or concurrent reviews of requests for covered health care services. New requirements cover decision-making, human oversight, and anti-discrimination, and include transparency, disclosure, and audit/compliance review requirements. Affected companies should evaluate their AI and algorithm-related utilization review and management practices. On September 28, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 1120 Health Care Coverage: Utilization Review into law, amending § 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code and § 10123.135 of the state's Insurance Code. Effective January 1, the new law regulates how health care service plans and disability insurers, including specialized health care service plans and specialized health insurers, use artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms, and other software tools to ensure compliance with specified requirements—including fairness and non-discrimination standards—for utilization review and management processes. SB 1120 also applies to vendors contracted with covered health plans for services that include utilization review or utilization management functions. SB 1120 is just one of several wide-ranging AI-related laws California produced this legislative session. Overview of SB 1120 Health Care Coverage: Utilization Review SB 1120 aims to address the growing use of AI and machine learning in health care, particularly in reviewing, approving, modifying, or denying requests for covered health care services based on medical necessity in utilization review or management activities. It establishes guidelines for the application of these technologies to ensure that they complement, rather than replace, human clinical decision-making. Key Provisions of SB 1120 Individualized Decision-Making : Health care plans and insurers must ensure that their use of AI or algorithmic systems for the purposes of utilization review or management functions rely on specific clinical data from an enrollee's medical history, individual clinical circumstances as presented by a requesting provider, and other relevant clinical information contained in a medical or other clinical record, rather than using generalized datasets. This is intended to prevent decisions being made based solely on aggregated data that might overlook individual medical needs. Human Oversight and Control : AI tools cannot replace healthcare decision-making and autonomously deny, delay, or modify care. Final determinations regarding medical necessity must be made by licensed physicians or health care professionals competent to evaluate the clinical issues. The bill stresses that AI tools cannot supplant professional medical judgment and decision-making, and that AI tools cannot directly or indirectly cause harm to enrollees, ensuring patient safety remains paramount. Transparency and Disclosure : Health care service plans and disability insurers must clearly disclose how AI tools are being used in utilization reviews. This includes disclosing compliance records, written policies and a description of the process by which the plan reviews and approves, modifies, delays, or denies requests in the provision of health care services. Plans must file these policies and procedures—and the description of the process by which the plan reviews and approves requests with the appropriate authorities—with the appropriate authorities, and disclose them to providers, enrollees, and the public upon request. Non-Discrimination : AI systems must be applied fairly and equitably, without discrimination against any enrollees. The bill emphasizes that AI tools cannot directly or indirectly discriminate against enrollees in violation of state or federal anti-discrimination laws. Audits and Compliance Reviews : AI systems used by health plans are subject to regular audits and compliance reviews by the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) and the Department of Insurance (DOI). These audits are intended to ensure the technology's accuracy, reliability, and adherence to legal requirements, such as protecting patient data from unauthorized use or disclosure under the state's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability. Health plans must also periodically review the outcomes of AI-driven decisions to improve system performance and reliability. Penalties for Non-Compliance : Willful violations of SB 1120's requirements by health care service plans may result in significant administrative penalties imposed by the DMHC or the Insurance Commissioner. The penalties aim to ensure strict adherence to the new AI regulations and protect patients from the risks of inappropriate denials of care. Implications for Health Plans and Insurers Health care providers and insurers that rely on AI tools for utilization review and management activities need to evaluate their systems carefully to ensure compliance with SB 1120. This may involve updates to AI models, increased transparency in their application, and ensuring that human medical professionals remain the final decision-makers in determinations of medical necessity. SB 1120 provides important safeguards for patients, ensuring that decisions about their care are made with proper oversight and individualized consideration. The law aims to strike a balance between technological innovation in health care and the need for human judgment in critical medical decisions. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services clarified earlier this year in an FAQ memo that Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) can use an algorithm or AI system in making coverage determinations, but MAOs must ensure that the algorithms comply with existing laws and regulations for how those coverage determinations are made. For determinations of medical necessity, MAOs must remain compliant with the rules of 42 CFR § 422.101(c), including consideration of a patient's medical history, physician recommendations, and clinical notes. Therefore, AI systems cannot make determinations of medical necessity without considering factors and circumstances specific to each patient. Next Steps Health care service plans and insurers should promptly evaluate their utilization review and management practices (as well as those of their vendors that provide such services) that involve AI tools and algorithms, to ensure they meet the requirements set forth in SB 1120, which appear to apply to prospective, retrospective, or concurrent reviews of requests for covered health care services. Given these broad and somewhat vague requirements, it will be important to monitor how the DMHC and DOI will implement the law and issue further guidance. Legal and compliance teams should also prepare for potential audits and ensure that disclosures about AI tool use are readily available and transparent to both patients and regulators. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

In a chat on the healthcare system, Dr. Ade-Conde said unlike most international hospitals, many health institutions in Nigeria lack data. He said: “The issue is data management. Unlike many international hospitals, most Nigerian institutions lack reliable data. This gap hampers ability to monitor outcomes, identify areas for improvement, and set benchmarks aligned with global standards.” Continuing, Ade-Conde noted: “Improving transparency, adopting minimally invasive techniques, and implementing data-driven practice could enhance healthcare quality in Nigeria. Nigeria’s healthcare budget has stagnated, largely due to political issues and inadequate funding. We need strong leadership committed to elevating healthcare. African leaders shift focus to healthcare Foundation advocates improved primary healthcare Centring care for maximal healthcare “Investing in research is also critical. During my years as a medical student at University of Lagos, we faced frequent academic strikes, which hindered learning. Nigerian medical universities today should foster research to encourage evidence-based practice.

This model, combined with accountability measures, would optimise healthcare spending and resources.” Ade-Conde’s practice spans a woman’s reproductive lifespan, providing care from conception to post-reproductive years and his expertise include fertility and reproductive technology, general gynaecology, minimally invasive surgery, and obstetrics. Comparing foreign healthcare system with Nigerian healthcare, Ade-Conde said: “The average Nigerian faces a greater burden of disease than those in Europe or North America. While Nigeria’s 2023 healthcare budget was approximately two billion dollars, Canada, with a much smaller population, allocated about 300 billion U.S dollars, and Ireland, with only five million, budgeted approximately 30 billion dollars.

Follow Author Nov 11, 2024, 08:57am EST Nov 11, 2024, 02:59pm EST Share Save Comment Bitcoin Rally Amids US Presidential Election FreePix The cryptocurrency market is currently riding a wave of optimism after Donald J. Trump's recent win in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin hits its new all-time high (ATH) at the $82,400 mark (unchartered territory) amid reports that Trump favors the United States becoming a leading cryptocurrency hub. However, as cryptocurrency prices surge, it remains difficult to run crypto companies in the healthcare sector, which I know personally as a black-woman Founder and CEO of a crypto-powered healthcare company, called Patientory. Bitcoin's Post-Election Rally Bitcoin's price has soared in response to Trump's win, likely driven by speculation that the incoming administration will adopt policies that could stimulate economic growth and drive investments into alternative assets. In the previous Trump term, there were favorable tax policies and less stringent regulatory oversight, enabling the industry to flourish. Investors are betting on a repeat performance, leading to a substantial influx of capital into Bitcoin. Moreover, the anticipated launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has fueled further excitement, potentially opening the floodgates to institutional investors. As traditional markets face geopolitical uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin is once again being viewed as a hedge against economic instability. The Healthcare Sector: A Dormant Opportunity for Cryptocurrency? While Bitcoin is enjoying its moment in the spotlight, the healthcare sector seems to have been left behind in the current crypto surge. Healthcare-focused altcoins and blockchain projects were once heralded as game-changers for the industry, promising to revolutionize data management, patient privacy, and supply chain logistics according the National Library of Medicine published journal article Blockchain integration in healthcare: a comprehensive investigation of use cases, performance issues, and mitigation strategies . Yet, they remain largely under the radar during this recent bull run and majority if not all bull-runs. These projects demonstrate how blockchain can be utilized to improve transparency, efficiency, and patient engagement in the healthcare sector. While these cryptocurrencies may not yet be as widely recognized as Bitcoin or Ethereum, they are carving out a niche by solving specific industry challenges using decentralized technology. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor So, why are these coins not riding the same wave as Bitcoin? Regulatory Uncertainty : Healthcare is a heavily regulated industry. The integration of the underlying blockchain technology and use of cryptocurrency into healthcare systems involves navigating complex regulatory frameworks, making it slower to gain traction. With the new administration's focus likely on traditional economic growth rather than healthcare reform, there may not be a strong push for adopting decentralized solutions in this space. Lack of Market Awareness : While Bitcoin has become a household name, many healthcare altcoins lack the same recognition among both investors and industry leaders. Coins make attempts to capture market attention, but they have not yet received large-scale adoption that can compete with mainstream crypto assets. Funding and Development Challenges : The bear market that persisted through 2022-2023 left many altcoin projects struggling to secure funding. While some sectors, such as DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs, saw a resurgence in interest, healthcare coins have not enjoyed the same level of investment. The lack of robust financial backing has slowed development and innovation in this sector. Potential Catalysts for a Healthcare Altcoin Comeback Despite the slow progress, the long-term potential for blockchain in healthcare remains strong. Here are a few developments that could catalyze a resurgence of healthcare altcoins: Increased Focus on Data Privacy : The rise in cybersecurity threats and data breaches in healthcare could drive interest in blockchain solutions that offer immutable, secure data storage. Interoperability Standards : The healthcare industry continues to struggle with fragmented data systems. Blockchain could serve as a bridge to improve interoperability, especially if the new administration supports tech innovation in healthcare. Decentralized Clinical Trials : As healthcare moves towards personalized medicine, the ability to run decentralized clinical trials using blockchain technology could streamline the process and reduce costs. Healthcare and AI : With stringent privacy and regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR, adoption of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare needs secure decentralized data storage to train and utilize large language models. Here are 6 healthcare-focused altcoins gaining traction on platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. These altcoins are designed to disrupt traditional healthcare systems by leveraging blockchain technology for data security, decentralized research, and patient empowerment, especially around women’s health. We also see more diversity representation in the healthcare cryptocurrency space among key management, including myself and Rejuve.AI CEO Jasmine Smith. Here are some of the prominent healthcare-focused coins: AthenaDAO (ATH) : The AthenaDAO Token is a governance token used by members within the Athena DAO ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in enabling community-driven decision-making for funding, research prioritization, and strategic initiatives focused on women’s health. Rejuve.AI (RJV): This token supports decentralized AI-driven medical research focused on longevity and health optimization. It’s part of the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement, which aims to democratize access to scientific research​. Rejuve.AI enables users to contribute their health data securely and earn RJV tokens in return. These tokens can be used within the platform for accessing personalized longevity insights, health optimization advice, and participation in exclusive research initiatives. The goal is to empower individuals to extend their healthspan by leveraging AI-driven analytics while maintaining control over their own data. Patientory (PTOY) : PTOY is the native token of the PTOYMatrix health information exchange and decentralized cloud health data storage network. Health organizations earn PTOY by providing storage space to host health information or for member driven use cases such as Patientory, Inc that developed the health data passport wallet and rewards consumers with PTOY for meeting AI recommended health goals. VitaDAO (VITA): VitaDAO focuses on funding early-stage research in the field of longevity and life extension through decentralized decision-making by token holders. It emphasizes collaborative scientific efforts to extend human health-span​. Solve.Care (SOLVE): The SOLVE token powers the Solve.Care ecosystem, a blockchain platform designed to streamline healthcare administration, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes through smart contracts. The operating company recently changed their name to Tuumio to expand beyond the realm of healthcare. MediBloc (MED): MED token is a utility token for transactions within its ecosystem, rewarding users for contributing data and incentivizing healthcare providers to deliver high-quality care. Built on the Cosmos blockchain, MediBloc enables patients, doctors, and healthcare providers to securely exchange medical information, thereby improving patient outcomes and streamlining healthcare processes. The platform uses the MED token as a utility token for transactions within its ecosystem, rewarding users for contributing data and incentivizing healthcare providers to deliver high-quality care. Will Healthcare Tokens Get Their Moment? As Bitcoin soars, healthcare altcoins may still be lying in wait for the right moment to break out. The challenges they face are significant, but the potential for blockchain to revolutionize healthcare is undeniable. If regulatory clarity improves and funding begins to flow into innovative healthcare projects, we may yet see a resurgence in healthcare-focused cryptocurrencies. For now, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin. But as history has shown, the crypto market moves in cycles. The next wave may well belong to those who can effectively leverage blockchain and cryptocurrency to solve real-world problems in the healthcare sector.

https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/11/11/ukraine-doctors-training,,"Ukrainian doctors , nurses learn skills to heal their decimated health care system",20241111T194500Z,https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1076-1-1000x788.jpg,wbur.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Support WBUR Dr. Vadym Serdiuchenko is guided through a tube thoracostomy procedure by Dr. Joseph Leanza. (Karyn Miller-Medzon/Here & Now) The war in Ukraine is heading into its third winter, stretching the battered health care system to its breaking point. The World Health Organization’s last tally in August counted 1,940 attacks on health care facilities and 34 health care workers killed in the first eight months of this year, 10 more than in all of 2023. That’s in addition to injured and conscripted health care workers, rolling blackouts, failing equipment and a profound toll on mental health. Among the organizations working to bolster and rebuild the country’s medical systems is Global Response Medicine , an NGO on the ground in Ukraine and other war zones. The organization develops battlefield-to-rehab care protocols and trains health care workers in the systems and procedures they need to practice wartime medicine. Recently, GRM brought a group of Ukrainian health care workers to Boston Medical Center’s Solomont Simulation Center . Inside the center, Dr. Joseph Leanza points a scalpel at a rack of pork ribs on a silver surgical table. Draped across a patient bed on the other side of the hospital-style room is an eerily life-like mannequin staring straight up at the fluorescent lights. On another table lies what appears to be an armless torso. It all looks a little like the set of a high-tech horror movie. But that illusion is broken by a dozen Ukrainian health care workers — doctors, nurses, residents and a hospital director — crowded around Leanza, waiting to try out procedures and equipment that can help improve patient care in Ukraine. Leanza — an emergency medicine doctor at BMC — is also the medical director for GRM which brought the health care workers to Boston from hard-hit cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Izyum. He’s guiding the group through ultrasound-assisted intubations, central line placement and more. Of course, some of the demonstrations — no less important on the battlefield — are a little less high-tech, including surgical procedures on slabs of pork ribs purchased that morning at a local grocery store. “They set them up as a sort of analog of the chest wall,"" Leanza explains. “If someone has a gunshot wound or a stab wound to the chest, sometimes too much blood or too much air accumulate in the chest… and evacuating the blood can be the only necessary component to saving someone’s life.” Among the Ukrainians digging in is Kharkiv doctor Vadym Serdiuchenko, who inserts his scalpel gingerly into the ribs, but turns quickly to Leanza to ask about how deep to go. Leanza suggests going “through the muscle, into the intercostals.” Serdiuchenko says through a translator that this is the kind of practice and training he can’t get in Ukraine in wartime. Across the room, also laser-focused on her task, is Viktoriia Totkalova. She’s using ultrasound guidance to insert a needle into an anatomically correct neck and torso. BMC ultrasound fellow Noelle Bates carefully guides her through the central line placement, a very skilled and potentially dangerous procedure. “In a warzone, if somebody needs rapid fluid administration, this would be a way to go,” Bates explains. Susanna Aksenkova is a second-year intensive care unit resident in Kharkiv where hospitals are being rebuilt even as the bombs are still falling. She says she and her mother — her only family — are from the Donbas region. But when shelling got too intense there at the beginning of the war, her mom left Ukraine. Aksenkova, just beginning her training, opted to stay in Kharkiv. “In Ukraine, and especially in Kharkiv, we have a lot of critical patients with a blast injury,"" she says. ""So, we need to improve our knowledge and our system to give better medical treatment for them."" She’s grateful for any opportunity to gather very specific skills that match the overwhelming need she sees in her hospital. “I mean that for the patients, it's really important,"" she says, ""like how deep you need to use your central line, how you need to fixate it, and extra materials you need for this procedure.” Aksenkova continues, “Sometimes it's difficult to do it in Ukraine because we don't have enough equipment for a lot of procedures. And sometimes it's really useful just to ask much more competent people and doctors how you can do it with such kind of equipment, which we have now.” Victoriia Totkalova practices an ultrasound-guided central line placement on a simulation neck/torso. (Karyn Miller-Medzon/Here & Now) She goes on to explain the dismal state of medical care in her city. “Nowadays, we don't have enough medical staff. We don't have enough doctors, we don't have enough nurses,"" Aksenkova says. ""So, I truly can say that as a resident now we do almost the same as the MD.” “It's not so good because we don't have enough clinical experience,” Aksenkova admits, but says she is still relieved to have stayed behind after her mother left, because, “I think I can help people right now in Kharkiv, and that’s important.” Bohdan Berezhnyi has been listening quietly. He’s an anesthesiologist and the medical director of Izyum’s hospital, about 45 miles from the Russian front. His city spent more than six months under Russian occupation. “Our hospital was destroyed at the beginning of war,"" he says. ""It's a very sad story... If there is a war in your city, you haven't electricity, you haven't water, you haven't heat, you cannot even walk to the street because a lot of the explosions.” He explains that doctors were forced to hide on the ground floor of the hospital because attempting to go home was too risky. “The emergency system didn't work. You cannot call to your friends, your medical staff to come in. You just stay in your hospital on the ground floor and you wait for the patient who just can't even have the possibility to come to the hospital by themselves,” he says, referencing the fact that during heavy shelling, it’s not possible for ambulances to respond. When asked whether people simply die on the ground, he answers, “I’m sorry. But yes.” Berezhnyi tells one particularly poignant story about Izyum residents trying to flee by running and driving over the only bridge leading out of the city. “Despite Russia targeting them, 30 people die on one side [of the bridge] and 30 on the other side,"" Berezhnyi says. ""A man tries to cross the bridge and he hears bullets. He turns on the ground, he feels pain in his abdomen part, but he stays in this condition by one day.” The man was retrieved by family members on the second day, but it was still too dangerous to bring him to the hospital. Finally on the third day, he was brought in for treatment. Berenzhnyi says that the man survived, but that he was the exception. Berezhnyi says those bleak days left him eager for training like this one, which he hopes will mean saving more lives. Among the things he’s learning from his stint with GRM, he says, is how to standardize systems so that every patient gets the same intake, evaluation and assessment at every level of treatment. Of course, the equipment hasn’t gone unnoticed. “Our doctors can’t even imagine about this equipment,” Berezhnyi laughs. “And I personally too! The CT scan and the ultrasound equipment and the ventilators. It’s very interesting to us."" Despite what feels to these Ukrainian health care workers like a never-ending war, Berezhnyi says he’s optimistic about rebuilding the medical systems in Ukraine, partly because of NGOs like GRM that are partnering with his country to bolster skills, training and systems. Aksenkova, who’s never practiced outside a warzone, thinks carefully before weighing in on whether she shares his optimism. “Probably more ‘yes’ than ‘no’” she says, “because difficult times… can create strong people.” She says that the world’s medical community is taking note of what Ukraine is able to do on the battlefield. “I see it every time if we are talking, not only about the civilian medicine, but also talking about the military medicine,'Aksenkova says. ""I see how the protocols are changing because of the Ukraine, not only for Ukrainian doctors, but also for doctors throughout the world because we can now treat such a kind of injuries with such a low amount of equipment.” But the irony is not lost on her. She says that having a top-notch simulation center, great education and a more resilient medical system would have been better learning tools than teaching “all this in such a cruel way.” Aksenkova adds, “But it’s working.

The research collated in DKSH's whitepaper provides a comprehensive analysis of the regional healthcare landscape, the challenges and abundant opportunities present, as well as recommended actions for global healthcare firms wanting to enter the market. Singapore, (ANTARA/PRNewswire)- DKSH, a leading market expansion service provider in Asia and beyond, in collaboration with FrontierView, released the whitepaper ""Southeast Asia as a Growth Accelerator for Global Healthcare Firms: Avenues to accelerate growth through expanded patient access."" The whitepaper, a result of a closed-door executive roundtable encompassing key leaders within the healthcare arena, provides an in-depth analysis on the region of Southeast Asia (SEA) as an untapped market that has yet to reach its full potential on the front of global healthcare investment. It provides an overview of the state of healthcare in the region, its foreseeable future, the challenges present and actionable recommendations for global healthcare firms to consider. As a region, SEA is home to approximately 8.5% of the world's population, but has a healthcare expenditure that amounts to only 1.4% of the global total. This disproportionate scale is poised for positive change with an increased importance placed on healthcare in recent years following the COVID-19 pandemic. This coincides with a booming population and a sizable forecasted rise in overall wealth in the region – setting the stage for a unique backdrop for the healthcare industry. Cognisant of this prospect, FrontierView extensively reviewed SEA's healthcare landscape with the support of DKSH, revealing numerous challenges endemic to the region. Though geographically limited, SEA is home to 11 countries, each with their own set of socio-economic difficulties that the whitepaper collated and analyzed. This highlighted very tangible hurdles for healthcare firms looking to enter the region, including localization and navigating multiple regulatory bodies. This is all encompassed by the overarching dominance held by public healthcare systems across the region, which has been largely characterized by their struggles related to budgetary and manpower constraints. Challenges revealed in the whitepaper also highlighted opportunities for global firms to increase healthcare accessibility in SEA. The constraints of public healthcare systems in the region have led to more active exploration of the private sector in order to fill the gaps. Shortfalls in the public sector have been addressed through solutions such as public-private partnerships which increase capability, efficacy and accessibility in the region without compromising government resources. The whitepaper also includes a series of recommendations backed by extensive analysis for global healthcare firms interested to enter the market. This includes forming strategies around addressing the personnel shortage, applying advanced technologies like AI to tackle unique local issues and supporting early detection as well as prevention. These recommendations and more elaborated in the whitepaper serve as an accessible and actionable guide for the private sector looking to enter this region brimming with latent opportunity. ""At DKSH, we are dedicated to improving lives by increasing accessibility to healthcare across the region. We are conscious of the complexities involved in expanding healthcare efforts, especially when penetrating new geographies. With a century of experience as the partner of choice for navigating and thriving in Asia, DKSH has accumulated a wealth of knowledge. We are excited that we were able to share our expertise and support this whitepaper which will equip our partners with the latest insights and strategies to succeed in Southeast Asia."", said Bijay Singh, Head of Business Unit Healthcare at DKSH. Alec Lee, Managing Director, Healthcare Research at FrontierView said that ""Southeast Asia's healthcare market is a fascinating topic and one that greatly benefits from continued in-depth analysis"". He added that ""in addition to the data from our research, this whitepaper incorporates insights from leading healthcare companies, including DKSH, gathered during our executive roundtable. As a result, this has proven to be an exciting step in uncovering the full potential latent in this region. We hope that the actions outlined in the whitepaper will contribute to improving healthcare access."" The whitepaper is now available for viewing and can be downloaded here .

OOPE in healthcare refers to the money people pay directly from their own pockets for medical services, such as doctor visits, medicines, and hospital stays. In India, high OOPE has long been a significant challenge, especially for low-income families, as it forces many to spend a large portion of their earnings or savings on healthcare. Advertisement “The National Health Accounts (NHA) data for 2021-22 reveals a positive trend, OOPE on healthcare is decreasing, largely due to increased government investment and an improved public healthcare framework,” said the Union Health Ministry on Sunday. Advertisement As per the NHA data, between 2014-15 and 2021- 22, government health expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of GDP rose from 1.13 per cent to 1.84 per cent. Additionally, GHE’s share of overall government spending grew from 3.94 per cent to 6.12 per cent, reflecting a robust commitment to public health, it said. Informing that during the same period, per capita health spending tripled from Rs 1,108 to Rs 3,169, the Health Ministry said this increase allows the government to strengthen public healthcare infrastructure, making services more affordable and accessible to the public, thereby directly reducing OOPE. This shift was further emphasised by the government’s response to the Covid 19 pandemic, where investments targeted both immediate health needs and long-term health challenges, such as the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), it said. Besides the GHE, the other reasons for decline in OOPE are expansion of social security expenditure (SSE), growth of government-funded insurance schemes and focus on public health infrastructure and workforce, among others. SSE on healthcare, including government-funded health insurance and social health programs, rose to 8.7 per cent in 2021-22 from 5.7 per cent of total health expenditure (THE) in 2014-15, as per the NHA data. The Health Ministry said the decline in OOPE makes healthcare services more affordable, encouraging individuals, especially in rural areas, to seek medical care without financial worry. This leads to more equitable access to healthcare across various socio-economic groups. Reduced OOPE allows the public healthcare system to cater to a broader population base, distributing healthcare resources more equitably and strengthening the overall system to handle increased demand, it added.

As a writer and author, his works on AI, Robotics and other emerging technologies has been featured in both local and international publications. As a researcher and educator, he has had the privilege of working, volunteering and attending global conferences at the forefront of technological advancements travelling around the world. In this interview with SAMUEL OAMEN , he speaks about the motivation behind his new book aiming to give insight on how Robotics will shape the future of healthcare. With the unfolding technological wave with emerging technologies, what do you think will be the future and the next level of modern healthcare? As an emerging tech researcher and tech-futurist, I believe the future of humanity will be largely driven by emerging technologies and these technologies will offer healing, help and hope to a lot of what we term terminal illness or diseases. For example, the advent of Elon Musk’s Neural link known as Blindsight; a vision restoring inplant will offer hope for those who are blind from birth. So with emerging tech like AI, Biotechnology, 3D Printing etc the narrative about terminal disease or damaged organs will be redefined. We are now in the era where tech is adding years to life! Your book “Robotic Intelligence: The Coming Wave in Healthcare,” talks about the coming wave in healthcare that will revolutionize the future of modern healthcare practice, delivery, and services. Can you shade some insights on this? To begin with, we need to realise that the world has changed and technology is the culture shaping wheel driving or leading that change and disruption. In this current technological disruption, emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Robotics, Blockchain, Augmented reality, Internet of Things (IoT), Biotechnology, 3D Printing, Quantum computing, Nanotechnology, etc have all demonstrated huge potential by research insights to impact the world across different industries. The healthcare sector won’t be left out in this coming wave of innovation and disruption. In other words, these listed technologies will impact how healthcare services will be curated, delivered, experienced and managed in no time from now. In my new book “Robotic Intelligence: The Coming Wave in Healthcare” which focuses on one (Robotics) among other technologies and how it explores the interconnection between human-driven healthcare delivery system and some of the latest robotic breakthroughs and innovative trends that is curating a borderless, digital and connected healthcare. The book offers clarity to its reader on the future on healthcare with some of the latest robotic innovations being engaged in delivering healthcare solutions. What do you see as the most transformative innovation currently emerging in healthcare robotics? There are several of them actually. If am to pick one, I will say it’s the current progress made in molecular robotics towards defeating cancer. Over the years, we have seen the efforts and outcomes with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; but with the ongoing efforts and research breakthroughs in molecular robotics I believe there is hope in the fight in defeating cancer. This is one of the impacts of emerging technologies within the healthcare space which I have unveiled in the book. There is a lot more to learn and understand in the book based on the depth of what I have shared. You explore both the opportunities and the ethical concerns surrounding the rise of robotics in healthcare. Could you elaborate on some of the ethical dilemmas that healthcare professionals might face as this technology becomes more widespread? Tosin Joseph: UK-based tech expert opens up on AI, robotics, others Yeah, so there is still a big question on security (cyber security), Data Security and Privacy, Autonomy and Consent, and some other important concerned areas every healthcare Professionals needs to pay attention to and what they need to do to position for the coming robotic wave. Let’s take the security of AI-powered healthcare robotic systems for example; there is a need for more work to be done in the area of security and safety. According to Deloitte in an article in April 2023 “Securing government against adversarial AI” highlighted how venture capital funds have hugely invested more than US$230 billion into AI/ML companies from 2018 to 2021, including almost US$90 billion in 2021. Interestingly, less than 1% of this funding has been channelled toward AI/ML security research and infrastructure development start-ups”. So, this shows we need to do more on security in securing healthcare systems against future AI-powered attacks. In “Robotic Intelligence: The Coming Wave in Healthcare,” you offer insights into how both players and non-players in the healthcare sector can position themselves. What steps should non-players take to benefit from the upcoming “robotic economic boom”? The powerful thing about technology is that it cut across every career or business in one way or the other in terms of opportunities too. Non-players need to pay attention to the robotic market trend and forecast and strategically decide which are to take a stake in. For example, non-players can take advantage of the vast promising investment opportunities in Cross-functional Healthcare Robotics Ecosystem. Investment in other affiliated expertise area like supply chain, and component manufacturing. There is also Cross-Sector Opportunities which have also shared in the book. I spent an entire chapter on this for everyone one to see the future economic boom in robotics and how to position for it. You mention that the book covers the NOW, NEAR, and NEXT stages of robotic technology in healthcare. Can you give us a glimpse of what you believe the ‘NEXT’ stage will look like, and how close we are to seeing it? Robotics which is also physical AI is driven by Artificial Intelligence. As we keep seeing and experiencing more advancement in AI, get ready for more robotic innovations and research breakthroughs within the healthcare space. Remember we are just within the first stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), there is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and there is still Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) ahead etc. Within the next 5 – 10 years max, prepare for some unprecedented advanced robotic breakthroughs in healthcare. Watch out! In conclusion, there is a lot coming underway to the healthcare sector that will be driven through AI and other emerging technologies. I have only written on some of the healthcare possibilities curated by Robotics, however; there are other ones I am still going to share my insights on. But more importantly, there is a bigger breakthrough coming that will change everything around modern medicine and will change the narrative on life, wellness, health and even death! Creation as we know it is about to be re-imagined. Being part of an exclusive session at a global AI and deepTech Summit in London created the room for me and other tech futurist and thought leaders to be able to rub minds on the higher resolution possibilities that AI is about to bring to humanity; and we aren’t talking about ChatGPT or any funny generative AI prompts here. We deep-dive into some mind blowing Innovations and breakthroughs AI has to offer across different sector especially in healthcare. Fingers cross. Watch out for my next work and publication.

The cost of another necessity, healthcare, continues to climb significantly with no end in sight. The latest National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans from Mercer finds the average expenses on a healthcare plan are expected to rise by 5.8% in 2025, the third straight year of at least a 5% increase. That number rises to 9% for small employers, defined as those with fewer than 500 employees. There are a number of factors contributing to this steady rise in healthcare costs, starting with a growing shortage of healthcare workers to meet the rising demand of aging baby boomers and Gen Xers. The report also cites consolidation in the healthcare system, which has reduced the number of hospitals in the U.S. by around 2,000 over the past two decades. Healthcare analyst David Balat agrees with those factors, but adds another important one. ""When you look at the annual reports from the insurers themselves, they're showing massive profits on an annual basis,"" he says. ""For them to blame only the healthcare providers is just not honest,"" he continues. ""They (insurance companies) themselves are contributing to the increases in premiums and the overall costs of healthcare."" Balat predicts the trend of rising healthcare costs will continue until we can cut out the middlemen and bureaucrats in the healthcare system. ""Ultimately, the primary stakeholders in healthcare are the medical professional and the patient,"" he tells KTRH. ""Unfortunately, we've got so many people trying to get in between those two and extract their own value, and then have to drive up the price in order to extract more and more value on a yearly basis.""

The Illinois Supreme Court has sided with Illinois health care facilities and against the plaintiffs' personal injury bar, ruling that Gov. J.B. Pritzker's executive orders entered during the COVID-19 pandemic give health care facilities immunity from liability for ordinary negligence for incidents that occurred during the pandemic, even if the alleged negligence was not COVID-related. Soon after the pandemic began, Pritzker entered a series of executive orders directing health care facilities to ""render assistance to the State by providing health care services"" in response to the pandemic to ensure that patients with COVID and other illnesses could still receive timely care and treatment. The executive order stated that certain health care facilities, including skilled nursing home facilities, ""shall be immune from civil liability for any injury or death "" when a health care facility ""was engaged in ... rendering assistance to the State by providing health care services in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, unless it is established that such injury or death was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of such health care facility."" In James v. Geneva Nursing and Rehabilitation Center , a nursing home resident died from COVID. The facility filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Pritzker's executive order provided immunity from liability for ordinary negligence because the facility was rendering assistance to the state by buying and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE), training staff to use PPE, continuing to accept admissions from hospitals, and preventing and treating COVID from spreading. The trial court denied the facility's motion to dismiss but allowed the facility to appeal the decision before a trial occurred. The appellate court reversed, holding that a statute authorizing Illinois governors to enter the executive orders at issue expressly contemplated situations in which a governor could grant immunity from liability for ordinary negligence under certain circumstances, and that Pritzker's executive orders were therefore proper. The plaintiff's lawyer appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which held that the executive orders gave the facilities immunity from liability for ordinary negligence while rendering assistance to the state during the pandemic, even if the alleged injury was not COVID-related. The Supreme Court noted that the executive orders expressly provided health care facilities with immunity for ""any injury or death"" that was caused by "" any act or omission"" of the facility that ""occurred at a time"" when the facility was ""engaged in the course of rendering assistance to the State by providing health services in response to COVID."" The court interpreted this language to mean what it says: Health care facilities have immunity from liability for ordinary negligence regardless of whether the alleged injury was related to COVID if the facility was ""rendering assistance to the State"" during the pandemic. The Supreme Court therefore remanded the case to the trial court to determine if the nursing home had, in fact, ""rendered assistance to the State"" during the COVID pandemic. Health care facilities may not be out of the woods yet because the plaintiffs' personal injury bar almost always includes a claim for gross negligence or willful misconduct in negligence complaints. Health care providers should nonetheless take some comfort in the Supreme Court's decision to limit their liability for ordinary negligence that allegedly occurred during the pandemic.

In a latest survey conducted by the national statistical agency, 51.8 of Inuit responded that they had to travel 1,500 kilometers or more for health care, and another 18.2 percent travelled 1,000 kilometers to less than 1,500 kilometers. For some Indigenous people, extensive travel is necessary to access health care, and this can result in financial burdens, emotional stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, the agency said. According to the agency, a total of 40 percent of Inuit, 18 percent of First Nations people living off reserve and 16 percent of Metis travelled outside their community to access health care services. Over one-quarter of Indigenous people in the country have unmet health care needs. Among First Nations people living off reserve and Inuit, a commonly reported reason was health care services not being in their area or being too far away, according to Statistics Canada.

Chip Roy (R-Texas), opinion contributor - 11/04/24 1:00 PM ET by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), opinion contributor - 11/04/24 1:00 PM ET Share ✕ LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email FILE – In this April 23, 2021, file photo, medical director of Doctor on Demand Dr. Vibin Roy waves good-bye to a patient at the conclusion of an online primary care visit conducted from his home in Keller, Texas. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) American health care is getting more expensive , but Americans aren’t getting healthier. We spend $4.8 trillion annually on health care — more than any other country — only to have some of the worst health outcomes in the developed world. Spending more money on government programs is not the solution. What we need is a fundamental paradigm shift toward health care freedom. We spend three times more per capita than Italy on health care, the average American lifespan is five years shorter. This isn’t an ode to Europe’s socialist single-payer health care systems; it is a wake-up call. Indeed, the U.S. government already controls more health care spending than socialist European systems . Our health care system is just corporate crony socialism disguised as free-market health care. Consider that over 70 percent of American adults, and nearly 40 percent of American children, are overweight and obese. Over 40 percent of American teens struggle with anxiety and depression, and 22 percent of them seriously considered suicide. Adults aren’t much better — nearly one in five American adults experience a mental health issue. There is a connection between a poor diet, lack of exercise and degrading mental health. The American food supply is contributing to the problem; 73 percent of the food in our grocery stores is considered ultra-processed. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — also known as “food stamps” — also incentivizes poor health outcomes. Junk food and soda account for 20 percent of the spending in the program , which subsidizes grocery bills for low-income Americans. Between 2019-2023, spending on the program doubled , and taxpayers will continue to pay even more for other people’s bad habits. But rather than prevent negative health outcomes on the front end, we treat them after the fact. Ninety percent of our health care spending is on chronic diseases. Encouraged often by the NIH, we are increasingly an overmedicated country looking for a “quick fix” to our health issues. Indeed, most Americans will have almost 40 vaccine doses before they turn 18 , and someone born in 2019 will likely be taking a prescription drug for 30-50 years of their life. Many believe drugs like Ozempic are the solution to our obesity problem, because that is what the “ experts ” tell us, even though only 28 percent of Americans meet even the CDC recommendations for physical activity. Too many of the so-called experts creating dietary guidelines at the USDA have food and pharma conflicts of interest, so we should take their advice with a grain of salt. Government-manufactured unhealthiness seems to be by design. Pharma companies, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers and hospitals rarely make money off gym memberships and higher fruit and vegetable sales. By abandoning the focus on health, this makes the cost of everything in health care more expensive, and people are discouraged from seeking the care they need. We must end the crony capitalism ruining our health care system. We must be brave enough to overhaul the government bureaucrats at NIH, CDC and the USDA — and to take on Big Insurance, Big Hospital, Big Pharma, Big Corporations and Big Ag. Doing so will be a tall task — the health care sector spent over $750 million lobbying the federal government for special treatment just last year. In comparison, the often-maligned military-industrial complex spent almost six times less on lobbying . As a result, health insurance in this country is not portable or convenient, and that’s not an accident. The government spends over $300 billion a year subsidizing employers to provide health insurance; if you lose or leave your job, you lose your health insurance and your access to medical care. Instead of allowing big corporations to dominate health care policy, we must empower Americans and reward them for making smarter health care decisions; this will also let innovators improve upon the status quo. Direct care models and Health Savings Accounts are two ways to do that. Direct primary care can help bring down costs and expand access without relying on a complicated array of insurance networks, codes and billing. Think of it as Amazon Prime for your doctor: unlimited visits and heavily discounted labs and medications can make people more confident in their health care finances and not miss those crucial follow-up appointments because they fear the cost. Some employers are already ditching traditional insurance companies for direct primary care and saving up to 40 percent . Health Savings Accounts or HSAs allow people to save for health expenses tax-free. Under a health care freedom model, employers could contribute to an employee’s HSA instead of serving as an HR wing of the government. These savings plans can empower those who want to opt out of an over-regulated and impersonal health care system and take power over their medical decisions back from massive insurance companies. Unfortunately, federal law currently limits how effective HSAs can be. Their contribution limits are too low, and direct primary care and health care sharing ministries are not HSA-eligible expenses, while rental cars and scooters are. You also only can have an HSA now if you have a high-deductible health plan. All of these restrictions should be eliminated. If politicians don’t treat this health care crisis with the attention it deserves, health care will bankrupt us and give the average American a less fulfilling life than they deserve. Enough is enough. We must embrace two steps to health care freedom. First, we must break the grip of the cronyism that feeds us poisoned food and makes a quick buck off the “cure.” Then, we must free the system using direct primary care and HSAs — among other things — to destroy the third-party paper pushers’ power to deny us an affordable and personalized relationship with the health care provider of our choice. Get the government bureaucrat and corporate America out of the way of you and your farmer and you and your providers so that we can make America healthy again.

(WATE) — The co-owners of Rocky Hill Pharmacy have been indicted on multiple charges amid accusations that they were part of a health care fraud conspiracy that involved altering and forging prescriptions to get money from drug plan and pharmacy benefit managers. According to the federal indictment, which is dated October 16, 2024, Rocky Hill Pharmacy and its co-owners, Tiffany Haney and Anne Warren, conspired to commit health care fraud. Both Haney and Warren were pharmacists licensed to practice in Tennessee, the indictment states. File: Former Heritage High teacher accused of ‘explicit’ communication with student Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Between August 2017 and July 2024, the indictment claims that Rocky Hill Pharmacy was paid $8,572,470.08 by drug plans, pharmacy benefit managers and other health care benefit programs because of the conspiracy. Haney and Warren were charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud, making false statement relating to health care matters and aggravated identity theft. The document alleges that Haney and Warren forged prescriptions using the names of medical providers, who did not authorize the prescriptions, and listed themselves and their family members as patients. They are also accused of creating a list of prescription medications covered by a prescription drug plan or other insurance plan that included certain steroids, pain creams, and other medications based on their high reimbursement rates from health care provider programs. The indictment claims that the pharmacy then hired an individual to market the list, referred to as a drug formulary, to pain clinics and health care providers. It continues to allege that Haney and Warren altered the formularies that were signed legitimately by providers by checking boxes next to prescribed medications and writing in additional refills. In some cases, the indictment claims Haney and Warren created forged formularies and other prescription documents by hand writing in patient names, marking boxes next to medications, writing in refills, and falsely signing the provider’s name. In other cases, Haney and Warren allegedly included notes that implied a forged prescription was phoned into the pharmacy or verbally authorized by a provider’s representative, the indictment says.

According to the Department of Justice, if Haney and Warren are convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, they could face up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000.

(AP) — Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. It builds on Maryland’s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare’s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state’s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act. This new federal framework, known as the AHEAD model, has been designed to deliver high-quality health care through greater coordination, with a focus on health equity and social needs to support underserved patients. “The AHEAD model is the next chapter in health care, so we are proud to be writing that new chapter right here in the state of Maryland,” said Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital. It’s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model. “Maryland has this unique system that we’ve developed over a period of decades now,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. “We’re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That’s the goal.” The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals. Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance. “Secondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,” said Cardin, a Democrat. “So, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don’t have to spend as much time with health care needs.” The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states — Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York— for participation in the AHEAD Model. “Maryland’s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,” Brooks-LaSure said.

Alli, who represents Oyo South Senatorial District on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, noted that this is necessary to ensure sanity in the health sector. The lawmaker, while speaking, called for a stronger legal framework to drive critical improvements in healthcare delivery across Nigeria. Alli made these declarations on Thursday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, during a lecture organized by the University College Hospital (UCH) Students Association. The lawmaker, while speaking on the topic “The Intersection of Law and Health in Nigeria: Shaping Healthcare Policies, Regulating Medical Practices, and Ensuring Equitable Access to Quality Healthcare Services,” emphasized the role of strengthened laws in building an equitable and effective healthcare system. Alli further identified key areas where healthcare laws can bolster health system efficiency. He added that policy strengthening, medical practice regulation, and promoting equitable access to quality services are also important. He maintained that Nigeria’s legal frameworks must evolve to tackle current and future health challenges. “Enforcing these laws effectively is crucial to maintain patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system,” he said. “Healthcare regulatory bodies, including the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) as well as the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN), must receive increased funding and personnel to enforce healthcare laws more effectively,” he added. “When patients understand their rights, they are in a better position to demand quality care and accountability from healthcare providers. “Our legal frameworks must evolve to tackle current and future health challenges.” Up Next PDP condemns herdsmen attacks in Benue communities, questions Alia govt’s inaction Don't Miss Aiyedatiwa not playing politics, committed to paying N73,000 wage – HoS You may like Trump’s threat: Remain calm, Tinubu has all it takes – FG to Nigerians FG to establish multi-million-dollar sugar factory in Taraba Nigerian govt approves 3 critical civil service policies Jigawa pensioners urges government to adopt 32,000 minimum pension Trump’s threat: ‘Nigerian Govt won’t be intimidated’ — Tinubu Trump convinced Nigerian govt not ready to tackle insecurity – Momodu"

While many health care systems have adopted this framework, the widespread use of the relative value unit (RVU) system fundamentally undermines these goals. Far from facilitating the quadruple aim, the RVU system creates a chasm between what health care is and what it aspires to be, making the attainment of these aims seem, at times, almost laughable. The four pillars of the quadruple aim and how the RVU system undermines them 1. Improving population health: procedures over prevention. The first pillar of the quadruple aim emphasizes improving population health through preventive care, management of chronic diseases, and addressing health disparities. These goals require long-term, holistic care strategies that go beyond episodic, procedure-based interventions. However, the RVU system is fundamentally biased toward procedures and volume-based care, rather than preventive care and long-term patient outcomes. Why it’s laughable: The RVU system rewards health care providers for doing more procedures, not for preventing them. Providers are incentivized to perform surgeries, diagnostics, and interventions because these actions translate into higher RVUs and, thus, higher compensation. In contrast, preventive services—like diet counseling, chronic disease management, or mental health care—are poorly compensated because they generate fewer RVUs. This creates an absurd situation where the health care system is essentially structured to focus on “sick care” rather than “health care.” Trend: Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension have skyrocketed over the past 30 years, yet prevention and management strategies remain undervalued. While public health initiatives are making strides, the RVU system continues to undervalue the very services that would improve population health in the long run. 2. Enhancing the patient experience: rushed, fragmented care Patients increasingly expect not only competent care but also care that is empathetic, personalized, and well-coordinated. The RVU system, however, pressures providers to maximize the number of patients they see or the procedures they perform, effectively turning health care into an assembly line. This compromises the quality of the patient-provider relationship. Why it’s laughable: The RVU system puts providers on a hamster wheel of patient throughput. Doctors are encouraged to see as many patients as possible within a limited time frame to meet RVU quotas, leading to shorter visits, rushed care, and an inevitable reduction in the quality of interactions. It’s laughable to think we can enhance the patient experience when physicians are forced to spend more time checking boxes in an electronic health record to document RVUs than engaging with their patients. Trend: Surveys over the past 30 years, such as those conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), indicate that while patient satisfaction scores have become a prominent metric, the patient experience itself is often degraded by the very system that measures these outcomes. Short visits and fragmented care dominate, making genuine, patient-centered interactions rare. 3. Reducing per capita costs: the perverse incentive of overutilization Reducing health care costs has been a central concern for policymakers, especially in the U.S., which consistently spends more on health care per capita than any other developed country. The RVU system, however, drives up costs through its emphasis on procedures, diagnostics, and volume—often at the expense of actual health outcomes. Why it’s laughable: The RVU system actively incentivizes overutilization of health care services. The more tests, procedures, and interventions a provider can perform, the more RVUs they generate and, therefore, the more money they make. This directly opposes the goal of reducing health care costs. It’s an open secret that much of health care spending goes to unnecessary procedures, tests, or repeat visits that generate high RVUs but do little to improve patient outcomes. Trend: Over the past 30 years, U.S. health care spending has skyrocketed. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), health care spending grew from $1.2 trillion in 1990 to nearly $4 trillion by 2020. This upward trend is largely due to the high utilization of procedures, diagnostics, and tests—all incentivized by the RVU model. Attempts to control costs, such as through bundled payments or capitation models, have not yet been widely enough adopted to counterbalance the pervasive influence of RVU-driven care. ADVERTISEMENT 4. Improving provider work-life balance: the burnout epidemic The quadruple aim added provider well-being as a critical element to emphasize that improving the health care system also requires supporting the mental and physical health of providers. However, the RVU system is a major contributor to physician burnout, which has reached epidemic levels in the last decade. Why it’s laughable: The RVU system puts intense pressure on providers to maintain productivity at the expense of their well-being. Doctors are often overworked, with more administrative duties related to documenting services and more patients to see, all while dealing with a fragmented and inefficient health care infrastructure. The demand to produce high RVUs leads to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of accomplishment, classic symptoms of burnout. It’s ironic, if not absurd, to speak of improving provider well-being while tethering them to a system that drains their mental and physical reserves. Trend: Studies over the past decade have shown alarming rates of physician burnout. According to the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, over 50 percent of U.S. physicians experience burnout. Burnout is not just an individual issue—it leads to higher rates of medical errors, physician turnover, and lower quality care, which perpetuates the vicious cycle of a broken health care system. The RVU system plays a central role in this, creating a toxic work environment where productivity is prioritized over professional satisfaction. The trends: a chasm between the RVU system and the quadruple aim Over the last 30 years, trends in health care outcomes, costs, patient experience, and provider well-being paint a clear picture: the RVU system is a primary driver of many of the very issues that the quadruple aim seeks to address. The chasm between the goals of the quadruple aim and the reality of the RVU-driven system is wide and growing. Health care costs have continued to rise due to RVU-driven overutilization. Provider burnout has worsened, with many doctors feeling more like cogs in a machine than healers. The patient experience remains fragmented and depersonalized as providers are forced to focus on volume. Population health outcomes are lagging, particularly in areas that rely on preventive care and chronic disease management—fields undercompensated by the RVU system. Conclusion: the quadruple aim and RVU system—an irreconcilable difference The goals of the quadruple aim and the realities of the RVU system are in direct opposition. The RVU system prioritizes productivity, volume, and procedures, which undermines the holistic, value-based care model that the quadruple aim aspires to. To suggest that health care providers can meet the quadruple aim within the constraints of RVU-driven care is not just difficult—it’s laughable. The trends over the past few decades demonstrate how broken the system truly is and how deep the divide is between our health care aspirations and the perverse incentives that keep us from achieving them. To truly move toward a health care system that meets the quadruple aim, the RVU model must be rethought, if not entirely replaced, with systems that reward value over volume, prevention over intervention, and well-being over burnout. Until then, the chasm between where we are and where we need to be will remain wide—and laughable in its absurdity. Mick Connors is a pediatric emergency physician.

Being a part of the team that delivers and supports that care can be just as impactful, and that’s precisely what Comprehensive Healthcare, one of Washington state’s largest behavioral health organizations, intends to demonstrate through a new multi-channel workforce recruitment campaign. Building on the theme “What we do means more,” the campaign highlights the far-reaching impact of a career in community behavioral health – and why Comprehensive Healthcare is an employer of choice. Through a new landing page featuring interviews with team members and open positions, advertising and social media activations, the organization takes a people-focused approach to attracting future workforce members by placing its staff, culture and attractive benefits package center stage. “It’s no secret that community behavioral health is facing a workforce shortage. Demand for services is at an all-time high, but the number of professionals entering our field is not keeping pace,” said Jodi Daly, Ph.D., CEO of Comprehensive Healthcare. “More than a year ago, we set out on this major initiative to ensure we’re articulating why our community members should consider a career in behavioral health – and why Comprehensive Healthcare is the right destination for professionals.” The organization’s employment data pegs it as a center for career advancement from the standpoint of professional development and compensation. Comprehensive Healthcare strives to pay above-average wages in each role and offers annual compensation reviews. In May 2024, employees received a 13 th month bonus – an extra paycheck, in recognition of their impactful and heartfelt work. Other employee benefits include robust PTO, vacation and sick days, tuition reimbursement, student loan assistance, and access to training and growth initiatives. While the organization is hiring for a range of roles, it is specifically featuring positions for registered nurses, therapists, medical providers, behavioral health associates, and IT and HR professionals, offering signing bonuses to help attract top talent. At Comprehensive Healthcare, registered nurses administer medication, provide education about prescriptions and general health needs and develop client treatment plans. Medical providers are also a part of the multi-disciplinary team that develops and implements client treatment plans, while also conducting medical evaluations, and prescribing and managing medications. Therapists provide counseling to individuals and groups and are supported by behavioral health associates who also provide counseling, as well as skills training, to help clients stabilize and learn how to manage their mental health conditions. IT and HR professionals are integral to the operations of the organization, delivering critical support across departments to ensure systems and processes are running efficiently and effectively. Currently, Comprehensive Healthcare is looking for a data & applications manager, a human resources director, and an HR generalist, among other positions. To build “What we do means more,” Comprehensive Healthcare partnered with Talent Works, a global recruitment agency, to capture feedback from current team members, and combine that with a robust human resources strategy designed to attract and retain talent. The initiative reflects the organization’s solutions-focused approach to ensure it can continue to grow and evolve to serve clients and meet Central Washington’s mental health needs. “We’re incredibly proud of this campaign,” added Daly. “It’s a vibrant reflection of Comprehensive Healthcare, the incredible work that our team is doing to support the community, and how we, as an agency, are committed to supporting and uplifting our team so that they feel energized about continuing that work. We look forward to the opportunities it will create for others to explore the many career possibilities within community behavioral health.” Learn more about the “What we do means more” campaign and career opportunities at Comprehensive Healthcare: careers.comphc.org .

Consumers can be catalysts for change: About 1 in 4 consumers (24%) are willing to switch doctors if virtual visit options are not offered, indicating the potential of consumers' preferences to shape the industry. Why this matters In 2025, life sciences and health care (LSHC) organizations may have to choose between harnessing the growing wave of consumerism and industry convergence or risk losing market share and margin according to Deloitte's ""2025 US Life Sciences and Health Care Outlook,"" released today. Data from Deloitte's recent consumer survey indicates that health care consumers may let their wallets do the talking since some are willing to switch providers who are not offering their preferred way of engaging, such as virtual visits. Similarly, life sciences organizations may experience more consumers gravitating to purchasing certain medications directly from the manufacturer — potentially moving direct-to-consumer sales of pharmaceuticals from the fringes today to the norm in the future. The power of the health care consumer may be more fully revealed in 2025. Key quote ""Life sciences and health care organizations seek to achieve their mission while growing margin. Organizations that understand consumers' preferences and prioritize consumer choices are likely to be better positioned to adjust their business strategy and capture market share in the coming year. Our research suggests that strategic moves that leverage cross-industry collaborations could close gaps in care and help meet consumers' evolving needs and expectations."" — Kulleni Gebreyes, M.D., vice chair and US Life Sciences and Health Care leader, Deloitte Shift in perspective and understanding needed Traditionally, the life sciences and health care industry has narrowly viewed its customer as a patient for services and products or as a member for benefit coverage. In a rapidly changing world that is consistently challenging traditional ways of thinking, the life sciences and health care industry is no different. In 2025, organizations that understand the people they serve are more than just patients at a hospital, more than just enrollees of a health plan, and more than just users of a medical device or prescription drug could have a competitive advantage. This broader perspective of the whole person will likely help the industry understand how to meet health care consumers where they are when they need health care services, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Convergence could close gaps Start-ups and organizations from outside of the life sciences and health care sectors appear to be working to fill the gap between consumer preferences and existing products and services. According to a Deloitte analysis of Pitchbook data, private equity firms invested about $87 billion in health care start-ups between 2021 and 2024. During the same period, consumers spent nearly $550 billion on non-traditional health care products and services according to a Deloitte analysis of Global Wellness Institute 2022 report. The market opportunity to fill the gap in consumer needs could drive convergence in 2025. More start-ups could enter the space, and existing organizations might develop new products and services to satisfy changing consumer preferences. Key quote ""Consumers appear to be investing in their health. Opportunities to connect organizations within and outside of traditional life sciences and health care with our industry incumbents can make health care more affordable, more accessible, more equitable, and more reflective of the experiences consumers deserve and need to live longer, healthier lives."" — Dr. Gebreyes About Deloitte Deloitte provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world's most admired brands, including nearly 90% of the Fortune 500® and more than 8,500 U.S.-based private companies.

They conduct household visits, provide preventive care, and guide families on health practices that enhance their well-being. Audio By Vocalize Principal Secretary, Public Health and Professional Standards and the Ministry of Health Mary Muthoni/ HANDOUT BY Mary Muthoni, PS for Public Health and Professional Standards at the Ministry of Health. Kenya is making bold strides toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with the Primary Healthcare Fund, funding primary health care at the centre of this transformation. Established under the Social Health Authority (SHA), the Primary Healthcare Fund is focused on one mission; to provide universal access to essential health services, ensuring that every Kenyan, regardless of their location or financial status, can receive the care they need. By financing level 1, 2, and 3 facilities - ranging from community health services to dispensaries and health centres - the government is ensuring that affordable healthcare is free and available to all Kenyans, removing longstanding financial barriers for the most vulnerable populations. The introduction of the primary Healthcare Fund marks a significant turning point in Kenya's approach to health. It is not merely about treating illness, it is about preventing disease and promoting overall health within communities. This comprehensive strategy prioritises health education and preventive care, recognising that investing in health at the community levels leads to better health outcomes and reduces the strain on higher level facilities. Central to this initiative are Community Health Promoters (CHPs), who serve as vital links between healthcare systems and communities. They conduct household visits, provide preventive care, and guide families on health practices that enhance their well-being. For millions of Kenyans in rural areas, CHPs are trusted community members delivering immunizations, maternal and child care, and health education directly to families. Their work is to ensure that essential services are accessible to every citizen, regardless of income or location. Level 2 dispensaries and Level 3 health centers complement this system by providing more extensive healthcare services. These facilities treat common ailments, provide early diagnosis and support preventive measures, ensuring that care is available close to home and alleviating the burden on larger referral hospitals, by prioritising the quality and accessibility of these levels. The primary Healthcare Fund establishes a reliable healthcare infrastructure that allows every community to access the services they need without financial strain. The government’s commitment to these lower-level facilities is a testament to the belief that primary healthcare is the foundation upon which the entire health system rests. The SHA plays a critical role in overseeing the effective utilisation of the Primary Healthcare Fund, ensuring that these facilities remain functional, well equipped and responsive to the healthcare needs of their communities. This not only enhances service delivery but also build trust in the healthcare system. The establishment and operationalisation of primary health care networks in the subcounties, has successfully increased access to health services for the county population, significantly reducing the burden of out-of-pocket expenditures, enhanced health indicators, reduced the burden at referral facilities and enabled identification and referral of clients in the community by CHPs with previously unknown conditions. This model has been credited with improving health outcomes across the country by improving health indicators, and reducing morbidity and mortality. The PCNs experience underscores the potential impact of a well-structured primary healthcare system being funded throughby the Primary Healthcare Fund. By ensuring that basic health services are available and affordable, Kenya can reduce the financial barriers that often prevent low-income households from seeking care. The fund not only supports healthcare providers but also fosters a culture of health seeking behaviour within communities, enabling individuals to prioritize their health without fear of financial hardship. As Kenya builds this foundation for UHC, every citizen has a role to play in supporting and sustaining the system. The SHA encourages all Kenyans to register for social health insurance, which is integral to creating a sustainable healthcare model that services current and future generations. By registering, Kenyans reinforce a health system that upholds the well-being of all. This act of participation strengthens the SHA’s capacity to expand and improve services, providing a secure healthcare safety net for everyone. Now is the time to act. Registering is not just about securing healthcare for yourself and your family; it’s about supporting a system that will benefit every Kenyan, creating a healthier, more resilient nation for all. Take part in this movement today and join the mission to make healthcare a universal right across Kenya. The commitment to primary healthcare through the primary healthcare fund represents a pivotal shift in Kenya’s health strategy. By prioritising health at the community level, Kenya is laying the groundwork for a healthier population and a more sustainable healthcare system. The goal is clear: to ensure that every Kenyan, regardless of their socio-economic status, can access quality healthcare services without financial burden. By focusing on accessibility, affordability, and community engagement, the Primary Healthcare Fund is a key component in achieving universal health coverage in Kenya. The future of healthcare in Kenya is bright, and with collective action and commitment, we can turn this vision into reality.

President Biden’s October 2023 executive order focuses on AI safety, promoting guidelines that ensure fairness, transparency, and security, especially within healthcare. A coalition of healthcare providers has aligned on voluntary commitments to safeguard AI application by focusing on trustworthy and equitable practices, while expanding AI’s potential for improving diagnostics, patient communication, and operational efficiency, according to AP News. AI applications in healthcare include faster medical imaging analyses and drug discovery acceleration, both of which can reduce costs and enhance patient outcomes. However, data privacy and security remain top concerns, with risks that unregulated AI could introduce biases or misuse patient data. Notably, generative AI tools are easing clinician workloads by managing administrative tasks and patient communication, though the industry recognizes the need for greater regulatory oversight to mitigate risks effectively. Investment in healthcare AI has surged, with analysts estimating potential savings in USA’s healthcare costs by up to 10% in the coming years. Despite this optimism, the path to widespread AI adoption varies, with pharmaceutical companies proceeding cautiously due to data requirements, while healthcare providers explore broader implementation for clinical and operational uses.

The whitepaper, a result of a closed-door executive roundtable encompassing key leaders within the healthcare arena, provides an in-depth analysis on the region of Southeast Asia (SEA) as an untapped market that has yet to reach its full potential on the front of global healthcare investment. It provides an overview of the state of healthcare in the region, its foreseeable future, the challenges present and actionable recommendations for global healthcare firms to consider. As a region, SEA is home to approximately 8.5% of the world's population, but has a healthcare expenditure that amounts to only 1.4% of the global total. This disproportionate scale is poised for positive change with an increased importance placed on healthcare in recent years following the COVID-19 pandemic. This coincides with a booming population and a sizable forecasted rise in overall wealth in the region - setting the stage for a unique backdrop for the healthcare industry. Cognisant of this prospect, FrontierView extensively reviewed SEA's healthcare landscape with the support of DKSH, revealing numerous challenges endemic to the region. Though geographically limited, SEA is home to 11 countries, each with their own set of socio-economic difficulties that the whitepaper collated and analyzed. This highlighted very tangible hurdles for healthcare firms looking to enter the region, including localization and navigating multiple regulatory bodies. This is all encompassed by the overarching dominance held by public healthcare systems across the region, which has been largely characterized by their struggles related to budgetary and manpower constraints. Challenges revealed in the whitepaper also highlighted opportunities for global firms to increase healthcare accessibility in SEA. The constraints of public healthcare systems in the region have led to more active exploration of the private sector in order to fill the gaps. Shortfalls in the public sector have been addressed through solutions such as public-private partnerships which increase capability, efficacy and accessibility in the region without compromising government resources. The whitepaper also includes a series of recommendations backed by extensive analysis for global healthcare firms interested to enter the market. This includes forming strategies around addressing the personnel shortage, applying advanced technologies like AI to tackle unique local issues and supporting early detection as well as prevention. These recommendations and more elaborated in the whitepaper serve as an accessible and actionable guide for the private sector looking to enter this region brimming with latent opportunity. ""At DKSH, we are dedicated to improving lives by increasing accessibility to healthcare across the region.

The announcement was made during the Malaysia International Healthcare (MIH) Megatrends 2024 event at Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, which featured international partners such as the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), the Australian Investment and Trade Commission (Austrade) and the British High Commission (BHC). The MCMC said the collaboration aimed to address pressing healthcare challenges, including the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, an increasing elderly population and limited healthcare access in rural areas. “By 2040, Malaysia’s elderly demographic is projected to nearly match the youth population, increasing the strain on healthcare services. “In rural regions, inadequate infrastructure and a shortage of medical professionals exacerbate disparities in health outcomes. “These partnerships seek to bridge these gaps by leveraging advanced technologies and expertise from the US, Australia and the UK to improve Malaysian healthcare delivery,” said the MCMC. During the ceremony, the MCMC said its partnership with the BHC would pave the way for a dynamic exchange of innovations, enhancing our healthcare capacity. “The partnership with the USTDA will introduce cutting-edge solutions, supported by invaluable grant assistance. “Austrade will provide innovation partnerships, empowering Malaysia to lead in healthcare transformation.” Present at the announcement were British High Commissioner KL acting deputy commissioner Tom Shepherd, USTDA senior country representative Murni Ali and Austrade trade and investment commissioner Melanie Haris.The MCMC also noted that the involvement of USTDA, Austrade and BHC would accelerate the adoption of cutting-edge solutions, bringing global expertise to foster innovation, stimulate growth and attract foreign direct investment. “These efforts will establish Malaysia as a leading health tourism destination while strengthening the local healthcare ecosystem.”Also present were Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil, Communications Ministry’s secretary-general Datuk Mohamad Fauzi Md Isa and MCMC chairman Tan Sri Mohamad Salim Fateh Din. The MIH Megatrends also saw telecommunications companies joining forces with financial institutions to redefine financial support in healthcare. The partnership between CelcomDigi and Ambank Group would focus on delivering advanced digital healthcare solutions, such as holo-medicine, intelligent medical assistance and remote healthcare solutions, focusing on providing financial ease and accessibility to clients. CelcomDigi Bhd chief executive officer Datuk Idham Nawawi and Ambank Group group chief executive officer Jamie Ling were present for the announcement. Maxis and AmBank Group have also deepened their collaboration to accelerate transformation in Malaysia’s healthcare sector and make financing more accessible to healthcare solutions. Both parties will explore innovative healthcare solutions enabled by connectivity, with potential applications such as remote consultation, robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality solutions and autonomous medical supply delivery. Maxis was represented by chief executive officer Goh Seow Eng and chief enterprise business officer Prateek Pashine. The event also saw the strategic partnership between Telekom Malaysia (TM) and Siemens Healthineers, which harnesses cutting-edge telecommunication technology and cloud-based solutions to transform future healthcare and medical equipment in Malaysia. TM chairman Datuk Zainal Abidin Putih, managing director and group chief executive officer Amar Huzaimi Md Deris and Siemens Healthineers Singapore and Malaysia director Jan Tiedermann were present for the collaboration announcement. Among the state leaders witnessing the collaboration announcement were Negri Sembilan health, unity, information, national integration and NGO action committee chairman Tengku Zamrah Tengku Sulaiman, Penang agrotechnology, food security and cooperative development committee chairman Fahmi Zainol, Pahang public works, transportation and health committee chairman Datuk Razali Kassim and Perak health, consumer affairs, national integration and human resources committee chairman A. Sivanesan. The MCMC said the rollout of 5G by telcos presents an opportunity to expand telemedicine and integrate wearable health devices, positioning Malaysia at the forefront of global healthcare transformation. “The telcos are playing a crucial role in driving these advancements. “The entry of international healthcare leaders into the Malaysian market will drive local progress by introducing leading- edge technologies, innovative solutions and best practices. “This influx of expertise will encourage private hospitals to enhance their services, leading to a more competitive and dynamic healthcare sector,” said the MCMC.

The launch was held yesterday at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre during the Malaysia International Healthcare (MIH) Megatrends 2024 conference. Officiating the event was Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad along with KPJ Healthcare University chairman Datuk Syed Mohamed Syed Ibrahim and KPJ Healthcare chairman Tan Sri Dr Ismail Bakar. Dzulkefly lauded the system as an initiative that brings meaningful improvements to the nation’s healthcare landscape. “By advancing medical education and research through collaboration between KPJ and KPJ University, it enables us to focus on population health, medical research, and the continuous development of our healthcare professionals,” he said. The Health Minister said that by 2035, an estimated 15% of the population will be over the age of 60. “With that, comes a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer,” explained Dzulkefly. He added that with such challenges, the healthcare system must adapt accordingly to address the population’s health challenges. Syed Mohamed, who is also Johor Corporation’s president and chief executive, emphasised the need to rethink and reimagine how healthcare works. “It is no longer just about providing treatments, hospitals must evolve beyond being mere treatment centres by embracing cutting-edge solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics and personalised medicine.” He added that it was necessary to shift the focus towards preventive care and overall well-being to help create a more sustainable healthcare system. “This vision is not born from incremental improvements, it is born from necessity and innovation as Malaysia faces a turning point with 45% of the nation’s healthcare provision coming from private hospitals. “The KPJ Health System will lead the way by bringing together the brightest minds in healthcare by pushing the boundaries of medical research and education,” Syed Mohamed concluded. Touted as a first of its kind in the country, the latest KPJ Academic Health System aims to align itself with the country’s long-term healthcare agenda of creating a world-class healthcare system. The system now looks to embed education and research into hospitals to transform them into centres of learning and discovery so that practice and innovation can go hand-in-hand. Doing so will help to enhance patient outcomes, foster continuous professional development for healthcare providers, and drive groundbreaking research to address current and future healthcare challenges. By embracing transformative technologies like AI, quantum computing and nanomedicine, KPJ Healthcare is setting a new standard for quality healthcare services across the country, driving improved patient outcomes and fostering a new generation of highly skilled healthcare professionals. This initiative contributes to the government’s efforts to increase access to advanced treatments, reduce healthcare disparities and support the development of specialised care centres that will cater to complex medical cases, strengthening Malaysia’s healthcare infrastructure. The launch of the KPJ Health System follows an internal soft launch held a week earlier, during which key internal stakeholders were introduced to the system’s vision. The KPJ Health System is designed to benefit not only KPJ Healthcare’s patients and staff but also the broader community through its research-driven approach to healthcare and focus on education. This is through the integration of three essential pillars: “to heal”, “to teach” and “to discover” which gives birth to the organisation’s Care for Life mantra. The healthcare event, MIH Megatrends 2024, which takes place from Oct 25-27, brings together some 3,000 healthcare industry-related players through the collaborative efforts of the Health Ministry, KPJ Healthcare and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). MIH Megatrends 2024 was officiated by His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, King of Malaysia. Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

According to Brown, if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election and enacts the policy initiatives that her administration has campaigned on, there would be “a massive rollback in health care access nationwide,” directly impacting the health and well-being of underserved communities in the U.S. “Just days ago,” he said, referring to comments made by the Democratic Party candidate during an NBC interview on Tuesday, “we heard Vice President Harris say that she does not believe in religious exemptions for abortion procedures.” “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris said when asked whether she would consider religious exemptions with respect to federal laws on abortion. “If these religious freedom violations are ultimately successful,” Brown continued, “they would effectively destroy Catholic health care in the United States by making the practice of faithfully Catholic health care unlawful and illegal.” The United States Catholic Conference of Bishops (USCCB) reports on its website that there are currently 645 hospitals, 438 health care centers, 1,389 specialized homes, 105 orphanages, 853 day care centers, and 3,449 social services centers in the U.S. Catholic health care network, which assists more than 118 million patients per year. In his remarks at the RFI gathering, Brown outlined seven key policy initiatives for safeguarding religious freedom and Catholic health care in the U.S. These include allowing faith-based providers equal opportunities to serve patients, enacting protections for human life and dignity, ensuring patients can access life-affirming care, rescinding harmful HHS mandates, and protecting the conscience and religious freedom rights of health care workers. Trending 1 2 3 4 5 “When the God-given dignity and love for the human person and the love of God is at the center of health care, all Americans, especially the most vulnerable, are best positioned to live longer, happier, healthier, more joyful lives,” Brown stated. When asked how Catholics should consider potential concerns with a second Trump administration — such as his proposal for universal IVF coverage and its impact on Catholic providers — Brown highlighted the importance of voting “to do more good and limit evil.” “I think for us as Catholics and as Catholic health care leaders, we have to be Catholic first,” Brown said. “Whether it’s law, whether it’s medicine, health care, all these things, it’s Catholic first, and any political support has to be secondary.” However, he continued, “at the same time, I think when it comes to these the plethora of human dignity issues, particularly in health care, I think the policies of Vice President Harris, they’re absolutely abhorrent on human dignity across the board.” “When it comes to the policies of the Trump administration, while very imperfect, [they are] superior on issues of human dignity in health care,” he added. “Absolutely superior.” Tags: Health Care , Catholic News , Conscience Protection , Freedom of religion Madalaine Elhabbal is a staff reporter for Catholic News Agency, based at the Washington, D.C. headquarters of EWTN News."

""As Malaysia advances in healthcare, there must be an emphasis on patient-centred care,"" he said He added that this focus on prioritising the patient is a crucial step in shaping the future of Malaysian healthcare. Dzulkefly then said that the traditional focus has been on reactive and curative care, treating diseases only after they manifest. ""However, the future of healthcare lies in prevention and partnership with patients. ""The future of healthcare: it's health first, then care,"" he said. Recognising the growing empowerment and involvement of patients, Dr Dzulkefly said that it is important to foster partnerships between healthcare providers and patients. ""Today's patients are more informed and empowered than ever before. They seek not only treatment but also a partnership in their health journey. ""Our digital health transformation must serve our primary objective of patient centricity, and a sustainable digital health ecosystem must lead towards achieving 'One Citizen One Record from Womb to Tomb',"" he said at the launch of Malaysia International Healthcare (MIH) Megatrends 2024 on Saturday (Oct 26). The event was officiated by His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia. Beyond the domestic landscape, the Minister acknowledged the global context and the need to address health disparities both within and between nations. ""The next frontier in healthcare will be defined by our ability to address these inequities. As health practitioners, we have a unique responsibility to advocate for policies and practices that promote health equity,"" he said.

OCR indicated that the purpose of the RHC Rule is to protect access to and privacy of reproductive health care that is perceived to be threatened by the recent actions of more than 20 states in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . The RHC Rule points out that the changing legal landscape increases the chances that a person's protected health information (PHI) in connection with reproductive health care may be disclosed in ways that harm what HIPAA seeks to protect, particularly trust in the health care system and its providers. The RHC Rule is effective as of June 25, 2024. Covered health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses (and their business associates) (collectively, ""Regulated Entities"") must comply with all provisions of the RHC Rule by December 23, 2024, including updating their HIPAA policies and procedures. The required Notice of Privacy Practices need not be updated until February 16, 2026. What the RHC Rule Prohibits Generally, the RHC Rule prohibits the use or disclosure of reproductive health care PHI by Regulated Entities for either of the following purposes: To conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into or to impose liability on any person for simply seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care, under the circumstances provided, is lawful. The identification of any person for the purpose of such an investigation or imposition of liability in connection with their merely seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. The RHC Rule defines ""reproductive health care"" broadly to include all health care that can be provided to address reproductive health including contraception (and emergency contraception), pregnancy-related health care, miscarriage treatment, fertility or infertility-related health care, and other types of care, services, or supplies used for the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive health, including the treatment of peri- and post-menopausal conditions. The RCR Rule indicates that the prohibition described above preempts state laws that mandate disclosure of PHI for a prohibited purpose even where pursuant to a court order or other legal process. It applies where Regulated Entities have reasonably determined that one or more of the following exists as to the reproductive health care: The health care is otherwise lawful under the law of the state in which the care is provided, whether or not the recipient of the care is a resident. The reproductive health care is protected (such as the use of contraception), required, or authorized by federal law, regardless of the state in which the care is provided. The health care was provided by a person other than the Regulated Entity that receives the request for PHI and its provision is presumed to be lawful. For these purposes, reproductive health care is presumed to be lawful unless the Regulated Entity has actual knowledge that the care was not lawful. Reproductive health care is not presumed to be lawful if the Regulated Entity is informed by the health care recipient that the reproductive health care was provided by an unlicensed person and such provision of care requires licensure. In addition, reproductive health care is not presumed to be lawful if the Regulated Entity receives factual information from the person requesting PHI that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the care was not lawful as provided. What the RHC Rule Still Permits The RHC Rule continues to permit Regulated Entities to use or disclose PHI for purposes otherwise permitted under the Privacy Rule where the request for the PHI is not made to investigate or impose liability on any person for the simple act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. For example, Regulated Entities may use or disclose PHI (a) to defend one's self in an investigation or proceeding related to professional misconduct or negligence where the alleged professional misconduct or negligence involved the provision of reproductive health care, (b) to defend any person in a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding where liability could be imposed on that person for providing reproductive health care, or (c) to an Inspector General where PHI is sought to conduct an audit for health oversight purposes. Required Attestation When Regulated Entities receive a request for reproductive health care PHI, the RHC Rule requires that Regulated Entities obtain a signed attestation that the use or disclosure is not for a prohibited purpose. The attestation is required when such PHI request is potentially related to any of the following: Disclosures to coroners and medical examiners, Health oversight activities, Judicial and administrative proceedings, and Law enforcement purposes. The OCR intends to issue model attestation language before December 23, 2024. Next Steps Health care providers, health plans, health care clearinghouses, and their business associates should consider taking the following actions: Review and update their Notice of Privacy Practices, including providing examples of how individuals' reproductive health care PHI may or may not be disclosed. Review and update as needed all HIPAA business associate agreements to require them to implement compliance with the RHC Rule. Review and update policies and procedures to the extent they are affected by the RHC Rule, such as the description of permitted disclosures, HIPAA definitions, and the implementation of the attestation requirement. Identify where reproductive health care PHI can be found in invoicing and other administrative records to avoid inadvertent disclosure. Train personnel responsible for managing health care and/or health plan information and/or responding to PHI requests about the requirements of the RHC Rule, including the process for obtaining required attestations.

He boosted Obamacare subsidies in the ARP without either raising revenue or cutting spending. He has been so focused on boosting enrollment that he has encouraged fraud. He has allowed health care spending to continue its long march over the federal budget, overtaking nearly everything else, adding trillions to the long-term debt, and in the process contributing to rapidly rising cost of interest payments. In the meantime, he has pursued small bureaucratic tweaks that make it harder and harder for Americans to escape Obamacare's imposing regulatory costs. Advertisement There is no reason to think that Harris would depart significantly from this approach. As she began campaigning for president, she signaled that her economic policies would prioritize expanding federal funding for health care and social programs. In her first major speech on economic policy, Harris promised to ""take on the issue of the cost of health care,"" and attacked Trump for wanting to repeal Obamacare, and for having no plan to expand health care access. A headline in The Hill summarized her health care agenda: ""Harris vows Biden-era health care programs will get bigger."" Ed Morrissey That assumes that Harris won't revert back to Medicare for All. Her campaign says she no longer supports that, but like all of her other reversals, Harris herself has yet to explain it or even solidly corroborate it.

Captioned Kachrodia v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. , No. 24-cv-01238 (M.D. Tenn.), the Acadia Healthcare class action lawsuit charges Acadia Healthcare and certain of Acadia Healthcare’s top current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Acadia Healthcare class action lawsuit further alleges that on September 1, 2024, The New York Times published an article entitled “How a Leading Chain of Psychiatric Hospitals Traps Patients,” which revealed that The New York Times ’s “investigation found that some of that success was built on a disturbing practice: Acadia has lured patients into its facilities and held them against their will, even when detaining them was not medically necessary.” On this news, the price of Acadia Healthcare stock fell more than 4%, according to the complaint.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Ramsay Health Care ( ASX:RHC ), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger. What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Ramsay Health Care, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.056 = AU$939m ÷ (AU$21b - AU$4.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024) . Thus, Ramsay Health Care has an ROCE of 5.6%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Healthcare industry average of 7.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Ramsay Health Care ASX:RHC Return on Capital Employed October 20th 2024 Above you can see how the current ROCE for Ramsay Health Care compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Ramsay Health Care . What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us In terms of Ramsay Health Care's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 11%, but since then they've fallen to 5.6%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run. Our Take On Ramsay Health Care's ROCE In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Ramsay Health Care is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. These growth trends haven't led to growth returns though, since the stock has fallen 34% over the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us. One more thing, we've spotted 1 warning sign facing Ramsay Health Care that you might find interesting.

Margaret Schroeder, CUPE local 204 president, says the agreement brings a new day for health-care workers in Manitoba. (CBC) Social Sharing A union representing Manitoba health-care workers says the new deal reached with the province and voted for by members is a result of health-care workers who made sure no one was left behind. ""This was a health-care deal all of our members could be proud of,"" said Gina McKay, president of CUPE Manitoba. The Canadian Union of Public Employees and Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union (MGEU) workers in Prairie Mountain Health and Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority voted in favour of the deal negotiated Oct. 8, which brings raises totalling an average of 27 per cent over the four-year contract, after rejecting an earlier contract offer. The ratification vote ended Friday at noon. CUPE signed the new collective agreement on behalf of around 19,000 health-care support workers Friday morning, with employers represented by the Provincial Health Labour Relations Secretariat. The union members covered by the agreement include home care workers, health-care aides, laundry aides, housekeeping aides, dietary aides, ward clerks and recreation co-ordinators at hospitals, health-care centres and personal care homes. General wage increases in 2024 for all employees under the agreement will begin at 2.5 per cent plus a one per cent market adjustment, a CUPE news release said Friday. That will be followed by general increases of 2.75 per cent in 2025, and three per cent in both 2026 and 2027. ""This brings health-care workers from dead last in the country to middle of the pack or better,"" McKay said. Manitoba health-care strike postponed after tentative deal reached in early morning hours The agreement also increases the starting wage for high-vacancy positions. Margaret Schroeder, CUPE Local 204 president, said the deal addresses retention and recruitment issues, adds more sick time and wellness days and eliminates unpaid scheduled hours in home care. ""It's clear that this is a new day for health-care workers in Manitoba,"" Schroeder said. Those workers include community and facility support workers at Shared Health Manitoba, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Prairie Mountain Health and the Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority, and community support workers in the Southern Health region. MGEU head says health-care strike imminent after province offers 'not a penny more' Schroeder said the union will be watching to see whether the new deal results in health-care vacancies filled and worker burnout reduced, and will be the first to ""ring the alarm bells"" if this deal doesn't fulfil those goals. ""But we think this is a strong start in the right direction,"" Schroeder said. The deal was reached in the early morning hours of the day the union was scheduled to go on strike. It averted a strike that would have reduced work by the approximately 25,000 workers to essential services only, with those who rely on services such as home care warned about impending reduced care.

Advocates say people who identify as LGBTQ+ have difficulty getting health care in Namibia. Namibia hosts workshop on health care access to LGBTQ+ community Print WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibians who are part of the LGBTQ+ community often find it difficult to get decent health care and many report discriminatory practices within the health care system. For example, when 20-year-old Immanuel Uirab sought contraception at a health facility, the nurse on duty would not assist him. “I don’t know if it’s the shorts I was wearing or you can generally just tell by looking at me that I am gay,” he said, “but then this particular nurse ... came out and she was, like, ‘No, we don’t offer contraceptives for people who practice sodomy. We can’t do that for you. ... You can go buy them if you want to use them in your private space, but we ... won’t give them to you because our government does not support homosexuality.’” A recent two-day training workshop facilitated by the group Our Equity Advocacy was aimed at encouraging health care practitioners in Namibia to not discriminate against sexual minorities. Discrimination in health care services violates the right to health care and the human rights principles of equity, privacy and dignity, said the United Nation’s special rapporteur on the right to health, Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng. Mofokeng held a workshop last weekend in Windhoek where she trained health care practitioners and young people about the role of health care in human rights. There are many opportunities in which health care workers “can take a seat at the table,” she said. “Not just in policymaking, but importantly in advocacy ... also in understanding human rights.” The executive director of Namibia’s Ministry of Health, Ben Nangombe, said that discrimination in health care based on sexual orientation is against the law and that practitioners who refuse health care to patients for any reason can lose their jobs. “The official position [of the] government on this matter is that the Namibian government provides health care services to all Namibians who need it without any discrimination whatsoever,” he said. One theme from last weekend’s workshop was the need for nurses to become agents of change and advocates for their patients. Letlhogonolo Mokgoroane, a legal practitioner and health rights activist from South Africa who co-facilitated the workshop, said members of sexual minority groups in Africa often face intrusive questioning when they seek medical care. “Let’s say you are going to a hospital or a clinic for a broken arm or a headache, some tummy ache, whatever,” Mokgoroane said. “What often happens is when you are trans or when you are gender nonconforming or when you are a member of the LGBTI community, immediately what happens is that the questions veer away from why you are actually there to really invasive and discriminatory questions, right? ‘I have a headache, why are you asking me about my sex life? ... I have a headache, why are you asking me about my genitalia?’” Mokgoroane said the issue can be addressed by training health care workers to affirm the gender of their patients when they treat them. However, Mokgoroane expressed worry that the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ laws in Africa will further drive discriminatory practices in the health care system and undermine public health altogether.

The Healthcare Worker Influenza Vaccination Dashboard , published by OHA’s Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program , shows that 61% of the state’s health care workers from all facility types were vaccinated among those eligible during the 2023-2024 flu season. This is slightly lower than the 2022-2023 flu season rate of 63% -- and concerning for state officials trying to prevent the virus’s spread to people most at risk of severe illness and death. The influenza vaccination rate among eligible health care workers had dropped 24% between the 2019-2020 and 2023-2024 influenza seasons – from 85% to 61% -- and marks the fourth consecutive year of decreasing influenza vaccination rates among health care personnel. “Health care worker influenza vaccination rates remain low and have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Flu activity is returning to pre-pandemic levels, but we have not seen the same for health care worker influenza vaccination rates,” said Dat Tran, M.D., the HAI Program’s medical director. “It is important that we focus on increasing flu vaccination rates for this critical, frontline workforce.” Broadcast-quality video clips of Dr. Tran speaking about rates of influenza vaccination among health care workers is available at https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/media-resources.aspx . OHA requires annual reporting of health care worker influenza vaccination data from four facility types – ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis centers, hospitals (including inpatient psychiatric facilities) and nursing facilities. Data are self-reported by facilities and includes aggregate counts of health care workers, grouped by health care worker category; who received an influenza vaccination; who declined; who had a medical contraindication; or who had an unknown vaccine status. The Healthcare Worker Influenza Vaccination Dashboard displays influenza vaccination data filterable by facility type, county, and worker classification. Trends by flu season and facility-specific data are also shown. According to the 2023-2024 dashboard, ambulatory surgery centers reported the highest flu vaccination levels among workers, with rates at 67%, followed by hospitals at 66%, nursing facilities at 37%, dialysis centers at 45% and inpatient psychiatric facilities the lowest at 24%. Dialysis centers were the only facility type that saw an increase from the 2022-2023 rates, but they were still below the rates for prior flu seasons. The percentage of eligible health care workers who declined vaccination has increased over the years, reaching 18% for the 2023-2024 flu season, which is up from 15% for the 2022-2023 season. Additionally, a high proportion of health care workers reported having an unknown vaccination status (21%), which may contribute to low vaccination rates – and illustrates the need for improvement in facility-level documentation of vaccination status. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed Healthy People 2020 with 10-year objectives for improving the health of all Americans, including showing progress toward a 90% influenza vaccination coverage goal for the health care workforce. However, Healthy People 2030 does not include a goal focused on increasing flu vaccinations among health care workers, so Oregon is continuing to use the Healthy People 2020 health worker vaccination goal as a way of directing public health action and showing where more support and education is needed. To achieve 90% vaccination coverage, Dr. Tran said there are important steps health care facilities can take. Public health recommendations include encouraging health care workers, including those not employed by the facility—such as contractors and volunteers—to get vaccinated at the beginning of every influenza season. Facilities can also host promotional activities, such as holding mass vaccination fairs, providing vaccines at no cost to employees, starting incentive programs, and documenting all health care workers’ vaccination status and requiring a declination form for health care workers who forgo vaccination. “We know our state’s health care workers want to protect their patients and prevent a potentially catastrophic outbreak of influenza, which can be deadly for vulnerable people, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions or who are immunocompromised,” Dr. Tran said. “We need health care workers to step up and get vaccinated.” OHA has developed a toolkit for health care employers and workers to help them improve employee flu vaccinations rates at their facilities to protect patients, themselves and their families.

OHA requires annual reporting of health care worker influenza vaccination data from four facility types – ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis centers, hospitals (including inpatient psychiatric facilities) and nursing facilities. Data are self-reported by facilities and includes aggregate counts of health care workers, grouped by health care worker category; who received an influenza vaccination; who declined; who had a medical contraindication; or who had an unknown vaccine status. The Healthcare Worker Influenza Vaccination Dashboard displays influenza vaccination data filterable by facility type, county, and worker classification. Trends by flu season and facility-specific data are also shown. According to the 2023-2024 dashboard, ambulatory surgery centers reported the highest flu vaccination levels among workers, with rates at 67%, followed by hospitals at 66%, nursing facilities at 37%, dialysis centers at 45% and inpatient psychiatric facilities the lowest at 24%. Dialysis centers were the only facility type that saw an increase from the 2022-2023 rates, but they were still below the rates for prior flu seasons. The percentage of eligible health care workers who declined vaccination has increased over the years, reaching 18% for the 2023-2024 flu season, which is up from 15% for the 2022-2023 season. Additionally, a high proportion of health care workers reported having an unknown vaccination status (21%), which may contribute to low vaccination rates – and illustrates the need for improvement in facility-level documentation of vaccination status. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed Healthy People 2020 with 10-year objectives for improving the health of all Americans, including showing progress toward a 90% influenza vaccination coverage goal for the health care workforce. However, Healthy People 2030 does not include a goal focused on increasing flu vaccinations among health care workers, so Oregon is continuing to use the Healthy People 2020 health worker vaccination goal as a way of directing public health action and showing where more support and education is needed. To achieve 90% vaccination coverage, Dr. Tran said there are important steps health care facilities can take. Public health recommendations include encouraging health care workers, including those not employed by the facility—such as contractors and volunteers—to get vaccinated at the beginning of every influenza season. Facilities can also host promotional activities, such as holding mass vaccination fairs, providing vaccines at no cost to employees, starting incentive programs, and documenting all health care workers’ vaccination status and requiring a declination form for health care workers who forgo vaccination. “We know our state’s health care workers want to protect their patients and prevent a potentially catastrophic outbreak of influenza, which can be deadly for vulnerable people, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions or who are immunocompromised,” Dr. Tran said. “We need health care workers to step up and get vaccinated.” OHA has developed a toolkit for health care employers and workers to help them improve employee flu vaccinations rates at their facilities to protect patients, themselves and their families.

JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off. Alberta’s government is taking action to refocus the health care system so that every Albertan has access to a primary health care provider and timely, high-quality primary health care, no matter where they live. Alberta’s new primary care provincial health agency, Primary Care Alberta, will create a modern, more responsive and unified health care system that prioritizes patients, empowers front-line health care professionals and helps reduce pressures on the entire health system. The immediate priority of Primary Care Alberta is to ensure every Albertan has access to high-quality primary care services in all areas of the province, so all Albertans and their families are supported in their day-to-day health needs through every stage of life. The new primary care agency will focus on supporting integrated teams of family physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists to provide patients with the best care possible. “Standing up Primary Care Alberta is an important milestone in refocusing the health care system to put patients first and give our front-line experts the support they need to ensure Albertans are receiving the care they deserve.” Kim Simmonds, the current assistant deputy minister of strategic planning and performance at Alberta Health, will be appointed as chief executive officer of Primary Care Alberta. Simmonds brings a wealth of public and private sector experience to the role and has extensive experience working with stakeholders across the health care system. She has experience working with clinicians and understands the need for data and evidence-based decision-making when it comes to delivering primary care services to Albertans, no matter where they live. “If primary care is to be the foundation on which the entire health system stands, every Albertan must have an ongoing connection and trusting relationship with a family doctor or health care team. They must belong to a health home where they are known and where they don’t have to tell their health story over and over again. There is much work to do in Alberta to achieve these goals, and I’m eager to get going to help make it happen.” Modernizing Alberta’s Primary Care System (MAPS) In 2022, the Modernizing Alberta’s Primary Care System (MAPS) initiative was launched to recommend ways to strengthen Alberta’s primary health care system. Alberta’s government undertook extensive engagement with its primary care providers and stakeholders to develop a guide to strengthen primary health care in Alberta. The MAPS final report recommended creating a single governance structure that supports an integrated team of health care professionals with data sharing within and across sectors. Improving the coordination and delivery of primary care was also something Alberta’s government heard during provincewide engagement sessions held earlier this year as part of efforts to engage with Albertans and health care professionals on how to refocus the health care system. This made-in-Alberta solution is the first of its kind to be established in a provincial health care system. The agency is a dedicated organization to support governance, oversight, delivery, operation and coordination, a significant step being taken to improve the quality of health care delivery in the province. Quick facts The Provincial Health Agencies Act enables the transition from one regional health authority, Alberta Health Services (AHS), to an integrated system of four sector-based provincial health agencies: primary care, acute care, continuing care, and mental health and addiction. The agencies will be responsible for delivering integrated health services, ensuring Albertans receive timely access to care regardless of where they live. Some of Primary Care Alberta’s longer-term priorities include: Engaging physicians and providing leadership opportunities to lead their peers through the change process. Incentivizing care models that improve health outcomes and patient experience. Providing tools to primary care providers, such as enhancing the current Find a Doctor website and e-Referral, that benefit both providers and patients. Setting standards for primary care so Albertans have consistent services. Funding primary care networks that bring practitioners together to implement provincial initiatives and address regional needs. Developing chronic disease care models to reduce the burden of chronic disease on patients and the health care system. More than 30,000 Albertans have had the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas directly on the refocusing through in-person engagement sessions, online feedback forms and telephone townhalls. In addition to public engagement sessions, dedicated engagements were held with Indigenous communities, the francophone community and other key health partners.

Le gouvernement de l'Alberta prend des mesures pour recentrer le système de santé afin que tous les Albertains puissent être référés, le plus tôt possible, à des prestataires de soins de santé primaires de la plus haute qualité, quel que soit l'endroit où ils pourraient vivre. La nouvelle agence provinciale de soins primaires en Alberta, Primary Care Alberta, crée un système de santé moderne, plus réactif et plus unifié, qui met les patients au premier plan, renforce l'autonomie des professionnels de santé qui sont en première ligne et permet de réduire la pression sur l'ensemble du système de santé. La priorité immédiate de Primary Care Alberta est de garantir à chaque Albertain l'accès à des services de soins primaires de haute qualité dans toutes les régions de la province. Tous les Albertains et leurs familles doivent être soutenus dans leurs besoins quotidiens en matière de santé, à chaque étape de leur vie. La nouvelle agence de soins primaires concentrera tous ses efforts pour créer des équipes plurielles composées de médecins de famille, d’infirmières praticiennes et de pharmaciens, afin d'offrir aux patients les meilleurs soins possibles. ""La création de Primary Care Alberta marque un jalon important dans le recentrage du système de santé qui fait des patients une priorité et fournit à nos experts, qui sont les premiers en contact avec les patients, tout le soutien nécessaire pour s'assurer que les Albertains bénéficient des soins qu'ils méritent."" Kim Simmonds, actuellement sous-ministre adjointe chargée de la planification stratégique et de la performance au sein d'Alberta Health, sera nommée directrice générale de Primary Care Alberta. Riche d'une expérience considérable dans les secteurs public et privé, Simmonds possède également une vaste expérience de collaboration avec les acteurs du système de santé. Elle a travaillé avec des cliniciens et elle comprend le besoin de données fiables et de preuves quand il s'agit de prendre des décisions dans le cadre des soins primaires offerts aux Albertains, quel que soit le lieu où ils résident. ""Pour que les soins primaires constituent la fondation de l'ensemble du système de santé, chaque Albertain doit avoir un lien continu et une relation de confiance avec un médecin de famille ou une équipe de soins. Tous les Albertains doivent appartenir à un centre médical où ils sont bien connus et où ils n'ont pas besoin de répéter constamment leur historique médical. Il y a encore beaucoup à faire en Alberta pour atteindre ces objectifs et et je suis déterminée à contribuer à la concrétisation de ces projets."" Modernisation du système de soins primaires de l'Alberta (MAPS) En 2022, l'initiative de Modernisation du Système de Soins Primaires de l'Alberta (MAPS, the Modernizing Alberta's Primary Care system) a été lancée pour formuler des recommandations visant à renforcer le système de soins de santé primaires en Alberta. Le gouvernement de l'Alberta a conduit de vastes consultations avec ses fournisseurs de soins primaires et tous les acteurs clés afin de développer un guide pour renforcer et améliorer les soins de santé en Alberta. Le rapport final du MAPS recommande de créer une unique structure de gouvernance qui soutiendrait des équipes collaboratives de professionnels de santé par le partage de données, que ce soit au sein d'un secteur ou entre les secteurs. L'amélioration de la coordination et de la prestation des soins primaires a également été une préoccupation soulevée lors des séances de consultation provinciales tenues plus tôt cette année par le gouvernement de l'Alberta, dans le cadre de ses efforts pour engager un dialogue avec les Albertains et les professionnels de la santé sur la manière de recentrer le système de santé. Cette solution - conçue et développée en Alberta - est la première de son genre à être mise en place dans un système de santé provincial. L'agence, dédiée à la gouvernance, à la supervision, à la prestation, au fonctionnement et à la coordination, représente une étape significative pour améliorer la qualité des soins de santé dans la province. Informations clés La Loi sur les agences de santé provinciales permet la transition d'une autorité régionale de santé, Alberta Health Services (AHS), vers un système intégré de quatre agences provinciales sectorielles : soins primaires, soins aigus, soins continus, et santé mentale et dépendances. Les agences seront responsables de la prestation de services de santé pluridisciplinaires, garantissant aux Albertains un accès rapide aux soins, quel que soit leur lieu de résidence. Parmi les priorités à long terme de Primary Care Alberta, on trouve : Impliquer les médecins et leur offrir l'occasion de prendre des initiatives pour guider leurs pairs à travers le processus de changement. Encourager les modèles de soins qui améliorent les résultats en matière de santé et l'expérience des patients. Fournir des outils aux prestataires de soins primaires, tels que l'amélioration des sites web actuels Find a Doctor et e-Referral, ce qui profiterait à la fois aux prestataires et aux patients. Établir des normes pour les soins primaires afin que les Albertains bénéficient de services cohérents. Financer des réseaux de soins primaires qui rassemblent les praticiens pour mettre en œuvre des initiatives provinciales et répondre aux besoins régionaux. Développer des modèles de soins pour les maladies chroniques afin d'en réduire le poids sur les patients et sur le système de santé. Plus de 30 000 Albertains ont eu l'occasion de partager leurs réflexions et leurs idées sur le recentrage, grâce à des réunions en personne, des formulaires en ligne de collecte d'avis, ainsi que des forums téléphoniques. En plus des séances de consultation publique, des consultations spécifiques ont été menées avec les communautés autochtones, la communauté francophone et d'autres partenaires clés du secteur de la santé.

(Eleakis & Elder Photography) California must protect essential health care. That’s where Prop. 35 comes in | Opinion 1 of 2 (Bigstock) With less than a month before Election Day, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California is hard at work to ensure reproductive health care is a fundamental right; to ensure that extreme anti-abortion politicians stay out of elected office; and to restore essential rights that have been stripped from too many over the last two years. Intrinsically connected to that work is our effort to make sure voters understand how important Proposition 35 is for the millions of Planned Parenthood patients served in California — as well as all residents throughout the Golden State. Prop. 35 will address California’s most urgent health care needs by securing dedicated, ongoing funding to protect and expand access to health care without raising taxes on individuals. Specifically, the measure will provide resources for Medi-Cal, the health insurance program that provides coverage for nearly 15 million Californians. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The proposition works by extending an existing levy on health insurance companies that will otherwise expire in 2026. Opinion Because of abysmal funding over the last two decades, it has become increasingly challenging for health care providers to see Medi-Cal patients. In fact, the state has redirected $30 billion in health care funding to non-health care programs over the last 15 years. As a result, providers can no longer take on new patients and keep their doors open; hospitals and clinics are closing or being forced to consolidate services; and patients are waiting months for care. We need to take action to protect essential health care, which is why voters have the chance to weigh in with Prop. 35. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The proposition will help solve California’s health care crisis by extending an existing levy on health insurance companies without raising taxes and dedicate funds to protect and expand access to care for all Californians. The existing levy on health insurance companies would otherwise expire in 2026, but Prop. 35 will permanently extend funding to ensure that Medi-Cal has the resources needed for the patients it serves. When Medicaid reimbursement rates are as low as they are in California, it limits access to care, causing bad health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries, according to the Commonwealth Fund . Because California’s Medicaid (Medi-Cal) beneficiaries are disproportionately people of color, the result of a poorly funded Medi-Cal is that Black, Latino and Asian American Pacific Islander patients have a harder time getting equitable access to care. Prop. 35 will help reduce existing inequities in health care by protecting resources to provide and expand patient access to care within community health clinics like Planned Parenthood, hospitals, emergency rooms, primary care, family planning and mental health services as well as with specialty care providers like oncologists and OB-GYNs. When a Medi-Cal patient comes to a Planned Parenthood health center for an annual wellness visit and there are indications of cervical cancer, it can often take months for an appointment with a specialist to make a treatment plan. Roughly 80% of Planned Parenthood patients are on Medi-Cal — that means that, sadly, this scenario is something we see all too often. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Prop. 35 puts funding directly into specialty care to ensure that the pipeline of specialists able to see Medi-Cal patients broadens. The measure also provides funding to help train more health care workers. A California Health Care Foundation study reported that, despite being the largest racial/ethnic group in the state, Latinos only represent 6% of the state’s physicians. To ensure we are offering culturally competent care across not just community clinics, but all health care settings, we need to provide more opportunities for communities of color to be represented within care teams. Prop. 35 will guarantee that health care dollars are spent as they were intended: on treating patients.

The Brief Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB-525 last year. It gradually phases in pay increases for the state's lowest-paid health workers to $25 over a number of years. The law was initially set to go into effect June 1, but Newsom asked lawmakers for a delay because of state budget concerns. It is expected to cost the state $1.4 billion in the first six months of implementation, according to estimates from earlier this year by the Department of Finance. LOS ANGELES - A minimum wage increase for certain health care workers in California goes into effect Oct. 16. Senate Bill 525 is part of a plan to gradually increase the pay for thousands of health care workers to $25 over the next decade. While it was originally enacted in the fall of 2023 and was slated to take effect June 1, the deadline was delayed by Gov. Gavin Newsom due to concerns over the impact on the California budget. The law is expected to cost the state $1.4 billion in the first six months of implementation, according to estimates from earlier this year by the Department of Finance. Workers of covered health care facilities that provide health care services (including patient care) or provide services supporting the provision of health care are covered. The following facilities are mentioned: Hospitals and Hospital Systems Care in residential settings Physician's groups County mental health facility County correctional facility Mental Health Rehabilitation Centers Outpatient clinics For example, workers at the state's largest health systems, including Adventist, Dignity Health, Sutter, and UC Health will start their pay increases at $23 an hour. SUGGESTED: Prices at California Chipotle, McDonald's and other fast-food chains are rising following minimum wage hike Approximately 426,000 workers are expected to benefit from the law, according to estimates from the UC Berkeley Labor Center. This includes medical assistants, front office staff, medical billing personnel, patient techs, janitors, food service workers, among others. You can see the full list of covered health care facilities by tapping or clicking here. The amount of wage increase depends on the employer/type of health care facility: Hospital or integrated health system with 10,000 or more full-time employees: $23 Dialysis Clinics: $23 Safety Net Hospitals: $18 Intermittent clinics, community clinics, rural health clinics, or urgent care clinics associated with community or rural health clinics: $21 All other covered health care facilities not listed in the other categories and not run by counties: $21 Covered health care facilities run by large counties (more than 5 million people as of Jan. 1, 2023) Covered health care facilities run by medium-sized counties (250,000 to 5 million people as of Jan. 1, 2023) Covered health care facilities run by small counties (less than 250,000 people as of Jan. 1, 2023) While a city or county cannot pass an ordinance setting a higher minimum wage only for health care workers covered by this law, a city or county can have an existing higher general minimum wage or set one for all employees that would apply to employees covered by this law. A local government can also have an existing higher minimum wage or set one specific for a particular group of employees so long as it does not include covered health care facility employees. SUGGESTED: $20 minimum wage goes into effect for California fast food workers The next scheduled increase is set for July 1, 2025. Right now the minimum wage for most people in California is $16 per hour, which is already among the highest in the nation.

Q: Before my husband passed last year, he and I spoke frequently about our health care wishes and decisions. Now that he is gone, I’m worried about who will help me with those decisions if I should become too sick to do it on my own. During a recent hospital stay, my doctor strongly encouraged me to fill out an “advance directive.” What exactly is an advance directive and how might it help me? A: I’m sorry to hear about the loss of your husband. It sounds like the two of you worked together well to be sure each of your health care wishes were expressed. We all have the right to participate in making decisions regarding our healthcare. If you become ill and can’t express your wishes for yourself, advance directives can help. Now is a great time for you to think about doing this since you are well enough to understand your choices and vocalize your decisions. × This page requires Javascript.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Nearly half a million healthcare workers are expecting to get a raise this week, as the state increases the industry's minimum wage. State budget issues delayed the pay boost by several months. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law last year that would gradually phase in pay increases for the lowest-paid health care workers, who will eventually earn $25 an hour. John Logan, SFSU professor of Labor and Employment explained how it works. ""It's creating a minimum wage between $18-$23 per hour for various health care-related workers. And not just medical staff -- (but also) workers such as janitors, groundskeepers and cooks that work in health care facilities,"" Logan said. MORE: How CA's minimum wage hikes for fast food, health care workers could impact economy The wage increases will impact about 426,000 workers. ""My mother had a hip replacement last year. She was cared for by these workers beautifully. But, you know, they don't make much money,"" said Rosanne Chloupek, a Bay Area resident. The minimum wage boost for health care workers was supposed to go into effect June 1, but it was delayed because of budget concerns. Back in April, fast food workers saw their minimum wage increase to $20 per hour. ""Both fast food and health care are very different industries, but employment has been growing in both of these industries, particularly in health care,"" Logan said. MORE: Silicon Valley minimum wage going up in 2024. But will it be enough for high cost of living? Logan says this wage increase will help the health care industry retain and recruit workers. ""It's a way of providing something approaching a living wage for hundreds of thousands of workers that didn't have it before,"" Logan said. Some question what the higher minimum wage will do -- if it will create more jobs, or if it will mean people lose their jobs. ""It's unlikely to result in significant job losses. But it may change job patterns in other ways,"" Logan said. Logan believes that the wage increases -- first for California fast food workers and now health care workers --will definitely pave the way for changes in other industries and in other states.

Amazon's AI for delivery, Microsoft's healthcare agents, and Writer's model: The week in new AI launches Plus, Nvidia said its inaugural AI hubs are coming to Pittsburgh By Britney Nguyen Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Reddit Share to Email Share to Link Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. 1 / 7 Amazon adds AI tech in delivery vans Amazon ( AMZN ) is adding AI-powered tech to delivery vans so delivery drivers can cut down time looking for packages at each stop. The company said this week it is deploying 1,000 electric delivery vans equipped with AI-powered Vision-Assisted Package Retrieval (VAPR) by early 2025. The VAPR tool will automatically show packages for each delivery stop by projecting a green “O” once the van arrives at the address, and project a red “X” on other packages. The device also uses an audio and visual cue to alert the delivery driver when it has found all the packages for the stop. A group within the Amazon Transportation team has been piloting VAPR since 2020. 2 / 7 Microsoft adds AI capabilities to help healthcare workers Microsoft ( MSFT ) announced new healthcare data capabilities and AI models that are focused on healthcare workers this week. The company launched new multimodal medical imaging AI models in its Azure AI Studio, which “enable healthcare organizations to integrate and analyze diverse data types — ranging from medical imaging to genomics and clinical records,” Microsoft said. It also announced a public preview of its healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio, where healthcare workers can build AI agents for tasks such as appointment scheduling and clinical trial matching. And Microsoft shared an update on its collaboration with healthcare organizations, announcing an AI solution for nurses to address documentation tasks so they can “focus less on paperwork and more on their patients.” Microsoft also said it launched new capabilities in its healthcare data solutions AI-powered platform in Microsoft Fabric. 3 / 7 Nvidia’s inaugural AI Tech Community Nvidia ( NVDA ) announced this week that it is launching joint technology centers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of a new initiative called AI Tech Community. Through the “Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI,” faculty, students, and researchers in higher-education will be provided with new tech and “boost innovation in the fields of AI and robotics,” Nvidia said. The Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will explore computational opportunities in the health sciences field, such as applying AI to clinical medicine and biomanufacturing, according to the chipmaker. 4 / 7 Writer’s new model, Palmyra X 004 Writer, an AI startup focused on enterprises, launched a “top-ranking” large language model (LLM) this week called Palmyra X 004 . The model, which will compete with enterprise models from OpenAI and Anthropic, “​​boasts state-of-the-art reasoning through novel training techniques and a suite of powerful new features and capabilities,” the company said. Palmyra X 004 is part of Writer’s enterprise-grade LLM family called Palmyra. The model family can support over 30 languages and multi-modal inputs such as images, audio, and video. “This new model has been benchmarked against models on Berkeley’s Tool Calling Leaderboard and early results show it leads by a significant margin, outperforming model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta ( META ), and Google ( GOOGL ),” Writer said. 5 / 7 AI startup Infactory raises $4 million seed Infactory, a startup building an AI fact-checking platform, announced this week that it raised a $4 million seed round, putting it in the top 1% of seed funding. The funding round, which was led by Bee Partners and included Andreessen Horowitz’s Scout Fund, valued Infactory at $25 million. The platform “combines innovative software with high-quality data to address the accuracy challenges faced by current AI services and hardware products,” according to Infactory. The company aims to license the platform to developers building AI applications, as well as journalists, educators, and consultants. “At Infactory, we’re not just riding the AI hype wave, we are at the forefront of it,” Brooke Hartley Moy, co-founder and chief executive of Infactory, said in a statement. Infactory also counts former Apple ( AAPL ) software engineer Ken Kocienda as co-founder and chief technology officer, and Felipe Abello as co-founder and chief operating officer. 6 / 7 Legal AI startup EvenUp raises $135 million Series D EvenUp, an AI startup focused on personal injury AI and document generation, announced this week that it raised a $135 million Series D funding round , leading to a valuation over $1 billion, per a press release. The round was led by Bain Capital Ventures, and brings EvenUp’s total funding to $235 million. The startup’s Claims Intelligence Platform is powered by its AI model called Piai. The model was “trained on hundreds of thousands of injury cases, millions of medical records and visits, and internal legal expertise,” according to the startup. “At EvenUp, we’re committed to revolutionizing the personal injury sector in the U.S,” Rami Karabibar, EvenUp co-founder and chief executive, told Quartz. “With our Series D, we’re dedicated to driving further innovation by bringing new products and features to market to strengthen our leadership position in legal-focused generative AI.” EvenUp is “fully dedicated to supporting our customers by freeing up their time in routine tasks, allowing them to focus more on what truly matters—their clients,” Karabibar said. The company says over 1,000 law firms have used its platform to claim over $1.5 billion in damages. 7 / 7 Colossyan’s new Instant Avatar feature Colossyan, an AI video platform for workplace learning, released its new Instant Avatar feature that can generate “lifelike” digital representations of users in seconds. The tool uses less than a minute of video footage to generate the avatars. The company is “removing the barriers to producing professional-grade, multilingual video content,” Dominik Mate Kovacs, founder and chief executive of Colossyan, said in a statement. “This advancement opens AI video up to so many new use cases, allowing users to create engaging and personal videos that are both authentic and easily scalable.” The avatars can lip-sync and translate scripts in over 70 languages.

Through new healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio, capabilities for healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, the healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio, and an AI-driven nursing workflow solution, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is supporting healthcare organizations on every step of their journey toward shaping a healthier future. ""We are at an inflection point where AI breakthroughs are fundamentally changing the way we work and live,"" said Joe Petro , corporate vice president, Healthcare and Life Sciences Solutions and Platforms at Microsoft. ""Across the broader healthcare and life sciences industry, these advancements are dramatically enhancing patient care and also rekindling the joy of practicing medicine for clinicians. Microsoft's AI-powered solutions are helping lead these efforts by streamlining workflows, improving data integration, and utilizing AI to deliver better outcomes for healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists, payors, providers, medtech developers, and ultimately the patients they all serve."" Expanding the reach of AI beyond text: healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio Microsoft is announcing the launch of healthcare AI models , a collection of cutting-edge multimodal medical imaging foundation models available in the Azure AI model catalog. Developed in collaboration with partners like Providence and Paige.ai, these models enable healthcare organizations to integrate and analyze diverse data types — ranging from medical imaging to genomics and clinical records. By using these advanced models as a foundation, healthcare organizations can rapidly build, fine-tune and deploy AI solutions tailored to their specific needs, all while minimizing the extensive compute and data requirements typically associated with building multimodal models from scratch. ""The development of foundational AI models in pathology and medical imaging is expected to drive significant advancements in cancer research and diagnostics,"" said Carlo Bifulco , MD, chief medical officer of Providence Genomics and a co-author of the Prov-GigaPath study. ""These models can complement human expertise by providing insights beyond traditional visual interpretation and, as we move toward a more integrated, multimodal approach, will reshape the future of medicine."" Harnessing the power of healthcare data with Microsoft Fabric Historically, healthcare data has been difficult to access due to its unstructured nature and the limitations of existing data management systems. These challenges have limited organizations' ability to gain a comprehensive view of patient experiences and access valuable insights. With the general availability of healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric , healthcare organizations can overcome these barriers by reshaping how users access, manage and act on data with a single, unified AI-powered platform. Additionally, healthcare security application templates for Microsoft Purview, an innovative suite of features designed to help govern healthcare data, are available in public preview. We're also launching new capabilities in public preview within healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric including: Conversational data integration: Send conversational data, such as patient conversations, from DAX Copilot to the Fabric platform. By sending DAX Copilot audio files, transcripts and draft clinical notes to Fabric, customers and partners can leverage various native tools in Azure and Fabric to analyze this data and/or combine it with other data to generate comprehensive insights. Social determinants of health (SDOH) public dataset transformation: Ingest, persist, harmonize and consume SDOH national and international public datasets to enable healthcare organizations to identify risks and health-related social needs to help create equitable healthcare for all patients and communities. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) claim and claim line feed (CCLF) data ingestion: Streamline the ingestion of claims data and harmonize with clinical, imaging and SDOH data to unlock actionable insights on patients and populations. Care management analytics: Leverage unified healthcare data and care management analytical templates to enhance patient care by identifying high-risk individuals, optimizing treatment plans and improving care coordination. Data discovery and cohorting: Utilize an integrated workflow that allows healthcare organizations to create, manage, analyze and share patient cohorts. Building a safe and responsible healthcare agent Healthcare organizations face numerous challenges, including workforce shortages, rising costs and increasing patient care demands. Generative AI offers a potential solution to these challenges by automating administrative tasks, analyzing vast amounts of data for actionable insights and assisting healthcare professionals in decision-making. To address this, Microsoft is announcing the public preview of healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio to build Copilot agents for appointment scheduling, clinical trial matching, patient triaging and more. Organizations can leverage the healthcare agent service to help create connected patient experiences, improve clinical workflows, and empower healthcare professionals while helping organizations meet industry expectations with Microsoft Copilot Studio. Early adopters, like Cleveland Clinic, which provided feedback to help optimize the solution for a healthcare setting, are already using these innovations to enhance patient experiences and improve operational efficiency. Enhancing nursing workflows with AI: nursing early outcomes With the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 predicting a shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, the urgency to deliver technology to support the nursing profession is felt more than ever. Last month at Epic's UGM, we announced the next focus area for our collaboration in Epic Workshop. Today, we're sharing more about how we're actively collaborating with several leading healthcare organizations — including Advocate Health, Baptist Health of Northeast Florida , Duke Health, Intermountain Health Saint Joseph Hospital, Mercy, Northwestern Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Tampa General Hospital — to build an AI solution using ambient technology that addresses nursing documentation by drafting flowsheets for review, allowing nurses to focus less on paperwork and more on their patients. This innovation expands on the company's long-standing strategic collaboration and joint development initiatives with Epic. ""AI is transforming nursing workflows by streamlining administrative tasks, allowing nurses to focus more on patient care,"" said Corey Miller , vice president of R&D at Epic. ""Together with Microsoft, we're using AI-powered ambient voice technology to populate patient assessments. Nurses using the tool are already sharing positive feedback on how it enhances personalized patient interactions."" ""For nurses, the integration of AI-driven solutions into our workflows is a game changer,"" said Terry McDonnell , DNP, ANCP-BC, senior vice president and chief nurse executive, Duke University Health System, vice dean for Clinical Affairs, Duke University School of Nursing , Duke Health. ""It allows us to focus more on patient care rather than the administrative burden of documentation. By automating tedious tasks, Microsoft's ambient AI solution helps alleviate burnout and gives us more time to connect with our patients at the bedside, where we truly make a difference."" Empowering responsible AI practices across healthcare In line with Microsoft's dedication to responsible AI, these new solutions adhere to the company's AI principles established in 2018 to help guide AI development and use. Microsoft remains committed to developing responsible AI by design, ensuring that these technologies positively impact both the healthcare ecosystem and broader society. In practice this means properly building, testing and monitoring systems to avoid undesirable behaviors, such as harmful content, bias, misuse and other unintended risks. Over the years, we have made significant investments in building out the necessary governance structure, policies, tools and processes to uphold these principles and build and deploy AI safely. At Microsoft, we are committed to sharing our learnings on this journey of upholding our Responsible AI principles with our customers.

Home care is very flexible and can be tailored according to a patient's needs, resulting in enhanced health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Many studies demonstrate that home healthcare is efficient and saves millions of dollars each year. Home care managed by skilled health practitioners enhances the patient's health status and prevents them from visiting the emergency department, in-patient facilities, and/or outpatient clinics. In addition, home healthcare is more cost-effective within the Medicare system than other forms of institutional care.

The shortage of skilled nurses in underdeveloped countries makes it difficult for people suffering from multiple health conditions to access and leverage nursing services. This may lead to severe health conditions and lifetime disability. Thus, it is advisable to build a large database of potential candidates and incorporate it into the recruitment process to alleviate difficulties with recruitment planning. Opportunity Technological advancements offer opportunities in the home healthcare market Advanced technologies, such as sophisticated electronic health records, have transformed home health care by streamlining patient information and enhancing diagnosis accuracy and treatment efficacy. In addition to this, they have improved data security and patient privacy by putting in place measures such as encryption and access control.

The amount, which will be injected into the MOH Health Innovation Fund, is separate from the Government’s investments in research and innovation through the Research, Innovation and Enterprise initiative, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, announcing the move. “MOH will identify proven and impactful technology, or use cases, and scale them up into system-wide national projects,” he said, adding that making an impact with technology requires going beyond innovations by individual institutions, and some “centralised push” may be necessary. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 22nd Singapore Health & Biomedical Congress at the Singapore Expo on Oct 10, Mr Ong said the convergence of genomics, AI and a focus on preventive care would have a profound impact on healthcare. And healthcare innovation can reach its fullest potential only when people are protected against major risks, he added. Three healthcare tech initiatives are in the works over the next year or two. By mid-2025, MOH will launch a national genetic testing programme for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a hereditary condition which affects the body’s ability to process cholesterol and increases the risk of heart disease. By the end of that year, automated record updating will also be implemented throughout the public healthcare system. And, if the use of AI in the reading of breast cancer screenings is proven effective, it will be progressively rolled out from end-2025. Noting that AI can help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes and deliver healthcare more efficiently, MOH said it plans to scale up the use of generative AI tools (gen AI) to automate tasks such as documentation and summarising medical records. “We will roll out automated record updating throughout our public healthcare system before the end of 2025, so that healthcare professionals can spend more time caring for patients, and be less occupied with routine tasks,” the ministry said in a statement. It also plans to expand the use of AI for imaging across the healthcare system, enabling earlier detection and follow-up on clinically significant signs. The ministry will work with the Health Promotion Board and the healthcare clusters to study how AI can make the workflow for reading breast cancer screening images more efficient, and give patients their screening results earlier. “If proven effective, from end-2025, we will start progressive roll-out of screening using AI for mammography across the system, with the proper workflows and care pathways in place,” Mr Ong said during the congress, organised by the National Healthcare Group. Public hospitals can access imaging AI models from different vendors via the AimSG platform, which can also monitor the AI models to ensure their accuracy and the safety of patients. More on this topic Precision medicine to be covered by MediShield Life; new law mooted to govern genetic test use Singapore healthcare professionals explore ways to tap AI in patient care During his speech, Mr Ong noted that AI can also be used to deliver predictive preventive care, with disease prediction models including parameters such as health status, lifestyles and socio-economic status. The addition of genetic information can make such models even more powerful, he said. In line with this, by mid-2025, MOH will launch a national genetic testing programme for FH. Under the programme, Healthier SG general practitioner clinics and polyclinics will identify those with abnormally high cholesterol levels and refer them for FH genetic testing at a new Genomic Assessment Centre. Should a patient test positive for the condition, their immediate family members will be encouraged to be tested as well. They will be eligible for means-tested subsidies of up to 70 per cent under the Specialist Outpatient Clinic subsidy framework, while the remaining co-payment can be further reduced by MediSave. Those diagnosed with FH will receive support from Healthier SG clinics to adopt healthier lifestyles and start on subsidised cholesterol-lowering therapies. “This proactive approach aims to significantly reduce the risk of premature heart disease and avoid future cardiovascular complications,” MOH said. A genetic testing programme will help raise awareness of FH and allow for more people to be diagnosed earlier, said Associate Professor Tavintharan Subramaniam, an endocrinologist who leads a national screening and management initiative for the condition based at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Should the programme prove successful, MOH will work on other major severe diseases, such as breast and colon cancers, diabetes, kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks, Mr Ong said, noting that this will require “sophisticated and multi-variate” AI models to be trained. Well-established regulations in healthcare serve as “clinical gatekeeping” and ensure that the judgment of healthcare professionals remains in place even as the sector becomes enhanced by AI, he said. “That said, we cannot swing to the other extreme, hemming ourselves in with regulations and rules, and failing to harness the opportunities of AI. We must be proactive in identifying use cases for AI in healthcare and adapt our rules and regulations to facilitate them,” he added. More on this topic Healthcare AI brings potential and pitfalls in diagnosis by apps Using software to treat a medical condition Mr Ong said that in the coming years, MOH will enhance its information technology systems to drive innovation, while ensuring cyber security and data privacy, beginning with a consolidated electronic medical record system throughout the public healthcare system. Gen AI tools will be integrated into the system to become part of its clinical and operational workflows, he added. Meanwhile a new platform, called Health Empowerment through Advance Learning and Intelligent eXchange , will act as the AI “technology factory” for the healthcare system. Developed by MOH and Synapxe, the cloud-based data infrastructure will enable the secure sharing of up-to-date and anonymised clinical and genomic data, among others, which will be used to train various AI and machine learning tools.

(IONS): Among The Stocks With Biggest Upside Potential According to Hedge Funds Bob Karr October 9, 2024 6 min read IONS We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) stands against the other stocks with biggest upside potential. The US equities saw a strong move after the September jobs report exceeded the economists’ estimates. As per the report, the US economy added 254,000 jobs last month, exceeding the economists’ estimates of 150,000 jobs. As a result of strong job gains, the unemployment rate was pushed lower to 4.1% from 4.2%. The strong jobs report puts rest to the rumors that the US Fed might aggressively lower the rates in a bid to keep the labor market afloat. The apex bank lowered its key benchmark rate last month for the first time in over 4 years by 50 basis points. This led to the current range of 4.75% - 5% from the 23-year high of 5.25% - 5.5%. Several renowned economists believe that the US Fed will decrease the pace of rate cuts. They expect a 25-basis points reduction instead of another half point at its next meeting on 6 -7 November. The September jobs report hints at the underlying health of the labor market, which is healthier than initially expected. This means that the private job creation remains robust. U.S. Equities September 2024- Commentary As per S&P Global, the S&P 500 saw an increase of ~2.02% in September, resulting in a YTD return of ~20.81%. The September month was dominated by the news about inflation remaining under control, and the US Fed delivering a 0.50% rate decrease, with the expectations of two 0.25% decreases expected later in the year. Additionally, Q2 2024 earnings were able to set a record, with more earnings records expected for Q3 2024 and Q4 2024. Notably, even China also contributed at the end of the month, ensuring low-cost U.S. supplies. China needs to continue to do so to achieve its goal of supporting real estate and encouraging consumer spending. Market experts believe that while the September month saw decent momentum in the US equities, October kicked off on a strong note. The release of the strong jobs report was enough to erase the losses on the nervousness over Middle East tensions and port strikes. The Chief Investment Officer at Independent Advisor Alliance believes that the current economic environment is an excellent time to own equities. This optimism stems from the fact that the economy has been expanding, the job market remains solid (if not strong) and the US Fed has not only stopped raising rates but is focused on cutting them. Story Continues After Strong Jobs Report, What Lies Ahead? Market experts opine that the US Federal Reserve decided to go for a soft landing by increasing the interest rates to slow inflation without negatively impacting the labor market to the point of a recession. Charles Schwab believes that investors should not expect a uniform economic recovery. The strength in services hiring continues to offset the weakness in manufacturing. The company highlighted that healthcare and government are the areas that have had strong hiring trends over the past few months. Manufacturing has been witnessing a recession, as hinted by the continued contraction of the ISM manufacturing index. The company believes that rate-sensitive areas, like utilities, financials, and real estate investment trusts (REITs), are expected to deliver strong performance moving forward. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management believes that the US Fed doesn’t have to cut rates aggressively in the upcoming meetings. The investment firm expects that investors should look for value across the whole market, and emphasize quality companies as the market continues to broaden. While the economy has not strengthened for the small-caps, the firm expects that mid-caps provide a good investment opportunity as a soft landing becomes more visible. Our methodology To list 10 Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Hedge Funds, we did extensive research and sifted through online rankings. After compiling a list of 25-30 stocks, we narrowed the list to the ones having the biggest upside potential, as of October 4. Finally, the selected stocks have been ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A scientist in a laboratory making a breakthrough discovery in biotechnology. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IONS ) Average Upside Potential: 62.23% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) discovers and develops RNA-targeted therapeutics in the US. Wall Street analysts believe that Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) continues to advance multiple late-stage candidates focused on potential approval and commercialization. With its proprietary antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology platform, the company remains focused on addressing significant unmet needs in rare diseases and cardiometabolic disorders. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS)’s pipeline has a strong potential, featuring numerous candidates in late-stage development that might reshape treatment paradigms for their respective indications. At the forefront is eplontersen, which is being developed in alliance with AstraZeneca for treating transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR), both in its polyneuropathy (PN) and cardiomyopathy (CM) forms. While the company focuses on investing significantly in R&D to advance its pipeline, it is also progressing toward a more sustainable financial position. Wall Street analysts expect that Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) will reach an EBIT trough in 2024, with several product launches that are planned for 2024-2025 anticipated to drive revenue growth. Its partnership with AstraZeneca offers global distribution capabilities, which might help Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) in maximizing the commercial potential of eplontersen. The company’s revenue increased for Q2 2024 and H1 2024 by 20% and 8% as compared to the same periods last year, respectively. These increases were mainly due to higher R&D revenue reflecting the value Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS)’s pipeline and technology generates. Leerink Partners raised the company’s shares from a “Market perform” rating to an “Outperform” rating, increasing its price objective from $53.00 to $62.00 on 24 th July. Overall IONS ranks 2nd on our list of the top stocks with biggest upside potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of IONS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than IONS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Social Sharing Trans Support N.L.'s Logan St. Croix says the funding is going towards bridging the gap between the medical needs of the transgender community and physicians. (Have a Nice Day Photo/Shutterstock ) An injection of hundreds of thousands of dollars is going toward bridging the gap between the medical needs of transgender people in Newfoundland and Labrador and accessing primary health care, says an organizer. The federal government is committing $571,400 to volunteer-based organization Trans Support N.L. to create a toolkit that will be a resource to improve doctors' treatment of transgender patients. Logan St. Croix, who sits on the board of directors, said it's hard enough getting a family doctor in the province, let alone one who is comfortable with providing transgender patients with appropriate care. ""That is what we're hoping to change here,"" they recently told CBC News. ""We're also going to build this toolkit in a way that really sets everyone up for, you know, creating gender-affirming health-care spaces."" The toolkit will contain medical information about treating transgender patients as well as demystifying myths around what primary health-care entails for transgender people, said St. Croix. It will also be useful for other health-care professionals, like nurses, to ensure they're providing ""equitable care"" for patients and provide the best level of care for their patients. ""We're really hoping this is going to build some good relationships between the trans community and health-care system here in the province,"" they said. St. Croix said the federal funding will primarily go to salaries for project facilitators across the province. ""We want to make sure that we're reaching not just the island, but Labrador as well, to make sure that providers there have that same sort of access to the toolkit, but also the workshop training that will be going along with that."" Primary health-care gap St. Croix said health care for transgender people is a part of primary health care as a whole. ""As a trans person, I have regular primary health-care needs as well, you know, when I have an infection, if I have a cold,"" they said. Some doctors might shy away from providing transgender people with medical care because they don't feel capable of it, which they want the toolkit to address. ""We're hoping this will kind of ease the path to getting more training around."" St. Croix said they consider themselves to be lucky with their primary health-care provider, who is also the primary health-care provider for the majority of transgender people in the province. ""But she's also only one person,"" St. Croix added. This St. John's trans man thought it wasn't possible for him to get pregnant. Then it happened Don't politicize medical care for trans youth, says transgender N.L. man There are transgender people in the province who have gone to their long-standing family doctor for medical care to be told the doctor doesn't know how to provide their specific health-care needs and offered to send them to another doctor, they said. Gaps in research Sevtap Savas, a professor and cancer researcher at Memorial University's medical school, said she was happy to hear this toolkit is in development. While not a member of the transgender community, she said as a cancer researcher she's learned about barriers to health care. ""For example, one transgender individual I know in Newfoundland and Labrador, their family doctor is not trans-friendly,"" she said. That means the patient has to go to walk-in clinics, which she said can discourage people from seeking medical treatment. ""We really have work to do here because nobody would like to increase human suffering,"" said Savas. Sevtap Savas, a professor and cancer researcher at Memorial University, says she's hopeful that medical care for transgender people will be improved. (Mike Moore/CBC) She said one issue she'd like to see addressed through the toolkit is a way of easing the confusion in the medical records when someone has transitioned but their medical records still list the gender assigned at birth. Savas is hopeful that there is interest in improving the health-care system for transgender people. ""I'm very hopeful that things are going to get better."" As a cancer researcher, Savas said she'd like to also see more research into cancer risks for transgender people, adding there currently is no national cancer screening guidelines for this group.

Generate Key Takeaways The News Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence research laboratory and German pharma company BioNTech are both building AI-powered lab assistants to help scientists conduct experiments and perform tasks, the Financial Times reported. It’s the latest example of how developments in artificial intelligence are revolutionizing a number of fields, including medicine. While AI has long been used in radiology, for image analysis , or oncology to classify skin lesions for example, as the technology continues to advance its applications are growing. OpenAI’s GPT models have outperformed humans in making cancer diagnoses based on MRI reports and beat PhD-holders in standardized science tests, to name a few. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement However, as AI’s use in health care expands, some fear the notoriously biased technology could carry negative repercussions for patients. SIGNALS Investors pour money into AI health care startups Sources: Business Insider, Mercer Health care-focused venture capitalists have been particularly keen on investing in startups that use AI, Business Insider reported, with money pouring into AI-related health care startups at twice the rate of the tech sector as a whole since 2019. The US health care system could face shortages of up to 100,000 workers by 2028, consulting company Mercer predicted , and AI could prove a boon to filling certain roles. Most venture investments target companies that use AI for administrative tasks, which one investor described as the “ low-hanging fruit .” Those that offer clinical analysis and diagnostics have had a harder time making it to market in the US, because they require FDA approval — a process that can be long and expensive. AI’s bias problem could have negative implications for health care Sources: Yale School of Medicine, Nature, State of California Department of Justice AI models are notoriously riddled with bias stemming from the data they’re trained on, frequently compounding existing inequality related to race, gender, or sexual orientation — and health care is no exception. For example, some algorithms tend to underestimate the symptoms of racial and patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities, requiring them to be “considerably more ill than their white counterparts” to receive the same care, a Yale School of Medicine article noted. Mitigation and monitoring for bias will be key, a 2023 Nature study suggested. Some US states have taken steps toward tackling the issue — in 2022, California’s Department of Justice began investigating whether algorithms that were used to determine patients’ access to health care displayed a racial bias.

Log In Create Free Account A promise was made to Canadians a half-century ago that governments would make sure that no one would be forced to go without necessary medical care. That promise is the foundation of universal health care in Canada. But that promise is being broken. Six million people – nearly one in seven Canadians – don’t have a family doctor. Of those Canadians fortunate enough to have a primary care physician, nearly a third have trouble getting a timely appointment, according to the Canadian Medical Association. Emergency rooms are packed to overflowing, when they aren’t closed, with wait times soaring. An unhealthy debate This is part of a series on our health-care system, and the challenges in diagnosing and fixing its problems, as explored in The Globe’s Secret Canada project. Data: Lack of clarity is unacceptable Lessons from abroad: Health care, Australian-style Lessons from the past: Jane Philpott’s prescription for change Justice: Defining the duty of care Accountability: What patient power can achieve Wait times are also rising for surgeries. Just 70 per cent of cataract surgeries were performed within the 16-week surgical benchmark last year, down from 83 per cent in 2010, according to data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Only two-thirds of hip replacement surgeries took place by the official deadline of 182 days in 2023, down from 84 per cent. (There might be more examples if Ottawa and the provinces could agree on appropriate benchmarks for procedures such as cancer surgeries.) The health care system cannot be called universal if millions cannot find a family doctor. This country does not have universal health care if routine surgical procedures routinely take far longer than the clinical guidelines. Faced with this problem, the provinces and territories have demanded more cash from Ottawa, while transparently trying to blame the federal government for the deficiencies of the system they run. For its part, the Liberal government has diverted its attention to ill-thought-out initiatives such as a national single-payer drug program, rather than focusing on the glaring deficiencies in the health care system. Money is not the answer. If it were, Canadians would enjoy platinum-level health care service. Per capita health care spending, adjusted for inflation, is 40 per cent higher than in 1993. Has that much higher spending resulted in an improved health care system? The question feels like a cruel joke. Other countries, such as Australia, spend less but get better outcomes for their citizens, a damning indictment of Canada’s health care system. If there is a cause for optimism, it is this: Canadians increasingly see the need for a shakeup. A recent survey from public relations firm Navigator found that 73 per cent of respondents agreed that the health care system needs “major reform,” a 19-point increase since 2022. Yet, that sentiment is not showing up in the actions of politicians. Ottawa is intent on punishing any infractions of the Canada Health Act by the provinces, rather than championing reform. And the provinces, with rare exceptions, are only tinkering around the edges of the system. Why the inaction in the face of such clear, and mounting, problems with Canada’s health care system? Political cowardice is surely part of the answer. But there are also big gaps in the debate over health care that have allowed politicians to avoid action. Gaps in data diminish the debate. As The Globe and Mail reported on Saturday, there are inconsistent measures on even the basic issue of emergency-room waiting times. CIHI could be a national repository of health care benchmarks, but that idea has been stymied by the provinces. The law is part of the problem. The Canada Health Act, in outlining basic principles, fails to even mention the one that is of pressing concern to Canadians: timely access. The reflex to compare Canadian medicare to the inequities of U.S. health care is another factor stultifying debate. And reforms that amount to timid tinkering, rather than transformative proposals that challenge the entrenched interests of the status quo, also contribute to the stasis. All of it adds up to a dire lack of accountability. When politicians fail to deliver on the promise of universal care – and they are failing – there are no consequences. Over the next week, this space will look at how to close those gaps, so that Canadians can finally have an honest and accurate debate over health care. After all, as any doctor knows, before a course of treatment can be prescribed, an accurate diagnosis is first needed."

In the twelfth episode of Sheppard Mullin's Health-e Law Podcast, Ilona Cohen, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Policy Officer of HackerOne, delved into the pressing issue of cybersecurity in the healthcare sector and the pivotal role that ethical hacking may play, with Sheppard Mullin's Phil Kim, Sara Shanti, and Michael Sutton. The Rising Tide of Cyber Threats in Healthcare Cohen provided a fascinating overview of the healthcare cybersecurity landscape, highlighting the dire consequences stemming from data breaches and the real-world impact of such breaches beyond theft of data, which can profoundly affect patient trust. The healthcare industry is increasingly finding itself at the crosshairs of cybercriminals, with data breaches and ransomware attacks becoming disturbingly common and the price tags for addressing and resolving such events continue to rise. Such concerns serve as a harrowing reminder of the vulnerability of healthcare infrastructure and the urgent need for proactive security measures, particularly as attempted data breaches and ransomware attacks will likely only increase in the days ahead. The Case for Ethical Hacking Ethical hacking, as Cohen explained, leverages the craft of highly skilled cybersecurity experts to identify and rectify vulnerabilities within a system, before malicious actors can exploit those vulnerabilities to cause data breaches. HackerOne's success stories, including the notable ""Hack the Pentagon"" program, which amassed reports of over 50,000 vulnerabilities, underscores the potential effectiveness and necessity of such initiatives. However, despite its proven benefits, adoption of these strategies has been slower in the healthcare industry compared to other fields. Cohen contends that overcoming this hesitancy will be critical for the ongoing success of ethical hacking, particular in the healthcare industry. Healthcare Needs More Hackers Ultimately, Cohen champions the idea that the healthcare industry needs more ethical hackers in an effort to help prevent data breaches. The narrative around hacking often conjures images of nefarious activities, but as Cohen highlighted, ethical hackers can be invaluable allies in the fight against cyberattacks. In particular, ethical hackers can offer unique perspectives and skills that significantly enhance the security posture of healthcare entities by exposing vulnerable areas before they can be exploited in a cyberattack. The Bottom Line With cyberattacks increasingly targeting the healthcare industry, there is a desperate need for urgency in addressing cybersecurity and related vulnerabilities. The insights shared by Cohen serve as a wakeup call to the healthcare industry to consider ethical hacking and other innovative cybersecurity measures. Despite the promise of ethical hacking, challenges remain with respect to adoption in the healthcare setting. It will be more important than ever to carefully navigate these hurdles, particularly in the highly regulated healthcare industry. To listen to this episode, click here .

Our Health Care Group explains why health care transactions in the state still face significant headwinds. The vetoed AB 3129 specifically targeted private equity and hedge fund investment in health care deals The existing California Health Care Quality and Affordability Act was also recently amended, and continues to be an obstacle for health care transactions The Office of Health Care Affordability can’t stop a deal from closing, but it can refer the deal to the state attorney general for investigation On September 28, 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill (AB) 3129, which had been passed by the California state legislature on August 31, 2024 and has received significant attention from the health care industry and private investment markets. AB 3129 would have posed a significant obstacle for private equity groups attempting to invest in California health care companies. Instead, Newsom vetoed the bill, stating that the Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) was established in 2022 specifically “to review and evaluate health care consolidation transactions through cost and market impact reviews (CMIR) of mergers, acquisitions, or corporate affiliations involving health plans, hospitals, physician organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other health care entities.” The governor noted that although OHCA does not have the authority to block or disapprove a proposed transaction, it can refer a transaction to the state attorney general, who may further investigate and can use existing authorities to challenge proposed transactions that may limit competition or increase costs in the health care industry. While AB 3129 would have specifically applied to certain private equity and hedge fund transactions in the health care industry, the existing California Health Care Quality and Affordability Act, which was signed into law on June 30, 2022, already requires any health care entities proposing to enter into a material health care transaction in California on or after April 1, 2024 to submit notice to OHCA at least 90 days before closing. OHCA can also extend the timeframes by initiating a CMIR, which can result in a delay of up to several months before the parties can consummate the transaction. Health Care Entities Subject to Material Change Transactions Now Must File Notice Notably, at the same time the California legislature was voting on AB 3129, OHCA was finalizing amendments to its material health care transaction regulations to clarify the application of the law and close certain loopholes. Specifically, the original version of the regulations (finalized December 18, 2023) required only health care entities that were a “party to” a material change transaction to file notice with OHCA. However, the amended regulations , effective August 22, 2024, also require health care entities that are “subject to” a material health care transaction to file notice. This effectively closes the loophole that could have allowed transaction parties to avoid filing simply by creating holding companies above health care entities or otherwise ensuring that the only “parties” to a transaction are not health care entities, even if they have health care entities as subsidiaries. While Newsom appreciated the goals of ensuring California consumers receive affordable and quality health care, he stated that “OHCA was created as the responsible state entity to review proposed health care transactions, and it would be more appropriate for the OHCA to oversee these consolidation issues as it is already doing much of this work.” So while AB 3129 is gone (for now), the complex OHCA material change transaction notice regulations remain intact, now incorporating these recent updates that effectively broaden the scope of their application. Takeaways Although this veto seems like a win for health care investors in California, OHCA’s expanded authority through the regulatory amendments and Newsom’s comments still present a significant challenge to any health care transaction in the state. While the landscape is considerably less restrictive than if AB 3129 had been signed into law, the existing California Health Care Quality and Affordability Act has already complicated health care deals in the state. However, private equity deals can still be done in California. But these challenges underscore the importance of engaging experienced regulatory counsel early in any deal in California to analyze the applicability of the law to the proposed transaction and assist in navigating the preparation, filing, and CMIR process, all while mitigating risks inherent to this relatively new process.

(NASDAQ:MRNS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNS) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Ganaxolone, a GABA_A receptor modulating mechanism intended to treat various forms of epilepsy. Their approved asset, Ztalmy, launched in July 2022 and is an oral suspension formulation of Ganaxolone for Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) – a rare, genetic, pediatric epilepsy syndrome. The company is also developing an IV formulation of Ganaxolone for refractory status epilepticus (RSE), another seizure condition. Marinus shares modestly sold off in March, largely in line with the general biotech market. Unfortunately, in April, the RAISE trial read out negatively and it looks like this asset will not be able to get FDA approval. The company is awaiting the full details of the data and we do not yet know exactly what went wrong in the trial. The company will no longer be allocating capital to the IV formulation and will be focusing on Ztalmy and formulating a go forward plan in the coming months. As a result, we meaningfully reduced our position size.” A biological researcher studying the interaction of GABAA receptors on a computer screen. Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Over the past few years, Nigeria has experienced a sharp increase in the number of healthcare professionals leaving for better opportunities abroad. The reasons are manifold: better pay, improved working conditions, access to advanced technology, and more opportunities for career development. This alarming trend has left many Nigerian hospitals understaffed and overwhelmed, particularly in public health institutions that already struggle with limited resources. The effects of this brain drain are already being felt across the country. Patients are facing longer waiting times, fewer specialists, and declining quality of care. With Nigeria’s healthcare system already burdened by high maternal and infant mortality rates, infectious disease outbreaks, and a growing number of non-communicable diseases, the loss of medical personnel is further exacerbating these challenges. The country’s doctor-to-patient ratio, already dangerously low at 1 doctor for every 5,000 patients, is now even further from the World Health Organization’s recommended ratio of 1 doctor for every 600 patients. The prominent health care provider believes the solution lies in addressing the root causes driving medical professionals away. He emphasised the need for improved working conditions, competitive salaries and better medical infrastructure. Many Nigerian healthcare workers feel disillusioned by the lack of equipment, poor facilities and insufficient funding for research and professional development, which often drives them to seek better opportunities abroad. “Our healthcare workers are some of the best trained in the world, but they are not being given the tools and resources they need to succeed here in Nigeria,” Haroun lamented. He called on the government to implement incentive programs that would encourage medical professionals to remain in the country. Nigeria, UK Foreign Ministers meet to deepen bilateral relations ‘Nigeria, others need $700b yearly investment to avert energy crisis’ UN, EU pledge support for improved human rights protection in Nigeria These incentives could include housing benefits, tax breaks and opportunities for continued education and specialisation. In addition to financial incentives, Haroun highlighted the importance of creating a more supportive work environment, where healthcare workers feel valued and respected for their contributions.

If we can address the factors driving them away, we will not only prevent their emigration but also attract those who have already left to return and contribute to the growth of our healthcare system,” he emphasised. Haroun, popularly known as Dr. Love on social media, is a distinguished healthcare professional with a wealth of experience in both clinical practice and healthcare administration. He holds a First Class Honors MBA in Healthcare Administration from Franklin University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. Further enhancing his expertise, he earned a certification in General Psychiatric Management (GPM) for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from the prestigious Harvard Medical School. Haroun’s medical foundation is rooted in his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from Lagos State University College of Medicine, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria. This strong educational background has equipped him with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare systems. From 2015 to 2017, Haroun worked as a licensed medical professional in Saudi Arabia, where he gained invaluable international experience in a diverse healthcare environment. This global perspective shaped his approach to healthcare delivery, prompting his subsequent move to the USA to pursue advanced postgraduate studies and further his professional development. In addition to his clinical and administrative expertise, Haroun is the CEO and founder of Love for Health Organization, a global healthcare initiative dedicated to improving access to quality healthcare, particularly for underserved communities around the world. Under his leadership, the organization continues to impact global health outcomes by addressing critical healthcare disparities and promoting sustainable solutions.

With industrywide workplace challenges ranging from emotional exhaustion to violence on the rise, it could prove a welcome effort for Georgia nurses, doctors and others who have struggled since the pandemic . The joint effort’s “groundbreaking” new program , “Art for Healers,” is still in the works, but promises to be a major boon for health care workers and artists alike. The program will incorporate art therapy — a science-backed practice with proven research on its benefits. Explore Researchers study how arts therapy can benefit health care workers “We’re going to move these types of creative programs to the next level,” Northside’s vice president of marketing, Lee Echols, said in a news release. “By introducing health care providers to artists in an artistic setting, we hope to open a new window of relief and revival for them. The collaboration of two industries hit hard by the pandemic — health care and creative arts — has the potential to make a huge impact on both.” The program’s requirements and specific details are still being finalized, but its launch is anticipated to coincide with the opening of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia’s new Atlanta facility over the next year. “MOCA GA has always focused on nurturing a thriving community where everyone has access to art and to artists,” Annette Cone-Skelton, the museum’s co-founder, president, CEO and director, said in a news release. “With Northside Hospital’s vision and support, we’ll build a dynamic program that will center art as an essential element to inspire the entire health care community to create and commune in new, meaningful ways.” Explore Try art therapy for a creative way to manage stress, depression and more The efficacy of art therapy for health care workers has been explored by researchers, finding the practice may be an effective tool against burnout. A University of Colorado research group has been putting their nearly two decades of field experience to the test on the subject through their Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab . Through six 12-week cohort studies, the researchers discovered “eye-opening” results. Participants — ranging from doctors, nurses, social workers and therapists to other researchers — experienced less burnout and had less desire to leave their health care jobs after receiving treatments. They scored lower for anxiety (28%), depression (36%), PTSD (26%) and emotional exhaustion (12%). “As physicians who have worked in critical care and emergency medicine for many years, we think that this incorporation of creativity in health care is vital,” University of Colorado professor of medicine Marc Moss and CORAL program manager Rafaela Mantelli told the Conversation . “The nation’s health depends on the well-being of the health care workforce. We believe that incorporating creativity and the arts as a tool for building resiliency in health care workers could help shift the culture of emotional isolation that health care workers live in.” Burnout has been a long-standing issue in the health care industry, but it has been significantly magnified by the pandemic. It led the International Council of Nurses to name the world’s nurse shortage a “global health emergency” last year. And Georgia remains one of the states most in need of nurses . A survey of nurses in New York and Illinois showed 7,887 RNs left their jobs between 2018 and 2021 because of retirement, burnout, emotional exhaustion or insufficient staffing. And, according to a three-year assessment from the American Nurses Foundation featuring more than 12,000 nurse respondents completed in 2022, burnout and workplace violence remain key issues. “These data sets reveal nurses need much more support than they are getting from their leadership and employers,” American Nurses Foundation executive director Kate Judge said in a news release . “The insights we’ve gleaned from Millennial and GenZ nurse respondents, as well as nurses of color, demonstrate that employers must dramatically shift their approach to supporting nurses, taking into account that different demographics of nursing have unique needs. Nurses leaving the profession, leaving acute care, and being burned out puts our health as a nation at risk.” Find more stories like this one on our Pulse Facebook page .

Alora Pharmaceuticals, LLC, the largest U.S. manufacturer of methylphenidate medications, 1 recognizes that ADHD impacts various aspects of daily life, from school to work to personal time. This month, let's all commit to increasing awareness and understanding of ADHD while fostering a more supportive environment. ADHD is among the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders in children and can be a lifelong disorder, with symptoms emerging in childhood and persisting into adulthood. Recognizing the signs of ADHD is an important step in obtaining a diagnosis. 2 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 10.2% of children in the U.S., ages 3 to 17, have been diagnosed with ADHD. 3 According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the percentage of adults with ADHD is estimated to be around 4-5%. 4 These statistics indicate that millions of children and adults in the U.S. are living with this condition. Medication, along with behavioral therapy, is often used in ADHD treatment. 2 Stimulants, like RELEXXII ®, are fast-acting and among the most well-known and frequently utilized medications for ADHD. The CDC states that 70-80% of children with ADHD experience a reduction in symptoms when using stimulant medications. 5 ""Raising awareness about ADHD is vital in breaking down barriers and fostering understanding. Accurate diagnosis and effective management are crucial for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. At Alora Pharmaceuticals, we strive to provide the resources and support needed to empower individuals with ADHD to reach their full potential,"" stated Shannon Faught , CCO of Alora Pharmaceuticals.

This contrasts with the sluggish performance of financial services, retail, and hi-tech, which have faced headwinds for nearly two years. ETtech The healthcare business of India’s IT companies has been silently spearheading the $250 billion industry's growth, being a bright spot at a time when key verticals such as financial services, retail and hi-tech have been under pressure for almost two years now. Digital transformation in the healthcare sector is driving this business for IT firms, analysts said. These are mostly small and medium deals, but the volume is high, and unlike in other verticals, the deal activity has not seen the post-Covid spike or the slowdown that followed. “The healthcare tech services market is disconnected from the commercial market like banking,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive at consulting and research firm Everest Group. “It is more closely related to the government services market. Healthcare is significantly funded by government spending which has kept increasing.” ETtech At IT market leader Tata Consultancy Services , the life sciences and healthcare vertical’s contribution to total revenue grew 2 percentage points in the past two years, partly offsetting the impact from a slowdown in the BFSI (banking financial services and insurance) segment. Its nearest rival, Infosys , too is posting strong growth in the vertical serving the life sciences sector. As per the company’s annual report for fiscal 2024, the share of life sciences in its total business grew the fastest after manufacturing. The contribution of financial services, meanwhile fell to 27.4% from 29.8% in FY23. Infosys has ambitions to take its life sciences revenue to $2 billion in the next three years from the current $700 million, HFS Research chief executive Phil Fersht told ET recently. Wipro reported a strong 7.2% year-on-year expansion in its health vertical revenue in the first quarter of FY25. In fact, it was the only vertical among the seven of the Bengaluru firm that posted growth. Healthcare tech services spending did not see the kind of acceleration that most markets had seen during Covid, said Everest Group’s Bendor-Samuel, adding: “…and they are not getting the impact of the post-Covid pullback that other sectors have experienced.” Pareekh Jain, chief executive of EIIRTrend, an engineering insight platform, said healthcare has not just been one of the fastest growing verticals in IT services but also among engineering services in the last few quarters. In engineering services, healthcare grew more than 17% y-o-y in the last two quarters. Explaining why billion-dollar deals are a rarity in the healthcare vertical, he said: “The priority here is digital transformation, so the growth is driven by a large number of small to medium size deals.” According to Bendor-Samuel, the healthcare sector is not experiencing the same need to restructuring which other sectors are required, and hence billion-dollar deals are very few. Not just the large IT firms, even smaller companies are seeing strong tailwinds in their healthcare verticals. At Persistent Systems , the healthcare practice today is slightly shy of $100 million a quarter and it has grown more than 50% year on year. Sonata Software recently said as part of its strategic five-year plan to achieve $1.5 billion in annual revenue, it has made targeted investments in the healthcare & life sciences vertical, making it one of the firm's fastest-growing business units. Another IT firm, Coforge , said the recent acquisition of Cigniti will help the company get three new verticals including healthcare in its business.

Flynn says representatives from all 23 PCC health sciences programs will be at the fair, discussing curricula, career options and special admission requirements.

It will offer the community an opportunity to see firsthand the different types of health care professionals PCC trains and how they collaborate with one another to provide exceptional patient care,"" says Flynn. There is no cost to attend the fair, and pre-registration is not required. Parking is also free and will be available outside the William E. Fulford Building. The event will take place in the Craig F. Goess Student Center’s Davenport Multipurpose Room and PCC’s Fulford and Herman Simon buildings.
