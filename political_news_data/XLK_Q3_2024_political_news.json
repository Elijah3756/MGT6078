Google: everything we learned in Fortnite court See all Stories Posted Sep 30, 2024 at 12:01 PM UTC S Quote Sean Hollister Tim Sweeney says his Epic lawsuits are all about freeing the youth: We want our kids to grow up in a world that’s better than this one. I grew up in an awesome world for developers and opportunity, the early days of Apple II computers and PCs, and anybody growing up, coming of age in this industry right now, is best case going to be an Apple and Google serf. That has to change. That must change. Not surprising to hear the man behind “Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite” say this, but it really does encapsulate his war with the tech industry.

    "article_text": "Beijing has been rather quiet as TikTok, the first globally successful app born from its domestic tech sector, fights for its life in the U.S. The debate over whether Washington will ban TikTok due to perceived national security concerns related to the Beijing base of its parent company, ByteDance, has simmered for years. In the past, Chinese officials haven’t shied from harsh rhetoric voicing opposition. But now, as a ban seems more likely than ever to take hold, Beijing is holding its cards close to the chest. In the months since legislation that would force TikTok to divest from ByteDance has made its way through Congress and now the courts, spokespeople for China’s Foreign Ministry have demurred requests for comment, referring to previous remarks. (Namely, a March statement from commerce officials that China will resolutely \"safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”)"

TOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Sep 30, 2024, 06:55 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large At Carnegie Mellon University, Google CEO Sundar Pichai discussed AI's transformative potential and the role of failure in tech development. He emphasized that ambitious projects attract top talent and can result in valuable innovations, even if they fail. Pichai humorously addressed questions generated by AI chatbots, noting a mix-up by Microsoft Copilot. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sees immense potential in AI, viewing it as a transformative technology with the power to revolutionise various aspects of life, however, he also acknowledged that failure is an inevitable part of the process when it comes to developing ambitious technology like AI. He has spoken about this publicly, most recently in a talk at an event at Carnegie Mellon University . Farnam Jahanian, the president of Carnegie Mellon University, used AI chatbots like Google Gemini, Perplexity AI and Microsoft Copilot to generate questions for a hypothetical elevator encounter with Pichai. Jahanian particularly emphasised on questions by Microsoft Copilot: You could inquire, \"Could each of you please explain why consumers wouldn't benefit if we were to vote to break up Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon?\" To address Google's practices, ask Sundar Pichai, \"How is it fair for Google to aggressively promote its own products alongside third-party products? Is this a level playing field for sellers?\" CMU President's Lecture Series with Sundar Pichai What was Google CEO’s response Jahanian highlighted that in the first question, saying, “Microsoft is notably missing here, by the way, but this is all for good humour”. When he was clarifying that the second question was “really what we got,” Pichai quipped saying the Microsoft Copilot AI may have confused Google with some other company. “And the second one it's confused about us and some other company, but I leave it up there,” Pichai said. “Great rebuttal,” Jahanian replied. Google CEO on failures in tech Pichai also said that failures are a part of the tech industry and that unsuccessful ventures can yield valuable innovations and attract top talent. “In tech, I think failures are an important part of your journey. When you want to work on really ambitious things, first of all, no one else is working on it, so you tend to have less competition,” Pichai responded to a question on “failure in the tech industry and how does he encourage his team to take risks.” “It attracts the best people in the world... even if you fail in accomplishing what you set out to do, whatever you created in the process will still be incredibly valuable,” he added.

Google employees are known as 'Googlers,' Meta's workforce is called 'Metamates,' and Amazon staff are termed 'Amazonians.' Microsoft employees go by 'Softies' and Nvidia's team is referred to as 'Nvidians.' These names contribute to company culture and values. The use of nicknames, for example at schools, creates a sense of shared identity. In India, students at St. Stephen's College are known as \"Stephanians,\" while those at St. Xavier's School are called \"Xaverians.\" This culture extends beyond educational institutions and into the corporate world where tech companies have given their employees distinctive nicknames that foster a sense of belonging. From \" Googlers \" at Google to \" Metamates \" at Meta, these monikers have become part of the company culture. According to a report by Business Insider, comedian John Mulaney recently poked fun at the tech industry's love for corporate jargon in his set he performed for Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference earlier this month. Let's take a closer look at some of the popular nicknames used in the tech industry. Workers at Google are called “Googlers” Probably the most common nickname that even kids may know is ‘Googler’. At Google, employees are known as “Googlers,” with newcomers called “Nooglers” and alumni becoming “Xooglers.” Amazon workforce are “Amazonians” This isn’t very hard to guess. While some probably know it from the movie Wonder Woman, before the word became ‘popular’, Amazon was already calling its workforce as “Amazonians.” Amazon takes a cue from its namesake river. “Metamates” at Meta Following Facebook's transformation into Meta in 2021, employees who were previously called “Facebookers” transitioned to “Metamates”. According to the company's culture page, Metamates “have a sense of responsibility for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It's about taking care of our company and each other.” Microsoft’s “Softies” Microsoft employees have been known to call themselves “Microsofties” or simply “Softies,” – if the word is a bit too hard for you. The name became common when the company in 2020 published a blog post about the “life of a Microsoftie”, as per the publication. Nvidia has a workforce known as “Nvidians” At Nvidia, the chipmaker led by Jensen Huang, employees are called “Nvidians,” a nod to the company's name, which is derived from the Latin word for “envy.” Apple has “Geniuses” Apple, despite its strong brand identity, doesn't seem to have a widely recognised nickname for its corporate employees. While there is no particular nickname, its retail staff are famously known as “Geniuses.” Twitter and Anthropic Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, workers have embraced the nickname “Ants”. Before Elon Musk's takeover and rebranding of Twitter to X, employees were commonly called “Tweeps.” About the Author TOI Tech Desk The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

This funding round is expected to raise as much as $6.5 billion. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion into OpenAI, is expected to add another $1 billion in this round. Ayushi Jain 28-Sep-2024 Apple has reportedly pulled out of discussions to join OpenAI’s upcoming funding round, which aims to raise as much as $6.5 billion. This unexpected move comes just before the round is set to close next week. Apple’s participation would have marked a notable investment from the iPhone maker in another major company, sparking interest among industry watchers. Survey ✅ Thank you for completing the survey! According to a source familiar with the situation, Apple recently dropped out of the talks, despite initial plans to be involved, reports The Wall Street Journal. The funding round, led by venture capital firm Thrive Capital, has attracted other big names in the tech industry. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion into OpenAI, is expected to add another $1 billion in this round. Nvidia, known for its AI and graphics processing technology, has also been in talks to join. Add As A Trusted Source For Google. Add as a preferred source on Google Also read: Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft in talks to invest in OpenAI Besides Microsoft, investment firms like Tiger Global Management and MGX, a company backed by the United Arab Emirates, are also considering participating in the round. Thrive Capital is expected to contribute around $1 billion. However, it’s important to note that it’s possible that participants and their investment amounts could change before the round closes. Some investors may adjust their contributions or pull out entirely, much like Apple has done. Also read: “When actual regulation is on the table, he opposes it”: Ex-OpenAI researcher claims Sam Altman doesn’t support AI regulation OpenAI, the company behind the popular AI tool ChatGPT, is also undergoing a significant corporate transformation. Originally structured as a nonprofit, OpenAI is transitioning to a for-profit company. This change, which was encouraged by many of the investors in the funding round, adds complexity to the process. If OpenAI fails to complete the transformation within two years, investors from this round can request their money back. While Apple’s exit from these talks may raise questions, other tech giants seem to remain committed to supporting OpenAI’s future growth, as AI continues to play a crucial role in shaping the tech industry.

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Google Trial Ends, Execs Emboldened To Speak Outside Courtroom by Laurie Sullivan , September 27, 2024 The Google and Department of Justice (DOJ) trial wrapped up this week, as both attempted to prove several things ahead of closing arguments scheduled for November, just before Thanksgiving. There were expected and unexpected consquences from the trial. The expected began with the DOJ alleging Google engages in anticompetitive behavior and monopolistic practices in three markets of the ad-technology sector connected to “open web display advertising” -- publisher ad servers, advertiser ad networks, and ad exchanges. It rested the case after weeks of sharing hours of expert testimony and introducing into evidence endless quotable emails from Google executives describing their views on the company’s position in the advertising ecosystem. \"We'll be able to crush the other networks and that's our goal,\" said David Rosenblatt, Google's former president of display advertising, describing the company's strategy. The notes were cited in court. advertisement advertisement Google argued that it faces plenty of competition and its business decisions, which the DOJ has characterized as anticompetitive, are intended to create a safer ecosystem for its users -- competition from other companies Microsoft Advertising and increasingly from TikTok and other tech companies building an ad business like The Trade Desk. Then, as the trial ended, the unexpected happen. Executives began willingly speaking out and sharing their views on a variety of companies they beleive to have followed in Google's steps. Lotame Founder Andy Monfried shared an interesting point on X, identifying a \"weird evolution\" in the ad-tech industry. He said that during the past decade Trade Desk executives have positioned the company as the alternative or \"the good guys\" when it comes to building a business and delivering value for brands and agencies, in programmatic ad technology -- specifically as an alternative to Google. \"I applaud them,\" he wrote. \"They built a tremendous company, and have been incredible entrepreneurs, operators, and marketers. Perhaps the best in our ecosystem of Advertising Technology. It is no small feat.\" A core thesis, while building an empire, has been for The Trade Desk to tout they are the \"anti-Google\" -- meaning the \"good guys\" that will do things differently, and always defer to the ethical and transparent way of doing business on behalf of clients, Monfried wrote. Unfortunately, Monfried wrote, \"they became what they preached\" and eventually became the \"new industry bully.\" Monfried called The Trade Desk the \"new Google\" that has begun to throw its \"muscle and weight around in a manner that hurts competition, negatively impacts the market\" in an to own the chain of events around addressability, enrichment and connectivity. \"I just hope they realize that their ascent to the most dominant player in our industry comes with a realization that Google never had,\" he wrote. \" A rising tide lifts many boats (when you become the biggest) -- and not simply, 'lets crush and own the entire data and media' chain of programmatic advertising.\" An executive at The Trade Desk said the company strictly serves advertisers, not all sides of the ad supply chain. \"Such characterizations don’t reflect The Trade Desk’s mission or business,\" Melinda Zurich, GM of communications at the company, told MediaPost. \"The Trade Desk has long stood for supply path integrity and a level playing field for our advertiser clients. Those principles, plus our commitment to never own media, will always underpin our business.\" ad exchange , ad network , ad serving , ad technology , advertising , digital , display , google , legal , media buying , programmatic Comment Next story loading advertisement More from MediaDailyNews Cox Presses SCOTUS To Throw Out Piracy Verdict Roblox Expands Creator Access To IP-Licensed Game Creation Meta's AI Goal: Commits To Spending $600B On U.S. Projects By 2028 Amazon Fights Prime Video User Bid To Revive Privacy Suit Amazon Reboots Ads System, Agents For Advertising SPONSOR CONTENT Join QSR Marketers in Santa Barbara!

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST TOKYO: Beijing has been rather quiet as TikTok, the first globally successful app born from its domestic tech sector, fights for its life in the US . The debate over whether Washington will ban TikTok due to perceived national security concerns related to the Beijing base of its parent company, ByteDance, has simmered for years. In the past, Chinese officials haven’t shied from harsh rhetoric voicing opposition. But now, as a ban seems more likely than ever to take hold, Beijing is holding its cards close to the chest. In the months since legislation that would force TikTok to divest from ByteDance has made its way through Congress and now the courts, spokespeople for China’s foreign ministry have demurred requests for comment, referring to previous remarks. Namely, a March statement from commerce officials that China will resolutely “safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” But it would be premature to interpret the recent silence as any sort of indication that Beijing will take this lying down. United States firms with exposure to the world’s second-largest economy, from Apple to Tesla, should brace for collateral blows if a tit-for-tat escalates. And policymakers would be unwise to underestimate the might Beijing may deploy in response to what it has previously decried as unfair “bullying”. A high-stakes DC Circuit Court hearing last week did not go well for TikTok. The odds of it halting a ban plunged from 70 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. And if it fails to win this court battle, the likelihood of undoing that loss is 10 per cent. CHINA WOULD NEVER ALLOW FORCED SALE OF TIKTOK While government spokespeople have shown restraint, Chinese state-backed news outlets offered a window into official thought. Shortly after the Senate passed the ban legislation, the China Daily ran an editorial warning: “The century of humiliation won’t be repeated over TikTok.” It indicated that Beijing views the US attacks on the popular app as in line with an historical pattern of Western exploitation, dating back to when British armies forced Chinese people to buy opium. It warned that attempts to impose coercion and subordination will fail. Separate editorials in other outlets similarly accuse the US of trying to “plunder” ByteDance. Even policymakers on the US-China Commission can’t seem to grasp that Beijing, and ByteDance, would never allow a forced sale of its crown jewel algorithm to a foreign buyer. China tweaked its export laws in 2020 to safeguard “national security and interests,” a move widely interpreted as a response to the first talks of a ban emerging. TikTok’s recommendation engine, which drives individualised content to users’ feeds to keep them scrolling and engaged, has long been cited as the secret sauce of the app’s success over rivals. Related: Commentary: Time is running out for TikTok in the US Commentary: The true victims of China’s foreign adoption ban? The children Some commentators argue that it won’t make sense - especially given the current macroeconomic woes - for Beijing to retaliate with sanctions or further policy signals that would discourage foreign investment amid a decades-low plunge. They claim blocking a sale would hurt ByteDance’s global investors. Yet this fails to acknowledge that Beijing has knee-capped its own tech sector in favour of broader policy goals with a brutal crackdown that has only recently eased. If the past few years have revealed anything about government priorities, it’s that investor returns and fast growth in the tech sector are no longer on top. President Xi Jinping’s mantra of “common prosperity” and high-quality innovation that strengthens its tech independence has taken its place. The US knows the game it’s playing with TikTok is unevenly weighted due to its own place in the global tech hierarchy, but this can also be a double-edged sword. As much as China risks turning away foreign investment by blocking a sale, it would be a win to broadcast to the world that any venture to make it in the lucrative US market isn’t safe. BEIJING MAY BE WISE NOT TO SAY MUCH Chinese officials may also be quietly considering options as they await the outcome of the presidential election. While Donald Trump kicked off this whole saga during his time in office, as a candidate he has since signalled that he would be against an outright TikTok ban because it would boost competitor Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Lawmakers have been quick to fill the space left by Beijing’s silence. They are furiously defending the constitutional right of free speech, while trying to silence a platform that more than 170 million Americans use to express themselves. TikTok is painted as a national security threat, but not only has commander-in-chief Joe Biden’s team joined, it has become a major campaign tool for both presidential frontrunners. The coconut tree memes and “brat” vibes propelling Kamala Harris’ popularity in the polls originated on the app. Related: Commentary: Kamala Harris is being called ‘brat’. What the sigma? Commentary: US law that could ban TikTok has a logic problem It’s ironic that the US is employing an undemocratic process to ban the app in the name of preserving its democracy. Around half of Americans use TikTok. Less than a third support a ban. Seven million US businesses are on TikTok. The supposed smoking-gun evidence that it is a real threat remains classified, kept from the eyes of not just the American public but TikTok’s own lawyers. The ban legislation was fast-tracked through Congress, attached to a foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. Lawmakers worried about social media security risks should instead pass comprehensive laws to protect Americans’ data and safeguard users from threats across all apps. Banning TikTok under these circumstances only gives China’s well-oiled propaganda machine the ultimate ammunition. Maybe Beijing is wise not to say much. America’s actions speak for itself.

    "article_text": "In recent years, universities worldwide have experienced a surge in the number of students choosing their computing programs. This situation is unsurprising, considering the growing demand for tech-savvy professionals in an increasingly digital world. However, it has brought to light significant challenges for higher education institutions. They must now grapple with the delicate balance of meeting the demands of the job market while maintaining the integrity of a well-rounded education. The rapid increase in computing majors, particularly at prestigious institutions like Stanford and MIT, signals a societal shift towards valuing technical skills over a broader educational mission. This phenomenon, often called the “STEM-ification” of society, underscores a prioritisation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at the expense of the humanities and social sciences. The implications of this trend are multifaceted. On the one hand, the surge in computing graduates is a response to the high demand for tech professionals, driven by the rapid pace of technological advancement and the lucrative job opportunities in the tech industry. For instance, 18% of Stanford University seniors graduated with a computing degree. This proportion has more than doubled in the past decade. Over the same period, at MIT, the rate of computing graduates increased from 23% to 42%. Students are drawn by the promise of high salaries and job security in a field that shows no signs of slowing down. However, this emphasis on computing and other STEM fields raises concerns about the potential marginalisation of the humanities and social sciences. A well-rounded education is crucial for developing critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and cultural awareness—indispensable professional skills, especially in the tech industry where ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity are increasingly important. Integrating technical skills with broader intellectual development can produce well-rounded professionals proficient in their fields, capable of thinking critically and ethically about the implications of their work. Interdisciplinary programs that combine computing with the humanities and social sciences offer a promising solution. For instance, some universities have introduced programs allowing students to major in computing while taking courses in philosophy, sociology, or history. These programs, such as Stanford’s ‘Computing and Society’ or MIT’s ‘Computing, Culture, and Society ‘, aim to produce graduates who understand the broader societal implications of their work, equipping them with the tools to navigate the ethical and cultural challenges they may encounter in their careers. In response to the changing demands of the job market, many companies are now focusing on candidates’ competencies rather than their formal education. Initiatives like Google Career Certificates exemplify this shift. These certificates offer an alternative pathway to tech careers by providing job-ready skills through short, intensive programs. Unlike traditional university degrees, which can take several years to complete, these certificates can be earned in months. They focus on practical skills directly applicable to the job market, such as IT support, data analysis, project management, and user experience design. These certificates provide a quick and accessible route to employment for individuals who may not have the time or resources to pursue a traditional degree. They address the immediate needs of the job market by equipping individuals with the skills employers are looking for. However, this trend also raises questions about the long-term value of such programs compared to a comprehensive university education. As companies increasingly focus on candidates’ competencies rather than their formal education, the value of traditional degrees may be challenged. While these certificates provide a quicker path to employment, they offer a different level of knowledge and critical thinking skills than a traditional degree. Universities must adapt to this new landscape by ensuring that their programs remain relevant and by offering more flexible and diverse pathways to education. This could involve revising curricula to integrate technical skills with broader intellectual development and promoting interdisciplinary programs that combine computing degrees with the humanities or social sciences. Moreover, collaboration between academia and industry is crucial. By working together, universities and tech companies can ensure that curricula stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and that graduates are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the job market. This partnership can also provide students with valuable internships and real-world experience opportunities, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The challenge for universities is to find a balance between meeting the demands of the job market and providing a comprehensive education. The rise of computing programs and initiatives like Career Certificates reflects the changing landscape of higher education and the job market. However, ensuring that students receive a balanced education that integrates technical skills with broader intellectual development is crucial. By collaborating with industry and promoting interdisciplinary programs, universities can prepare students to navigate the complexities of the modern world and ensure they are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in their careers. The future of higher education depends on its ability to adapt to these challenges and innovate in ways that meet the needs of both students and the job market."

    "article_text": "Representative image A tech-savvy Indian couple in Canada recently shared insights on their impressive earnings and offered advice on how others in the tech industry can achieve similar income levels. The couple was interviewed by Piyush Monga, the founder of the Instagram channel Salary Scale, during a vox pop in Toronto. High Income in Tech Roles The couple, both tech professionals, revealed their annual earnings—CAD$100,000 each, amounting to a combined family income of CAD$200,000 (roughly ₹1.2 crore). The husband works as a programmer, while the wife is employed in a support role. Upskilling Recommendations When asked how others could earn similar amounts, the husband suggested pursuing technical certifications. “You can go for a technical certification, like Hadoop certification or Cloud Certification,” he said. For those interested in management roles, he recommended the Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) certifications, adding that PMP can significantly boost career prospects. The wife echoed his sentiment, agreeing that PMP certification is valuable. However, Monga questioned whether PMP retains its value in today’s job market, considering its widespread availability, and asked if certifications like Cloud might be more lucrative. Relevance of Certifications in Different Domains The husband emphasized that the relevance of certifications depends on the domain. “For example, there are domains where if you have a cloud certification, you will get the job easily,” he explained. He added that cybersecurity certifications also hold significant value, highlighting the importance of domain-specific skills in the IT sector. Live Events He disagreed with Monga’s suggestion that PMP is losing value, stating, “There has to be someone to manage the team, right,” underscoring the continuing need for project management skills in the tech industry. The couple’s insights highlight the importance of continuous upskilling and adapting to domain-specific demands in the tech industry to achieve high earning potential.

The Karnataka capital's dominance in the high-tech industry is the major reason behind the growth of the GCCs, as per the report, which added that Bangalore has about 37 per cent of GCC talent. Professional Services, which includes BFSI and consulting companies, follow with 21 per cent of the headcount. The manufacturing sector in Bengaluru is also emerging as a significant player, contributing 10 per cent to the total headcount, with automotive and electronics manufacturing leading this growth. The findings also showed Hyderabad accounting for 14 per cent of TeamLease Digital's client base. The city excels in the high-tech industry, which contributes 45 per cent to the GCC headcount. Hyderabad's GCCs are at the cutting edge of digital transformation, leveraging advancements in cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, and data analytics to enhance global operations. The focus on automation and emerging technologies like robotics and blockchain underlines Hyderabad's role as a leader in tech innovation. The Mumbai/Pune region follows closely, with 31 per cent of TeamLease Digital's GCC partnerships. The high-tech and automotive sectors are the most significant in this region, with the high-tech industry making up 33 per cent and the automotive sector contributing 22 per cent of the headcount. Pune, in particular, is emerging as a driver in the automotive sector. This region is also notable for its involvement in the capital markets, a sector that is only served by Mumbai/Pune and Delhi NCR, highlighting critical skills in data mining, predictive analytics, and big data frameworks. Delhi-NCR contributes 22 per cent to the overall GCC headcount, with Software Platform and High Tech each representing 20 per cent of the headcount. This region is unique in its substantial contribution to the oil and gas industry, comprising 6.5 per cent of the GCC headcount. Elaborating on the findings, Neeti Sharma, Chief Executive Officer, of TeamLease Digital said, \"Sectors like healthcare, BFSI, and retail have shown remarkable growth. Between 2021 and 2023, these sectors recorded cumulative compound annual growth rates (CAGR) exceeding 30 per cent. This growth is particularly notable, given that during the same period, the broader IT industry was experiencing a downturn. In contrast, the GCC Software and Internet sector maintained steady progress and is projected to reach a CAGR of 6.2 per cent by 2027. Even more promising is the retail and e-commerce GCC sector, which is expected to see the strongest growth at 8.4 per cent CAGR, followed closely by Healthcare at 7.5 per cent.\" (ANI) LATEST COMMENTS () POST YOUR COMMENT Comments Not Available POST YOUR COMMENT TRENDING TOPICS Tariff , GST , Diwali , Iran , election , Zubeen , Trump , Mamdani , Bihar , sensex , Israel , Congress , BJP , Ladakh , Modi , pahalgam , Pakistan , cricket , Naxal , Budget CITY NEWS Delhi Mumbai Kolkata Chennai Bangalore Kochi MORE CITIES MORE BUSINESS NEWS Nykaaland 3.0 Welcomes 30,000+ Attendees...

Here's why travel influencer parted ways with Apoorva Mukhija Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently shared his vision for the future of technology during a live recording of the \"Acquired\" podcast in San Francisco. He emphasized the importance of open-source models in the ongoing competition within the tech industry. According to Zuckerberg, the debate between open and closed models is more than just a business strategy; it’s an ideological battle that could shape the future of how technology is developed and used. Zuckerberg pointed out that companies like Apple have traditionally followed a closed model, integrating their software and hardware in a way that keeps their source code private. While this approach can enhance security, it limits how quickly innovation can occur. In contrast, he highlighted the success of open ecosystems, like those seen during the PC era with Windows, where a more open model allowed for greater collaboration and faster advancement. His long-term goal is ambitious: over the next 10 to 15 years, Zuckerberg aims to champion the development of open platforms and hopes they will ultimately dominate the tech landscape. He believes that fostering open-source technologies will not only promote innovation but also create a more vibrant and democratic tech industry where anyone can contribute. Meta has already made significant moves in this direction. In 2023, the company launched Llama 2, an open-source AI model that quickly gained traction in the tech community. This was seen as a positive step, allowing developers and researchers to modify and build upon the model. However, open-source technology is not without its challenges. Zuckerberg acknowledged the potential risks, such as misuse by bad actors. For example, Llama 2 has faced criticism for providing access to sensitive information, though Zuckerberg defended the model by saying similar information is available elsewhere. In July, Meta built on this momentum by releasing Llama 3.1, another open-source model that was praised across the tech industry. Many executives described it as an “incredible gift,” highlighting the potential benefits of open-source innovation. Overall, Zuckerberg's commitment to open-source technology reflects a broader shift in the industry, aiming to create more collaborative and accessible tools for everyone.

ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG Ng Wei Kai Follow topic: Universities - Singapore Published Sep 21, 2024, 05:00 PM Updated Sep 23, 2024, 03:58 PM SINGAPORE – With a near-perfect score for his A-level exams, 22-year-old Kee Song Yang had his pick of university courses before settling on computer science, in part for the promise of a high starting wage. But he came up empty-handed despite sending out dozens of internship applications in the last summer break – signalling the rising competition within the industry. The third-year National University of Singapore (NUS) student , who is worried about his job prospects, is among the swelling numbers of local undergraduates studying computer science and related disciplines who are soon entering a rapidly changing and highly competitive tech industry. Across NUS, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU), the number of young people enrolled in computing and related courses shot up 63 per cent over the last five years, based on enrolment data. Since 2019, the number of students enrolled in NUS’ School of Computing and its computer engineering course, which is jointly organised by the College of Design and Engineering and the School of Computing, has risen 68 per cent, from 3,498 to 5,878. At NTU, the number of undergraduates specialising in computing-related courses has nearly doubled from 1,987 in the 2019/2020 academic year to 3,156 in 2023/2024. Similarly, enrolment in SMU’s computing-related courses jumped from 1,490 to 2,310, up by 55 per cent. In response to queries, NUS said it is seeing greater interest for programmes such as artificial intelligence, computing, computer engineering, as well as data science and analytics. Highly competitive sector Starting salaries for these graduates, who usually enter the tech industry, often top the graduate employment surveys published by universities. In 2023, NUS’ computer science graduates earned a $6,181 median basic monthly salary compared to the $4,313 average for all fresh graduates. Demand has been fuelled by the growth of Singapore’s tech industry, which in 2022 was worth $106 billion – or 17.3 per cent of Singapore’s nominal gross domestic product. Big tech firms, including US companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, as well as short-video sharing app TikTok’s parent company ByteDance and conglomerate Tencent have in recent years made Singapore home. Also in the mix are hedge funds and other financial institutions, which seek such graduates as “quants”, or quantitative traders who execute complex trades using algorithms and other programs , as well as various regional players and startups . The route into permanent positions in these firms is often through internships , which can result in “conversions”, or offers of employment , said fourth-year NUS computer science student Vibilan Jayanth, 21. Roles at established tech firms or financial firms such as Jane Street Capital – which has an office in Singapore – are seen as very prestigious and often well-paid, he added. That is why competition for such internships is fierce, said Mr Vibilan, who sent out 30 applications for internships last year. His peers too had sent out between 50 and 100 applications. While the industry has always been competitive, the growing pool of graduates means the situation is even more dog-eat-dog than before, he said. “It feels like even more people fighting for fewer spots.” Advent of generative AI; changing skills needed More broadly, large-scale industry restructuring due to changing macro-economic conditions like higher interest rates and the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have kept students on their toes . These changes have resulted in widespread layoffs globally over the last few years, which some publications have dubbed The Great Tech Reset. In August, tech giant Intel announced a 15 per cent cut in its global workforce. According to independent tech layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi, 436 tech companies have laid off 137,050 workers in 2024 alone. Closer to home, in January, e-commerce giant Lazada retrenched an undisclosed number of its Singapore staff. Figures from the annual graduate employment survey showed that 88.7 per cent of information and digital technologies graduates found full-time permanent work after six months in 2023, down from 93.2 per cent in 2022 and 93.7 per cent in 2021. Despite this, demand for tech workers in Singapore has rebounded, data from professional networking site LinkedIn showed. The company saw a 29 per cent year-over-year increase for tech industry job postings in June 2024 compared to June 2023. More on this topic Higher starting salaries for SIT’s class of 2023, with tech graduates earning the most askST: Do tech graduates still enjoy good job prospects? This was much better than the 49 per cent year-on-year decrease in June 2023 compared with June 2022 , it told The Straits Times. LinkedIn Apac’s head economist Chua Pei Ying said: “The data also shows that the hiring rate for the tech industry has started to improve in recent months – the hiring rate for June 2024 grew by 2.7 per cent year on year, which is the highest growth in over two years.” While demand for fresh tech graduates is strong, the skills employers are asking of them have changed. Ms Chua said: “We are seeing a significant skill shift accelerated by AI transformation, which will fuel the emergence of new roles in burgeoning sectors.” President of the Singapore Computer Society Sam Liew said the demand for tech roles in Singapore has changed significantly over the past few years, driven by factors such as technological advancements, government initiatives, and shifts in business operations. The job market has faced challenges due to economic uncertainties and changes in the hiring patterns of big tech companies, he said. Despite this, demand for tech roles remains robust, particularly in areas such as cyber security, artificial intelligence and data science, he added. Students’ concerns about the job market are understandable, given the current climate. “However, it is important to note that despite retrenchments, the tech sector remains resilient overall. The demand for tech skills continues to grow across various industries.” One major change in the industry is the arrival of generative AI, particularly the launch of AI-chatbot ChatGPT at the end of 2022. More on this topic New handbook to help S’pore employers hire tech workers based on skills, not academics Singapore’s tech grads in limbo amid shrinking job market The chatbot , which is free to use up to a point, is able to process and respond to questions in conversational form. Its introduction is widely seen as a watershed moment in the use of such technology. It also has applications in programming. NUS’ Mr Kee said: “ChatGPT is actually very good at programming. It’s useful for a lot of the simpler parts of the work.” Universities are working to help students keep pace with the speed of change. Associate Professor Ng Teck Khim, vice-dean for industry relations at NUS’ School of Computing, said it has introduced new courses in AI-related areas, and is also looking into updating the syllabus of existing courses. The school also plans to revamp or introduce new degrees to reflect the latest AI advancements, he added. NTU’s Professor Luke Ong, vice-president (AI & Digital Economy) and dean at the College of Computing and Data Science, said new AI-related offerings for students include an AI and Society computing degree launched in 2024 . Students who show strong aptitude and talent in AI are further stretched with the Turing AI Scholars Programme, meant to develop those interested in AI research, he added. The college also launched a new minor in AI programme in 2024 for all non-computing undergraduates, he said. Getting past gruelling interviews to land a job remains among students’ chief concerns. Said Mr Vibilan: “I feel prepared to function in a role in a company, but it’s getting past the hurdle of the time-trial interviews that seems like a big barrier.” More on this topic Fixing the ‘leaky’ Stem pipeline begins with helping women beat imposter syndrome SMEs to get help in using generative AI, tech workers to be upskilled The interview process for technical roles often involves timed coding exercises , which many students prepare for using LeetCode – a website with practice questions, as well as mock interview preparation . Worried about the future and aiming for a job in big tech, Mr Kee spends many of his free hours on the website to prepare for interviews , or ‘Leetcoding’, as users call it . “I guess I just have to keep on grinding,” he said. Correction note: An earlier version of the story did not include some computing-related courses offered by SMU. The story has been updated to accurately reflect the enrolment in such courses across the universities. See more on Universities - Singapore Big Tech Working life"

Constellation will rename the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. Watch NBC6 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Constellation Energy plans to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and will sell the power to Microsoft, demonstrating the immense energy needs of the tech sector as they build out data centers to support artificial intelligence. Constellation expects the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island near Middletown, Pennsylvania, to come back online in 2028, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the company announced Friday. Constellation also plans to apply to extend the plant's operations to at least 2054. Constellation stock jumped about 22% on Friday to close at $254.98 per share. Its shares have more than doubled year to date. Microsoft will purchase electricity from the plant in a 20-year agreement to match the energy its data centers consume with carbon-free power. Constellation described the agreement with Microsoft as the largest power purchase agreement that the nuclear plant operator has ever signed. \"The decision here is the most powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource,\" Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez told investors on a call Friday morning. Unit 1 ceased operations in 2019 as nuclear power struggled to compete economically with cheap natural gas and renewables. It is separate from the reactor that partially melted down in 1979 in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Constellation will rename the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. The facility is named after Chris Crane, who was CEO of Constellation's former parent company and died in April. Constellation will invest $1.6 billion in restarting the plant through 2028, including on nuclear fuel, Chief Financial Officer Dan Eggers told investors during the call. Tech hunts for nuclear Electricity demand from data centers is expected to surge in the coming decades as the tech sector ramps up AI, threatening to strain the electric grid. While estimates vary, Goldman Sachs has forecast data centers will consume 8% of total U.S. electricity demand by 2030, compared with 3% currently. Power demand is also surging from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the adoption of electric vehicles. Rystad Energy has forecast that data center and electric vehicles alone will add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, equivalent to the entire consumption of the nation of Turkey. Tech companies are hunting for nuclear power to meet that growing electricity demand while adhering to their climate goals. In March, Amazon Web Services bought a data center campus from Talen Energy that will be powered by the Susquehanna nuclear plant, also in Pennsylvania, in a first-of-its-kind deal. Oracle recently said it is designing a data center that will be powered by three small nuclear reactors . There is growing bipartisan support from federal and state governments to revive the nuclear industry after a decade-long wave of reactor shutdowns. Three Mile Island would be the second nuclear plant to restart operations in U.S. history. The Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan would be the first, with that plant expected to return to service at the end of 2025. Restart process Constellation anticipates that the NRC will complete the review of Three Mile Island in 2027, Eggers said. The review includes a safety and environmental impact study. \"Based on our expertise on plant licensing and regulatory processes and through observation of the Palisades restart, we are highly confident we'll be able to restore the plant's operational licensing authority to the same state that existed prior to the shutdown in 2019,\" Eggers said. The nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, will also have to review Three Mile Island's impact on the grid before the nuclear plant can restart, Eggers said. Constellation plans to submit a grid interconnection request to PJM next year, the executive said. Eggers said the plant could potentially restart earlier than expected if PJM embraces changes that speed up interconnection requests to address tightening power supplies in the 13-state, primarily mid-Atlantic region that the grid operator serves. \"In this rebirth, we see the most powerful sign that America will turn to the enduring promise of nuclear energy, an old and loyal ally that is renewed and ready to light the way forward,\" Dominguez said.

Image: © Andres Poveda Kinia, Cognizant and Lenovo among the 2024 Diversity in Tech winners by Suhasini Srinivasaragavan 20 Sep 2024 Save article From individuals to organisations, a total of 17 awards were given, celebrating diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. The seventh annual Diversity in Tech Awards took place last night (19 September) at Dublin’s RDS, with wins for Kinia, Fiserv and Workday, among others. Judged by a panel of industry leaders, the awards celebrate diversity, women’s achievements and exceptional leadership in the tech industry. US recruitment company Greenhouse Software , which opened its first EMEA office in Dublin in 2020, won the Diverse Company of the Year Award. Dr Alessandra Sala won the Grace Hopper Award , named after the pioneering computer scientist, and pays tribute to STEM professionals who make a lasting impact on technology and society. With more than 15 years’ experience in research and innovation, Sala is the global president of Women in AI , the co-chair of UNESCO’s Women4Ethical AI and senior director of AI and data science at Shutterstock. In 2021, she received the XV International Prize ‘Le Tecnovisionarie’ in the AI-Industrial Research category. She was previously head of analytics research at Nokia Bell Labs. At the award ceremony yesterday, Sala delivered a keynote about AI excellence and cultivating a diverse ecosystem. “This award celebrates our collective investment and underscores the importance of building a future where women and underrepresented groups can lead, innovate and inspire in a more equitable tech industry,” she said. Speaking to SiliconRepublic.com in 2020 , Sala said a different approach is needed to tackle the gender problem in AI. “The model is not to just state that we have a problem. Stating that we have a problem is obvious to everyone,” she said. “Sharing the same experience and stopping there, it doesn’t move the needle.” Managing director of the awards, Tracey Carney said that “diversity is no longer an optional add-on” for companies. “These awards celebrate not only the companies that have embraced inclusion, but also the individuals who are the driving force behind this transformation. “The people we honour today are not just professionals; they are passionate advocates, many of whom bring lived experience to their work, making their commitment to diversity all the more powerful and authentic.” Winners DE&I Excellence in Leadership Award – Sebastian Gollwitzer (Fiserv) Neurodiverse Inclusion Award – Auticon Technical Guru Award – Nicola McDonnell (Workday) Cultural Inclusion Award – Carelon Global Solutions Hiring Now Think for impact with Liberty IT.

Read our privacy notice . Martin Sorrell ’s digital advertising agency S4 Capital pointed today to a bigger drop in annual revenue as it reported a half-year operating loss. Lower spending from major tech firms led the decline, with one unnamed major customer in particular cutting back. S4 said: “All Practices have seen some impact from the net revenue reductions, most evident in Technology Services reflecting anticipated lower transformation revenue from one client” Net revenue in the first half fell 13.5% on a like-for-like basis to £376.1 million. Its operating loss was £3.7 million. The firm said: “We target like-for-like net revenue to be down on the prior year, but to a greater extent than that assumed in May 2024 in our last trading update.” It stood by full-year profit guidance. S4 is a digital-only marketing firm, at the cutting-edge of the industry. On the latest trends in the trade, it said there was “a focus on AI driven hyper-personalisation at scale”. Its founder Sorrell, who is one of the best-known names throughout the City, explained: “Trading in the first half reflects the continuing impact of both challenging global macroeconomic conditions and high interest rates. “This particularly impacted marketing spend by some technology clients and our Technology Services practice was affected by a reduction in one of our larger relationships”. The wider ad industry has flocked to the tech sector, seen as a promising source of business amid more challenging conditions in the wider economy, S4’s update is likely to sound alarm bells over the potential limits of budgets even in this fast-growing area. Nonetheless, Sorrell stayed upbeat as he looked ahead, not least as use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues as a major industry theme.

    "article_text": "Six Ideas For Latina Inclusion In The IT Channel Latinas make up less than 2 percent of the U.S. tech workforce, and roughly 1 percent of engineers in the U.S., however inclusion initiatives often fail to address their specific challenges and barriers. Natalia Herrera, global head of marketing and alliances for channels at Logitech, tells CRN the best ways to fix that problem. The tech industry, while known for its innovation, still faces challenges regarding diversity and inclusion, particularly for Latinas. Despite organizations claiming to value diversity, Latinas continue to be underrepresented in tech and leadership roles. In an interview with CRN, Natalia Herrera, global head of marketing and alliances for channels at Logitech, shares her insights on how inclusive leaders and organizations can help Latinas thrive in the IT channel. Below are six actionable ideas for Latinas striving to make their mark in the tech industry. 1. Break Through Biases And Stereotypes Latinas often face both racial and gender biases, which can limit their career advancement. According to Herrera, biases and stereotypes about Latinasâ€™ abilities and perceived lack of cultural fit remain a significant barrier: \"Latinas specifically have not only a racial bias sometimes, but also a gender bias. That can affect hiring, promotion opportunities, and investment.\" Recognizing and challenging these biases is the first step toward change. Latinas in IT can work to educate themselves and others about these biases while pushing for organizations to adopt more equitable hiring practices. 2. Seek And Build Role Models And Mentorship One of the critical gaps for Latinas is the lack of visible role models in tech leadership. Herrera emphasizes the importance of seeing people like yourself in positions of power: \"In the recruiting process, there needs to be specific role models, diverse role models that can lend a pin onto a diverse group of people.\" Latinas can actively seek mentors and sponsors within their organizations and beyond. By doing so, they can create pathways not just for themselves, but for the next generation of Latina leaders in the channel. 3. Expand Your Network Latinas often face a limited network in the tech industry. Herrera noted that although progress has been made for women in general, there is still work to be done specifically for Latinas: \"We see a lot more progress on the women's side, but Latinas specifically, there's still smaller groups that support that scenario.\" Building a professional network is key to career growth. Latinas can leverage Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and industry-specific organizations to connect with others who share their background and career aspirations. Networking can open doors to new opportunities, mentorship, and support systems that are critical for advancement. 4. Advocate For Tailored Inclusion Programs One-size-fits-all diversity initiatives may not address the unique challenges Latinas face in the workplace. Herrera believes that inclusion programs must be tailored to meet the needs of different groups: \"While we're trying to be inclusive of all the groups, each group has different disadvantages... there needs to be a very specific approach to addressing the barriers for their advancement.\" Latinas should advocate for programs that address the specific obstacles they face in the tech industry, such as targeted mentorship, sponsorship, and recruitment efforts designed to provide them with the support they need to excel. 5. Push For Early Recruitment Initiatives Early exposure to STEM fields is critical for Latinas. Herrera highlights the need for educational institutions and companies to create targeted outreach programs: \"We need to see a lot earlier exposure and engagement to STEM programs for Latinas specifically.\" Latinas can encourage companies to build recruitment pipelines that start early, reaching out to schools and universities that serve underrepresented communities. Being proactive in these efforts ensures that young Latinas see tech as a viable career path. 6. Leverage Cultural Diversity In Business Strategy Latinas can use their unique cultural insights to drive business strategy. Herrera emphasizes the importance of understanding diverse markets, especially when working in global roles: \"You don't get that from sitting behind your desk. You actually have to go to the markets and kind of understand that from working with distributors or specific channels of that country or region.\" Latinas working in the IT channel can advocate for immersive experiences that allow companies to leverage cultural diversity in their go-to-market strategies. This creates meaningful and targeted campaigns that resonate with diverse customers, providing companies with a competitive edge. The Bottom Line Latinas have much to offer the tech industry, but success requires both inclusive leadership efforts and organizational support. By challenging biases, building networks, advocating for targeted inclusion, and leveraging their unique perspectives, Latinas can pave the way for future generations. As Natalia Herrera points out, the power lies in pushing for change while also embracing the diversity that defines the IT channel.

Nvidia mostly recovered from its sell-off and is now down just 12% from its all-time high. Adobe sold off on earnings but is still up over the last few months. And Salesforce is down around 20% from its all-time high but has also recovered from its lows. Here's why exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) can be an excellent way to ride the rally in Oracle and buy the dip on Nvidia, Adobe, and Salesforce. Image source: Getty Images. A results-focused market Some folks might look at the market rally in 2024, especially since the beginning of 2023, and say that valuations are overextended. But overall, the growth has been impressive, and earnings have been strong enough to support the broader market rally. Nvidia reported blowout results but fell due to valuation concerns. It has since made up the bulk of that sell-off. Adobe's growth has slowed, and the stock is down year to date despite gains in the major indexes and tech sector. The company has developed impressive new apps and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, but it has yet to monetize these solutions enough to justify higher costs.

Approaching the tech sector with the right mindset The tech sector makes up 31% of the S&P 500 and has been the driving force behind the bull market for over a decade. Buying tech stocks requires the acceptance that you aren't getting a good deal based on traditional valuation metrics like the P/E ratio. It also demands patience, a high risk tolerance, and an ability to hold through periods of volatility, since the sector can suffer severe drawdowns in a matter of months. If those factors sound acceptable, then the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be a great way to buy and hold many top tech stocks and let exciting growth themes play out over the long term."

The survey polled 1,000 respondents across Singapore , Hong Kong , Vietnam and India , and found that 81% of Asian tech professionals view the UAE as a growing tech hub. A further 76% of respondents say the UAE provides a conducive environment for the tech industry. Tarik Chebib, CEO, Middle East, Capital.com The UAE's growing reputation as a burgeoning tech hub is fuelling interest among tech workers across the region, with nearly half (45%) of respondents expressing a willingness to relocate to the UAE for work, out-ranking countries like Germany (38%) and Hong Kong (20%) as popular relocation destinations. This places the UAE in close competition with other prominent destinations such as Singapore (46%), the UK (57%), and the US (52%) as preferred locations for relocation among tech professionals. Commenting on the findings, Tarik Chebib , CEO, Capital.com, Middle East , said: Get the latest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . \"With 8 in 10 respondents from our recent survey recognising the UAE as a competitive tech hub, it's clear that the region is gaining momentum as a favourable destination for tech talent. Asia's tech professionals have traditionally gravitated to cities in the UK, the US and Singapore to further their careers, so it's encouraging to see the UAE stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this cohort and get the recognition it deserves as an attractive location to live and work.\" Government support is the key factor contributing to UAE's growing reputation as a tech hub and relocation destination of choice. Of those surveyed, 93% think it is important to have a government that is supportive of the tech industry, highlighting the UAE's concentrated push to develop the country as a hotspot for international tech talent. Advertisement The majority of those surveyed (74%) cite the UAE's banking, visa, special healthcare/health insurance packages, and real estate services for qualified tech professionals, as factors. More broadly, respondents also say that a high quality of life (60%), attractive remuneration (54%) and the UAE's strategic location (52%) also feed into their decision to relocate. \"As a leading partner of the UAE's NextGenFDI initiative, we have seen first-hand the government's commitment to support and grow the tech sector. The UAE's business-friendly environment, forward-thinking policies, investment in innovation, and position as a gateway to the Middle East , Africa and Asia , makes it an ideal location for companies and talent alike. Capital.com is proud to contribute to the sector's growth and innovation in the UAE.\" said Chebib . While all respondents indicated a ' willingness ' to relocate for work, 47% indicated that they are ' actively' looking to relocate, highlighting the huge potential for the UAE to attract and retain tech talent. \"As a company operating in the UAE that is licensed by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), we need to draw on an exceptional pool of talent to meet our exacting business and regulatory needs. This means searching for the best talent, from anywhere in the world. Given the UAE's pro-talent stance and growing appeal as a tech destination for professionals, we have had no problem recruiting talent from as far afield as the UK, Europe and Australia . Employees are eager to relocate to a country that not only supports their personal needs but also provides fertile ground for further development within the tech sector,\" added Chebib .

    "article_text": "Taiwan's tech industry is a key link in the global supply chain [Carl Court/Getty Images] By Erin Hale and Alastair McCready Published On 18 Sep 2024 18 Sep 2024 Click here to share on social media share2 Share facebook twitter whatsapp copylink Save Taipei, Taiwan – Taiwan’s crucial tech industry has been unwittingly drawn into Middle East politics after revelations that thousands of exploding pagers used to kill members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group were manufactured using the branding of a Taiwanese firm. Taiwanese tech company Gold Apollo on Wednesday denied that it had manufactured the AR-924 model pagers that exploded en masse in Lebanon, saying they had been made by a European company named BAC through a licensing deal. Recommended Stories list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Bolivia braces for turmoil as protesters clash over anti-government march list 2 of 4 Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 936 list 3 of 4 The future of travel? For hyperloop, it’s one step forward, two steps back list 4 of 4 World Nomad Games put the spotlight on the sport of the Great Steppe end of list “According to the agreement, we authorise BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in specific regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,” Gold Apollo said in a statement. “We only provide brand trademark authorization and have no involvement in the design manufacturing of this product,” the company added. The logo of Taiwanese company Gold Apollo is seen outside its office in New Taipei City on September 18, 2024 [Yan Zhao/AFP] Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had no record of direct exports of the devices to Lebanon and that the pagers may have been modified after manufacturing. Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Times and Reuters news agency, citing unnamed officials, reported that Israeli authorities had placed small amounts of explosive material in the pagers before the detonations. Israel has not commented. Analysts in Taiwan expressed doubt that the Taiwanese government or Gold Apollo would have willingly participated in the apparent attack, which Lebanese authorities say killed nine people and wounded more than 2,700 others. Advertisement Still, the incident draws unwelcome attention to Taiwan and its globally renowned tech industry, which produces the lion’s share of semiconductors used to power practically all electronics worldwide. Jhy-Chern Liu, a professor at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, said he was “shocked” at the news and that people on the island were concerned. “Even though Taiwan has been very close to the US in all aspects, I do not believe that any companies in Taiwan would be involved in a deadly plot like this, considering that Taiwan is an open society and a full democracy. Any hint of ideas like this is simply impossible and unthinkable,” Liu told Al Jazeera. “I do not think the Gold Apollo company would be so unprofessional or stupid to be involved …,” Liu added. While Taiwan is unlikely to have been directly involved, the incident nonetheless raises uncomfortable questions for Taiwan’s tech industry going forward, given its importance for global supply chains, said Yachi Chiang, a professor in tech law at National Taiwan Ocean University. “This incident will be a huge, critical lesson for the industry,” Chiang told Al Jazeera. “The Taiwan tech industry used to think they are only manufacturers of hardware, so they have nothing to do with politics, they are doing their own business. But not any more.” The revelations have also brought the fallout of the war in Gaza to Taiwan’s front door. Taiwan typically keeps its distance from global conflicts and geopolitical controversies except in cases involving China, whose government in Beijing claims the self-governing island as a province. Since the war in Gaza began in October, Taipei has stayed largely silent on the number of Palestinian deaths, although it did condemn Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, which, like most countries, does not officially recognise Taipei, but they both have close ties with the US. While Taipei is one of the most diplomatically isolated governments in the world with just 12 formal allies, it punches above its weight in global influence thanks, in part, to its powerful tech industry. A security staff member walks past a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company logo at the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu on July 5, 2023 [Sam Yeh/AFP] The island is home to TSMC, which manufactures about 90 percent of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips, which make up the backbone of Taiwan’s export-dominated economy. About two-thirds of Taiwan’s exports, which account for about 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), are classified as machinery and electronics, ranging from advanced iPhone chips to small components like the screws used in car engines. Advertisement Besides cutting-edge tech, Taiwan’s factories also produce more antiquated technology such as pagers, which run on less advanced chips than smartphones. Taiwan’s economy is also dominated by small and medium enterprises such as Gold Apollo, which was founded in 1995 and specialises in pagers and small wireless communication devices used by restaurants and hotels. Chiang said the incident in Lebanon highlighted the need for Taiwanese tech companies to pay more attention to their supply chains, even as Taipei has signed onto initiatives like the US-led Clean Network to keep Chinese tech out of Western telecom infrastructure. “You may recall the United States, they advocated for the Clean Network, clean infrastructure – this is because in each of the links of this whole supply chain, it could be the weakest link, but we don’t know which link that might be,” she said. “That’s why it’s necessary to have a whole clean network and whole clean infrastructure – you can see the necessity here.” In Taiwan, where the public is used to China’s threats to “reunify” with the island by force if deemed necessary, Tuesday’s attack also prompted questions about the island’s security. Some Taiwanese netizens wondered if pagers could be used in a similar attack by Chinese tech companies in the future. “What we should worry about is that the other side of the Taiwan Strait will follow the same pattern and attack us,” one user wrote on the popular Reddit-like message board PTT. “Taiwan just wants to sell things, okay?” another wrote. “How others mess around is the business of the Middle East.”"

    "article_text": "The Okanagan tech sector in British Columbia is delivering an outsized economic punch relative to its population size, according to a new report from tech accelerator Accelerate Okanagan. Although the Okanagan accounts for less than 10 percent of BC’s population, the report revealed that its tech sector contributed an impressive $4.98 billion to the economy in 2023. By comparison, BC as a whole, with a population of over five million, saw its tech sector generate $16 billion in gross domestic product in 2022. Accelerate Okanagan’s fourth economic impact study shows the region’s economic impact has grown nearly fivefold from $1.02 billion in 2013. That figure is determined using Statistics Canada’s input-output models . The Okanagan is home to 787 tech companies employing 32,645 people. The Okanagan region, which surrounds its namesake lake in south-central British Columbia, encompasses cities like Kelowna, Vernon, Penticton, and Salmon Arm. While its population may be small compared to major urban centres like Vancouver, it is home to 787 tech companies employing 32,645 people. Among the Okanagan’s four census regions, the Central Okanagan—home to its largest city, Kelowna—was the driving force behind much of the area’s economic growth. The region generated $3.01 billion in 2023, employing over 19,747 people, according to Accelerate Okanagan’s report. The report revealed that 61 percent of local tech companies in the Okanagan are under nine years old, and 58 percent have already reached profitability. Top sub-sectors in Okanagan tech include advanced manufacturing, with companies like RainStick Shower and 4AG Robotics, cleantech with firms like Lomi and GreenStep, and SaaS businesses such as Minga and Trellis. The report noted that quality of life, climate, and commute times were listed by respondents as some of the key benefits of building a tech company in the Okanagan. The greatest challenges for local founders, however, include access to capital and attracting new customers, according to the report. RELATED: Saskatchewan tech sector employment doubled over four-year period: report “The struggle to easily access growth capital and tech talent is a universal issue, but it’s magnified in the Okanagan by the region’s distance to major urban centers,” the report reads. Sourcing technical talent also appears to be a challenge cited by those surveyed in the report, which is being exacerbated by a higher cost of living sweeping BC and other Canadian provinces. However, the study found that the region’s reputation as a destination for young talent is taking hold, with 46 percent of employees being under the age of 35. The report noted that startups, for example, are benefitting from local graduates from institutions like Okanagan College and the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus. The report also found that the overall sentiment within the region’s tech ecosystem is largely positive, with 65 percent of tech companies preparing to grow their workforce in the coming year.

    "article_text": "The creator of Linux detailed the latest Linux updates at the Linux Foundation's Open Source Summit Europe event. Credit: Shutterstock At the Open Source Summit (OSS) Europe event in Vienna, Austria, on Sept. 16, the always colorful Linus Torvalds took the stage in a fireside chat to detail his views on the latest open source and Linux developments. The Linux Foundation , which hosts the event as well as employs Torvalds, used the summit to make a series of announcements. Among the news: The free5GC open source 5G core software project is moving to the Linux Foundation. The CAMARA project issued its first release, providing common network APIs for telcos and hyperscalers. AWS moved its OpenSearch technology to new governance under the Linux Foundation . Linux kernel 6.11 release is out. “We’ve had a very good regular cadence of releases, and it has resulted in the fact that we’re doing the releases every roughly nine weeks,” Torvalds said. “That means that releases are not exciting, and they’re not supposed to be. They are timely, and they are hopefully very reliable. But exciting is not, I think, the goal.” What’s new in Linux The Linux kernel is the core component of any Linux distribution. Torvalds emphasized that most kernel changes are still driver updates. That said, core kernel development continues even now, 33 years after he first started Linux. “I’m still surprised by the fact that we’re doing very core development,” Torvalds said, citing recent work on fairly low-level virtual file system code and discussions about memory management and “…things that have been around forever.” This continued evolution, he suggested, is driven by the continued expansion of the hardware base but also the continued expansion of the user base. One of the most significant recent milestones in Linux development has been the completion of the real-time Linux project, which Torvalds wryly described as having a very brief development cycle of about 20 years. The real-time Linux project brings a high level of determinism to operating system functions. This project exemplifies the sometimes lengthy process of kernel development. “While kernel development is very active, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you can get a new feature, file system, or anything into the kernel very quickly,” Torvalds said. “There’s often a long development period that people seldom even see.” Torvalds remains optimistic about the state of open source Contrary to concerns about recent tech industry layoffs and reduced corporate involvement in open source, Torvalds painted an optimistic picture. “I feel like open source is doing very well,” he said. “People take open source for granted now in a way that they absolutely did not just two decades ago.” Torvalds highlighted the democratizing effect of open source, particularly for newcomers to the tech industry. He noted that any new programmer can use open source as a way to enter the industry and make connections without necessarily having gone to the right schools or having the personal connections that are often needed in many other industries. For those looking to start new open-source projects, Torvalds advised finding a niche that is both personally interesting and meaningful to others. “In the tech industry, so much is about the hype. Everybody is following everybody else like lemmings off a cliff, trying to chase the next big thing, and I don’t think that’s a successful strategy,” Torvalds said. “I think you need to find something that isn’t what everybody else does and excel at that and be the first to do something slightly different.” SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

According to the EEOC’s findings, analysis, and enforcement information, there are barriers to equal employment for high tech jobs, which the Agency intends to address through heightened enforcement efforts. It is important for all employers – not just high tech companies – to understand the EEOC’s report and be mindful of the agency’s strategic position it signals to avoid becoming the target of the EEOC’s enforcement efforts. On September 11, 2024, the EEOC issued a report entitled High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech Workforce and Sector 2014-2022 , which analyzes “demographic disparities for workers in 56 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations and the industries employing them.” In addition to providing an assessment of the current state of diversity in these fields, the report also discusses the most common discrimination charges filed by high tech sector workers with the EEOC. The report follows on the EEOC’s Strategic Enforcement Plan (“SEP”) for fiscal years 2024-2028, which stated, in part, that “[t]he continued underrepresentation of women and workers of color in certain industries and sectors (for example, construction and manufacturing, high tech, STEM, and finance, among others), are also areas of particular concern, especially in industries that benefit from substantial federal investment.” (We’ve written previously about the proposed and final SEP .) EEOC Findings of Underrepresentation of Certain Workers in High Tech Jobs The report lists numerous findings that show, according to the EEOC, that the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, female, and older workers in the high-tech industry is due to “discriminatory barriers,” which the EEOC intends to address by proactively investigating charges of discrimination and pursuing litigation. The EEOC also plans to provide technical assistance and engage in extensive education and outreach efforts aimed at getting employers to comply with laws enforced by the EEOC. The EEOC’s specific findings include: Female, Black, and Hispanic workers remained substantially underrepresented in the high tech workforce and sector. According to the EEOC, between 2005 and 2022 there was very little change in the representation of Black workers and virtually no change in the representation of female workers occurred in the high tech workforce. Black, Hispanic and Asian workers were purportedly underrepresented in managerial positions compared to their participation in the high tech workforce overall. While women are nearly half of the total U.S. workforce, the EEOC reports that they were just 22.6% of the high tech workforce in all industries, and only 4% of the high tech workforce in the high tech sector. The EEOC suggests that the high tech workforce is generally younger than the total U.S. workforce; 40.8% of the high tech workforce are ages 25 to 39, but only 33.1% of the overall workforce. Workers over age 40 in the high tech workforce reportedly lost ground between 2014 and 2022, declining from 55.9% to 52.1%. EEOC Charge Filings in the High Tech Sector The report provides charge filing information from 2022 (the most recent year for which the EEOC has reported data). The data show that the four most common types of charges filed in the high tech sector are: (i) retaliation; (ii) disability discrimination; (iii) race discrimination; and (iv) sex discrimination. Further, age, pay, and genetic information discrimination charges are more prevalent in the high-tech sector than in other sectors, with age discrimination charges representing the greatest difference in filings as compared to other sectors. Employers are likely to see surge in enforcement action by the EEOC in these areas, particularly with respect to Black, Hispanic, female, and older workers. Implications for Employers Employers in the high tech sector and with high tech employees must remain on high alert when it comes to the EEOC. The EEOC announced in the SEP that it intended to focus its enforcement efforts on this sector, and this report demonstrates that the EEOC is doing just that. As such, employers in the high tech industry and with high tech employees should be familiar with this report, and the EEOC’s promise to pursue large scale enforcement efforts in this space. Employers in all industries should also mark the take-away that the EEOC continues its focus on systemic hiring and recruiting enforcement in a wide variety of sectors.

The report assesses the current state of diversity in the high tech workforce and those employed in the high tech sector. It also discusses the most common discrimination charges filed by high tech sector workers with the EEOC, building on previous reports from 2016 and 2017 by the EEOC and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) , respectively. The EEOC report released today acknowledges that employers have made limited progress toward including qualified workers of all backgrounds in the high tech sector and high tech workforce but concludes that significant barriers still remain to equal employment opportunity in high tech. The magnitude of the underrepresentation for some demographic groups, particularly for women and Black workers, combined with research and the EEOC’s experience enforcing anti-discrimination laws, suggest that discrimination likely contributes to the relatively low employment of women, Black workers, Hispanic workers, and older workers in high tech. “Sixty years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, there is a high degree of underrepresentation and a disturbing lack of career advancement for female, Black, and Hispanic workers in the high tech workforce, despite the recent period of growth in high tech occupations. America’s high tech sector, which leads the world in crafting technologies of the future, should not have a workforce that looks like the past,” said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows. “These data raise serious questions that deserve serious answers.” Burrows said, “At the Commission, we will work to identify instances in which discrimination has contributed to these disparities. It is important for high tech employers to self-assess and address any discriminatory barriers limiting employment opportunities and to implement proactive policies to increase inclusion. Everyone deserves access to these high tech opportunities, which often provide competitive pay, benefits, job security, and stability.” Findings from the report include: Female, Black, and Hispanic workers remained substantially underrepresented in the high tech workforce and sector. Between 2005 and 2022 there was very little change in the representation of Black workers and virtually no change in the representation of female workers occurred in the high tech workforce. (see Section III) Black, Hispanic and Asian workers were underrepresented in managerial positions compared to their participation in the high tech workforce overall. (see Section V) While women are nearly half of the total U.S. workforce, they were just 22.6% of the high tech workforce in all industries, and only 4% of the high tech workforce in the high tech sector. (see Section V, Tables 11 and 12) The high tech workforce is generally younger than the total U.S. workforce; 40.8% of the high tech workforce are ages 25 to 39, but only 33.1% of the overall workforce. Workers over age 40 in the high tech workforce lost ground between 2014 and 2022, declining from 55.9% to 52.1%. (see Section V, Table 9) Charges of discrimination filed with the EEOC in the tech sector were more likely to involve discrimination based on age, pay, and/or genetic information than those filed in other sectors. (see Section VII) Given its findings, the report recommends that high tech companies proactively examine barriers limiting employment for women, older workers, Black workers, and Hispanic workers. The EEOC prevents and remedies unlawful employment discrimination and advances equal opportunity for all. More information is available at www.eeoc.gov .

Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC ( LSE:SMT ) View Price & Profile Scottish Mortgage jumps following Nvidia recovery Published: 10:01 12 Sep 2024 BST Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC (LSE:SMT) has added more than 3% to its share price following a bullish session in the US tech sector. Nvidia Corp, which is Scottish Mortgage’s largest holding (comprising 6.8% of its total portfolio) closed 8% higher on the Nasdaq 100 index on Wednesday, marking the end to a bearish period for the superstar chipmaker. Nvidia shares have been out of favour following its second-quarter earnings in early September. While the Silicon Valley giant and primary Wall Street play on the artificial intelligence sector beat revenue expectations, concerns were raised about the trajectory of its AI chip sales. This led to a record $270 billion being wiped from Nvidia’s valuation. But Nvidia shares staged a bumper recovery yesterday, sending shares surging over 8%. In turn, Scottish Mortgage, being one of Britain’s foremost investors in the group, shared in the positive sentiment. Scottish Mortgage is a prominent tech investor, with major holdings in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and a raft of unlisted companies including Elon Musk’s SpaceX . This makes the FTSE 100 investment trust susceptible to market shifts in the US tech sector. At the time of writing, Scottish Mortgage shares were swapping for 819.19p with a market capitalisation of £10.6 billion. Continue reading"

PHOTO: AFP Follow topic: Technology sector Published Sep 12, 2024, 12:55 PM Updated Sep 12, 2024, 05:05 PM HANOI – Several regional private equity firms have banded together to establish a Vietnamese alliance, aiming to facilitate US$35 billion (S$45.7 billion) of investment into the country over the next decade. The newly established Vietnam Private Capital Agency (VPCA), founded by five partners from funds including Golden Gate Ventures, Do Ventures and Monk’s Hill Ventures, will organise seminars, support private equity firms and both lobby and work with the government on policy. Its goal is to facilitate investment in sectors from agriculture to education to healthcare, said Mr Vinnie Lauria, a board member for the agency. It is unclear how the association arrived at its investment projection, which is several times higher than what Vietnam’s tech sector attracts annually at present. But many investors tout the country’s potential at a time US-China tensions are prompting businesses to relocate factories and target new markets for growth. Vietnam’s digital economy is set to surpass US$90 billion in 2030 from US$30 billion in 2023, according to a joint report from Google, Temasek and Bain & Company. “Vietnam is a hot market,” said Mr Lauria , a Golden Gate founding partner . “The motivation to establish the VPCA stemmed from key developments in Vietnam, including rising wages and GDP (gross domestic product), increasing FDI (foreign direct investment), export growth post-Covid-19, government innovation programmes and rapid infrastructure development.” The industry association hopes to broaden its membership to 100 individuals by the end of 2025, from more than 40 now. Existing member firms also include Vertex Ventures, Ascend Vietnam Ventures and Mekong Capital. Vietnam’s start-up scene has exploded in the past years, driven by the rise of firms such as games developer VNG. But as with much of South-east Asia, its tech sector has struggled to raise capital since a post-Covid-19 downturn. In 2021, Vietnam drew a record US$2.6 billion through 233 private deals, up from US$700 million via 140 deals a year prior, according to the Google report. But total capital invested in Vietnamese tech start-ups in 2023 plunged 17 per cent to US$529 million, placing it third among South-east Asian countries, according to a separate report from Do Ventures and the Vietnam National Innovation Centre.

    "article_text": "gorodenkoff/Getty Images Menu List Icon Table of contents Back to top Trend Unchanged Icon Arrow Up Icon The technology sector moves quickly, so if you’re looking to invest here, it could make sense to buy a tech exchange-traded fund (ETF). A tech ETF is an easy way to build a tech portfolio, letting you play the sector if you think it’s going to run higher – and you can do it without analyzing the individual companies. An ETF also provides diversification , reducing your risk compared to buying a few individual stocks. Here are some of the best tech ETFs to consider for your investment portfolio, with data as of April 23, 2025. What are the main kinds of tech ETFs? The tech sector is large, and for purposes of classification, it’s called “information technology” as part of the GICS classification system . That system breaks the tech sector down into three major industry groups: Software and services — This industry group includes software companies and IT services companies. Technology hardware and equipment — This group includes three main areas: communications equipment; technology hardware, storage and peripherals; and electronic equipment, instruments and components. Semiconductors and semiconductor equipment — This group includes the “chip” companies that make semiconductors and those that produce supporting equipment. If you’re looking for broad exposure to tech, you can find funds that invest across the sector, giving you a diversified cross-section of players. Best tech ETFs 1. Best software & services ETF iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) This ETF tracks an index composed of North American software companies and interactive media companies. Top holdings include Oracle, Microsoft and Salesforce. 5-year returns (annualized): 14.2 percent Expense ratio: 0.41 percent Dividend yield: n/a 2. Best internet ETF First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (FDN) This ETF aims to match the investment results of the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which tracks stocks of U.S. internet companies. Its largest holdings include Meta Platforms , Amazon and Netflix. 5-year returns (annualized): 9.2 percent Expense ratio: 0.51 percent Dividend yield: n/a 3. Best semiconductor ETF iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) This ETF tracks an index composed of U.S.-listed stocks in the semiconductor industry. Its top holdings include Broadcom, Nvidia and Texas Instruments. 5-year returns (annualized): 19.1 percent Expense ratio: 0.35 percent Dividend yield: 0.8 percent 4. Best diversified tech ETF Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) This ETF tracks a benchmark index of the information technology sector, giving investors a diversified cross-section of the sector. Top holdings include Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft. 5-year returns (annualized): 18.6 percent Expense ratio: 0.09 percent Dividend yield: 0.6 percent What to look for in an ETF When investing in ETFs, it’s useful to look at a few aspects of each ETF so that you actually buy what you think you’re buying. Here are three key things to look for: The sub-sector — Each sub-sector may respond differently to developments in the industry. For example, software companies will respond differently to growing demand than semiconductor companies, which often have to deal with the cyclicality of that sub-sector. So you need to know what kinds of companies your ETF owns. The investment track record — The track record of the ETF can give you an indication of how the fund might perform in the future, though there are no guarantees. Has the ETF outperformed or underperformed the industry? The sub-sector can heavily influence the track record, since not all tech sub-sectors perform the same. The expense ratio — Pay attention to the expense ratio , which tells you how much it costs to own the fund annually as a percent of your total investment in it. Finally, it’s worth noting that larger ETFs tend to charge lower expense ratios, because they can spread the costs of running the fund across more assets. So the cheapest funds may often be the largest funds, and a low expense ratio is a key measure of what makes a top ETF. How to invest in tech ETFs An ETF can make it easier for individual investors to invest in the tech sector , but because of the various industry dynamics at play, you’ll still need to know some of the sub-sectors you’re investing in. While some sectors do well almost perennially, others may be more cyclical and have more booms and busts, depending on their specific dynamics. The ETFs above give you a highly liquid way to invest in the tech sector, but you’ll want to carefully consider which sectors you’re investing in. If you want to invest in an upswing of the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, you may want a fund that’s focused exclusively on that industry group. If you’re right, you may enjoy even greater profits than you would earn with a more broadly diversified tech ETF. Similarly, you may want to invest in one of the most profitable areas of the market – software companies. The big appeal of software is that these firms can operate with enormous margins as they grow their sales. Because the incremental costs on software sales are low, much of every incremental dollar of sales may add to pre-tax profit. Bottom line Investors looking for exposure to the tech sector have a few different options to play it, from funds that invest in sub-sectors to those that invest across the sector. So it’s important to know which sector you’re investing in and the potential risks and returns offered by each ETF. For this reason, some investors stick to broadly diversified index funds, such as those based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index , and don’t worry too much about a sector’s ups and downs. — Bankrate’s Brian Baker contributed to an update of this story.

    "article_text": "Anne-Marie Walsh Wed 11 Sep 2024 at 03:30 Workers with AI skills are top of tech employers' hiring wishlists as a major surge in recruitment is predicted in the coming months. A new survey by ManpowerGroup Ireland published today says Irish tech companies expect a resurgence in hiring plans in the next three months. This follows a prolonged period of stagnant hiring plans and downsizing. The report calculates that employers’ “net employment outlook” or optimism for the period from October to December this year stands at 39pc, up from 6pc in the previous three months. The “net employment outlook” is calculated by subtracting the number of employers who expect a fall in hiring from those who expect an increase. This optimism is driven by fresh demand for highly skilled specialists, especially candidates with AI skills. More than half of employers expect AI to create more jobs than it replaces over the next two years. The ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey reveals the highest level of optimism since the post-pandemic hiring boom. Demand for high-skilled roles like AI specialists, data engineers, cloud architects, cybersecurity specialists, and developers is expected to ignite tech sector hiring. Despite this, hiring in “high volume”, or large numbers of workers, is expected to remain subdued. “Following a period of redundancies and hiring freezes made in response to economic turbulence and post-pandemic over-hiring, the tech sector is now looking to the future with a sense of cautious optimism.” said Jonny Edgar, Managing Director at ManpowerGroup Ireland. He said employers feel confident about the potential of AI to create more jobs than it replaces, and there’s a growing appetite for specialists in generative AI and machine learning. However, he said it is going to be a mixed picture “and it remains to be seen whether businesses’ optimistic attitude is reflected in the reality of hiring trends over the coming years”. The IT sector in Dublin is the most confident about recruitment, and has adopted AI more than elsewhere. \"The stability of a growing economy has given big tech the confidence to plan for growth, and most of that is increasingly concentrated in the capital,\" said Mr Edgar. He noted that Ireland’s GDP is projected to grow by 1.2pc this year and 3.6pc next year – the highest rate of any country in the Eurozone. \"With inflation cooling and workforce participation increasing, businesses have reason to be optimistic,\" he said.

(DC File Photo) London: Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. \"By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,\" the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission's original decision in 2017 accused the Silicon Valley giant of unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. Google made changes to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. The company started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. Google is also appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties involving its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence. Google is facing particular pressure over its digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial set to begin Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges the company holds a monopoly in the “ad tech” industry. British competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in “ad tech” while the EU is carrying out its own investigation.

    "article_text": "LONDON — Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc’s top court ruled against it Tuesday on a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Union’s top court rejected Google’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who’s expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission’s top official overseeing competition. Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened. Advertisement One of the takeaways from the Apple decision “is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their (collective) muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,” Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The Google ruling “reflects the growing confidence with which competition regulators worldwide are tackling the perceived excesses of the Big Tech companies,” said Gareth Mills, partner at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. The court’s willingness “to back the legal rationale and the level of fine will undoubtedly embolden the competition regulators further.” The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. Advertisement “We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,” Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. “Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,” Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court’s decision, saying it shows how the bloc’s competition law “remains highly relevant” in digital markets. “It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,” Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. “It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don’t need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.” Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of 4.125 billion euros ($4.55 billion) involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of 1.49 billion euros ($1.64 billion) over its AdSense advertising platform. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. European Commissioner and Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said that the shopping case was one of the first attempts to regulate a digital company and inspired similar efforts worldwide. “The case was symbolic because it demonstrated even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable. No one is above the law,” Vestager told a press briefing in Brussels. Advertisement Vestager said the commission will continue to open competition cases even as it enforces the Digital Markets Act. The DMA is a sweeping rulebook that forces Google and other tech giants to give consumers more choice by following a set of dos and don’ts. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. Vestager, who said she had been braced for defeat, hailed it as a landmark victory for “tax justice.” It was a surprise win for the commission, which has previously targeted Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat with tax rulings that were later overturned on appeal. They were part of the EU’s efforts to stamp out sweetheart deals that let companies pay little to no taxes in a fight that highlighted the debate over whether multinational corporations are paying their fair share around the world. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it “total political crap.” Then-U.S. President Donald Trump slammed Vestager, who spearheaded the campaign to root out special tax deals and crack down on big U.S. tech companies, as the “tax lady” who “really hates the U.S.”"

(AP Photo/Jens Meyer, File) (Jens Meyer, Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) LONDON – Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. Recommended Videos \"By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,\" the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. “We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,” Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. “Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,” Google said. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law “remains highly relevant\" in digital markets. \"Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival comparison shopping services were virtually invisible,\" director general Agustín Reyna said. “Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from clothes to washing machines.” Google is still appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties, which involved its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence. Google is now facing particular pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial that began Monday , the U.S. Department of Justice is alleging the company holds a monopoly in the “ad tech” industry. British competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in ad tech while the EU is carrying out its own investigation. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jason Smith, R-Mo., looks ahead to Tuesdays ABC News Presidential Debate and potential funding bill solutions. Workers in the tech sector are backing Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris , even as several prominent tech moguls have thrown their support behind former President Donald Trump. Workers at Google parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are donating millions of dollars to Harris' campaign, and those contributions outpace those of employees giving to the Trump campaign , according to data by political watchdog group OpenSecrets. The data includes donations made by company employees and owners, as well as workers' and owners' immediate family members. Employees at Alphabet have donated over $2.16 million to Harris' campaign, which is almost 40 times as much as they have given to Trump. Amazon and Microsoft employees and family members have donated $1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, to the Harris campaign. Those amounts are significantly more than the $116,000 from Amazon workers and the $88,000 from Microsoft workers, as well as their family members, given to the Trump campaign.

Donations from Meta workers to Harris have amounted to $835,000 versus $25,000 to Trump, while at Apple, workers' donations to Harris have reached $861,000 compared to $44,000 for Trump.

Nvidia Corp ( NASDAQ:NVDA ETR:NVD ) View Price & Profile NVIDIA’s AI strength keeps tech sector on bullish trajectory: analysts Published: 12:57 03 Sep 2024 EDT The stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into the year-end as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) 's earnings report and management commentary last week was the “missing piece” for the AI revolution bull thesis, analysts at Wedbush believe. Shares of NVIDIA traded down 7.8% at $110 in the early afternoon on Tuesday after investors spent the long weekend weighing up the chipamaker's underwhelming profit guidance. “While the initial reaction to these robust earnings/guidance from the Godfather of AI Jensen and NVIDIA was muted, we believe the underlying enterprise demand for AI is way outstripping supply and with Blackwell delay fears allayed we do not see anything getting in the way of this AI Revolution heading into year-end,” analysts wrote in a note to clients. They see AI starting with NVIDIA but the broader ramifications for the tech sector as a “4th Industrial revolution” being built out across semis, software, infrastructure, Internet, and smartphones over the next 12 to 18 months. Joining NVIDIA as a core driver of AI is Microsoft, with other tech stalwarts also playing a part including Oracle, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, and AMD among others. Wedbush’s analysts continue to estimate that for every $1 spent on an NVIDIA GPU chip, there is a $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector, which supports their “firmly bullish view” of tech stocks over the next year. “Taking a step back, Nvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape with its chips powering the AI Revolution and being the only game in town for now,” they wrote. Analysts noted that even though competitors such as AMD are ramping up, there is essentially $1 trillion in AI capital expenditure coming for NVIDIA over the next few years. “The cloud numbers and AI data points from Redmond, Amazon, and Google were very strong during earnings season the last few months as this indicates massive enterprise AI demand is now underway which was further confirmed by NVIDIA and the Godfather of AI last week and is a major bullish data point for the broader tech sector into year-end,” they wrote.

By Brian Gilmartin Stock Markets Published 09/02/2024, 02:34 AM S&P 500: Which Sectors Are Poised for Strong Earnings Growth in 2025? View all comments (0) 0 Brian Gilmartin Articles ( 1431 ) | My Homepage Follow US500 0.21% XLY 0.25% XLE 1.31% XLI 0.03% XLP 1.31% XLV 2.31% XLK -0.85% XLU 0.06% XLC 0.81% Despite Mag 7 price action, tech sector forward estimates are still rising. Looking at estimated earnings growth for full-year 2024 and 2025, note how the expected tech sector growth rates are trending: 2024 expected tech sector earnings growth has risen about 300 bps or 3% since early April ’24. 2025 expected tech sector earnings growth has risen about 200 bps since early ’24. For those looking for a head start on which sectors MIGHT outperform in ’25 as a function of rising sector earnings growth, peruse the calendar 2025 table for sectors with rising expected growth since April ’24. Here’s a list of the sectors. Energy sector growth for ’25 has risen over 400 bp’s since early April ’24; Healthcare sector growth for ’25 has risen over 700 – 800 bps since early April ’24 (Health care sector growth in ’24 has been cut in half the last 6 months so don’t ignore that); Industrial’s sector growth for ’25 has risen 120 bp’s since early April ’24; Basic Materials sector growth for ’25 has risen about 250 – 300 bps since early April ’24; Communication services sector growth has risen 290 bp’s since early ’24; Technology expected tech sector earnings growth has risen about 200 bps since early ’24; Utilities expected sector growth has risen about 100 bps since early ’24; Here’s a perspective that is rarely talked about in the mainstream financial media: which sectors are looking for the greatest changes in absolute earnings growth for 2025 (versus what is expected in 2024): Energy gets the prize currently: as of this week 2024 is expected to decline 11% on the year, versus an expected 14% growth rate for ’25; Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples are looking for similar (i.e flatter) growth rates in ’25 that are being seen in ’24; Industrial’s are expecting much faster growth in ’25 (+16%) versus ’24 (+3%). Health Care is also expecting much faster growth in ’25 (+21%) vs ’24’s (+6%); Basic Materials too, with +18% expected in ’25 vs -3% in ’24. Expected technology growth for ’25 as of today, while still seeing positive revisions, is almost expecting a growth rate in ’25 (+21%) that isn’t all that different from ’24’s +19%. The above sentence could be the reason why the Mag 7 and the tech sector stocks have suddenly gone flat the last 8 weeks. While sector estimates are rising, the absolute change in 2025 expected tech sector’s earnings growth is about the same rate of growth as being seen in ’24. Looking at the industrials, energy, and basic material sectors, the ’25 expected growth rates look like the industrial economy of America is poised for healthy growth in ’25. Those sectors are roughly 25% of the S&P 500 ’s market cap, with industrials being half the market cap weight of the three at 12%. Conclusion This article had an entirely different title and objective at the start, but the title was changed after writing this piece, which is exactly why you want to have a blog or do a podcast, i.e. so you lay out or articulate the thought process before concluding. While the goal of today’s blog was to talk about the still-rising earnings estimates in the tech sector, the article broadened out to include all sectors within the S&P 500 that are seeing rising sector growth (i.e. positive revisions) in 2025, which is somewhat of an unusual pattern. Also of note was the identification of sectors that will see the biggest absolute swings in expected growth in calendar 2025 (based on today’s estimates), versus 2024, hence readers can see the sectors with the biggest possible swings in growth for 2025. This weekend, this blog will be out with “Top 10 holdings” for clients and what portfolio changes have been made. Investment advisors, fund managers, and folks who manage their own money should already be thinking about what 2025 holds. There is a lot that can go right and wrong: stocks go up for many reasons, i.e. PE expansion, easier monetary policy (i.e. lower interest rates that generate lower discount rates), favorable (i.e. pro-business) tax and economic (fiscal) policies, favorable demographics, and vice versa. So far 2025 looks positive from an “expected 2025 S&P 500 EPS growth” perspective. S&P 500 EPS growth looks healthy, and with a possibly easier Federal Reserve, and a lower fed funds rate, you’d think the interest rate-sensitive sectors will outperform. That being said, which other sectors do you wish to overweight and which sectors do you want to avoid? *** None of this is advice or a recommendation, but only an opinion. Past performance is no guarantee of futures results. Investing can and does involve the loss of principal even for short periods of time.

    "article_text": "Vice President Kamala Harris recently unveiled an economic plan centered on price controls, wage hikes, and subsidies. While the tech industry is not specifically targeted in her proposals, the broader economic ramifications could spell trouble for the sector. Harris’s price controls, covering essentials like food, medicine, and housing, echo the failed attempts of the past, such as Richard Nixon’s price controls in the early 1970s. Nixon’s efforts may have temporarily masked inflation, but they led to shortages, required a price-control bureaucracy, created higher lobbying costs, reduced industrial production, and, ironically, led to higher prices in the long run. Price controls often hurt those they aim to help; price controls on food damage family farms and harm low-income households by decreasing supplies of controlled products in favor of higher-priced foods. Via AP Photo/Mike Stewart In the pharmaceutical industry, price controls have even more severe effects. A study of OECD pharmaceutical price controls finds that they suppressed research and development (R&D) budgets by billions, resulting in fewer new drugs, lower life expectancies, and increased overall healthcare costs. The consequences for small businesses are similarly grim. Artificially low prices squeeze out the least profitable, generally smallest or newest firms, often leaving only the largest corporations standing. What does this mean for the tech industry? While the wage hikes could accelerate the adoption of AI and automation—a potential boon for tech—the broader economic drag caused by price controls would likely dampen demand for tech products and services. Depressed incomes and production, coupled with the inevitable price surges once controls are lifted, could spell trouble for the sector. Moreover, someone must pay for the new, substantial subsidies, potentially costing between $1.7 trillion and $1.9 trillion over a decade. Funding this would likely require some combination of tax hikes or money printing—both of which could stifle the economy. Tax hikes would reduce aggregate investment , spending , and savings , thus suppressing gross domestic product. The likely consequence for tech are less R&D into artificial intelligence and reduced demand for the tech industry’s products. Alternatively, financing these subsidies through monetary expansion risks escalating inflation—a phenomenon the Biden-Harris administration has struggled to contain. Inflation suppresses the economy, erodes economic stability, and distorts financial decision-making. Not only would the resulting depressed demand hinder growth in the tech sector, but the industry would likely also see its costs rise faster than other areas of the economy. (Technically, the tech sector falls into business services . Its rate of asset turnover —the measure of how many days it would take for revenue to pay for assets—is below average across industries .) Compounding these issues are the Biden-Harris plans to regulate algorithmic pricing in housing. Suggesting regulations at this time could have a chilling effect on technological innovation. Even as research into algorithmic pricing remains nascent, Harris’s signaling of regulatory intentions could deter businesses from adopting new technologies, stifling the very innovation that drives the tech industry. Harris’s plan resembles a move toward a planned economy, which, as Ronald Reagan warned , equates to controlling people—using force and coercion to constrain the choices of workers, farmers, and businesses; choices that, if left to a free market, would benefit consumers. This heavy-handed approach is bad for the tech industry and bad for the economy as a whole. As the tech sector grapples with numerous business challenges and regulatory challenges, including the exploding regulatory regimes in Europe and aggressive antitrust at home, the broader economic implications of Harris’s plan should not be underestimated. What is presented as a path to economic improvement would instead lead to stagnation and diminished innovation in one of America’s most dynamic industries.

    "article_text": "0 Comments August 30, 2024 Kamala Harris Campaign Reclaims CA Tech Donor’s Support SAN FRANCISCO, CA (ANI) – Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is capitalizing on a network of former major donors, particularly from the tech industry, who were previously inactive during President Joe Biden’s campaign. According to Politico, Harris has raised nearly $59 million after Biden recused himself from the race. Of that $12.5 million came from donors in California. Notably, tech giants like Google, Apple, and Meta have been significant contributors, with Google and its parent company Alphabet donating $262,000, Apple $170,000, and Meta $81,000. Politico’s analysis reveals that Harris is poised to attract more donors from the tech industry, with over 10,000 Californians contributing to her 2019 campaign, including about 460 tech employees who raised around $400,000. The tech sector, which had leaned towards Republican nominee Donald Trump, is now showing substantial support for Harris. This shift includes many former supporters from her 2020 presidential run who had not contributed during her time as Biden’s vice president. Share With:"

Wall Street Analysts Say Buy the Dip Nisha Gopalan August 29, 2024 2 min read NVDA picture alliance / Contributor / Getty Images Key Takeaways While investors are underwhelmed by Nvidia's growth prospects, Wall Street analysts are sticking with their buy calls. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target to $155 from $115, noting strong demand for the company's Hopper chips and a Blackwell GPU that is now on track. Still, the shares were falling in Thursday morning trading. Investors have found Nvidia's ( NVDA ) latest results to be underwhelming, Wall Street is calling on them to buy the dip. Several Nvidia ( NVDA ) analysts came out in support of the artificial intelligence (AI) darling's \"strong\" quarterly results in notes after its slowing growth , reported last night, underwhelmed the market, sending its shares about 3% lower in early trading. Nvidia on Wednesday reported blockbuster quarterly earnings. The chipmaker's second-quarter revenue and net income more than doubled from last year, surpassing analysts' estimates. Its shares fell, however, as investors focused on signs of slowing growth at the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom. JPMorgan Lifts Target to $155, Blackwell Issues Sorted Out JPMorgan analysts raised their price target to $155 from $115 and reiterated their overweight call on the stock, noting strong demand for Nvidia's existing Hopper chips while the highly anticipated next-generation Blackwell GPU is now on track for production . \"While Blackwell shipments are pushed out as we expected by about 2 months, we do not believe this has any impact to the overall CY24/CY25 revenue profile as that void has been back-filled with Hopper shipment upside given the strong AI demand environment,\" JPMorgan wrote Thursday. Wedbush called the results \"masterful.\" For every $1 spent on the company's GPU chip, the broker said, there would be \"a $8-$10 multiplier across the tech sector.\" \"AI GPU demand is way outstripping supply for Nvidia at this juncture and the Street should come away from these results as a very bullish indicator for the broader tech sector with more shock and awe rather than a shrug of the shoulders in our view,\" wrote Wedbush, which maintained an outperform rating. Jefferies said that while the earnings beat fell short of expectations, what was important was that the Blackwell delay \"is in the rearview mirror, while Hopper demand remained strong.\" Jefferies has a buy rating on Nvidia. HSBC maintained its buy call and $145 target price on the stock. Bank of America raised its target to $165 from $150. Read the original article on Investopedia .

Devdiscourse News Desk | Wellington | Updated: 29-08-2024 12:16 IST | Created: 29-08-2024 12:16 IST The latest measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024-25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill, has passed its first reading in Parliament. Image Credit: Country: New Zealand SHARE The New Zealand Government is continuing its efforts to bolster the economy and provide a more secure future for businesses and individuals, as highlighted by Revenue Minister Simon Watts. The latest measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024-25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill, has passed its first reading in Parliament. Minister Watts emphasized that the Bill aligns with the Government’s commitment to improving economic conditions in New Zealand. A key feature of the Bill is a streamlined approach to applying tax relief for future emergency events, such as earthquakes and floods. “The Bill proposes that tax relief can be activated by Order in Council, rather than relying on primary legislation, which will lead to a quicker government response and faster recovery for those affected,” said Minister Watts. “This will provide earlier certainty for taxpayers during emergency events and ensure that the system is prepared in advance.” In addition to enhancing emergency response measures, the Bill introduces provisions aimed at supporting the economic future of young people. One such provision will allow individuals under 16 to enroll in KiwiSaver with the signature of just one guardian, simplifying the process, particularly for children of parents who are separated. “We want to help young people secure their economic future by making it easier for them to start saving early,” Minister Watts explained. The Bill also includes several other measures designed to strengthen the economy and support businesses: Pension Fund Transfers: It will become easier to transfer pension funds from selected countries, including the UK, to New Zealand schemes. Business Capital Access: Eligible businesses will have improved access to capital by allowing borrowers to register retrospectively for the approved issuer levy in certain circumstances. Support for the Tech Sector: The Bill proposes increasing the thresholds related to exempt employee share schemes, which will particularly benefit start-ups and the tech sector. Minister Watts noted that the Government passes legislation annually to set tax rates for the following year and to introduce changes that simplify the system and boost productivity. “We have started to see signs of our economy moving back in the right direction, but it is not job done. This Bill includes various changes to ensure we’re all better off,” he added. READ MORE ON: Simon Watts Advertisement POST / READ COMMENTS"

WATCH HERE Tech stocks led gains, adding 2.05%, as investors parsed quarterly results from artificial intelligence heavyweight Nvidia . The AI chipmaker beat expectations and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the ongoing quarter, but traders had been hoping for a stronger beat and shares were lower in premarket and early trade. Germany's DAX index closed at a fresh record high above 18,900 points. Weak gross domestic product growth has weighed on sentiment around the euro area's biggest economy; however, more positive data came Thursday, as headline annual inflation on an EU-harmonized basis eased more than expected to 2% in August . Economists had been expecting a reading of 2.3%, compared to the previous month's 2.6% print. Spain's preliminary harmonized inflation, meanwhile, came in at 2.4% for August, down from July's 2.9% reading and below economists' 2.5% prediction. The inflation data fueled expectations for further European Central Bank interest rate cuts, dragging the euro 0.4% lower against the U.S. dollar to $1.1076, and 0.17% lower against the British pound, to 84 pence. Markets have fully priced a September rate cut of 25 basis points following June's first move lower , with a significant chance of two more follow-up cuts this year. Elsewhere, shares of French beverage maker Pernod Ricard jumped Thursday, before paring gains. The company reported a 1% drop in net sales for its full fiscal year but said it was expecting sales to grow again looking ahead. Shares closed 2% higher. Remy Cointreau shares, meanwhile, gained 3%. It comes after Reuters reported that China's commerce ministry said it would not impose provisional anti-dumping subsidies on brandy imported from the European Union. Both Pernod Ricard and Remy Cointreau make brandy. Shares of German food delivery firm Delivery Hero rose 12.5% after the company said Thursday it plans to list its Middle East business , Talabat, on the Dubai stock exchange.

Nvidia Corp ( NASDAQ:NVDA ETR:NVD ) View Price & Profile NVIDIA earnings could be pivotal to a tech sector revival Published: 08:42 28 Aug 2024 EDT NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) upcoming earnings report, set to be released after Wednesday's close, is being hailed by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives as the most crucial of the year, with the potential to shape market trends far beyond 2024. The chipmaker, whose CEO is described colorfully by the Ives as the \"Godfather of AI,\" is at the heart of a generational shift in technology, with its GPUs seen as the essential \"new oil and gold\" for the tech sector. Its dominance in AI chip production, coupled with an anticipated $1 trillion in AI capital expenditure over the coming years, places Nvidia at the center of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This report is expected to confirm massive enterprise demand and validate NVIDIA's critical role in the AI landscape. \"We continue to estimate for every $1 spent on an NVIDIA GPU chip there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the tech sector which speaks to our firmly bullish view of tech stocks over the next year,\" said Ives in a note. As for the specifics, the giant is expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share on $28.24 billion in revenue, with a \"whisper number\" of $0.71 per share, according to a report carried by Forbes. The stock, already up over 160% this year, is trading near record highs, reflecting its status as a bellwether for both the tech sector and the broader market. Beyond NVIDIA, investors will also be monitoring Salesforce, expected to rebound after a soft quarter, as tech spending on AI continues to drive larger deals. With the Federal Reserve poised to begin a rate-cutting cycle and macroeconomic conditions favoring a soft landing, this report could serve as a catalyst for tech stocks moving higher into 2025, solidifying Nvidia’s role as the key player in the ongoing AI revolution.

Suggested Reading The 7 best cities in America to celebrate Thanksgiving What's more expensive on your Thanksgiving menu this year? The 5 best cities in America for veterans — and the 5 worst The Cupertino, California-based tech giant laid off 100 workers in its digital services group, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The services teams for the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore, were hardest hit. Related Content OpenAI does damage control after a top exec talked government support for its spending spree Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang backtracks after saying 'China is going to win the AI race' Other impacted teams included Apple News and engineering roles, according to the publication. The people told Bloomberg that the move was part of a “shift in priorities” for the services unit. Apple did not immediately reply to Quartz’s request for comment. Books, in particular, has become less of a focus for Apple, according to Bloomberg, but the app is still expected to receive future updates. On the other hand, News will continue to be a priority, despite the cuts. While Apple has not been in the business of slashing its headcount, this is not the iPhone maker’s first reduction this year. In March, Apple notified 614 workers across its California offices that they would be let go in late May. In January, Apple said it would be shutting down its 121-person team that works on AI features in San Diego, giving employees an ultimatum to relocate or face layoffs. One month later, the tech giant cancelled its autonomous car program and gave some employees in the division three months to find reassignments within the company — or be laid off. This year so far, 412 tech companies have had layoffs, affecting 134,061 employees, according to tech sector layoff tracker layoffs.fyi . While 2023 was a bloodbath, with massive cuts at some of the largest tech companies, including Microsoft (MSFT) , Google (GOOGL) , and Amazon (AMZN) , 2024 has not been much better. Many of those same companies started the year by carrying out cuts that numbered in the thousands. And that has continued well into the year, with other tech giants looking to trim layers and expenses. Intel (INTC) , for example, recently announced that it will be cutting about 15% of its workforce, or 15,000 jobs, as part of a cost-cutting plan . 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed Monday's high and low performers and told investors weakness in the tech sector is not enough to warrant buying just yet. \"At this point, there's going to be a lot more Nasdaq weakness. So, please be ready to do some buying, but just not yet,\" he said. \"Too early in the rotation.\" Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE While the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high, the S&P 500 declined 0.32% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.85%. Cramer suggested that some on Wall Street sold secular companies with consistent earnings in order to rotate into cyclical stocks that do well when interest rates come down. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stocked investors' hopes that rate cuts are imminent, saying \"the time has come for policy to adjust\" at the central bank's annual retreat last week. However, Powell did not give specifics about the timing or extent of the cuts. Cramer warned that \"right now, the best are being thrown out with the worst,\" and named several tech stocks to watch that are currently down: Nvidia , Amazon , Meta , AMD and Micron . He said Nvidia needs to see a pullback if it is going to rally this week postearnings. He praised the business acumen of Amazon and Meta, adding that there is demand for AMD and Micron products. \"I want to keep the buy list small because I think there'll be many more days like this to come,\" Cramer said. \"There's just not enough money raised so far to think that tech has bottomed. The sales are not covering the buys.\" Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

    "article_text": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, voiced his concerns about Pavel Durov's arrest, highlighting its implications for the future of software and free speech in Europe. Durov's Arrest Shakes the Tech Industry The arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, was a major story last night, as some may already be aware. The whole thing began when Durov while refueling on a private plane in France, was wanted only minutes before touchdown. Since Durov is also a citizen of France, the billionaire faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on all charges. Every credible person in the tech industry, and the cryptocurrency industry in particular, has spoken out about the situation. Vitalik Buterin's (Ethereum's co-founder) viewpoint stands out as the most intriguing, U.Today shares. It is for this reason that Buterin has voiced his concern on the potential implications of this arrest for the future of software and freedom of speech in Europe. Buterin Highlights the Risks of Centralization According to Buterin, this case shows how the internet industry is changing, with platforms being criticized for being too centralized and not following the rules. Buterin has already addressed other technological concerns, including the dangers of centralized artificial intelligence and monitoring, centralized identification systems, and political attacks on encrypted messaging. To solve these problems, he advocated decentralized technology and finance. Toncoin Price Drops After Durov's Arrest In the meantime, the price of Toncoin (TON), which is the native token of the TON blockchain, which is tied to Telegram, has dropped by about twenty percent in response to the news. The current price of each coin is $5.68 as of this moment. Overnight, the total locked value of the TON blockchain had a significant drop, going from $790 million to $297 million. This was a direct result of the collapse that was observed within the network."

    "article_text": "Tristan Greene Aug 23, 2024 Analysts come unglued ahead of Nvidia earnings call — $10T within 5 years The Sept. 28 earnings report is being called the most important event of the year for the stock market. Listen 0:00 9239 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Tech giant Nvidia will hold its second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 28, and analysts are having a field day discussing the potential implications. With investors expecting to see profits of more than double year-over-year as well as record-breaking revenue, many stock market insiders are calling it the event of the year. Nvidia’s stock has been on a rocket to the moon for the past two years. In 2022, at its lowest, the company’s stocks dropped to around $11 a share, giving it a market capitalization of approximately $250 billion. In the mid-2024 market, that would place it slightly beneath Toyota in cap value. As of Aug. 23, Nvidia is trading at $128.52. This makes it the second most valuable company in the world by market cap ($3.166 trillion), trailing only Apple ($3.443 trillion). Q2 earnings The second quarter wasn’t particularly kind to the tech industry. While there were some outliers in Apple and Meta, nearly every other technology outfit in the top 20 ended the quarter with stock trending downward over a 30-day period. Related: Tech stocks plummet as Intel nosedives, Nvidia faces antitrust probe Now that Nvidia is finally set to report its earnings, the calculus around the tech industry’s overall performance may change. Analysts are predicting the company’s Q2 earnings and revenue will break the records set in the first quarter of 2024. Analyst optimism An analyst for Los Angeles-based private investment firm Wedbush, Dan Ives, told news outlet Quartz that he was expecting the Nvidia call to be the “most important week for the stock market this year and potentially in years.” Another analyst, Ethan Feller of the Zacks investment research firm, wrote that the earnings call could set Nvidia on the path toward a $10 trillion market capitalization within the next five years if current trends continue. While these predictions may seem optimistic, it bears mentioning that Nvidia stock has compounded at an annual rate of nearly 100% over the past five years.

This marks the first time since 1998 that Sweden has experienced a negative net migration of Indian-born residents. Live TV Share Advertisement Indians, however, remain one of the largest groups of new immigrants to Sweden, just behind Ukrainians. (Photo: Getty/Representational Image) India Today World Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Aug 23, 2024 15:12 IST Written By: Girish Kumar Anshul Many Indians move abroad for better prospects. Traditionally, countries like the US, UK, and Canada have been popular choices for Indian students and professionals seeking better opportunities. In a surprising twist, however, the trend has reversed in Sweden, a European country, which has seen more Indians leaving than moving in. Between January and June 2024, Sweden saw a dramatic increase in the number of Indian-born individuals leaving the country, with 2,837 departures -- a massive 171% rise compared to the 1,046 departures in the same period last year. advertisement This makes Indians the largest group of emigrants from Sweden, surpassing those from Iraq, China, and Syria, according to Statistics Sweden. This decline might be influenced by recent challenges, including tech sector lay-offs and stricter work permit regulations. The Indian population in Sweden was 58,094 in 2023, according to Statistics Sweden. FIRST NEGATIVE NET MIGRATION SINCE 1998 This shift marks the first time since at least 1998 that Sweden has experienced a negative net migration of Indian-born residents in the first half of the year. From 1998 to 2010, a total of 24,034 residence permits were granted to Indians. Of these, 61.2% (14,705) were for work, 25.8% (6,200) were for studies, 9.6% (2,307) were for family reunification, 3.1% (747) were for adoptions, and 0.3% (75) were for humanitarian reasons, according to a report by the European University Institute. Robin Sukhia, secretary-general and CEO of the Sweden-India Business Council, cautioned against drawing immediate conclusions. “We do not believe there is a single reason for this change. It’s likely due to various factors, including high living costs, a shortage of service apartments, and general accommodation issues. A full-year assessment is needed to understand the trend,” Sukhia told The Local Sweden. INDIANS STILL KEY IMMIGRANTS, JUST BEHIND UKRAINIANS Despite this increase in emigration, Indians are still one of the largest groups of new immigrants to Sweden in 2024, coming in second only to Ukrainians, according to The Local Sweden. A total of 2,461 Indian-born individuals moved to Sweden between January and June 2024, down from 3,681 in the same period last year. Excluding the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, this represents the lowest level of Indian immigration since 2017. The decline follows years of consistent growth driven by strengthening diplomatic ties and Sweden’s efforts to attract skilled professionals to address gaps in sectors like technology. \"Prior to this, Indian immigration had been on an uninterrupted climb since 2009, following strengthening diplomatic ties and the Nordic country’s drive to attract highly-skilled students, researchers and labour migrants to plug skills gaps in especially the tech sector,\" reported The Local Sweden. advertisement However, recent challenges such as lay-offs in the tech sector and stricter work permit regulations are impacting this trend. The number of work permits granted to highly skilled immigrants fell by 20% in the first half of 2024 compared to the previous year, with first-time work permits for Indian citizens decreasing by 30%. These developments reflect the evolving challenges faced by Indian nationals in Sweden and indicate potential shifts in the country’s immigration dynamics. - Ends Published By: Yudhajit Published On: Aug 23, 2024 Watch Live TV"

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST HSINCHU, Taiwan: Taiwan's technology industry has always been a male-dominated sector, but one major player is looking to tap the female talent pool amid a manpower shortage. To do that, MediaTek - the world’s largest smartphone chip maker - is aiming to change the gender imbalance through education. Among its initiatives is organising camps for high school girls from across Taiwan, in the hopes that they will eventually join the industry. “I’m interested in writing computer programs during computer classes in school, so I joined the camp,” said one participant. “I learnt a lot from the professors and female engineers. They've cultivated my interest in technology and I plan to head towards this career direction.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading FEW FEMALE EMPLOYEES Female workers only make up about a quarter of the workforce in the technology industry, noted MediaTek Foundation executive secretary Cynthia Feng. In the semiconductor industry and other related sectors such as electrical engineering and electronic information, female graduates account for an even smaller proportion - 13 to 15 per cent, she added. Based on research papers she has published, stereotypes may have hampered females from pursuing careers in the tech industry, she told CNA. \"Girls seem to lose interest in math and technology between the ages of 10 and 14 because of the perception of their roles in the society or lack of confidence in their own abilities,” she said. Currently, MediaTek’s female employees account for 20 per cent of its total workforce - a proportion it is looking to increase in a bid to boost innovation. “Adding women’s perspectives would help to find a more innovative and comprehensive solution to a problem,” she said. It also hopes to recruit more females to fill the job gaps, as the tech industry struggles with talent shortage due to a shrinking birth rate and competition with international tech giants. Based on a recent survey conducted by a local job bank, more than 50 per cent of Taiwan's tech companies are hiring. Currently, there are more than 100,000 job openings just for engineers. Related: Taiwan chip giant TSMC's survival in focus as cross-strait tensions grow BEING A WOMAN IN THE TECH INDUSTRY Ms Katherine Kao, who has been working as an engineer for MediaTek for seven years, said the company provides flexible work hours for female workers who may need to strike a balance between home and work. However, there are challenges that come with being one of few females in the firm, the 30-year-old added. “For instance, when delegating challenging tasks that require more effort, managers would worry whether women could handle them. So if I want to take on challenging or difficult tasks, I would have to really take the initiative to ask for it,” she said. Still, Ms Kao believes perceptions are changing now as the industry is actively seeking to tap the female workforce. “Some people probably think that boys have better logic and can better adapt to the technology industry. Maybe they are more suitable for work like coding and other more difficult tasks. But girls are just as intelligent as boys,” she said.

    "article_text": "AGENDA Hide and seek: where are the women in the tech sector? Business Technology By Silka Patel Share 0 Comments Silka Patel (Image: Contributed) This article is brought to you by our exclusive subscriber partnership with our sister title USA Today, and has been written by our American colleagues. It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. I don't know about you, but I (sometimes) become a little irritated from continually shouting to the rafters about the need for more women in the tech sector. I’ve done it for most of my career, but at times, I still don’t feel heard (and I know I’m not alone). While the industry might also feel they are saying the right things, much of what is said is all talk with little action and poor peer visibility to facilitate change. That’s why I wasn’t surprised when the British Computer Society released figures estimating that the UK tech sector is \"missing\" half a million women. This follows individuals leaving the sector because of personal circumstances, the impact of the pandemic or not being supported by their organisation. Current data estimates that women make up anywhere from 20 to 26 per cent of those working in the UK tech sector. This isn’t ideal, but the leaky pipeline begins long before women reach the workplace. Growing up, girls were told that they could be anything, achieve anything and had the potential to smash through that glass ceiling all while screaming at the top of their lungs to make sure others knew they were on their meteoric rise to the top. For those who then moved on to study STEM subjects, this was likely when that championing stopped and they found that there were no peers like them and limited platform to allow them to thrive; marking the start of the leaky pipeline. But it’s not just those starting out who become disillusioned with the sector. Even role models in the sector - those who are the same gender, sexuality, from the same ethnic or socio-economic background - feel pressure to be an ambassador for future generations. If the pipeline was self-fulfilling, this pressure wouldn’t exist as there would be enough women to support and champion those coming into the sector and those developing through it. Enacting any change starts at the grassroots and (I believe) in smaller cohorts. Often, I’ve found that round table conversations are more impactful than large-scale conferences as targeted, action-focused conversations mean that change will happen, and the cycle of challenges being discussed will stop. We need to maintain a little realism though. For example, it’s no good committing to recruit women who have invested their time in upskilling to re-enter the workforce or train mentors to then change the goalposts at the last minute. So, when it comes to bringing more women into the sector (and ensuring they don’t escape from the pipeline), it’s time that organisations and the broader sector in general stop overpromising with a side of under-delivery. Once the ecosystem starts doing that, perhaps I'll be able to save my voice a little…. But until then, I WILL ALWAYS CHAMPION THE INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN THE TECH SECTOR. There, I said it.

What Happened : Karp, in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, suggested that the rise of Trump was a direct result of the “excesses” of Silicon Valley. He specifically pointed to the detachment of tech moguls from the average American and their support for policies that exempt them from bearing the costs. He said, “I don’t believe you would have a Trump phenomenon without the excesses of Silicon Valley.” Karp, who initially supported President Joe Biden before switching to Vice President Kamala Harris , also criticized the tech industry’s lack of accountability and the divisive content on their platforms. See Also: Bitcoin Could Soar 200% This Cycle If This Happens Palantir, a company founded by Karp and Peter Thiel in 2003, provides data-mining and analytics software to government and law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Defense, the FBI, and the CIA. The company also supplies artificial intelligence models to military forces, including those of Israel and Ukraine. Why It Matters: The timing of Karp’s comments is significant as Palantir has been in the spotlight recently . The company’s stock surged after reporting strong second-quarter earnings and announcing a new partnership with Microsoft Corp . This collaboration aims to enhance data analytics and AI services for the U.S. Defense and Intelligence Community. Additionally, the broader context of Silicon Valley’s political influence is underscored by Mark Cuban ‘s recent remarks. Cuban criticized the tech industry’s desire to position Trump as a CEO-like figure for the country . The political landscape is further complicated by venture capitalist David Sacks , who hosted a high-profile fundraiser for Trump. Sacks, who has supported various political figures, believes the recent legal challenges against Trump will only bolster his support. Read Next: What’s Going On With Rocket Lab Stock Today?

    "article_text": "Tristan Greene Aug 16, 2024 California removes teeth from AI law without addressing tech’s core concerns The law appears more corporate-friendly, but the implications for consumers are a bit murkier. Listen 0:00 1814 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED California lawmakers have amended a controversial bill that would hold artificial intelligence firms accountable for harms caused by their products in response to industry criticism. However, it’s unclear if the state’s concessions will be enough to convince naysayers in the tech industry. The bill, called the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act (SB-1074), essentially seeks to protect whistleblowers and empower the state of California to intervene if it has reason to believe an AI-related catastrophe is going to occur. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the tech industry is in a bit of an uproar over the bill’s stipulations , with many tech luminaries saying it would stifle innovation and growth. Stifling innovation In its original format, the bill would have allowed the state to sue firms for negligence over lax safety practices, even if the violations didn’t result in a catastrophic event. It would have also created a government oversight board responsible for implementing and enforcing said safety practices. After negative feedback from the tech industry, including a comprehensive list of suggestions from AI firm Anthropic, California Senator Scott Weiner claimed his office was under the belief it had found a happy medium: “We accepted a number of very reasonable amendments proposed, and I believe we’ve addressed the core concerns expressed by Anthropic and many others in the industry,” Core concerns However, based on the bill’s new language, it appears lawmakers still haven’t addressed the tech world’s core concern. Whether the state can sue prior to a catastrophe or merely issue injunctions is tangential to the essential problem of liability. SB-1074 would still allow the state to hold any AI developer responsible for harm caused by their products. In many cases, it’s near impossible to predict all the ways that “harm” could manifest from an AI model. The bill’s next step is a final assembly vote, which, according to the schedule, must be held prior to Aug. 31. At that point, unless the governor decides to veto it, technology firms operating in the state of California will face a regulatory environment unlike any other in the country.

    "article_text": "Synopsis The bill has sparked fierce debate in the tech industry, with Silicon Valley giants, academics and investors taking sides on whether to regulate a nascent technology that has been hyped for both its benefits and its dangers. The bill would no longer create a new agency for AI safety, instead shifting regulatory duties to the existing California Government Operations Agency. And companies would be liable for violating the law only if their technologies caused real harm or imminent dangers to public safety. Agencies California lawmakers have amended a bill that would create new restrictions for artificial intelligence , paving the way for first-of-their-kind safety rules that could set new standards for how tech companies develop their systems. The State Assembly's Appropriations Committee voted Thursday to endorse an amended version of the bill, SB 1047, which would require companies to test the safety of powerful AI technologies before releasing them to the public. California's attorney general would be able to sue companies if their technologies caused serious harm, such as mass property damage or human casualties. The bill has sparked fierce debate in the tech industry, with Silicon Valley giants, academics and investors taking sides on whether to regulate a nascent technology that has been hyped for both its benefits and its dangers. Sen. Scott Wiener, the author of the bill, made several concessions in an effort to appease tech industry critics like OpenAI , Meta and Google. The changes also reflect some suggestions made by another prominent startup, Anthropic. The bill would no longer create a new agency for AI safety, instead shifting regulatory duties to the existing California Government Operations Agency. And companies would be liable for violating the law only if their technologies caused real harm or imminent dangers to public safety. Previously, the bill allowed for companies to be punished for failing to adhere to safety regulations even if no harm had yet occurred. \"The new amendments reflect months of constructive dialogue with industry, startup and academic stakeholders,\" said Dan Hendrycks, a founder of the nonprofit Center for AI Safety in San Francisco, which helped write the bill. A Google spokesperson said the company's previous concerns \"still stand.\" Anthropic said it was still reviewing the changes. OpenAI and Meta declined to comment on the amended bill. Wiener said in a statement Thursday that \"we can advance both innovation and safety; the two are not mutually exclusive.\" He said he believed the amendments addressed many of the tech industry's concerns. The Democratic-majority Legislature is expected to pass the bill by the end of the month. It would then go to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has not said whether he supports it. If the bill is signed, California will again be a step ahead of the federal government on tech regulation. California's Legislature has helped shape U.S. tech consumer protections with a 2020 privacy law that curbed the collection of user data and a 2022 child online safety law. Opponents of the AI bill have argued that it would discourage tech giants from sharing the software code underlying their artificial intelligence with other businesses and software developers -- a practice known as open source. They believe this would choke the progress of smaller AI companies. While the amendments alleviated some issues and improved on the earlier version, \"the open source software community still rightly has concerns that this will be a damper on AI development,\" said Chris Nicholson, a partner with Page One Ventures, a venture capital firm. Several candidates for mayor in San Francisco, where much of the AI startup community is based, have questioned the bill. \"San Francisco's reputation as a leader in technology and innovation is because we embrace new ideas and serve as a sanctuary for research and development, and SB 1047 clearly threatens our brand and leadership,\" said Mark Farrell, a former interim mayor and current candidate. Lauren Wagner, an investor and researcher who has worked for both Google and Meta, said the amended version of the bill was an improvement. But she argued that regulation of AI should be a federal issue, not something for state lawmakers. \"This seems like something the federal government should take on,\" she said. \"This is not light touch.\" Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

We’ve seen strong signs of great momentum in Alberta’s tech sector over the last five years and we continue to build on that momentum.” “In the first half of 2024, Alberta companies raised an impressive $383 million across 41 deals. That has pushed us 33 per cent ahead of British Columbia, with Alberta companies securing $95 million more than our western neighbours. This is a big deal. This is the first time we’ve surpassed B.C., but I don’t think it’s the last time that it’s going to happen; rather, this is a sign of things to come.” “Alberta’s tech sector is growing very fast and it’s an exciting place to be. I’m betting on Alberta’s innovators to take us to even higher heights. Our tech sector has been maturing for a while, but in the last five years we’ve hit it into overdrive.” “This has been in the works for a long time, and we’ve been building a strong foundation with our investments in Alberta Enterprise Corporation, Alberta Innovates, and our partnerships with post-secondary institutions. Albertans, especially those in the technology and innovation space, know I am a tireless advocate, selling Alberta’s tech successes and inviting investors to participate in that success. I’ve been talking to the venture funds from across North America to say there’s something special happening in Alberta and it would be irresponsible of you to not pay attention.” “This approach is paying off, as seen by the 2.5 per cent year-over-year increase in the number of deals in Alberta—a stark contrast to the declines seen in the rest of Canada and the U.S. This is good news for Alberta, and we should be proud of what our tech sector is delivering. It’s a sign of a bright future.” Related information Canadian Venture Capital Market Overview"

    "article_text": "Welcome, Mickey mickey@disney.com Manage MyDisney Account Log Out TECHNOLOGY Tech giant Cisco reportedly may undergo second round of layoffs affecting thousands of workers By DeJuan Hoggard Tuesday, August 13, 2024 In February, Cisco laid off an estimated 4,000 employees. Some of those employees worked at the company's Research Triangle Park campus. RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (WTVD) -- A major shakeup could soon come to the tech industry as stalwart giant Cisco may be undergoing another round of layoffs as early as Wednesday. Reuters first reported the news that thousands of employees across the company could receive pink slips this week. Cisco did not return a request for comment from ABC11. In February, Cisco laid off an estimated 4,000 employees. Some of those employees worked at the company's Research Triangle Park campus. \"Google's cut back, Microsoft's cut back. So this would not be unique for Cisco,\" said North Carolina State University economist and professor Michael Walden. The move to reduce its workforce, which the company refers to as \"limited restructuring,\" is said to be so that the company can focus more on its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. \"That might seem ironic because AI is obviously a technology that's coming out of the tech sector,\" said Walden. \"But one of the expectations with AI is it's probably going to replace a lot of people at their jobs, including those in the tech sector.\" Walden said he expected upward of half a million jobs to be affected by AI technology -- either a job replaced or a job created. Wednesday, the company's CEO is scheduled to address investors and deliver a quarterly earnings report. \"The way I read it right now is it's not necessarily that Cisco was underperforming compared to the other tech companies, but they may feel as if they're underperforming compared to how they performed in the past, and how the entire tech sector is performing right now,\" said Walden. Cisco is Durham County's fourth largest employer and boasts itself as North Carolina's 47th largest. \"I don't want to minimize the trauma of someone being laid off, it's very much, very traumatic for them,\" said Walden. \"But if you had to be in a market where you have to be where you're well-credentialed, maybe a college degree and you have to get a different job, this is a market you want to be in, rather than some of the other markets in the country.\" No word on how many RTP employees, if any, might be affected.

Report us Related Topics Taxes high-tech Israeli Innovation Authority High-tech has long been touted as the driving force behind Israel’s economy, but new data from the Innovation Authority underscores just how crucial the sector is. In 2021, high-tech workers and companies contributed 36% of the nation’s income tax, with revenues likely surging even further in recent years. In a report titled “High-Tech Sector's Contribution to State Revenues from Individuals and Companies,\" the Innovation Authority and the Chief Economist Division of the Ministry of Finance reveal that in 2020, about a quarter of all tax payments in Israel from companies and wages came from high-tech. 2 View gallery Tel Aviv skyline ( Photo: Shutterstock ) Furthermore, in 2021, employees in the high-tech industry were responsible for approximately 36% of income tax payments. At a time when budget cuts are affecting almost every industry, the Innovation Authority aims to demonstrate that harming high-tech workers directly impacts one of the most significant sources of state revenue. Most of the income from the high-tech industry is linked to employees, with 85% of this revenue coming from taxes on wages, including income tax, national insurance and health insurance. Only 15% comes from corporate tax. Over a period of six years, nearly 100 billion shekels were collected from the income tax payments of high-tech workers, which make up a third of the income tax revenue during this period. Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, said: \"This publication emphasizes the strategic importance of the high-tech sector to the Israeli economy and state revenues. For the first time, we present a comprehensive review of the various tax contributions from high-tech workers and companies. High-tech serves as the ‘growth engine’ of the economy and its 'shock absorber' during crises. The insights from this analysis reinforce the importance of government action to protect the sector and ensure its continued growth, even during economic slowdowns.” The report highlights a significant gap between high-tech workers and the rest of the economy: the average monthly income tax payment of a high-tech worker in 2021 was 6,966 NIS, 6.3 times the average for the rest of the economy. The Israeli economy is increasingly reliant on income tax payments from high-tech: between 2016 and 2021, income tax collection from high-tech workers increased by about 66% in real terms. 2 View gallery ( Photo: Shutterstock ) Foreign companies such as Nvidia, Intel and Google play a significant role in the local high-tech industry, both through their purchases and their contribution to innovation. Despite their workers representing only about 20%-25% of the total high-tech workforce, and foreign companies constituting only 0.3% of all business companies – their contribution accounts for more than a third of the total high-tech contribution to state revenues, both in terms of work-related taxes and corporate tax. Unsurprisingly, most of the state's revenues come from the center of the country, reflecting the underrepresentation of certain populations in high-tech. In 2021, 57% of tax payments came from the dominant group of employees in the industry—men, Jewish (non-ultra-Orthodox), working in central Israel and Tel Aviv. The report also reveals that women contribute less than 19% of the income tax in high-tech, which is lower than their relative share in the field (about a third). On average, a high-tech worker paid NIS 3,508 in income tax per month in 2021, which is six times more than workers in other sectors, who paid an average of NIS 583 per month. Almost 97% of income tax payments in 2021 from high-tech companies came from Jewish workers (non-ultra-Orthodox), totaling more than 21 billion shekels. The report's authors estimate that, based on the increase in the number of high-tech employees between 2021 and 2023, along with the rise in the average salary in the sector, the direct contribution of the high-tech sector to state revenues and its share of overall revenue have likely increased during these years. << Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram >> Comments New comment The commenter agrees to the privacy policy of Ynet News and agrees not to submit comments that violate the terms of use , including incitement, libel and expressions that exceed the accepted norms of freedom of speech. send comment \" \""

    "article_text": "Jerusalem, Aug 13 : Israel's hi-tech sector contributes more than a third of the national income tax, according to a report jointly issued by the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) and the Finance Ministry on Tuesday. The IIA said in a statement that this rate points to the Israeli hi-tech sector as a key driver of the country's economy. The report provided a first-of-its-kind examination of state revenues related to hi-tech employment, including income tax and corporate tax payments, aiming to adjust government policy and investments by assessing how sector changes impact the economy. In 2021, about 36 per cent of all tax payments in Israel came from the hi-tech sector, with 85 per cent of the revenue related to its workers and only 15 percent from corporate tax, according to the report, Xinhua news agency reported. It added that the average monthly income tax payment of a hi-tech worker in Israel in 2021 was 6.3 times the average for the rest of the economy, reflecting the sector's substantial contribution to state revenues. Between 2016 and 2021, income tax collection from hi-tech workers increased by 66 percent in real terms, indicating that the Israeli economy is increasingly dependent on income tax payments from hi-tech workers. According to the report's authors, based on the increase in the number of high-tech employees between 2021 and 2023, along with the rise in the average salary in the sector, the direct contribution of the high-tech sector to state revenues and its share of overall revenue have likely increased during these years."

    "article_text": "In a landmark decision, a U.S. judge recently ruled that Google violated antitrust law by spending billions of dollars to create an illegal monopoly as the world’s default search engine. The ruling, certainly the first major win for federal authorities against Big Tech’s market dominance in over two decades. This could therefore lead to significant changes in how Google operates. The Ruling U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta, in his 277-page decision , found that Google abused its dominance in the search market by monopolizing search queries on smartphones and browsers, thereby throttling competition and harming consumers. This violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act mirrors some of the most significant antitrust cases in U.S. history, including the breakup of AT&T’s telephone monopoly, Standard Oil, and Microsoft’s illegal bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Google currently controls approximately 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones. The ruling is a substantial victory for the Department of Justice. The institution has been increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of antitrust cases against major tech companies. The last significant antitrust ruling in the tech industry targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago. The Aftermath The ruling marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing efforts by U.S. regulators to rein in Big Tech’s market power. Over the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple, accusing these companies of illegally maintaining monopolies. Despite the ruling, the road ahead remains complex. Google has after that stated that it plans to appeal the decision, which could prolong the legal battle into 2026. The upcoming “remedy” phase could consequently involve lengthy legal proceedings, including potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court. This decision has the potential to reshape the competitive landscape of the tech industry. If the ruling leads to a breakup of Google, it would mark one of the most significant regulatory actions against a technology company in history."

    "article_text": "A US ruling against Google has been seen as a potentially seismic moment for the company and the tech sector given its control of search and its related advertising business. — Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa LONDON: Google has illegally exploited its dominance in the search engine market to stifle competition, a judge in the US has ruled. The case has been seen as a potentially seismic moment for Google and the tech sector given its control of search and its related advertising business. Here is a closer look at the case and what it could mean for Google and the wider industry. What has happened? In 2020, Google was sued by the US Department of Justice, which claimed the tech giant has abused its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and harm consumers. During the case, lawyers argued that Google’s monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having more time and money to invest in improving its search engine, an approach which impacted consumers. For its part, Google dismissed these suggestions, arguing that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become dissatisfied with the results – highlighting how Yahoo had once dominated search in the 1990s before Google appeared. But ultimately, after several months of reviewing evidence, the judge ruled that Google had breached US antitrust laws in how it operated. What did the judge say? In his decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Google was a “monopolist” that had “acted as one to maintain its monopoly”. US attorney general Merrick Garland said the “victory against Google is an historic win for the American people”. “No company, no matter how large or influential, is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws,” he said. The technology giant is widely expected to appeal against the decision, and the process could take it all the way to the US Supreme Court. What does the decision mean for Google and the wider tech sector? This is the biggest question to come out of the case. The decision by the judge sets up another legal phase where it must be decided what changes or penalties should be imposed on Google in order to protect competition. The outcome of that decision could have a huge impact on the tech sector, as the changes could be as drastic as asking the company to dismantle parts of its online empire, or stop it spending huge sums of money each year to ensure Google search is the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices. Or the judge could decide that only more modest changes are needed to protect competition and consumers, leaving Google relatively unscathed. Any changes imposed would come at a critical time in the sector, as Google battles with Microsoft and others to lead the industry as it enters the age of AI. – PA Media/dpa Related stories: Google illegally maintains monopoly over Internet search, US judge rules Google antitrust ruling may pose $20 billion risk for Apple Will Google’s historic monopoly lawsuit be the death knell for Mozilla and Firefox?

GenAI adoption among women in tech could bridge gender diversity gaps: Nasscom-BCG report The report recommends various measures to boost women’s success in GenAI, including mentorship, flexible work arrangements, and fostering an inclusive work culture. By BL Bengaluru Bureau Updated - August 09, 2024 at 08:17 AM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/genai-adoption-among-women-in-tech-could-bridge-gender-diversity-gaps-nasscom-bcg-report/article68501575.ece Copy The report emphasizes that GenAI can help overcome traditional barriers, potentially enhancing gender diversity in the tech industry. Nearly 90 per cent women in India’s tech workforce see GenAI as a critical driver for career growth, according to a report by Nasscom and BCG. However, the report by Nasscom and BCG showed that only one-third feel prepared to use it, even though women are willing to put in extra effort to succeed with AI and GenAI technology. Women comprise about 36 per cent of India’s tech workforce but remain underrepresented in executive roles. Nearly 95% of junior, 96% of mid-management, and 100 per cent of senior management women are ready to invest more time in achieving professional success in GenAI. The advent of Gen AI is set to revolutionize the tech industry, offering a unique opportunity to foster gender diversity by enabling women to overcome traditional barriers and excel in their careers, the report ‘GenAI: The Diversity Game Changer We Can’t Ignore’ noted. The report was launched on the sidelines of the Nasscom Global Inclusion Summit in Bengaluru. The report showed that one in five women use GenAI tools almost daily, with about 35% of senior management women reporting daily usage. Further, women view GenAI tools as a significant boost to their perceived competence, with 45% of the surveyed women in tech roles experiencing higher confidence than their non-tech peers. As GenAI is projected to dominate 33% of the global AI landscape by 2027, the AI market is expected to reach $320-380 billion, growing at a CAGR of 25-35%, according to the report. Despite the progression, the lower adoption and usage of GenAI tools among some women at senior management levels can be attributed to several challenges, including limited knowledge, lack of trust, restricted access to these tools, and fear of competence scrutiny. From entry-level roles to the C-suite, women consistently point to knowledge gaps as the primary challenge in adopting Gen AI. The report outlined that addressing these knowledge gaps and other barriers is crucial to increasing GenAI adoption among women. Gender diversity in AI Commenting on the report, Sangeeta Gupta, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at Nasscom, said, “Despite significant progress in diversity and AI/Gen AI adoption, substantial gaps still limit women’s full potential in the tech industry. With Gen AI set to dominate the tech industry, it is critical to address key challenges such as knowledge gaps and lack of support and empower women, particularly in these roles. By addressing these obstacles and cultivating an inclusive environment, businesses can not only enhance their own success but also contribute to a more equitable and dynamic tech landscape. We believe that embracing these changes is both a moral imperative and a strategic advantage that will shape the future of the industry.” While GenAI will act as an equalizer for women in tech, only 35% of surveyed women respondents feel completely prepared by their employers, leading to barriers to adoption. The report recommended actions to boost women’s success in these technologies, including defining clear career pathways; guiding through formal and informal mentorship programs; enabling flexible work arrangements; offering ethical training; building a culture of empowerment, diversity, and inclusion; and fostering networking opportunities “Globally, senior women lead in GenAI adoption, yet India lags with a 64% gender disparity in AI leadership. To capture the USD 320 billion AI market, India’s tech sector needs diversity. This will ensure effective systems by eliminating biases and incorporating varying ethical perspectives. Let’s seize this significant opportunity to rectify the gender imbalance in the tech industry,” says Sreyssha George, Managing Director and Partner at Boston Consulting Group.

Here's why travel influencer parted ways with Apoorva Mukhija The tech industry's struggles are not limited to 2024, as 2023 also saw massive lay-offs, with 1,186 tech companies laying off about 262,682 staff, compared to 164,969 lay-offs in 2022. The most significant contributor to this staggering number is Intel, which plans to lay off more than 15,000 employees, accounting for over 15% of its total workforce. CEO Pat Gelsinger cited disappointing revenue growth and difficulties in leveraging AI trends as the primary reasons behind the $10 billion cost-reduction strategy aimed at 2025. Dyson, the UK-based appliance maker, has also announced plans to reduce its workforce by around 1,000 positions in the UK, impacting over 25% of its domestic staff. CEO Hanno Kirner said that the decision was made because of intense competition and rapid technological advances. Microsoft has also been impacted, with over 1,000 staff losing their jobs in the mixed reality and Azure divisions over the past two months. The company has not officially acknowledged this latest round of lay-offs, but affected employees have reported that the cuts primarily targeted product and product management roles. UKG, a software firm headquartered in Massachusetts, has announced a 14% reduction in its workforce, which equates to about 2,200 employees out of a total of 15,882. The company stated that the lay-offs are aimed at concentrating on key growth areas to bolster its long-term strategic goals. Intuit Inc, a financial management software company based in California, has revealed plans to cut 1,800 positions, which constitute roughly 10% of its workforce. This lay-off represents the second-largest reduction in the tech industry for July. Other notable lay-offs include Kaspersky's decision to terminate all employees in the US due to a government ban on its software, Koo's shutdown following failed acquisition negotiations, and significant job cuts at Unacademy, WayCool, PocketFM, Bungie, and Humble Games. As the year progresses, it remains to be seen whether the tech industry will be able to bounce back from these challenging times. However, the sheer scale of the lay-offs in 2024 suggests that the sector is facing significant headwinds that will require strategic planning and adaptation to overcome.

    "article_text": "Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways After several of its brightest stars declared support for former President Donald Trump last month, Silicon Valley has now come out in force for Vice President Kamala Harris. Though Silicon Valley remains a stronghold of support for Democrats, the Biden's administration's hawkish approach to tech has alienated many in the industry, and in recent months a number of high-profile entrepreneurs and investors including Elon Musk have backed Trump. But Harris, a Bay Area native with ties to the industry, could forge a stronger relationship with the Valley and has already received pledges of support from a new group called VCs for Harris -- representing hundreds of prominent venture capitalists. Leslie Feinzaig, the venture capitalist who started VCs for Harris, said she recently wrote a pledge and bought a URL to host its site without expecting much. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement MORE: Harris officially names Tim Walz as vice presidential running mate Within days, billionaire entrepreneur and television personality Mark Cuban and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joined the group. \"I basically haven't slept since,\" Feinzaig said.

(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Feinzaig's efforts have resulted in more than 700 pledges of support for Harris, and could signal a friendlier relationship between the vice president and the Valley than Biden has had. \"Silicon Valley had no friends in Washington during the Biden administration,\" said Georgetown Law Center professor and technology regulation expert Anupam Chander. \"You have the Department of Justice, which has filed those antitrust lawsuits. You have the White House and the U.S. Trade Representative, who have been retreating from efforts to ensure free flow of data across the world.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement And, of course, Chander said, you have Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who has gained an army of fans -- and detractors -- for leading an ambitious effort to regulate giants such as Amazon and Meta. PHOTO: Vice President Kamala Harris delivers an address on Artificial Intelligence policy at the U.S. embassy, Nov. 1, 2023, in London. (Carl Court/Getty Images) The Biden administration did, however, work to pass the CHIPS Act, which allocated billions to onshore the production of semiconductors used in many electronics -- an achievement celebrated by the leading tech industry advocacy group as \"a major victory.\" Still, leading venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the co-founders of investment fund Andreessen Horowitz, cited concerns about Biden's policies in a podcast episode announcing their support for Trump. \"The future of our business, the future of technology, new technology and the future of America is literally at stake,\" Horowitz said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement MORE: Election 2024 updates: Obama, Pelosi and others react to Harris' VP pick Despite continuing frustrations with the Biden administration, according to industry insiders, Democrats appear to retain the support of most in Silicon Valley. \"Many of us are frustrated with Biden administration's sort of anti-technology, anti-business stance,\" said Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur Merci Grace. Grace said voting against Trump would be \"pretty easy\" for her and most of her peers, 70 or 80 percent of whom she estimates will ultimately support Harris. Feinzaig said some of the high-profile figures in the industry who have come out in support of Trump \"weren't speaking for the full industry.\" PHOTO: Elon Musk addresses the European Jewish Association's conference in Krakow, Poland, Jan. 22, 2024. (Czarek Sokolowski/AP, FILE) Still, Trump has made inroads in certain corners of Silicon Valley. In June, a fundraiser hosted by tech billionaire David Sacks in coordination with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance -- a former venture capitalist with ties to another prominent conservative tech mogul, Peter Thiel -- raised $12 million for the former president's campaign. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump has also received endorsements from a number of prominent entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency sector, promising in his 2024 platform to \"end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown.\" Also, he spoke at the annual Bitcoin Conference in late July. The former president has taken a stern stance on big tech companies, calling them \"too big\" and \"too powerful\" in a July interview with Bloomberg , but saying \"I don't want to destroy them.\" Some expect Harris, meanwhile, to assuage concerns in the Valley by taking a more dovish approach than the Biden administration, though they say her policy views on tech remain an open question. \"I would expect to return to a more technocratic stance,\" said Rob Merges, a law professor at U.C. Berkeley who spent several decades working in the tech industry. \"A traditional Clinton, Obama -- you know, friendly to the benefits of technology, reasonable in regulation, and cautious to not go too far in any one direction.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Chander said he thinks Harris is \"someone who recognizes the importance of innovation, but also worries about some of the harms that might follow.\" PHOTO: Streetcars at Embarcadero Plaza in Silicon Valley in San Francisco, June 1, 2021. (Jim McAuley/Bloomberg via Getty Images) But, he noted, \"because Harris didn't go through a regular primary, we haven't seen her stake out positions on some issues.\" Since Biden announced he would not seek reelection on July 21, Harris has not mentioned the tech industry in public campaign remarks and her campaign declined to comment on whether she would keep Khan at the head of the FTC (high-profile donors including Hoffman have recently urged her to do the reverse). But the Valley needs no introduction to the vice president. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Harris dealt with the tech industry as California's attorney general and has headed some of the Biden administration's efforts surrounding artificial intelligence, working with top AI companies to agree on voluntary guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI. The vice president's brother-in-law, Tony West, also serves as chief legal officer for Uber, headquartered in San Francisco. In remarks about AI in November, she said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Grace said she gets the sense that Harris is \"a reasonable person who is very intelligent, and we can have a discussion with her.\" She added that Trump \"is just someone who you can't trust.\" \"It's not worth the temporary alignment to make a little bit more money on top of the billions that you already have -- to get in bed with someone who you can't trust,\" Grace said. Feinzaig also shared her trust in Harris. \"I feel like we have a candidate that is listening.\" Silicon Valley leaders get behind Kamala Harris originally appeared on abcnews.go.com About Our Ads"

ASML Holding NV ( NASDAQ:ASML ETR:ASME ) View Price & Profile ASML among European tech stocks looking 'good value' after market sell-off, says Deutsche Bank Published: 12:40 06 Aug 2024 BST The European tech sector now contains some good buying opportunities after the 'correction' in recent days, says Deutsche Bank, based on more attractive valuations and an expectation of improved earnings in the second half of the year. Taking in the sell-off on Tuesday, the Euro STOXX 600 Tech subsector is down 14% since the beginning of July, underperforming the broader STOXX 600 by 9% during the same period, which accounts for over a quarter of the downturn in the broader European equity market, multi-asset strategists at the bank said. \"We see three reasons why the tech underperformance should come to a halt from here,\" said strategist Maximilian Uleer, with one of his key arguments being that as weak quarter-on-quarter tech earnings growth in the first half \"should return to above market growth\" in the second. After the stock market moves in recent days, tech price/earnings ratios have returned to their long-term range, he added, with the 11% premium seen to the 10-year average seen in the spring having \"entirely vanished\" over the past weeks. The strategist noted that the \"often-proclaimed inverse correlation of tech and rates has proven wrong\" in the past few weeks, with the 10-year German Bund yield declining by 31 basis points since the start of July, while the tech sector \"has not benefitted from lower rates levels at all\". \"That said, we do not believe that the negative correlation of rates and tech has vanished entirely. \"If Bund yields drop below 2%, we expect the correlation of tech and rates to turn from positive to negative again, as has been the case during previous cycles of lower interest rates.\" The Deutsche Bank multi-asset team upgraded its rating on tech to 'neutral', seeing current valuations as \"fair\" and earnings estimates as \"more realistic\", though they are still cautious about the potential for further earnings downgrades as 2025 earnings growth forecasts are still elevated. They recommend client be \"selective\", with favourite tech stocks in being Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) , SAP and Capgemini, where analyst colleagues see around 50% upside for ASML, 20% for SAP and 40% for Capgemini.

In 2020, Google was sued by the US Department of Justice, which claimed the tech giant has abused its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and harm consumers. During the case, lawyers argued that Google’s monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having more time and money to invest in improving its search engine, an approach which impacted consumers. For its part, Google dismissed these suggestions, arguing that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become dissatisfied with the results – highlighting how Yahoo had once dominated search in the 1990s before Google appeared. But ultimately, after several months of reviewing evidence, the judge ruled that Google had breached US antitrust laws in how it operated. – What did the judge say? In his decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Google was a “monopolist” that had “acted as one to maintain its monopoly”. US attorney general Merrick Garland said the “victory against Google is an historic win for the American people”. Justice Department Statements on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia’s Decision in U.S. v Google 🔗: https://t.co/Dj7Xbwz6Yy pic.twitter.com/kzJfWlNWk7 — U.S. Department of Justice (@TheJusticeDept) August 5, 2024 “No company, no matter how large or influential, is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws,” he said. The technology giant is widely expected to appeal against the decision, and the process could take it all the way to the US Supreme Court. – What does the decision mean for Google and the wider tech sector? This is the biggest question to come out of the case. The decision by the judge sets up another legal phase where it must be decided what changes or penalties should be imposed on Google in order to protect competition. The outcome of that decision could have a huge impact on the tech sector, as the changes could be as drastic as asking the company to dismantle parts of its online empire, or stop it spending huge sums of money each year to ensure Google search is the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices. Or the judge could decide that only more modest changes are needed to protect competition and consumers, leaving Google relatively unscathed. Any changes imposed would come at a critical time in the sector, as Google battles with Microsoft and others to lead the industry as it enters the age of AI.

Read our privacy notice . Dividend-paying IAG today provided one of the London market’s few bright spots in a session dominated by US recession and tech sector worries. The British Airways owner surged 6% or 9.7p to 169.7p after results showed second quarter profits in line with the previous year’s record of 1.25 billion euros (£1.06 billion). It also set aside 147 million euros (£125 million) for next month’s dividend payment of three euro cents. This will be IAG’s first distribution since the pandemic in a move chief executive Luis Gallego said showed confidence “in our performance and our transformation”. Defensive focused stocks were also in favour in London as Smith & Nephew continued its progress following yesterday’s results by adding another 16p to 1215p and consumer healthcare firm Haleon lifted 4.5p to 362.5p. The FTSE 100 index fell 22.70 points to 8260.66, which represented a decent showing given the turbulence in other global markets. Japan’s stock market was the worst hit as the Nikkei 225 closed 5.8% lower, its worst performance since 2020 due to yen strength and the selling of tech stocks after Wall Street’s Nasdaq Composite closed 2.3% lower. US traders are braced for another tough session later today after Intel shares slumped 19% in dealings following Thursday’s closing bell. The chipmaker said it would axe 15% of its workforce and suspend its dividend on the back of a disappointing second quarter. Recession jitters also swept through Wall Street yesterday after weekly initial jobless claims rose to their highest in nearly a year at 249,000. The focus is now on today's non-farm payrolls figures, which are forecast to slow to 175,000 from 206,000 in June. Deutsche Bank said: “The past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood on the back of another batch of weak US data yesterday followed by mostly downbeat tech earnings overnight.” Heavily sold stocks in the FTSE 350 included Baillie Gifford Japan Trust, which lost 6% or 42p to 710p, and Alphabet backer Pershing Square Holdings with a fall of 158p to 3638p.

The nuclear plant provides more than 90% of Connecticut's carbon-free power. The tech center reflects growing interest in nuclear plants as sources of reliable, carbon-free power for data centers. In this article CEG D Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT The Dominion Energy headquarters is pictured in Richmond, Virginia, on July 6, 2020. Zach Gibson | Getty Images Dominion Energy is exploring the possibility of connecting a data center directly to a nuclear plant in Connecticut, as the tech sector hunts for carbon-free electricity to power artificial intelligence applications. The Millstone Power Station in Waterford, Connecticut, provides more than 90% of the Nutmeg State's carbon-free power and generates enough electricity for nearly two million homes annually, according to Dominion. \"We're certainly open to the idea of a co-located data center,\" Dominion CEO Robert Blue told analysts on the company's second-quarter earnings call Thursday when asked about Millstone. \"We continue to explore that option,\" Blue said. \"We do clearly realize any co-location option is going to have to make sense for us, our potential counterparty and stakeholders in Connecticut.\" Some 55% of Millstone's output is spoken for under a fixed-price contract through late 2029, Blue said. Dominion is \"actively working with multiple parties to find the best value for Millstone\" when the current power purchase agreement expires, the CEO said. Surging demand Power demand from data centers is surging as tech companies build larger and larger facilities to support increased use of artificial intelligence. The demand from individual data centers has soared from 30 megawatts historically to as much as several gigawatts today, Blue said on Dominion's first-quarter earnings call in May. A gigawatt of power is equivalent to the capacity of an average nuclear reactor in the U.S. Dominion is the eighth-largest company in the S&P 500 Utilities Index by market value. The utility, headquartered in Richmond, serves northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Dominion has connected nine new data centers so far this year with plans for a total of 15 by the end 2024. Blue said Thursday that data center \"growth is accelerating in orders of magnitude driven by the number of requests, the size of each facility and the acceleration of each facility's ramp scheduled to reach full capacity.\" The tech sector has shown growing interest in nuclear as a source of reliable, carbon-free power for data centers. Amazon Web Services bought a data center powered by a Talen Energy nuclear plant in Pennsylvania for $650 million in March. AWS is also in talks with Constellation Energy for electricity supplied by a nuclear plant on the East Coast, according to a Wall Street Journal report in July .

    "article_text": "J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press FILE – In this July 21, 2016, file photo, entrepreneur Peter Thiel speaks during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The Silicon Valley data-mining firm Palantir Technologies says it has confidentially filed to go public, setting up what could be the biggest public stock offering of a technology company since Uber‚Äôs debut in 2019. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) By Aynne Kokas PUBLISHED: July 31, 2024 at 2:58 PM PDT JD Vance’s ascendance to vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket, with ardent backing by tech investor and megadonor Peter Thiel, may seem improbable given the tech sector’s long-standing role in Democratic Party fundraising. Yet Thiel’s support of Vance reflects a larger backlash against the power of legacy tech firms in the United States. As some pro-tech Democrats chafe against the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts, and Republicans nominate a former Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has voiced support for those same efforts, it is clear that the tech sector is further splintering politically. Vance’s rise reflects the power of moneyed tech leaders who unapologetically assert principles of techno-libertarianism, or the idea that technology firms should be free from most government intervention. This view is growing in political power and influence in the GOP. Thiel gave Vance a job in his Silicon Valley venture capital firm and boosted Vance’s successful U.S. Senate campaign in Ohio by $15 million — the largest amount ever contributed to a single Senate candidate, Politico reported in 2022. He also connected Vance with former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk is financially supporting Trump through his America PAC. This represents a shift from the tech sector’s reputation as a bastion of support for the Democratic Party. Many startup founders have been based on the progressive West Coast, particularly in California, and for years there’s been a revolving door of Democratic officials leaving D.C. for high-profile roles in Silicon Valley. Against that backdrop, the tech sector has largely furthered the Democrats’ interests — including by serving as campaign staffers, offering digital expertise and acting as major donors. Yet as the sector has grown, so has the backlash against Big Tech as well as the calls from voters and politicians on both sides of the aisle to regulate the industry. Antitrust efforts, including from current Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, have rung alarm bells for tech firms seeking to preserve their market share. For his part, blaming the state’s “overregulation” and liberal policy, Musk announced this month that he will move the headquarters of X (formerly Twitter) and SpaceX out of California to Texas. Potentially complicating the picture, Vance has singled out Khan “as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job.” Khan has brought anti-monopoly lawsuits against large firms including Amazon, so it might appear that Vance supports regulation and oversight. However, it’s more likely that his position reflects a pro-competition streak designed to maximize the number of firms that can compete with the big players. Thus it seems that the Vance-Thiel alliance is aimed at challenging the firms that have been identified as potential monopolies and now represent an establishment hoarding power away from emergent companies that hope for minimal oversight (such as the startups Thiel invests in, and the EV sector Musk has sought to dominate). Thiel and Musk, as key figures in the techno-libertarian movement, are making a reasonable bet that their regulatory environment will be much more permissive under a second Trump administration. But at the same time, they have signaled openness to policy that weakens the dominant companies. Of course, personal investments can change that calculus. Consider Trump’s massive turnaround from trying to ban TikTok’s U.S. operations to opposing a ban after meeting with GOP megadonor Jeff Yass, who owns a stake in TikTok’s parent company. It also remains to be seen how long Trump’s otherwise hawkish approach to China’s tech sector, exemplified by a preference for increased tariffs and export controls, will persist. Thiel has roundly critiqued Apple and Google’s ties to China. On the other hand, Musk’s Tesla business depends on the Chinese market, which is its second largest after the United States. As of 2023, nearly 40% of Tesla’s battery components also come from China, and the firm is building a sizable battery factory in Shanghai. The new fault lines in Silicon Valley politics have become harder to predict. If Trump prevails, his administration may well dodge or roll back regulation — except for those companies and individuals perceived as too threatening to his and Vance’s allies.

I'll take a mechanical watch over a digital one every day of the week, even though I know the digital one is technically better. But when it comes to investing you just can't ignore technology stocks, so you have to figure out a way to own them that is comfortable for you. A technology-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) is one very good option, but don't make it the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF ( IGM 0.68% ) . Here's why. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF sounds interesting When I came across the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, my first thought was, \"What does expanded mean?\" And because I'm an investing geek I went right down a rabbit hole trying to figure out why this exchange-traded fund was \"expanded.\" The top-level logic is interesting. Image source: Getty Images. According to the ETF's marketing website, it provides \"Broad exposure to the technology sector, and technology-related companies in the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors.\" That's reasonable, given that technology pervades just about every sector today. And the communications and consumer discretionary sectors are two sectors where technology plays a huge role. But how are the stocks actually selected from those sectors? To find that out, I had to track down the index methodology for the index the ETF tracks. But that index isn't directly disclosed on the marking website. It is listed as the benchmark index. Being a benchmark index isn't the same thing, since a lot of ETFs benchmark to the S&P 500 index but don't specifically track the index stock-for-stock. I had to read the prospectus to get confirmation that the S&P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index was the index I needed to understand. Given that I couldn't easily find a link to the methodology document (not unusual, but still frustrating), I had to search for information about the S&P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index. On the website describing the index, I found the explanation, \"The S&P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index is designed to measure securities from the S&P North American Technology Sector Index and the supplementary stock Netflix, Inc. \" That's pretty unhelpful, other than telling me the index specifically includes Netflix, so I had to go into the actual methodology document to find out more. Expand NYSEMKT : IGM iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF Today's Change ( -0.68 %) $ -0.90 Current Price $ 131.12 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 130.24 - $ 131.50 52wk Range $ 76.26 - $ 135.81 Volume 563K Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A That document says: \"Underlying Index. S&P North American Technology Sector Index. For information on the underlying index, please refer to the S&P North American Sector Indices Methodology.\" There's a link there, but it doesn't actually go to the specific document; I had to search again. That puts me three layers deep in order to understand the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF. I suspect most investors would have given up by this point. But, once I found the next methodology description, I learned that the index tracks the information technology sector, interactive home entertainment sub-industry, and the interactive media and services sub-industry (these are specific sectors within the GICS classification system). That was a lot of work for a fairly simple answer (plus Netflix!). Honestly, it should raise a red flag when an ETF makes it this hard to find out what it does. What about performance? That said, there are times when complicated investments are worth the extra effort because they have strong performance histories. For example, Berkshire Hathaway is a super complex business , but it has been a huge long-term winner. That's not exactly the case with the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF. In fact, compared to a technology ETF that isn't expanded, like the Technology Sector Select SPDR ETF , it's been a laggard of late. In fairness, that's largely because a small number of very large technology stocks have been on a shocking tear, with Nvidia leading the charge. Adding more stocks increased diversification , but it also ended up watering down the gains from the handful of big winners. IGM Total Return Level data by YCharts And that brings up the real problem here. If you want to own a technology ETF, buy a technology ETF. Buying a technology ETF that is pitching itself as more than just a technology ETF kind of waters down the whole idea of buying a sector-specific ETF in the first place. Taking a line from a classic science fiction film's more famous characters, \"Do or do not, there is no try.\" I get it, but I wouldn't recommend it Having spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out what the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF actually does (so you don't have to), I can now say I understand. What I can't say is that I'm convinced this is a good option for investors who are looking for technology exposure. And the recent performance shows why, given that the \"expanded\" feature has ended up watering down the ETF's performance. Buying a technology ETF is a great idea for luddites like me, but the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF isn't the way I'd recommend most people get their technology exposure."

    "article_text": "Technology US Senate poised to pass major online child safety reforms It is expected to pass two significant bills, COPPA 2.0 and KOSA The US Senate building,Photo: Reuters Reuters Published : 30 Jul 2024, 07:17 PM Updated : 30 Jul 2024, 07:17 PM The US Senate is expected to pass major online child safety reforms in a vote on Tuesday, although the legislation, which has drawn mixed reactions from the tech industry, faces an uncertain fate in the House of Representatives. Two bills - the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act and the Kids Online Safety Act, nicknamed COPPA 2.0 and KOSA - would need to pass in the Republican-controlled House, currently on recess until September, to become law. The bills were approved by the Senate in a bipartisan procedural vote last week, with 86 senators supporting and just one opposing. Democrats control that chamber by a margin of 51-49 seats, while Republicans hold the House by 220-212. COPPA 2.0 would ban targeted advertising to minors and data collection without their consent, and give parents and kids the option to delete their information from social media platforms. Top US social media platforms made an estimated $11 billion in advertising revenue from users younger than 18 in 2022, according to a Harvard study published last year. KOSA would make explicit a \"duty of care\" that social media companies have when it comes to minors using their products, focusing on design of the platforms and regulation of the companies. Executives at social media sites Snap Inc and X said at a congressional hearing in January that they supported KOSA, while Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew said they disagreed with parts of it. Tech industry groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have criticized the bill, saying that differing interpretations of harmful content could result in minors losing access to content related to vaccines, abortion or LGBTQ issues. Senators amended the language of the bill in response to such concerns earlier this year, in part by limiting the enforcement responsibility of states' attorneys general. Josh Golin, executive director at Fairplay for Kids, a group that supports the bills, said KOSA requires companies to mitigate specific risks, such as content that promotes eating disorders. \"Obviously government officials can do things that are not legal, but this does not give government officials any legal basis for censorship,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Republican candidate and former US president Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference last Saturday in Nashville, Tennessee. Photo: Mark Humphrey/AP Photo Caoimhe Gordon Tue 30 Jul 2024 at 03:00 US tech companies based in Ireland have reduced their recruitment in advance of the American presidential election on November 5, a new employment analysis by Morgan McKinley has indicated. The outcome of the contest between Donald Trump and the Democratic Party challenger, most likely Kamala Harris, could have huge implications for the tech sector. Trump has suggested he is in favour of light-touch regulation on AI and other emerging technologies, and is likely to approve tech mergers and acquisitions. Vice-president Harris is expected to continue the Biden administration’s tough anti-trust enforcement. Faced with this uncertainty, there has been a “recruitment slowdown” in the tech sector, according to the analysis by recruitment firm Morgan McKinley. This is particularly reflected in hiring for software development roles. “This caution is linked to the upcoming US elections and potential changes in economic policies and regulatory frameworks,” said Trayc Keevans, global FDI director of Morgan McKinley Ireland. “The tech sector’s recruitment slowdown, especially in research and development roles, reflects broader economic uncertainties. Companies are being prudent, awaiting clarity on the political and economic landscape.” Overall, the number of job openings jumped in the second quarter of the year, according to the analysis. Vacancies rose 14.4pc from the previous quarter, with the majority of the growth recorded in April and May. Jobseeker numbers also increased in the period. The number of those looking for a job rose by 6.9pc from the first three months of the year. Morgan McKinley reported that these increases point to a more balanced market, with both job opportunities and availability of candidates on the rise. The monthly unemployment rate in Ireland stood at 4.2pc in June, according to the latest release from the Central Statistics Office. This was up 0.2pc from May. “The Irish professional employment market continues to show resilience and growth, even amidst global uncertainties,” Ms Keevans said. “The increase in job vacancies and job seekers suggests a dynamic market, but sector-specific trends indicate varying levels of activity and caution.” While tech slowed down, companies in the accounting and finance sectors recorded a rise in hiring across the period. This was driven by compliance needs related to the introduction of the Digital Operational Resilience Act, Morgan McKinley reported. This EU regulation is intended to strengthen the IT security of companies in these industries. “The sector also observed stable salaries, with higher compensation for niche roles such as sales traders, reflecting the scarcity of these professionals in Ireland compared to other financial hubs,” Ms Keevans said. She also pointed to demand for qualified accountants and tax professionals due to an ongoing shortage in Ireland. This was attributed to current migration trends, as well as the large salaries offered by major firms operating in this space. Demand for construction professionals jumped in the quarter. Morgan McKinley noted a rise in the number of permanent roles available in State infrastructure projects. While hiring levels in the residential construction sector grew, the report pointed to a slowdown in vacancies in commercial construction. “Employers face challenges in recruiting international talent due to visa issues and the accommodation crisis, which has led some companies to acquire properties to house their employees,” Ms Keevans said.

    "article_text": "Use the sell-off in tech stocks as a chance to buy the dip, UBS says Matthew Fox July 29, 2024 3 min read UBS sees the recent tech stock sell-off as a buy-the-dip opportunity for long-term investors. The sell-off has been driven by an overall shift from large-cap to smaller-sized companies. UBS cites attractive valuations, solid fundamentals, and fading technical factors as reason to stick with large-cap tech. This month's sell-off in technology stocks represents a buy-the-dip opportunity for long-term investors, according to a Monday note from UBS. The sell-off was exacerbated by a rotation out of large-cap stocks and into smaller-sized companies, leading some to question if the years-long trend of mega-cap tech stocks outperforming the market is over. But according to UBS, the recent decline in tech stocks is only temporary, and that should be apparent when mega-cap tech stocks report their second-quarter earnings results later this week. \"With results still due from some big firms this week, market volatility is likely to continue. But we think the tech sector should find support in the coming weeks and resume its leadership,\" UBS said. The confidence from UBS stems from a trifecta of factors: compelling valuations, fundamentals, and technicals. \"Tech valuations have become attractive again.\" The technology sector has experienced a 10% sell-off nearly every year over the past decade, so the recent 9% decline in the Nasdaq 100 is not out of the ordinary, according to UBS. A healthy sell-off in tech stocks has led to more attractive valuations for the fast-growing sector, especially when compared to previous bubbles. \"While the tech sector appears to be expensive after the rally this year, price-to-earnings multiples remain much lower than in the dot-com era, when many tech stocks had much lower-quality earnings,\" UBS said. \"Tech fundamentals remain solid.\" With Apple , Amazon , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms on deck this week to report earnings, UBS says the tech sector should see a net profit growth of 20% to 25% in the second-quarter. \"Today's tech leaders also offer high-quality margins, strong free cash flows, and solid balance sheets, a positive driver amid slowing economic activity,\" UBS said. And that growth should last for many years as the AI revolution requires massive investments in architecture, like Nvidia's GPU chips and new datacenters. \"As Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai pointed out, 'the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting,\" UBS highlighted. \"Technical factors supporting the rotation are likely to fade.\" Short-squeezes, call option activity, and bank hedging have fueled the rotational trade into small cap stocks, but that won't last forever, according to UBS. Story Continues \"The positioning influence on the rotation trade will soon dissipate, as such technicals typically do after about a month,\" UBS said. \"So, we think the environment remains favorable for quality tech stocks, and believe that investors should ensure they have sufficient exposure to AI beneficiaries within and outside the US.\" Read the original article on Business Insider View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

    "article_text": "Silicon Valley's support for the UBI is premised on the notion of AI-driven job losses (Image credit: Antonio Solano / Getty Images) By Joel Mathis, The Week US published 26 July 2024 One of Silicon Valley's favorite ideas isn't really tech-driven. The universal basic income — \"cash aid from the government, no strings attached\" — is the tech industry's solution to the anticipated wave of job losses created by the rise of artificial intelligence , NPR said. That's why OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has spent the last few years funding an experiment in giving people free money. \"Do people sit around and play video games,\" he asked in a blog post, \"or do they create new things?\" Now we have some answers. New results from Unconditional Income Study found that giving $1,000 a month to people in Illinois and Texas \"improved financial flexibility without disincentivizing workforce participation,\" Fast Company said. Recipients had a safety net, in other words, but still wanted to work — though they worked a little less. But skepticism still dies hard. \"There is this resilient myth that cash no strings attached promotes laziness,\" said New York University's Juliana Uhuru Bidadanure. Can the universal basic income change lives? The Altman-funded experience is a reminder that \"money can indeed buy happiness,\" Brandon Vigliarolo said at The Register, which covers the tech industry. Cash recipients \"were more likely to visit the hospital, see a specialist, go to the dentist, and cut down on excess alcohol and drug use.\" And the participants were also 10% more likely to actively seek a job than people who didn't receive the UBI. That's the good news. The bad news, at least for employers: Cash recipients \"were less likely to apply for jobs they didn't want.\" The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up Giving Americans $1,000 a month is \"better than nothing,\" Lucas Ropek said at Gizmodo . But the study shows it's not enough to \"drastically reshape the economic outlook of that person's life.\" One finding: The cash had \"close to no net impact\" on the physical health of cash recipients. The payments did help those people meet their \"most basic needs, including affording groceries and paying rent.\" And that allowed some of the recipients to dream of starting their own businesses, but few actually did so. The takeaway? \"Solving poverty isn't a quick and easy process.\" Will UBI save us from the problems of AI? Silicon Valley 's support for the UBI is premised on the notion of AI-driven job losses. But \"if there's no great wave of AI-driven unemployment, if the AI bubble bursts ,\" then that support might also disappear, Oshan Jarow said at Vox .

    "article_text": "Editors' Pick Money Markets What A Harris Presidency Could Mean For Crypto By Owen Tedford , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Owen Tedford explains how tech and crypto policies impact the markets. Follow Author Jul 25, 2024, 10:47am EDT Jul 25, 2024, 12:13pm EDT Share Save Comment PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - JULY 13: Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event at the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote Presidential Town Hall at the Pennsylvania Convention Center on July 13, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Harris continues campaigning ahead of the presidential election as Democrats face doubts about President Biden's fitness in his run for re-election against former President Donald Trump. (Photo by Drew Hallowell/Getty Images) Getty Images Following President Joe Biden’s decision to step out of the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris has become the presumptive Democratic nominee. This change has sparked a new wave of excitement among younger voters and set off a race in Washington policy circles to determine Harris’ positions on various issues. Despite spending over two decades in elected positions, having become District Attorney of San Francisco in 2004, Harris is still an enigma in certain policy areas. She spent most of her career as a public prosecutor, moving to serve as the California Attorney General until she entered the U.S. Senate in 2017. She has often framed herself as a progressive, but there is uncertainty over whether this is her philosophy or more of a practical choice being from California. However, her California ties have brought her closer to the tech industry than some other progressives and her criticism of the sector has been more moderate than some of her peers. Crypto is one area where there is some uncertainty over how Harris may approach the industry. Some are optimistic that this could mean she is a blank slate and open to being persuaded by different viewpoints. Mark Cuban recently told Politico , “She will be far more open to business, AI, crypto.” Indicating an openness to a more industry-friendly regime or a desire to establish clearer regulations for the industry could be an easy way for Harris to win more campaign donations from businesses and investors in her home state. Given her background as supporting progressive policies and friendliness toward the tech industry, it is easy to imagine a world where Harris embraces crypto. Other progressives have touted how digital assets can make financial services more accessible and serve as a means to force more competition on traditional financial services businesses, a group she has clashed with in the past. The message of inclusion and accessibility would likely play well to Harris, who has routinely tried to make “policy decisions through the lens of women, children, and minority communities,” according to the Wall Street Journal . However, a case also can be made that Harris, who is not expected to significantly deviate from Biden’s policies, does not provide the relief the industry is hoping she may bring. Hailing from California, she could have concerns about federal pre-emption and may want any laws to preserve the ability for states to set stricter standards rather than having federal rules be the maximum. In addition, Harris could decide to leave the issue to the regulators, who may be more inclined to continue with regulation by enforcement, particularly with some of the challenges that rulemaking will face after this year’s Supreme Court rulings. Lastly, even if Harris is more friendly to the tech industry, she will likely want to avoid being seen by other Democrats, especially progressives, as pursuing an industry-written policy. This could mean that even if regulation is enacted, it does not reflect what industry members hope to achieve. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The likely deciding factor in how crypto policy evolves under Harris are the advisors around her and the leaders of her regulatory agencies. There is an old Washington adage that “personnel is policy,” and with Harris not appearing to hold strong personal views on digital assets, it will likely be true in this case. It is uncertain whether she would look to have new chairs at key regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, without Democratic control of the Senate, the odds of a change in leadership go down. Other critical positions, like Secretary of the Treasury, are more likely to see a change, even if Republicans have a majority in the Senate. Former President Donald Trump’s re-election likely still spells the best outcome for the crypto industry, but Harris’ unknown policy positions have fairly sparked some optimism.

    "article_text": "Business Revolut receives UK banking licence Simon Hunt , Business & Technology Correspondent @ SimonPeterHunt 25 July 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Revolut today ended a painful three-year wait to secure a British banking licence in a breakthrough moment for Britain’s biggest fintech, paving the way for major expansion. The Canary Wharf-based business, which first applied for a licence back in 2021, received confirmation of the verdict from the UK’s Prudential Regulatory Authority, opening the firm up to offering a range of new financial services to compete with the biggest High Street banks. The $45 billion firm said it will now enter the ‘mobilisation’ stage before obtaining a full licence, during which time banks can only hold £50,000 of total customer deposits. According to the Bank of England, mobilisation “could take as little as a few months but cannot continue indefinitely and should take no longer than 12 months.” Revolut had already obtained a banking licence in Lithuania in December 2021 and is also regulated by the European Central Bank. The decision, which has taken significantly longer to arrive than expected, ends months of speculation that the Bank of England was minded to turn down Revolut’s banking licence application. A qualified audit opinion from accountants at BDO last year, the range of cryptocurrency services offered and the number of Russian shareholders and senior management at the firm are thought to have contributed to the cautious approach by regulators. But CEO Nik Storonsky previously said the cause of the delay “is not really us” and expressed frustration at the regulatory environment in the UK, last year ruling out an IPO in London. “If you are a business and you want to build something, uncertainty is a thing that kills you because you don’t know what you can do, what you can’t do,” he said. But Storonsky, who has a net worth of £4.9 billion according to the Standard’s Tech Rich List, said today: “We are incredibly proud to reach this important milestone in the journey of the company and we will ensure we deliver on making Revolut the bank of choice for UK customers.” Earlier this month, Revolut was handed a squeaky-clean audit report by BDO after two successive years of qualified opinions. Previous audit reports warned on problems with revenue recognition connected to Revolut’s IT systems. Since 2021 the company’s annual IT spend has nearly tripled to £47.4 million. The London-based business, which recently celebrated its ninth anniversary and will shortly move into a huge new office space in Canary Wharf, recorded a £344 million profit for 2023 , compared to £6 million the previous year, while revenues nearly doubled to £1.8 billion. That was helped along by rising interest rates, which added an extra £400 million in interest income during the year, as well as a more-than 50% jump in customer subscription income, which now accounts for around £250 million of the firm’s turnover. In contrast to wider trends in the tech sector, which as a whole saw more than a quarter of a million layoffs in 2023 according to job cuts tracker layoffs.fyi, Revolut has been on a hiring spree, adding more than 2,000 staff to top 8,000 by the end of last year, with plans to increase headcount by an even greater number in 2024.

A selloff in the tech sector spread to other cyclical areas, as disillusionment with artificial-intelligence technology, uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election race, and signs of a marked slowdown in Chinese economic activity weighed on investor sentiment. GE Aerospace fell sharply, reversing Tuesday's gains after it hit a 16-year high. Silgan Holdings struck a deal to buy Weener Plastics Holdings, a German packaging group majority owned by U.K. investment firm 3i Group, for about $908 million. Shares of Pentair slipped, but not by as much as the broad market, after a relatively strong earnings report for the water-products producer.

    "article_text": "Office vacancies hit all-time highs in the Bay Area's largest cities A new report shows that office vacancies in the Bay Area's three largest cities has hit all-time highs. Ted Egan, the chief economist of both the city and county of San Francisco, joined us on 'The Nine' to talk about the city's vacancy rate, which has reached nearly 37%. SAN FRANCISCO - Office space vacancies in the Bay Area’s largest cities have reached historic highs, according to a new report. The analysis by real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield found that vacancies in San Francisco, where the market has been struggling since the Covid pandemic, has hit a new high of 34.5% in the second quarter, up more than 6% from a year ago. The national rate was at 20.5%, an all-time record. In the Oakland/East Bay region, vacancies spiked to 18.6%, up almost 3% from a year ago. It was 17.2% in San Jose, and in the North Bay it was 13.3%. Analysts said the commercial real estate market has continued to face challenges since the pandemic due to companies downsizing and a recent series of job cuts in the tech industry. The increased practice of remote work also led to more empty office spaces. SEE ALSO : Ryan Seacrest's Bay Area estate just hit the market for $22M San Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan speculated the market hasn't quite hit rock bottom yet, but he said there’s reason for optimism that a turnaround was on the horizon. \"The good news that we're seeing is leasing activity is picking up,\" Egan said. \"People are renewing their leases-- existing tenants, mainly, some new tenants, and also people are interested. So people are looking around and kicking the tires for office space now.\" The Cushman & Wakefield report also found that asking rents were also on the decline, so prospective tenants may be looking for a deal. Figures showed that the average asking rent in San Francisco dropped to about $68 a square foot in the second quarter, the lowest in almost a decade and about $5 less per square foot compared to a year ago. Other reasons for optimism, according to Egan, was that there were signs of a rebound in tech employment. \"We've had about two years of layoffs in tech and job declines there the last couple of months. We may have started to turn a corner,\" the economist said. The high vacancy rate may put the city in position to re-imagine itself, especially with the boom of artificial intelligence and an ever-evolving tech industry. Open AI , one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, announced last fall that it would lease some 500,000 square feet of office space in the city's Mission Bay neighborhood. \"The industry is very dynamic. We have a new range of AI startups, and who knows what the tech industry is going to look like in ten years and who the leading companies are,\" Egan said. \"It does seem to be true, though, that the Bay Area, Silicon Valley and San Francisco are still the leader of tech in the country.\" Salesforce laid off 300 employees Salesforce continues to reduce employment with 300 more job cuts this year.

Tue, 23 Jul, 2024 - 00:05 Cáit Caden       Technology Ireland has called for significant investment to be pumped into meeting EU digital transition targets in a bid to grow the tech sector in the Republic of Ireland. In its pre-budget submission, Technology Ireland — an arm of lobby group Ibec — urged the Government to put aside €100m a year until 2030 to meet national and EU digital transition targets, and to provide continued funding for digital transition measures currently funded through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Technology Ireland director Una Fitzpatrick said it is “essential\" that Ireland resources itself to comply with EU frameworks, especially as a number of multinationals based their European headquarters in Ireland. Ms Fitzpatrick added that her organisation is also seeing the establishment of a minister of state for digital delivery under the Department of An Taoiseach, “given the high priority assigned to digitalisation from the European Commission\". Technology Ireland echoed Ibec’s recommendation at its own pre-budget submission in recent weeks to deploy money tucked away in the National Training Fund to upskill workers. “The Government will have a surplus nearing €2bn in the National Training Fund in 2025 and a significant release of investment from the fund should be outlined in the budget,” a spokesperson for the organisation said. The organisation also called for a review of the taxation system to enable SMEs to scale and retain their businesses in Ireland and recommended a research and development tax credit. Technology Ireland this would allow smaller firms to manage administrative expenses more effectively and utilise the credit. “This budget must seek to respond to evolving tax regimes to preserve and enhance Ireland’s appeal as a prime tech business destination,” the spokesperson added.

Nvidia Corp ( NASDAQ:NVDA ETR:NVD ) View Price & Profile Nvidia working on China-compatible flagship AI chip, says Reuters Published: 08:31 22 Jul 2024 BST Chipmaking titan NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is working on a China-compatible version of its cutting-edge Blackwell artificial intelligence chip that will satisfy US technology sanctions. According to a Reuters report citing “three sources familiar with the matter”, Nvidia is developing the chip with input from its China-based distribution partner Inspur. The US has imposed stringent export controls on technologies heading to China in a bid to curb the country’s adoption of AI technology into its military. This has been a source of frustration for Nvidia, which is a leading supplier of chips to the country. Nvidia was forced by US authorities to stop supplying China with its then-flagship H100 and A100 chips in 2022. The company released a simplified version of these chips for the Chinese market, only for them to come under tougher sanctions in late 2023. Nvidia’s next generation of AI chips, the Blackwell family of processors, was announced in March 2024 to praise from tech industry leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Given the bipartisan support for Chinese tech sanctions across the US political spectrum, it is unlikely that Nvidia – and the tech industry as a whole – will see a reprieve following the presidential elections in November. It leaves the prospect that even a watered-down version of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips could come under tougher sanctions in the months and years ahead. Continue reading"

Nvidia Corp ( NASDAQ:NVDA ETR:NVD ) View Price & Profile Nvidia working on China-compatible flagship AI chip, says Reuters Published: 03:31 22 Jul 2024 EDT Chipmaking titan NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is working on a China-compatible version of its cutting-edge Blackwell artificial intelligence chip that will satisfy US technology sanctions. According to a Reuters report citing “three sources familiar with the matter”, Nvidia is developing the chip with input from its China-based distribution partner Inspur. The US has imposed stringent export controls on technologies heading to China in a bid to curb the country’s adoption of AI technology into its military. This has been a source of frustration for Nvidia, which is a leading supplier of chips to the country. Nvidia was forced by US authorities to stop supplying China with its then-flagship H100 and A100 chips in 2022. The company released a simplified version of these chips for the Chinese market, only for them to come under tougher sanctions in late 2023. Nvidia’s next generation of AI chips, the Blackwell family of processors, was announced in March 2024 to praise from tech industry leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Given the bipartisan support for Chinese tech sanctions across the US political spectrum, it is unlikely that Nvidia – and the tech industry as a whole – will see a reprieve following the presidential elections in November. It leaves the prospect that even a watered-down version of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips could come under tougher sanctions in the months and years ahead. Continue reading"

Annapurna Roy ETtech Updated On Jul 22, 2024 at 10:33 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook The investment in India’s generative AI startups saw an increase by two times in the first six months of 2024 (January-June) compared to the second half of 2023 ( July-December), tech industry body Nasscom said in a report. Despite the increase in investments, however, there was a nearly 50% decline in funding rounds during the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year, Nasscom said in its latest Generative AI tracker. During the same period, investments in Gen AI startups in the US saw an increase by three times, while investments done by big tech companies in Gen AI startups also saw a 1.25x increase. Advt Top global hyperscalers are expanding their infrastructure investments across geographies, with over $80 billion in commitments announced towards data centre and cloud capacity over the next 10-15 years, Nasscom said. Revenue from Gen AI is also gradually appearing as top IT companies are now prepared with strong use cases. For instance, Accenture announced $2 billion in Gen AI revenue booked during H12024. India’s largest software exporter TCS also reported $900 million in Gen AI revenue booked during this period, with 10% in production to be billed within FY 2025. Sangeeta Gupta, chief strategy officer, Nasscom said, “As GenAI continues to revolutionise the tech landscape, the tech industry in India is leveraging this technology both in-house and for client solutions. The focus is on guiding clients through their entire Gen AI journey, from identifying impactful use cases to executing proofs of concept, while upskilling their workforce with essential expertise. The industry has seen a sevenfold increase in Gen AI activities, including business prospecting, talent development, partnerships and new product launches, solidifying Gen AI as a top strategic priority for tech services companies.” Key insights Startups: Gen AI saw a lagged effect of the ‘funding winter’, with decline seen in H12024. By contrast, overall tech startup funding rose globally and in India. All Gen AI investments in India in H12024 were in the early stages — deals within $50 million. Globally, marquee investments were in late/growth stages — in US, 2/3rd of H12024 investment deals were over $150 million. This year, greater investor funding went towards enterprise Gen AI platforms, relatively less towards application-based ones, unlike H12023. In the US, over 50% funding went to foundation model startups. Matrix Partners India emerged a key investor across multiple funding rounds. Enterprises: In India’s tech industry, Gen AI activity rose 7x since H1 2023 across business prospecting, talent development, partnerships, new product launches. 2024 saw transition to product launches after strategic partnerships forged in 2023, with revenue in sight. Focus is on building and platformisation of cross-sectoral and vertical Gen AI use cases. Enterprises turned to consultative business prospecting for guidance on use case selection, PoCs, decision-making around production, data privacy and security challenges. One million employees trained on Gen AI since H1 2023 — 3,50,000 in H12024.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST Good grades and a fancy degree may not be enough to get you that dream job or sustain a successful career. Asher Ling, Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director, Singapore at Princeton Digital Group, and SGTech’s Talent Steering Committee member explains what and why skills-based hiring is on the rise. A man being interviewed by a potential employer. (Photo: iStock) Here's an excerpt from the podcast: Tiffany Ang: You said (that) there is a guide to help companies move towards a skills-based hiring approach. But realistically, how many companies are we seeing now that will go okay, we are looking for a specific skill set, rather than just focusing on the paper. Asher Ling: I would say it depends on (the) industry. Within the tech industry, and especially within the infocomm tech industry, where certain skill sets, whether it's cybersecurity or AI capabilities or certain specific engineering expertise in my fields, those skill sets are extremely important beyond just having an engineering degree. I have a project director who runs very large-scale, complex engineering designs. When I first hired him, he came to me with a Higher Nitec (qualification) and he was a draftsman. But he had the right skill sets. We hired him, and then we developed him along the way. He went on to get his diploma and then in his 30s, he went on to do his degree, and that helped him to pivot his whole career to where he is. Tiffany: So, on the topic of hiring, how do you assess them right at the point of the interview, though? Do employers, let's say, throw them a set of simulations? What do they do? And isn't that a lot of work for the employer too? Asher: From a skills-based hiring approach, the general approach is to consider instead of just a straightforward interview where you look at the paper and then just do that interview. I've also done interviews, for example, for specific skill sets that we need, which is unable to be clearly identified from the qualifications, we put it as a situational test in the interview. For example, if I'm hiring a customer success manager, what I'll do is I'll take a real case, problem, situation, or crisis that I'm dealing with. And I'll ask the potential employee who's coming in and say, if this is the situation right now, and if these are complex, real life, real world, grey challenges, how are you going to deal with it?

Key Takeaways After a CrowdStrike update caused a global tech outage Friday, analysts said the event could have lasting implications for the company and the big tech industry. Jefferies analysts said that the outage could affect CrowdStrike's financials due to expenses associated with remedying the issues and damage its reputation. Citi analysts said the scale of disruptions caused by the outage may also push regulators to examine the big tech ecosystem. After a CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) update caused an outage affecting businesses and governments across the world Friday, analysts said there could be lasting implications for the company and the big tech industry. A defective update by the cybersecurity company disrupted Microsoft ( MSFT ) platforms, impacting organizations ranging from airlines to the London Stock Exchange . The news sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling Friday, while Microsoft shares were little changed. Outage Could Hit CrowdStrike's Bottom Line and Reputation, But Microsoft May Come Out Unscathed The outage could negatively affect CrowdStrike through expenses associated with remedying the situation and damage to its reputation. Jefferies analysts said that while it's too early to know the exact implications of the outage on the company's financials, the timing is not working in CrowdStrike's favor. The outage happened in the last two weeks of the quarter when the analysts said \"a large portion of business is done,\" raising the likelihood it could weigh down results. The analysts said that there could be an \"expense burden\" for the cybersecurity company as it works to appease impacted customers, which will likely mean \"credits, discounting or additional free products\" affecting margins. While the analysts highlighted that it's important that the outage was not related to a security issue and that CrowdStrike was transparent with its immediate response, they did say the incident could cause reputational damage that might deter customers and lead CrowdStrike to miss out on potential deals. While Microsoft was tied to the outage through disruptions to its systems, Jefferies analysts said the impact of the tech giant will likely be \"minimal.\" Microsoft is \"working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online,\" CEO Satya Nadella said in an X post Friday. Scale of Disruptions Could Draw Regulatory Scrutiny The scale of the outage also underlined the danger of consolidation within the tech industry where a few big players have a massive influence on the market, analysts said, and suggested it could draw attention from regulators to examine vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. Story Continues \"Given the scope of the outage and scale of economic disruption, we expect fresh, louder debates on the limits of vendor consolidation (systemic risk) both across the IT stack and especially cybersecurity,\" Citi analysts said. The analysts noted the \"outage will garner more political/regulatory attention\" as \"software vendors have clearly become so large and so interconnected where events like these are plainly showcasing their influence on the greater economic system.\" Read the original article on Investopedia .

Speed 1.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 (Adobe Stock photo) Indiana’s tech sector saw continued strength in venture capital activity in the second quarter with a combined $216 million in investment through 48 deals, according to a new report from TechPoint. The investment total is a 360% increase over the second quarter of 2023. The growth initiative for Indiana’s tech sector said the increase in VC deals in Indiana suggests a “growing interest and diversification in the state’s startup ecosystem despite broader financial headwinds.” Indiana’s results in the second quarter, TechPoint said, come as the number of VC deals and exits are on the decline nationally. “The increase in deal numbers within Indiana, however, suggests a potential shift towards exploring more smaller investments and a broader array of sectors than previous years,” TechPoint said. “Indiana’s ability to maintain a vibrant number of deals amidst the nationwide decrease underscores its growing reputation as a nurturing ground for new businesses and innovations.” The majority of the tech investments came in the life sciences (11 deals/$124.2M) and artificial intelligence and machine learning (9 deals/$56.85M) markets. However, investments were made across a variety of areas, including agbioscience, tech services, and software-as-a-service. The majority of the deals involved investments in startups at the pre-seed stage, totaling $3 million. Among the largest deals was a $58.3 million investment in Bunker Hill-based AZIsotopes, which came from undisclosed investors. Sortera Technologies in the northeast Indiana town of Markle also secured $44.4 million to expand its current operation and begin development on a second facility.

    "article_text": "Gaza Sky Geeks, a programme of Mercy Corps, launched an impact report on the Palestinian tech ecosystem “The Impact of Gaza Crisis on The Palestinian Tech Ecosystem.” Before the crisis that has been aggressively unfolding since the events on October 7th, Palestine was home to a tech ecosystem in bloom. Housing thousands of specialist outsourcing companies, freelancers, and early-stage startups, the Palestinian ICT sector was en route to becoming one of the primary industries providing the Palestinian population with a dignified livelihood. Thousands of people have made a living monetizing their skills online either as tech/tech-enabled service providers, or as freelancers in fields like programming, design, marketing, financial services, administration, and more. However, current events have put an effective stop to every aspect of life as we know it. The utter devastation, destruction, and unfathomable loss of human lives are debilitating. It makes it difficult, almost impossible, to talk about solutions, interventions, and rebuilding - but we must. Once a permanent ceasefire is reached, technology will be the key to unlocking the revival of the Gazan and Palestinian economy. But how? Twenty-eight tech ecosystem players, businesses, and freelancers were interviewed for this report, and they have all shared their input on interventions needed to revive Gaza. We say revive and not rebuild because the talent, capabilities, and determination are already there. All that is needed is to support and facilitate the ICT sector in the following areas: Financial Recovery for Businesses and Individuals Job Creation and Market Access for Businesses Rebuilding Business Capacity, Infrastructure, and Operational Capacity Tech and tech-enabled work is the gateway to earning a meaningful income and living in dignity, but nothing can be achieved in isolation. Now is the time for the tech ecosystem players, the private sector, and the international community to come together. Each must play their part in the revival of Gaza. The purpose of this report is to ascertain the impact of the October 7, 2023, events and their fallout on Palestinian tech-services companies, the digital workforce, and the tech ecosystem more broadly. This will, in turn, inform future marketing campaigns and advocacy efforts focused on the post-conflict operating context. The report will include considerations of reputational damage, business disruption, payment risks, and other factors that may affect the willingness of international clients and markets to engage with the Palestinian tech sector, as well as how to leverage any goodwill that has been generated. Responding to these risks and opportunities immediately is paramount to avoid negative perceptions becoming too firmly entrenched and to ensure the long-term potential of Palestine’s tech sector is not irrevocably undermined. This report has collected views and data from many players in the Palestinian tech ecosystem across the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza. We recognize that the situation in Palestine remains fragile and uncertain, and much depends on wider geopolitical decisions outside the control of the local tech ecosystem. Despite this, we aspire for this report to catalyze collaborative ideas and strategies aimed at rejuvenating the sector. By amplifying voices from across the Palestinian tech landscape, we can gain deeper insights into the conflict's genuine ramifications. This report stands as a crucial resource in informing the development of impactful programs by Gaza Sky Geeks, Mercy Corps, and other stakeholders within the evolving Palestinian context post-October 2023. Gaza Sky Geeks is a key player in Palestine's tech sector and carries a duty for its revival. Established in 2011 by Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian aid organization, GSG's mission initially focused on mentoring entrepreneurs in Gaza, expanding steadily in scope and outreach over the past decade. Before the events of October 2023, GSG operated multiple co-working spaces in Gaza and annually conducted hundreds of tech and employability training programs across Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. GSG served as a haven for Palestinian tech enthusiasts, offering training sessions, boot camps, and a place to enrich themselves while pursuing online income. Known for its inclusivity, vibrancy, comfort, and positive atmosphere, GSG proudly provided safe spaces for young Palestinian women, who made up more than 50% of its participants, to learn and work. Enabling large numbers of young Palestinians to secure employment and earn respectable incomes through online work is paramount for the future of Palestine. GSG’s integrated approach of capacity building of individuals and tech-services companies in specialist tech skills, combined with cross-regional ties and international market access, will help to improve the competitiveness of the Palestinian tech sector and deepen social cohesion and stability in Palestine. With this report, we aim to ignite a global conversation and extend a special invitation to our fellow tech ecosystem players to join us in our common goal of reviving the Palestinian tech sector."

PHOTO: AFP Published Tue, Jul 16, 2024 · 07:20 AM SALESFORCE cut about 300 roles as part of a broader effort to streamline operations, underscoring that the tech industry remains focused on controlling costs. The software giant made the cuts this month, according to a source familiar with the reductions who asked not to be identified because the information is not public. The company confirmed that it had pared some jobs, without getting specific. “Like any healthy business, we continuously assess whether we have the right structure in place to best serve our customers and fuel growth areas,” a spokesperson said. “In some cases that leads to roles being eliminated.” While a small sliver of the company’s total workforce, the cuts are just the latest example of the tech industry reining in costs following years of rapid hiring. San Francisco-based Salesforce cut about 700 workers earlier this year and pared roughly 10 per cent of its total workforce at the start of 2023. Several large tech companies announced major reductions this month. Intuit announced plans to eliminate 1,800 employees last week, blaming the reductions largely on underperforming employees and saying it would rehire roughly the same number of people. Software makers UiPath and Open Text also disclosed layoffs this month. Last month, Business Insider reported that Microsoft cut hundreds of workers in its Azure cloud division. Salesforce has previously spoken about hiring in key areas to drive revenue growth, such as around its Data Cloud product while keeping an eye on expenses. “Are we getting the most from everybody in the business – if we are not, we are going to have to make reshaping decisions,” said chief operating officer Brian Millham during a June investor conference.

Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks Palantir Technologies ( PLTR ) is a stock to watch. The fast-growing artificial intelligence ( AI ) innovator has been on a winning streak lately. Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com As red-hot as the artificial intelligence ( AI ) market is, Wall Street is still cautious about some companies. The best example is Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR ) stock. Despite its 66% year-to-date (YTD) gains over the past year and dynamic reach across many facets of the tech sector, it has still garnered undeniably mixed sentiment from analysts, the majority of whom rate it as a “hold.” But this week, things are off to a good start for Palantir. One firm has named it as a likely winner for the upcoming earnings season. While Wedbush Securities sees high growth ahead for other stocks, its other tech favorites trade at much higher levels than PLTR stock. This could make the company highly appealing to investors seeking new AI plays. What’s Happening With PLTR Stock It’s been an excellent month for Palantir and so far, its winning streak doesn’t appear to be easing. As of this writing, PLTR stock is up 3.5% for the day, and its current trajectory suggests it will continue trending upward. Despite minimal gains over the past week, today’s performance has pushed it into the green by 15% for the month. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, known for his tech sector expertise, recently issued an investor note on his predictions for the tech sector. As noted, his team sees several top stocks, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), benefitting from the second-quarter earning season. Palantir stands out on that list as not being among the Magnificent Seven. But Ives clearly sees potential in it. As he states of his team’s take: “We believe 2Q earnings will be a major positive catalyst for the tech sector and expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the robust tech gains in 1H2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage led by software, cyber security, digital advertising, and semis.” The analyst also highlights the importance of the AI revolution, noting that both “show cloud deployments and enterprise AI spending” are “tracking nicely ahead of Street expectations,” which puts names like PLTR stock in an excellent position to surge as the Q2 earnings season sparks new AI enthusiasm among investors. Why It Matters Even after its excellent past two quarters, PLTR stock still trades at less than $30 per share. That’s substantially lower than most of its dominant AI peers, which will likely make it a tempting play for investors looking to gain exposure to the booming market. Palantir is known as a data analytics company, but it has a reach across many sectors , including cybersecurity, energy and defense contracting, which has spawned a lucrative history of procuring government contracts. Earlier this year, it received a $178 million contract from the U.S. Army to build valuable ground station prototypes. Now that Ives has flagged it as a probable Q2 winner, PLTR stock is likely to rise even more over the coming weeks. While most people will likely be watching the sector’s more prominent names, smart investors will keep at least one eye on this fast-growing AI standout.

    "article_text": "Home News Israel Google’s £23 billion purchase of Israeli startup Wiz would be a ‘middle finger up to BDS’ Israel Google’s £23 billion purchase of Israeli startup Wiz would be a ‘middle finger up to BDS’ If it happens the deal will be the tech giant’s biggest-ever July 15, 2024 12:37 By JC Reporter , Jewish News Syndicate 3 min read Google’s parent company Alphabet is in advanced talks to acquire Israeli cloud cybersecurity startup Wiz in a deal worth some $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. If the agreement is inked, it would represent the California tech giant’s biggest-ever buy (scorching the previous record of $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2012). It would also mark a significant achievement for Israel’s high-tech sector. “This is the largest acquisition to ever happen in the Israeli high-tech sector. It’s a sign of the strength of the Israeli tech hub,” Dror Bin, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, told JNS on Monday. “It’s a sign of confidence that giants like Google show by making such an acquisition in Israel,” he added. Richie Torres, Member of the US House of Representatives, said the deal represesents “a $23 billion middle finger to the BDS movement against the Jewish State”. The politician, who has been outspoken in his support for Israel, continued “The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction movement should itself be boycotted, divested, and sanctioned”. Google is poised to acquire an Israeli cyber startup known as Wiz for $23 billion. Google’s largest acquisition in history is not only a vote of confidence in Israel. It is a $23 billion middle finger to the BDS movement against the Jewish State. The Boycott, Divestment, and… pic.twitter.com/ZAHBjf8MuR — Ritchie Torres (@RitchieTorres) July 15, 2024 Intel’s $15 billion pickup of Mobileye in 2017 is the current Israeli record holder. For its part, Google has shown interest in the Israeli market, in 2013 purchasing Waze for $1.1 billion, creating the Jewish state’s first domestic unicorn (a startup reaching $1 billion in valuation without being listed on the stock market). While Wiz is headquartered in New York City with nearly a thousand employees scattered across North America and Europe, most of its engineering team is based in Tel Aviv, where the 40-year-old Israeli co-founder and CEO Assaf Rappaport was born. Since its founding in Israel in 2020, the economic worth of the firm, which offers cybersecurity software for cloud computing, has skyrocketed. The company in May announced a funding round of $1 billion at a staggering $12 billion valuation. According to Wiz, the company hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months and in February of this year reached $350 million in annual recurring revenue, with a 40% market share of Fortune 100 customers. Wiz already partners with Google and other leading cloud companies, including Amazon and Microsoft. It plans to hire 400 more people in 2024. The local Israeli ecosystem consists of 9,000 different high-tech companies including early stage and early growth companies, large enterprises and multinationals. Since the start of the war against Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the Palestinian terror group’s Oct. 7 invasion of southern Israel, the high-tech sector has worked to maintain its services to global customers and deliver on promises made to investors. High-tech professionals launched the #NoMatterWhat campaign shortly after the beginning of the war to send the message that they continue to maintain the highest standards, despite some companies having had up to 20% of their workforces mobilized to serve the country. “The Israel Innovation Authority, the government agency responsible for the high-tech sector, also continues to invest in the local ecosystem since the war started,” Bin told JNS. “We have launched several programs and funds to secure early stage companies in Israel and make sure that the next wave of growth and innovation will occur,” he said. “The fundamentals of the Israeli tech sector did not change. We still have the best entrepreneurs in the world. I think that this type of deal shows it is indeed the case,” he added. While there are few details about what the acquisition will mean for Wiz’s operations, Bin sees it as very promising. “Google is buying Wiz for a reason. It’s a great company with great leaders and great employees and most of all amazing technological solutions. I assume Google is buying it to keep growing the business,” Bin said. “One of the amazing things about Wiz is that the company only started a few years ago and they managed to create a very high growth rate in its revenues and evaluation. and I am sure Google will continue this pace, investment and further maintain the high growth rate of this company,” he added.

    "article_text": "Big Tech has a problem thanks to energy-gobbling AI. These stocks may help solve it By Spencer Kimball,CNBC • Published July 12, 2024 BOOKMARKER Tayfun Coskun | Anadolu | Getty Images The tech sector faces a moment of truth in its ambitious climate targets, as the growing power needs of artificial intelligence data centers jeopardize the industry's promise to slash carbon emissions. Alphabet 's Google unit reported last week that its greenhouse gas emissions rose 13% in 2023 compared to the prior year, \"primarily due to increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\" Watch NBC Bay Area News free wherever you are WATCH HERE Google admitted in its most recent environmental report that \"reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment.\" And Microsoft disclosed in May that its indirect emissions rose by 31% compared to 2020, primarily due to \"the construction of more datacenters and the associated embodied carbon in building materials.\" Goals at risk The energy needs of AI computing pose a significant challenge to Google's and Microsoft's ambitious climate goals. Google aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 through around-the-clock carbon-free energy on every electric grid where it operates. Microsoft wants to become carbon negative in the same year, matching 100% of its electricity consumption with carbon-free energy and investing in carbon removal technologies. Whether this remains possible is unclear. Google and Microsoft, for example, have not pushed back their climate goals. But at the same time, forging ahead with energy-intensive generative AI is a commercial imperative for Microsoft, Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley's U.S. software analyst, told clients in a Thursday note.

Tech services make up about 7.5% of the country’s $3 trillion-plus gross domestic product. Bloomberg Updated On Jul 12, 2024 at 07:54 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook India’s $250 billion tech sector plays an important role in the economy, employing about 5.4 million people India ’s technology sector will need more than 1 million engineers with advanced skills in artificial intelligence and other capabilities over the next 2-3 years, an industry body estimates, a demand that won’t be met unless the government significantly beefs up education and training in the country. The sector will need to reskill more than half of its existing workforce to take up jobs in fields such as AI, big data analytics and cyber-security, said Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice president and chief strategy officer at the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), based in Bengaluru. New college graduates will only be able to fill a quarter of the advanced tech jobs needed, she said. Advt “Employability of the workforce is a huge challenge and will require a fair amount of work,” Gupta said in an interview Monday. “The industry can’t do with a one-time up-skilling, it has to be a continuous journey amid a fast changing digital landscape.” India ’s $250 billion tech sector plays an important role in the economy, employing about 5.4 million people. Tech services make up about 7.5% of the country’s $3 trillion-plus gross domestic product. IT businesses like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. are struggling to fill positions because of a wide mismatch between the skills of the workforce and what they need on the job. That threatens to put Indian IT companies at a disadvantage against global rivals such as International Business Machines Corp. and Accenture Plc. TCS said last month it’s unable to fill 80,000 jobs because of the skills gap. It’s also doubled the number of its employees trained on AI in the fiscal year that ended in March. Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India’s largest engineering and construction firm, said in June its IT and IT-enabled services unit has a shortage of 20,000 engineers. Gupta said the root of India’s skill gap lies with the country’s poor schooling system, from lower grades to high school. Colleges don’t provide students with enough practical skills, which are essential for the job market, she said. Nasscom estimates the demand supply gap for digital talent is expected to widen from the current 25% to about 29% in 2028. Advt The comments underscore warnings from well-known economists like former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who say India’s poor schooling will hinder growth prospects in a country where more than half of the 1.4 billion population are below the age of 30. A recent report from the international labour organization estimates that higher educated young people are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling.

This development could broaden market gains as tech sector growth slows, according to Bank of America. Bank of America’s analysts, Ohsung Kwon , CFA and Savita Subramanian , presented a more conservative outlook on Q2 earnings for U.S. companies compared to consensus estimates. While the consensus expects earnings per share (EPS) to rise by 9% year-over-year in Q2, the analysts anticipate a 2% beat which aligns with historical averages but is the smallest since Q4 2022. Behind the weaker-than-expected forecasts, analysts cited the weak macroeconomic data last quarter. “Economic Surprise Index is at the lowest level since June 2015. The historical relationship points to a 3% EPS miss,” Bank of America wrote. ‘Magnificent 7 vs. The Other 493’ The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE: RSP ) has underperformed the cap-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) by approximately 13 percentage points year-to-date. This gap widens significantly when comparing the broader market with the Magnificent 7, as tracked by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE: MAGS ), as illustrated in the chart below from Benzinga Pro. This trend could potentially be halted in the upcoming weeks. As the tech sector’s rapid growth begins to decelerate, the broader market, represented by the “Other 493” companies, is poised for earnings growth, according to Bank of America. “2Q is expected to be the first EPS growth quarter for the Other 493 since 4Q22, whereas growth for the Magnificent 7 is expected to slow for the second straight quarter and again in 3Q,” analyst wrote. The Magnificent 7’s earnings recovery began earlier because they entered an earnings recession in the second half of 2022. This prompted tech companies to implement cost-cutting measures sooner, resulting in an earlier recovery, Bank of America explained. Year-to-date, tech layoffs have significantly decreased, while layoffs outside the tech sector have increased, indicating more cost-cutting opportunities in non-tech industries. These efforts are expected to enhance margins for the “Other 493” in 2024-25. ‘ Virtuous Cycle’ From AI Investments A virtuous cycle appears to be forming from AI investments. Major tech companies — Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ) — confirmed last quarter that 2024 is set to be the first year of a multi-year AI investment cycle. The consensus capex forecast for these companies increased by $18 billion during Q1 earnings season to approximately $200 billion, a 34% year-over-year rise. Historically, companies in reinvestment cycles underperform, but AI investments could create a virtuous cycle. Semiconductor “are the most obvious beneficiaries,” Bank of America highlighted. Yet, the rising power consumption from AI and the construction of data centers are anticipated to boost demand for electrification, construction, utilities, and commodities, ultimately creating more jobs.

    "article_text": "Earnings Season Kicks Off This Week Amid Healthy Bump in S&P 500 Forward Estimate By Brian Gilmartin Stock Markets Published 07/08/2024, 12:25 AM Earnings Season Kicks Off This Week Amid Healthy Bump in S&P 500 Forward Estimate View all comments (1) 1 Brian Gilmartin Articles ( 1431 ) | My Homepage Follow US500 0.21% C -0.72% INTC -1.48% JPM -0.36% WFC 0.15% IXIC -0.25% The big banks start reporting next Friday, July 12th, ’24. Look for JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), Citigroup (NYSE: C ), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ). The June CPI and PPI data are also due this week, with CPI Thursday, July 11th, and PPI scheduled for release Friday, July 12th, 2024. This table from Briefing.com takes readers through the expected economic data for the week of July 7, ’24. Consumer credit will be released Monday afternoon. It doesn’t typically get a lot of press, but it’s been somewhat weak the last few months. S&P 500 Data: The forward 4-quarter estimate jumped $9 this week as the old quarter (Q2 ’24 – Q1 ’25) fell off and new quarter was added (Q3 ’24 – Q2 ’25), with the new forward 4-quarter estimate now $261.39. The forward 4-quarter estimate the first week of January ’24 was $243.98. The PE on the forward estimate is now 21.3x versus 21.6x last week and 19x to start 2024. The S&P 500 earnings yield jumped to 4.69% from last week’s 4.63% despite the 1.5% increase in the S&P 500 this week, thanks to the big jump in the forward estimate. Per LSEG, only 19 companies have reported Q2 ’24 financial results thus far, so “upside surprises” or beat rates, aren’t meaningful yet. There is no question that the S&P 500 earnings data is supportive of the bull market narrative. S&P 500 earnings are solid (so far). Rate-of-Change: This internal table using the expected quarterly EPS estimates for the S&P 500, shows the forward 4-quarter estimates looking out from Q3 ’24 through 2025, and then calculates the rate-of-change for the forward 4-quarter estimates sequentially, for 4 weeks and for 12 weeks. The unusual strength in May and June ’24 is starting to weaken, but that’s what happens in the last two weeks of each quarter and then the first two weeks of the following quarter, until the earnings release docket starts to ramp. It will be the week ending July 19th when we should start to see firming once again. Remember though, the S&P 500 will peak before the S&P 500 EPS estimates start to roll over. While the S&P 500 itself is a leading indicator, I’d say – after doing this weekly post for 20 years – that S&P 500 earnings are more a coincident indicator. For all the labor put into this weekly blog, readers should watch for negative pre-announcements of major large-cap stocks. I hate to constantly talk about market history, but going back to the year 2000, after the S&P 500 and NASDAQ topped in March 2000, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) warned in September 2000, and GE’s Jack Welch was using the mainstream media (primarily CNBC) to beat up on Greenspan and warn him of a rapidly slowing US economy, just as the mainstream media was getting wise to GE’s “earnings manipulation” for the last 20 years. One aspect that is rarely talked about today, is that in terms of earnings quality, the S&P 500 today is light years ahead of the late 1990’s, and where that is apparent is the cash-flow statement. Technology sector EPS and revenue trends: Q2 ’24 (est): tech sector EPS expected to grow +16.9% while tech sector revenue is expected at +9.5% yoy; Q1 ’24 actual: tech sector EPS grew +27% yoy, while revenue grew +8.5% yoy; Q4 ’23 actual: tech sector EPS grew +24.2% yoy, while revenue grew +7.8% yoy; Q3 ’23 actual: tech sector EPS grew 15.3% yoy, while revenue grew +2.8% yoy; Q2 ’23 actual: tech sector EPS grew +5% yoy, while revenue was flat yoy; Q1 ’23 actual: tech sector EPS fell 8.3% y-o-y, while revenue fell -2.9% yoy; The trend is your friend. What’s more interesting to me is looking at Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24, (see the first table in this late June blog post), note the “upside surprise” for technology as each month progressed in the Q4 ’23 and Q1 ’24 quarters. Tech is facing tougher compares in the back half of ’24, but note that revenue growth for the tech sector is starting Q2 ’24 at its highest level in 18 months. Conclusion: This blog has turned cautious on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq given the bad market breadth, and the lack of participation in the broader market (only two sectors outperformed the S&P 500 YTD in ’24, and those are technology and communication services, per Bespoke), but this “affliction” can continue on indefinitely, as we saw in the late 1990s. It’s a bull market in (some) stocks, so play it accordingly. None of this is advice or recommendation, but only a personal opinion. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, even for short periods of time. All EPS and revenue estimate data is sourced from LSEG.com. Thanks for reading.

    "article_text": "Industry adds 7,500 net new jobs, but tech occupation unemployment ticks up DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. , July 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Technology industry job growth in June was offset by slowdowns in other key employment metrics, analysis by CompTIA , the nonprofit association for the information technology (IT) industry and workforce. The tech industry added an estimated 7,540 net new workers in June, the biggest monthly increase in 2024, CompTIA's analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) #JobsReport data reveals. 1 Continue Reading Technology services and software development occupations continue to lead new hiring, a positive sign for the small and medium-size segment of the sector. The total base of US tech industry employment stands at approximately 5.6 million workers. That positive result was countered by the loss of 22,000 tech occupations throughout the economy. 2 The tech unemployment rate experienced an unexpected jump to 3.7%, moving directionally with the national unemployment rate increase for the month. \"Despite pockets of growth, the recent data indicates a degree of downward pressure on tech employment,\" said Tim Herbert , chief research officer, CompTIA. \"A combination of factors, including AI FOMO , likely contributes to segments of employers taking a wait and see approach with tech hiring.\" New employer job postings for tech positions totaled nearly 200,000 in June, down slightly month-over-month. In total there were more than 444,600 active tech job postings for the month and 2.5 million for the year. 3 Among major metropolitan markets, San Francisco and Denver recorded healthy gains in the number of job postings from May to June. Open positions in San Francisco totaled 6,110, an increase of 1,077 from May. In Denver , tech job postings increased by 424 to 3,684. Most other metro markets saw modest declines. California , Texas and Virginia had the highest volumes of June tech job postings among the states. The report shows that 46% of all active tech job postings in June did not specify that candidates have a four-year degree. The percentage was higher for several key tech positions, including network support specialists (90%), IT support specialists (73%), network and systems administrators (54%), network architects (50%) and database administrators (50%). The \"CompTIA Tech Jobs Report\" is available at https://www.comptia.org/content/tech-jobs-report . About CompTIA The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a leading voice and advocate for the $5 trillion global information technology ecosystem; and the estimated 75 million industry and tech professionals who design, implement, manage, and safeguard the technology that powers the world's economy.

    "article_text": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story The UK’s new government already has big plans. In the first few weeks after the election, it will signal to the world that Britain is “back” as a leading global player and rekindle ties with old friends in Europe. Yet Britain’s calling card, when it comes to tech industry credentials, is not as sparkling as it once was. Its big bet on tech, allegedly a priority for the Conservative party following Brexit, has yet to manifest into a new golden age for the industry. In fact, the UK tech landscape has survived many things during the 14 years of consecutive Conservative governments: Brexit; a tech talent pipeline problem; a two-and-a-half-year hiatus of its membership in Europe’s key science and innovation program, Horizon; overreliance on foreign investors ; and a worrying lack of appeal as a place to grow startups or go public. A majority Labour government could change all that and turbocharge the tech industry into a new renaissance—if politics don’t get in the way. Despite all these headwinds, the UK tech sector is still in remarkably good shape. It has around 50 startup unicorns (companies valued at over $1 billion), and its tech industry remains the third-most-valuable in the world after the US and China. But in 2023, fewer than 300 startups accessed funding in a Series A round ( according to figures from investment community VenturePath), and only six companies achieved unicorn status , a worrying direction of travel for the industry. A lack of ambitious pro-tech funding has underpinned what some startup founders, investors, and tech advocates that spoke to WIRED describe as a “difficult period” for the UK economy, with increased competition from startup hubs around the world. Their message to this Labour government is clear: Improve investment opportunities, unlock the potential of future technologies, and steal certain things from the playbooks of former Conservative governments—and other nations—to get ahead. But Labour hasn’t provided them with much reassurance yet. Its manifesto promises “Labour will make Britain the best place to start and grow a business,” will speed up approval times for new technology, and will establish “binding regulation” to develop artificial intelligence. It mentions a few other specifics, such as to “scrap short funding cycles for key R&D institutions in favour of ten-year budgets.” It also promises to “make Britain a clean energy supplier.” However, the party’s overall plan is to “unblock tech barriers to restart the engine of our economy,” a statement that is very vague and open to interpretation. Antony Walker, deputy CEO of UK tech-sector trade association techUK, said “barriers” the Labour party intends to remove could include “challenges around the R&D credit system” and issues around continuing to build out and deepen the UK’s digital infrastructure, including planning for things like data centers . The first thing that the tech industry wants is more strategy and ambition. “We need a go-to market strategy that says, ‘Here’s the emerging technologies in the next 10 to 20 years that are going to become important,’ the SWOT analysis that demonstrates the strengths and opportunities in the UK versus the strengths and opportunities in other countries,” says Charles Sturman, CEO of TechWorks, an industry body that represents UK semiconductor and deep tech companies. In his view, these include quantum computing, AI, and neuromorphic computing. “I think we need a longer-term, multiyear, multi-parliament, at least 10-year strategy that does all of this. But then also what we need is the government to be prepared to put public money on the table.” This would involve reversing Labour’s pledge to be frugal —a political risk in the current economy. One way for Labour to unlock capital is to leverage the power of pensions and allocate more of their funds to venture capital to fill the Series A funding gap, says Edward Prior, head of investor services at early-stage VC fund SFC Capital. “There’s more US pension fund money in UK startups than there is UK pension fund money,” he argues. “Yes, we need to be the best place to start a business, and we really are on a world-leading footing with that, but we also need to be the best to scale a business, because we are losing too much of our value for our economy in those scale-up stages, where there is not enough money coming into series A and beyond.” If the new government is looking for inspiration to bridge the funding gap, it could adopt some of the previous government’s initiatives and see them through. There was no mention in Labour’s manifesto of any changes to the Conservatives’ EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme), SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme), and VCT (Venture Capital Trust) tax schemes, but VC funds argue that it is important that these initiatives are maintained to improve the startup economy. Russ Shaw CBE, founder of Tech London Advocates & Global Tech Advocates, a support community for startups, says the biggest issue is funding for companies seeking unicorn status. He also highlighted issues with the talent pipeline, which Labour could tackle by delving into the thorny issue of immigration. “We have the Scale-Up Worker visa and the Global Talent visa, which are good, but it’s the process candidates have to follow that is fundamentally broken,” says Shaw. Alan Chang from Fuse Energy, a clean energy company that launched two years ago, says his company has had to “jump through so many hoops” to bring talent from abroad over to the UK, and this is a problem Labour will have to fix by making high-skilled talent visas easier, quicker, and cheaper to acquire. “In my network, I know a lot of people who are very successful who have either left the UK or who are thinking about leaving,” he explains. If Labour dropped the immigration health surcharge—a levy of around £1,000 ($1,276) annually for workers—it would make it much more attractive for skilled people to come to the UK, says Zach Meyers, assistant director for the Centre for European Reform. “The immigration surcharge is kind of insane, because it’s basically like a tax on their migrants. And that is a single step that would, I think, go a long way to addressing the skills problem.” The new government would also do well to pay attention to the £250 billion of new value identified in the Alison Rose Review in 2019 that could be unlocked if women were backed to the same extent as men. Only 2 percent of VC funding is going to female founders, points out Emma Wright, partner at UK law firm Harbottle & Lewis, co-lead of the invest-HER campaign, and director of the Interparliamentary Forum on Emerging Technologies. She argues that there would be “a lot of benefit” from providing transparency on where investment money is going. “It would address both some of the missions around, for instance, social mobility or regional funding, but also the ability to then make an assessment of whether there is more to unlock within the economy.” Improving talent schemes is not the only thing the future government can capitalize on to make the UK a global connector. “The next UK government is going to be constantly confronted with this question about the extent to which it should align or diverge from the European Union,” says Walker, and unlike the Conservative government, a Labour government will be coming with “less baggage.” “Maybe we will be able to look at it more on a case-by-case basis, which might be an optimal relationship for the UK in terms of the way it aligns or diverges from the European Union,” says Walker. “I think there will be a closer dialog, and certainly we have seen European institutions such as the European Commission already engaging more with the UK.” The UK may still attract more VC funding than France, but President Emmanuel Macron leadership’s bid to create a successful generation of AI startups has not gone unnoticed among the UK tech community. The prospect of political instability across the channel following the French elections may provide the new UK government with an unexpected advantage. “A lot of the French tech sector ecosystem has been built on public sector funding and investment by the French government into public sector funding. If the far right wins in France, will that funding continue?” says Shaw. “The challenge they will face, which I don’t think the UK has, is that if a lot of your sector is built on public sector funding, when you have a change in government, that potentially puts at risk the funding models you’ve put in place.” “France is definitely stealing a march,” says Wright. But the UK may be able to leverage its independence. Wright argues that the UK has “some scope” to deviate from the EU AI Act, which may be seen as quite cumbersome from a compliance perspective, but could show leadership in global governance “and that pragmatism that we [the UK] are often known for with our regulation achieving the same outcomes.” The industry still needs to keep up its levels of international investment, says Walker. “They [Labour] have talked about this idea of having a big international business summit early on. Then, I think there’s a bigger process of: How do you open up that access to capital markets in the UK? How do you address some of the risk aversion of some of the UK pension funds to make sure there’s the capital there? That’s going to be a critical area Labour need to focus on.” The real question is: Does Labour have the capacity to make all of these changes? The slice of the UK tech industry that spoke to WIRED certainly thinks so. “There’s lots of excitement about what will come next,” Walker says. Ultimately, the bottom line is that even if Labour does nothing at all to move the dial any time soon, a majority government will have a positive net impact on investment, and therefore tech. “I don’t think we can underestimate the importance of certainty for the next five years and how much that might lead to people being able to value markets and make some investments,” says Wright. “That’s the first thing they can do without major intervention.” Let’s not forget that a 2022 Labour report, titled Start Up, Scale Up , outlined plans to transform Britain into the “startup hub of the world” and preempted many of the issues that still affect the industry today. Rachel Reeves, the then-shadow chancellor, preempted the path ahead: “We can continue down the road of managed decline, falling behind our competitors, or we can draw on bold thinking to propel us forward.”"

    "article_text": "The Q2 Earnings Season Gets Underway Sheraz Mian July 3, 2024 4 min read ^GSPC Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: The setup for the Q2 earnings season, whose early reports have started trickling in, is one of continued resilience coupled with a steadily improving outlook. Given the favorable revisions trend ahead of this reporting cycle, we will be looking for further improvement in the earnings outlook. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth rate since the +9.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022. Earnings growth for the Energy sector is on track to turn positive in Q2 after remaining in negative territory over the preceding four quarters. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues. Excluding the ‘Mag 7’, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +5% (from +8.6%). Regular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our favorable take on the overall earnings picture. A big part of our positive view reflects developments on the revisions front, both for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as the remainder of the year. As noted earlier, the current +8.6% earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 index is barely down from where the growth rate stood at the start of the period, as shown in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In addition to the Energy sector, Q2 estimates have increased for the Tech, Utilities, Transportation, and Autos sectors, helping partly offset negative cuts for the other sectors. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period. The 2024 Q2 quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of robust Tech sector earnings growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +15.8% from the same period last year. For full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.4%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. The chart below shows how the aggregate earnings total for the Tech sector has evolved over the past year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Some of the major Tech stocks that have led the market’s gains this year are also experiencing positive estimate revisions. Story Continues Take, for example, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia Corp. NVDA. The current $20.16 per share earnings estimate for META for this year is up from $17.64 at the start of the year and $14.92 on June 30 th , 2023. The magnitude of positive revisions to NVDA’s estimates is in a league of its own. We will be closely watching how the revisions trend for the space unfolds as the Q2 reporting cycle really gets going, but the early results from the likes of Oracle ORCL and Adobe ADBE suggest that we can expect continued favorable momentum here. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector’s positive earnings outlook is the sector’s margins outlook, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research We are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year’s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector’s productivity. The Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that this year’s +9.1% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +9.0%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.

    "article_text": "One-Two Punch As the tech sector reels from round after round of layoffs , one underemployed worker is urging others in her position to do anything — including sell their blood — to make ends meet. In an interview with SFGATE , 55-year-old marketing writer Nina McCollum said that after being let go from what she thought was her dream job at an HR tech firm last spring, finding substantial work has been a struggle. Since that fateful termination last March, McCollum has rejoined the ranks of the un- and underemployed folks in the tech sector forced to contend with increased competition and lowered wages. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement That layoff, however, was far from the first for the tech-adjacent writer who went viral in 2019 for submitting more than 200 job applications without being hired. She's gotten so good at handling the aftermath of layoffs that she's become something of an expert in it — and now, she's urging others in her position to do whatever it takes to survive. McCollum's advice to others impacted by the tech industry's pivot to AI is to, essentially, not go for broke. Instead of taking on jobs that pay too little for the heaps of responsibility they pour onto workers, she advises people quite literally sell their plasma or their belongings to keep the lights on. Ego, McCollum suggests, is the enemy — and there's nothing wrong with doing whatever job will pay the bills and not burn you out. Bleak Outlook As for her own prospects, the mother of one who also takes care of her ailing mother knows that the realities of her age and the responsibilities she holds make her an unattractive candidate to employers. \"They want someone young and cheap,\" McCollum told SFGATE . \"My chances of obtaining another great-paying [full-time] job are next to zero.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement We'd wager that doing menial side hustle tasks like driving for UberEats will likely end up being as (not-so) lucrative as plasma donation, which pays on average about $30-70 per donation . But then again, with Silicon Valley tech execs' obsession with young blood , you might be able to get more if you're young or know someone.

PHOTO: BT FILE Metta Ni, Augustin Boey and Neil Lee Published Wed, Jul 3, 2024 · 05:00 AM FOR decades, Singapore has been held up as a model of successful state-led economic development. However, many doubted whether this top-down approach could succeed in the rapidly evolving digital economy, where nimble entrepreneurship is often seen as more important than long-term government planning. Despite doubts about Singapore’s struggles to nurture a thriving tech sector in the late 2000s, the city-state has now emerged as a global powerhouse in scaling up digital technology firms more than a decade later. How did this transformation happen? Our new research sheds light on Singapore’s journey. We found that the key was the government’s ability to coordinate a diverse ecosystem of actors – a capability we term “network coordination”.

    "article_text": "NPR Calif. bill would take steps to ensure AI models won't cause catastrophic events By A Martínez Published July 2, 2024 at 2:16 AM PDT Facebook LinkedIn Email Bluesky Twitter Listen • 3:44 A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: California, where the tech industry is paying close attention to newly proposed AI legislation. The bill says large companies that develop artificial intelligence must take reasonable steps to ensure their AI models can't cause catastrophic events. So think biological warfare or mass casualties. Now, some AI developers say the bill is an overreach that could stifle innovation. Others in the field say the potential risks of AI need to be taken seriously. The bill's author is California State Senator Scott Wiener. And I asked him what his bill is meant to do. SCOTT WIENER: This is a really light touch, basic safety approach, and it only applies to very large, powerful AI models that cost more than $100 million to train. So we're talking about the large labs like Google or Meta or OpenAI. This is not about startups. It doesn't cover startups. And what it requires is that if you're going to train and release one of these massive models that don't even exist today but will very soon, that you should perform basic safety testing on that model to determine if it creates a significant risk of a huge, catastrophic harm. And to be clear, the large labs like OpenAI and Anthropic and Meta and Google have already committed to doing this testing. So we're simply asking them to do the testing they've agreed to do. MARTÍNEZ: So if someone has technology that someone else uses in a malicious way or a harmful way or a deadly way, why should that company be held responsible? WIENER: Well, first of all, the person who uses the technology in a malicious way should be held accountable, and that's the case now, and that'll remain the case. But when we're talking about incredibly powerful models that we have never seen as a human society before, shouldn't we also try to reduce the risk that that model can enable a bad actor to do something malicious? MARTÍNEZ: Now, I think a lot of people, Senator, right now, are maybe more concerned about maybe the smaller scale risks that AI could pose, like, maybe automation that might mean that they lose their jobs. I mean, your bill talks about AI maybe enabling nuclear war. I mean, has the technology really advanced to that point? WIENER: The safety issues that we're talking about in this bill are not the only challenge that we have. Of course, there's algorithmic discrimination and other deepfakes. And, of course, that should be and is being addressed. But, you know, as human beings, sometimes we ignore risk until something terrible happens. That happened with social media. We allowed it to go for years and years without doing anything to address the real harms that social media was causing. Why don't we get ahead of the risk for once? MARTÍNEZ: Did you introduce this bill maybe because Congress has yet to pass their own AI legislation and they're not moving quick enough? WIENER: Congress has a horrible track record of not doing anything to address risks caused by technology. California, as the epicenter of tech innovation and AI innovation, we are well positioned and have a responsibility to step up to foster innovation, 'cause I want to be clear, AI promises so many benefits to humanity, and I'm a huge fan of AI, but we also are well positioned to address some of the safety risks and to try to reduce those risks in a way that fosters innovation. And so California should step up because I am not optimistic that Congress is going to do anything here. MARTÍNEZ: That is California State Senator Scott Wiener. Thank you very much.

NPR's A Martinez speaks with its sponsor, state Sen. Scott Wiener. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: California, where the tech industry is paying close attention to newly proposed AI legislation. The bill says large companies that develop artificial intelligence must take reasonable steps to ensure their AI models can't cause catastrophic events. So think biological warfare or mass casualties. Now, some AI developers say the bill is an overreach that could stifle innovation. Others in the field say the potential risks of AI need to be taken seriously. The bill's author is California State Senator Scott Wiener. And I asked him what his bill is meant to do. SCOTT WIENER: This is a really light touch, basic safety approach, and it only applies to very large, powerful AI models that cost more than $100 million to train. So we're talking about the large labs like Google or Meta or OpenAI. This is not about startups. It doesn't cover startups. And what it requires is that if you're going to train and release one of these massive models that don't even exist today but will very soon, that you should perform basic safety testing on that model to determine if it creates a significant risk of a huge, catastrophic harm. And to be clear, the large labs like OpenAI and Anthropic and Meta and Google have already committed to doing this testing. So we're simply asking them to do the testing they've agreed to do. MARTÍNEZ: So if someone has technology that someone else uses in a malicious way or a harmful way or a deadly way, why should that company be held responsible? WIENER: Well, first of all, the person who uses the technology in a malicious way should be held accountable, and that's the case now, and that'll remain the case. But when we're talking about incredibly powerful models that we have never seen as a human society before, shouldn't we also try to reduce the risk that that model can enable a bad actor to do something malicious? MARTÍNEZ: Now, I think a lot of people, Senator, right now, are maybe more concerned about maybe the smaller scale risks that AI could pose, like, maybe automation that might mean that they lose their jobs. I mean, your bill talks about AI maybe enabling nuclear war. I mean, has the technology really advanced to that point?

What Happened : On Monday, while appearing on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Ives explained the ripple effect of Nvidia’s success throughout the tech industry. Ives noted that tech stocks were up another 15% , he said that even though the rally was led by ‘Godfather of AI’ Jensen Huang , the \"multiplier for every dollar spent on an Nvidia chip — $8-10 flows into rest of the tech.\" He also pointed out that some tech firms feel the strain, especially those lacking the necessary resources and expertise. See Also: Investors Predict Impact Of Potential Trump Presidency On Markets: ‘The Market Is Already Priced For That To Happen’ Comparing this moment to the pivotal tech boom of 1995 rather than the bubble of 1999, Ives said, “It’s a 1995 moment, not a 1999 moment,” expressing his sustained bullishness for tech stocks. Ives compared the current situation to a party , with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) playing pivotal roles. “Apple is now on the dance floor at the AI Party with Nvidia and Microsoft still running the show as DJs….but it's only 9 pm and this AI Party goes till 4 am in our view,” he said. When questioned about the longevity of this tech bull market, Ives forecasted a two-year run. Why It Matters : The tech sector has been buzzing with excitement as industry giants race towards a $4 trillion market cap The AI revolution is just beginning, and the second half of 2024 promises even more thrills. Nvidia’s stock had seen a significant rebound after a recent correction, with Ives suggesting that the company's market cap could reach $4 trillion. He has also identified Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR ) as the “purest” AI stock in terms of use cases. Last week, Peter Thiel , while speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival , drew parallels between the dot-com bubble of '99 and the current state of AI. He went on to say that Nvidia is capturing 80-85% of the revenue in the AI sector, something Thiel found “very strange.” This is because most of the profits are being generated at the hardware level, an area “Silicon Valley doesn’t even know much about anymore.” Photo Courtesy: Shutterstock.com Read Next: The Rise And Fall Of Pioneering Weed Markets: RIP California And Colorado Cannabis Industries Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.

The Role of SIA Scotch Whisky in the Partnership You might wonder, what does a whisky brand have to do with AI? The answer lies in shared values. SIA Scotch Whisky, founded by Carin Luna-Ostaseski, is dedicated to breaking barriers and championing diversity, much like the Women in AI who are paving the way for future generations by fostering change and inclusivity within the tech industry. Both realms, though seemingly different on the surface, share a commitment to pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. SIA Scotch Whisky, founded by trailblazing Hispanic entrepreneur Carin Luna-Ostaseski. She is one of the first women in history to create a brand of Scotch Whisky. Duy Ho Photography SIA Scotch Whisky has been revolutionizing the industry and inspiring others to achieve the unexpected. Founded by a trailblazing Hispanic entrepreneur, SIA is among the first scotch whisky brands of its kind. Its approachable flavor profile boasts notes of warm vanilla, salty-sweet caramel, refreshing citrus, clover honey, buttery toffee, and a subtle hint of smoke. Perfect for cocktails, enjoyed neat or on the rocks, SIA shines best in settings where potential is unleashed and friendships are celebrated. “We appreciate being included as part of the What She Said event at W San Francisco,” states Carin Luna-Ostakeski, founder of SIA . “The focus on AI brought light to the women in the industry that are paving the way as pioneers in a new industry. As the founder of SIA, I’m a pioneer in my own right as one of the first women in history to create a brand of Scotch Whisky. My hope is that by introducing ‘outsiders’ to the spirit, and really anything that’s new, we can show that not only is it okay to be an outsider, but even that being an outsider is in! What She Said is such an amazing platform to showcase inspiring women doing incredible things and I feel so honored to be included.” About the ‘What She Said’ Series Welcome to What She Said. W Hotels launched What She Said in 2016, to celebrate the fabulous women who stay with us every day and those who live in our communities. We wanted to create a safe space for women to share their experiences and be heard, learn from each other and connect. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...
