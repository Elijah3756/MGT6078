This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The Defense News Top 100 list of defense companies for 2024 includes five Turkish firms, up from four in 2023, amid rising global demand for Turkish defense products and increasing maturation of the Turkish defense industrial sector in terms of breadth and sophistication. Ranked Turkish companies include: ASELSAN (42, up from 47 last year): producer of defense electronics, especially communications and sensors. ASELSAN was the first Turkish company to crack the Top 100 in 2008 and has consistently been the leading Turkish defense revenue generator. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI or TUSAS ) (50, up from 58): leader in Turkish defense aerospace joined the Top 100 in 2012 and has been the second-ranked Turkish firm since. ROKETSAN (71, up from 80): producer of unguided rockets and guided missiles has seen revenues grow in large part due to integration of its products on Turkish unmanned systems Machine and Chemical Industry ( MKE ) (84, new): producer of small arms, artillery and ammunition; shifted from a state-owned enterprise to a joint stock company in 2022. Has helped meet booming demand for artillery and related munitions. Military Factory and Shipyard Enterprise ( AFSAT ) (94, new): aircraft, naval and land systems production and overhaul. Major deals with Pakistan (MILGEM) Burkina Faso/Togo (minesweepers). Several intriguing aspects of this grouping stand out. First, Turkey occupies an elite tier among international arms producers. Only eight countries have more than two companies in the Top 100, and only three — the U.S., U.K. and China — have more Top 100 firms than Turkey. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Top 100 is here: Find out how defense companies performed in FY23 The U.S. is in a class of its own, but with 25% defense export growth and $5.5 billion revenue in 2023 , the Turks have risen to near the top of the second tier. Second, arguably the most dynamic sector in the Turkish defense industry — unmanned systems — has yet to produce a Top 100 firm, but seems poised to do so moving forward. BAYKAR , makers of the TB2 Bayraktar and Akinci Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles, has become the standard bearer for Turkish defense innovation and operational impact across various global hotspots. TAI produces high-quality drones as well, and a half-dozen other companies have established Turkey as an innovation and price-performance leader in the field. That five Turkish companies not centered on unmanned systems made the Top 100 makes clear that an understanding of Turkish defense needs to look beyond the headline-generating drones. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Third, such growth could not have happened without an expanding network of clients and partners for the Turkish defense industry; while indigenization has increased the milli ve yerli (locally/nationally produced) portion of domestic defense needs, globally significant firms require foreign markets and partnerships. Turkish defense sector firms — there are over 3,500 total — have built partnerships with Ukraine , the U.K. , Pakistan , Gulf countries and many others . The Turkish Ministers of Defense (Yasar Guler) and Defense Industry (Haluk Gorgun) addressed a bilateral Defense Industrial Base conference in Washington on the sidelines of the recent NATO summit, and touted the Turkish defense sector as young, dynamic, enjoying unique access in the Mideast, Africa, Balkans, Central and South Asia — and uniquely positioned to partner with U.S. firms. Guler assessed during the conference that Turkish exports in the first half of 2024 showed continued growth, up 20% year on year. An interesting bit of context for this year’s Top 100 is the directed efforts in Washington and Ankara to deepen and broaden defense cooperation between the two NATO allies. The Turkish American Business Council (TAIK, headed by Murat Ozyegin) and the American Turkish Business Roundtable (ATBR, led by retired Gen. James Jones) have convened two conferences in 2024 to bring U.S. and Turkish firms together to explore areas for collaboration and cooperation in the defense sector. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With the example of the recently approved F-16 deal and joint venture for 155mm artillery ammunition between Turkish and American firms , we might expect to see many more such joint ventures emerge. The Turkish defense industry still faces growing pains and dilemmas, though. The International Institute for Strategic Studies noted in a recent study that the Turkish defense industry is at a crossroads: Having increased self-sufficiency and developed significant export capabilities through defense sector indigenization, it has developed a new dependence on sustained exports and defense industrial cooperation for advanced subsystems. Substantial autonomy does not mean full independence in the defense sector but rather continued complex interdependence. This implies that continued growth will require proactive consultation and mutual compromise between Ankara, Washington and NATO allies in Europe. Another check on growth has been the Turkish government’s struggles with inflation, which is currently subject to a significant campaign of monetary tightening. Upward pressure on interest rates from the battle against hyperinflation has made domestic bank loans less attractive for developing small firms into major defense industrial players. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One solution has been for such firms to pursue public listing rather than domestic bank or government financing. Demand remains high in the global market for the solid price-performance balance that has typified Turkish defense products. That augurs well for the continued growth of the five current Top 100-member Turkish firms and those aspiring to join the club. If 2024 sees progress in Ankara’s efforts to bring down inflation, continued macroeconomic stability and sustained Great Power Competition, this year’s strong performance from the Turkish national defense sector should be reprised or accelerated over the next twelve months.

After operating as an industrial conglomerate for more than 130 years, growing to become a bellwether, blue chip industrial firm, GE spun off its various core businesses. Since April 2, 2024, the history-steeped GE stock ticker symbol has represented GE Aerospace, a leaner company exclusively focused on civilian and military propulsion systems. Though it has only been a stand-alone company for two quarters now, GE Aerospace is off to a profitable start. Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.39 %) $ -1.22 Current Price $ 310.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.05 - $ 312.72 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 2.7M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % GE Aerospace's fantastic second quarter of 2024 The company reported strong earnings that included across-the-board growth in orders, operating margin and profit, and free cash flow. Orders up 18%, to $11.2 billion Adjusted revenue up 4%, to $8.2 billion Operating profit up 37%, to $1.9 billion Adjusted earnings per share up $0.46, to $1.20 per share Free cash flow up $200 million, to $1.1 billion These second-quarter results come on the heels of a similarly strong first quarter. Clearly, GE Aerospace is building momentum as a stand-alone entity. Besides the profitable results, the company also issued upward revised guidance for full-year 2024, forecasting free cash flow of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, operating profits of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.20. The bullish revision to its guidance makes sense, since the company also reported new agreements to supply engines for 34 aircraft for four different airlines. As part of GE Aerospace's focus on operational results, the company reported progress on its Flight Deck strategic plan. By the close of the second quarter, it had made progress growing efficiencies at the majority of its 15 largest suppliers. In total, GE Aerospace's second quarter was chock-full of encouraging news. GE Aerospace is executing an investor-friendly capital allocation plan The profitable operating results from the first two quarters of the year aren't the only encouraging signs for investors in GE Aerospace. Since operating as a stand-alone company, GE Aerospace has been implementing a capital allocation plan that favors investors. The plan involves the regular payment of dividends as well as share repurchases. During the second quarter of 2024, the company repurchased 11.7 million shares and paid a dividend of $0.28 per share; the dividend is currently yielding 0.66% on a forward basis. As part of the company's overall strategic plan that is focused on operational leanness, GE Aerospace either completed or reached agreements to sell several legacy insurance and licensing businesses. The focus for the future is very much on the core propulsion business, and management seems determined to help shareholders reap the rewards of its pinpoint focus. GE Aerospace stock is fully valued and not a buy at current levels Things are going well for GE Aerospace, and with the more concentrated focus on propulsion, growing sales and earnings, and an emphasis on rewarding shareholders, there is little for investors to quibble with -- except for the share price. Up over 80% in the last year, shares have come a long way very quickly. Analyzing GE Aerospace on traditional valuation metrics, especially in comparison to competitor RTX Corporation ( RTX +0.11% ) , reveals that shares are currently not attractive on a valuation basis. Ticker Price-to-free cash flow per share Price-to-earnings ratio Price-to-sales ratio Price-to-book value ratio Dividend coverage ratio GE 52.0 40.3 2.7 9.9 8.1 RTX 35.4 21.4 2.4 2.6 0.7 On every one of the traditional valuation metrics shown in the table, GE Aerospace is more expensive than RTX; in several cases, substantially so. One area where GE Aerospace shows more potential than RTX is in its dividend coverage; its coverage ratio is substantially higher than RTX's. This higher ratio not only means that GE Aerospace can easily afford its dividend, it also shows there is substantial room to increase its dividend, which could be attractive to income investors. The bottom line is that GE Aerospace is off to a strong start as a stand-alone company, but its shares are too expensive right now. Value-oriented investors should watch for a drop in share price, looking for an opportunity to buy this quality company ""on sale."""

The latest leg up is due to its impressive second-quarter earnings release earlier this week. Howmet's end markets The company generates around 52% of its sales from commercial aerospace and 16% from defense aerospace, with commercial transportation at about 18%. The remaining 14% is under the ""industrial and other"" heading. Its crucial end markets are jet engine components, aerospace fastening systems, and airframe structural components.

While it's no secret that end market demand for airplanes (commercial or defense) remains robust, and manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs, there are questions about delivery rates. Boeing's delivery issues are well documented , and Airbus recently lowered its guidance for airplane deliveries. Moreover, this year, GE Aerospace has significantly reduced its 2024 guidance for production of the LEAP engine, which powers the Airbus A320 neo and the Boeing 737 MAX. Howmet's earnings dispel fears That said, Howmet beat expectations for the second quarter, and management raised its full-year revenue, earnings, and cash-flow guidance. Instead of a baseline case of $2.35 in earnings per share (EPS), management now expects $2.55. Image source: Boeing. Discussing the airplane volume issue on the earnings call, CEO John Plant said that, despite slowing its production, Airbus was still increasing its requirements. Meanwhile, parts orders at Boeing ""continue to be at levels above the actual 737 and 787 build rates."" Indeed, Boeing expects a recovery in build rates on the 737 MAX to hit 38 a month by year-end. That would be good news for Howmet, and it can continue its strong operational performance."

Fast forward to 2024, the New Zealand-based aerospace company has received its certification from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to fly its rocket-powered aircraft for supersonic flights at unlimited speeds. This certification also allows the plane to be flown beyond the pilot’s line of sight without needing special restricted airspace. It’s a milestone for Mk-II Aurora, which has completed 50 flight tests under both jet and rocket power since July 2021, even operating under more restrictive licenses. Dawn Aerospace poses its rocket-powered aircraft as the first air vehicle ever to fly to 100 kilometers altitude, towards the suborbital, and make it happen two times in a single day. Aside from conducting supersonic flights, the aircraft can also fly for high-speed flight research, earth observation, as well as other defense and civil uses. all images courtesy of Dawn Aerospace Dawn aerospace to set new record for rocket-powered aircraft Dawn Aerospace worked closely with local agencies like the CAA, NZ Space Agency, and other agencies for several years prior to receiving the certification. They went through rigorous checks and testing to ensure that the aerospace company’s rocket-powered aircraft could deliver its performance enough to carry out supersonic flights. Now, their Mk-II Aurora is ready for another goal: to fly up to 100 kilometers high multiple times a day. If successful, this can set new records for speed, altitude, and climb rate for an aircraft that powers itself. In 2023, Mk-II Aurora reached speeds of 200 knots and altitudes of 9,000 feet during its test flights. Dawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft Mk-II Aurora sets eyes on supersonic flights flight tests in late 2024 for rocket aircraft mk-ii aurora Since then, Dawn Aerospace has upgraded rocket-powered aircraft for a new series of tests. One important test included running its engine for 60 seconds and then restarting it to show it could safely abort and retry a flight if needed, a key preparation for the supersonic flights. So far, the next set of flight tests, happening from July to September, is expected to involve up to twelve flights. The main goal is to push the vehicle to fly faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1.1) and reach altitudes of 70,000 feet. The next target in line is to show that the vehicle can fly twice in one day, proving its ability to be quickly reused.

Analysts expect GE Aerospace's revenue to grow year-over-year despite some uncertainty in the airplane manufacturing market. Bank of America analysts said GE could be ""strongly positioned"" in the sector thanks to its variety of products and customers. GE Aerospace ( GE ) reports second-quarter earnings before markets open Tuesday, in what will be the aerospace parts maker's second earnings report since General Electric completed its split to three separate companies earlier this year. GE Aerospace is expected to report $8.5 billion in revenue, up from last year's $7.9 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. In its first quarter as a standalone company , GE Aerospace reported revenue of $8.1 billion, and raised its profit expectations for the full fiscal year, citing strong demand for its commercial and military airplane engines. GE Aerospace also said in its first-quarter report that it will begin offering more detailed breakdowns of its earnings starting in the second quarter, providing investors more insight into the performance of its two segments, ""Commercial Engines & Services"" and ""Defense & Propulsion Technologies."" GE Aerospace 'Strongly Positioned' To Benefit From Industry Growth Despite some uncertainty in the aerospace industry with Boeing ( BA ) experiencing safety issues and production slowdowns and Airbus ( AIR ) recently lowering its full-year guidance , Bank of America analysts wrote Wednesday that stocks of parts manufacturers like GE Aerospace are expected to weather the storm. ""We do not expect uncertainty to put significant downside risk on the commercial [ original equipment manufacturers ] in the quarter, as recent headlines have largely been priced into the stocks,"" the analysts wrote. Reiterating a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $180, the analysts wrote that GE could be ""strongly positioned"" to benefit from industry growth thanks to its ""unique portfolio,"" with revenue streams across aircraft manufacturers and aircraft types. The two other former divisions of General Electric, GE Vernova ( GEV ) and GE HealthCare ( GEHC ), are set to report their earnings on July 24 and July 31, respectively. GE Aerospace shares have gained close to 17% since the company completed its split from GE Vernova, at $159.13 as of Friday's close. Read the original article on Investopedia .

Login or signup to continue reading All articles from our website & app The digital version of Today's Paper Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia All other regional websites in your area Continue Young people from remote and regional communities across north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands will get hands-on experience with the aviation industry through Raising Horizons. The program, run by Indigenous aerospace consultancy Gunggandji Aerospace, is particularly focused on getting more First Nations girls into aviation, but is also open to boys. Gunggandji Aerospace founder and chief executive Daniel Joinbee said it's about showing the students what's possible in aviation. ""I want to change the narrative about what we're capable of doing,"" he told AAP. ""Get out into communities and talk to young kids about what are the opportunities and pathways into aviation and space, because it's not just being a pilot and it's not just being an astronaut."" Gunggandji Aerospace CEO Daniel Joinbee wants to show Indigenous kids what's possible in aviation. (HANDOUT/GUNGGANDJI AEROSPACE) Mr Joinbee is an air force veteran and Gunggandji man from the community of Yarrabah in far north Queensland. It was while consulting for Boeing that he realised there was a gap in the sector, prompting him to start the nation's only Indigenous-owned aerospace consultancy. The Raising Horizons program, which is set to begin in Townsville in January 2025, is a partnership between Gunggandji Aerospace, Rex Airlines and NRL Cowboys House, with funding from the federal government. The students will be connected with mentors throughout the program, something Mr Joinbee said is important to support them on their journey. ""One of the things that women in aviation already say is that there's a lack of mentors for emerging females in the industry to get behind them,"" he said. ""There will be males on the program as well and it's just as important for these young men to see that there are women in these leadership roles, because that's how we create holistic social change. ""It's not boys as fighter pilots and girls as crew attendants - everyone has a place in aviation and it is an exciting career that we can all actively participate in."" But Mr Joinbee said it's important to keep the young people engaged long after they've completed Raising Horizons. ""It's not just about the eight module program, and then we high-five the kids and say 'all the best, see you later',"" he said. ""There has to be follow-through, there has to be ongoing mentoring and there has to be a bigger sense of more."" Gunggandji Aerospace also facilitates ""non-traditional pathways"" into the aviation sector for young adults. Mr Joinbee said they're designed to help First Nations people who have not finished high school, have been incarcerated or are parents of young children to get into aviation and space industries. His vision is for aviation to be a viable career option for all First Nations people. ""I just want to see that aviation is seen as an accessible pathway for mob,"" he said.

The stock price rose 58% in the first six months of 2024, crushing what were solid gains by the S&P 500 (up 15%) and Nasdaq Composite index (up 19%) over the same period. Investors are apparently optimistic about this aerospace industry leader, judging by its stellar first-half share price performance. A potential downside is that the run-up in GE Aerospace stock has left it trading at a pricey valuation. Is it still a buy today? Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.39 %) $ -1.22 Current Price $ 310.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.05 - $ 312.72 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 2.7M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % The birth of GE Aerospace After struggling for years, General Electric's management enacted a drastic transformation in the company's makeup. In November 2021, the sprawling conglomerate, which built everything from light bulbs to jet engines to medical technology, announced it would spin off several of its businesses into two new publicly traded companies. GE Healthcare ( GEHC 0.10% ) was spun off in early 2023 and took with it GE's health-related business segments. In April 2024, GE's energy businesses were spun off as GE Verona ( GEV 0.64% ) . What was left under the GE stock ticker was renamed GE Aerospace. Now that these businesses have separated from each other, their management teams can better focus on their specific operations. And for investors, these maneuvers allow them to evaluate each business independently. A dominant player in the aircraft engine market GE Aerospace designs and manufactures jet and turboprop engines for commercial, military, and business aircraft. CFM International, its 50/50 joint venture with the French aerospace company Safran Aircraft Engine, manufactures the Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion (LEAP) engine, which is used in the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320, and Comac C919. CFM International is the leading player in the global aircraft engine market, with a 39% share as of 2020. On its own, GE Aerospace had a 16% market share , so combined, it had a hand in 55% of the total market. Although aerospace stocks tend to command premiums due to their long-term growth prospects, GE Aerospace now trades at more than 32 times its expected one-year forward earnings -- nearly twice the valuations of peers RTX and Lockheed Martin . GE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. Ongoing supply chain issues could weigh on GE Aerospace this year, resulting in fewer deliveries than expected. An analyst at JPMorgan Chase recently lowered second-quarter estimates for the aerospace manufacturer, while a Jefferies analyst covering GE Aerospace anticipates that LEAP engine deliveries will slide by 5% in 2024. The long-term outlook is bullish These potential headwinds and the stock's already-high valuation could weigh on its share price performance in the near term. However, investors have a good reason to be bullish on GE Aerospace for the long term. That's because its real bread-and-butter is its aftermarket business , where it maintains and repairs its engines. Because aircraft engines need regular servicing to ensure safety and optimal performance, GE Aerospace benefits from a steady demand for parts and services over their lifecycle. Image source: Getty Images. Another positive long-term trend for GE Aerospace is the growing demand for air travel. Precedence Research projects that the size of the aircraft engine market will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.9% through 2032. Rising passenger traffic will necessitate larger airline fleets, resulting in more demand for engines, parts, and overhauls -- demand that GE Aerospace stands ready to capitalize on. Is GE Aerospace still a buy today? GE Aerospace faces potential headwinds from fewer deliveries that could weigh on the business, potentially limiting the stock's near-term upside given its premium valuation. That said, the company is incredibly well positioned with its dominant position in the aircraft engine market, and it should be an excellent long-term performer. Its aftermarket business should provide steady cash flow -- analysts at UBS are modeling for compound annual growth of 13% over the next five years from GE Aerospace's aftermarket business.

His appointment comes after a distinguished career within the Labour Party, where he has held significant governmental and parliamentary roles, culminating in his recent tenure as shadow defense secretary. Healey, born on April 1, 1970, began his political journey as MP for Wentworth and Dearne, swiftly establishing a reputation for his astute grasp of defense and security issues. His early years in Parliament saw him serve as state minister for housing and planning, where he spearheaded initiatives aimed at tackling housing shortages and promoting sustainable urban development. Transitioning to the role of state minister for local government, Healey pushed reforms aimed at empowering local governance structures and enhancing community engagement. As shadow defense secretary, he played a crucial role in scrutinizing and advocating for Labour's defense policies. During his time in office, he focused on updating the UK's defense strategy, paying special attention to improving cybersecurity and reinforcing international defense partnerships. He prioritized readiness and efficient procurement strategies, in line with the party’s overall national security agenda. Advocacy, grassroots engagement Healey's tenure as shadow defense secretary was defined by his advocacy for increased defense spending and comprehensive capabilities, reflecting a pragmatic approach to safeguarding national interests in an interconnected world. His initiatives aimed to ensure the agility and resilience of the UK's armed forces against emerging threats like cyberwarfare and hybrid tactics. His foresight and acumen earned him respect across party lines, solidifying his leadership in defense policy circles. Beyond his parliamentary duties, Healey is recognized for his down-to-earth demeanor and commitment to grassroots engagement. A passionate cyclist, he frequently explores the picturesque landscapes of South Yorkshire, finding solace and inspiration amid the rigors of public service. His engagement with constituents and local communities underscores a grounded perspective and a steadfast belief in inclusive leadership principles. Future challenges As Healey assumes the defense secretary post, he inherits a dynamic geopolitical landscape fraught with challenges and opportunities. His predecessors have left a legacy of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the country's defense posture and responsiveness. Figures such as Sir Michael Fallon and Penny Mordaunt navigated periods of heightened international tensions, leaving a backdrop of strategic advancements and organizational modernization within the defense sector. Looking ahead, Healey's leadership will be pivotal in navigating the complexities of global security dynamics, from geopolitical rivalries to technological disruptions. His role will require skill in forging diplomatic engagements and leveraging defense partnerships to safeguard British interests on the global stage. The evolving nature of security threats demands a proactive approach to defense policy and strategy, one that Healey wants to deliver. His ascendancy as UK's defense secretary marks a critical juncture in Britain's defense policy landscape. His career trajectory from local governance to national defense strategy reflects a commitment to public service and an understanding of contemporary security challenges. As he steps into the pivotal role, Healey's leadership promises to shape the future trajectory of British defense policy, navigating complex geopolitical waters in the days ahead.
