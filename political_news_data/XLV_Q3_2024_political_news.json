Two-thirds of Americans say health care is not getting enough attention from both political parties in the presidential election, a new survey found. According to the survey , conducted by Gallup and nonprofit West Health, 67 percent of respondents overall say health care is not receiving enough attention. Only 6 percent say it’s getting too much attention and 27 percent say health care is receiving the right amount. Democrats and independents were more likely than Republican respondents to say health care is not receiving enough attention, though 53 percent of GOP voters say the candidates could focus on it more, the survey found. Seventy-one percent of respondents who tuned in to last month’s debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump said the candidates did not spend enough time talking about health care issues. Independent voters are weary of both candidates’ stances on health care, Gallup noted. Independents slightly favored Harris on health care issues, like improving access to care, improving quality of care and lowering costs of prescriptions, but Trump trailed closely behind on many issues, the survey found. According to the poll, 63 percent of Americans say a candidate’s position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the single most important health care-related issue in the election, or among the most important ones. A candidate’s position on lowering health care costs follows close behind with 57 percent support. Forty-three percent say a candidate’s policies related to mental health care access are among the most important health-related issues in the election. Older voters tend to favor a candidate’s position on Medicare and Social Security while younger voters prioritize mental health and lower costs, the survey found. It also found Democrats were more optimistic than their Republican and independent counterparts to say access to affordable health care will improve in the next five years, though no group was overwhelmingly optimistic that things will change. The survey was conducted Sept. 9-16 among 3,660 adults and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

    "article_text": "Report Solutions for America: Getting Health Care Reform Right August 17, 2010 5 min read Download Report Marion Smith Counselor to the President Marion Smith, through his research and writing at The Heritage Foundation, relates... Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close THE ISSUE: The health care system needs reform, but not the types of changes enacted under the new health care law. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act moves the health care system in the wrong direction. This highly unpopular law would assert federal control over health care benefits and financing, erect a complex one-size-fits-all health system, and centralize America’s health care decisions in Washington. Instead, Congress should transform the health care system into one that empowers individuals and families, not Washington, to control more of their health care decisions. THE FACTS: Health Care Spending. The U.S spends over $2.6 trillion on health care, roughly 17 percent of gross domestic product. More Government Control. Health care spending will increase by $311 billion between 2010 and 2019 under the new law. Soon, the government will control over half of all health care spending. Rising Crisis in Health Care Entitlements. The Medicare program alone faces a $30.8 trillion unfunded obligation with an onslaught of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Medicaid has become a growing fiscal problem for the states, accounting for over 21 percent of state spending —second only to education. No Two States Are Alike. State health insurance markets differ radically, reflecting differences in demography, levels of poverty, regulation, and underlying health care costs. Rates of uninsurance range from 25% in Texas to 5% in Massachusetts, while premiums for individual policies range from $2,606 in Iowa to $6,630 in New York. THE SOLUTIONS: Repeal Obamacare. There is a precedent for repealing highly unpopular and misguided laws: the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. History may be repeating itself. Recently, over 70% of Missouri residents rejected a key provision of Obamacare­—the requirement that individuals purchase a health insurance plan designed and approved by government bureaucrats. The rebellion at the state level, in fact, is both widespread and multi-dimensional. Some states will vote on similar repeal measures; in others, legislation has been introduced challenging various aspects of the law; still others have banded together to challenge the constitutionality of the individual mandate in lawsuits. The House of Representatives even voted recently to repeal one provision of Obamacare that will impose draconian paperwork requirements on millions of small businesses. The easiest way to address all these grievances: repeal Obamacare. Promote Personal Control Through Tax Equity. Today, workers who purchase coverage through their employer receive an unlimited tax break on the value of their health care benefits. However, those who purchase coverage on their own receive no comparable tax break. Ideally, the current tax exclusion should be replaced (or at the very least capped) with a system of universal tax credits for taxpayers. Concurrently, existing health care spending, such as Medicaid and SCHIP (the State Children’s Health Insurance Program) should be redirected to help low-income individuals and families purchase private health insurance. Putting Americans in charge of their health care dollars and decisions will go along way toward bringing about greater efficiency and cost reduction to the health care system. Fix Current Government Health Programs. To address the country’s looming entitlement crisis, Medicare and Medicaid must be transformed. Specifically, Medicare should be a defined-contribution system in which the government provides a contribution for benefits and seniors are able to apply their contribution to the health plan that suits them best. Medicaid should be restructured to mainstream healthy moms and kids into private health insurance through premium assistance while patient-centered models of care should be integrated into Medicaid to give the disabled, the elderly, and their families a say in the care and services they receive. Updating these programs would make the costs both more predictable and sustainable for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. Promote Federal–State Partnerships. A one-size-fits-all federal solution cannot accommodate the unique and diverse health care challenges facing the states. States should take the lead in health care reform by identifying the key health care challenges facing their citizens, structuring a consumer-based marketplace for health insurance, and expanding affordable health care options for their citizens, including setting up pooling arrangements to protect persons with pre-existing conditions while not unduly burdening taxpayers. Beyond reforming the tax treatment of health insurance and restructuring health care entitlements, the federal government should promote interstate commerce in health insurance, extend certain protections for those who maintain continuous coverage, and provide states with technical assistance and relief from federal rules that inhibit innovation. Provide Portability. Individuals—not the government—should be able to choose the health coverage that best suits their needs. To accomplish this, private health insurance must be portable—that is, owned by Americans so they can take their package from job to job. Portability, in turn, will require lawmakers to end the bias against individuals now in the tax code (see above) and for states to take the lead in guaranteeing that individuals can choose from among competing plans in transparent and lightly regulated marketplaces. ------------------ SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS: Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on the Uninsured Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on States Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Doctors Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Future Generations Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Seniors Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Businesses Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Taxpayers Repeal Obamacare - The Case Against Obamacare: A Health Care Policy Series for the 112th Congress Personal Control - Health Care Tax Credits: Designing An Alternative to Employer Based Coverage Personal Control - Health Care Tax Credits: Best Way to Advance Affordability, Choice & Coverage Fix Current Gov.

    "article_text": "Jim Cramer on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN): ‘Leerink Analysts Downgraded Regeneron To A Market Perform Hold After A Negative Eylea 2mg Biosimilar Preliminary Injunction Ruling’ Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc September 28, 2024 8 min read REGN We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it’s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well. In the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn’t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing. \"At first, I didn’t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half— a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you’ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.\" Jim Cramer's 1st Investment Lesson: Know What You Own Jim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses. During his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: \" Know what you own .\" Story Continues \"During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That’s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.\" From Childhood Curiosity to Financial Empire: The Rise of Jim Cramer Jim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him. The business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like \"open,\" \"range,\" and \"close\" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market. His dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn’t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn’t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked. The Stock Game Not long after, Jim introduced this \"stock game\" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing. \"Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this \"stock game\" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That’s how I fell in love with the stock market.\" Jim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.

    "article_text": "Manitoba Health-care support workers 'not feeling the love' from province as strike looms Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said Thursday nobody loves health-care aides more than he does, but as thousands of them prepare to walk off the job in early October, they say they’re not feeling the love back from the provincial government. Strike by 25,000 support workers could begin Oct. 8 Gavin Axelrod · CBC News · Posted: Sep 26, 2024 8:47 PM EDT | Last Updated: September 27, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 5 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew speaks during a health-care staffing update Thursday. (CBC Manitoba ) Social Sharing Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said Thursday nobody loves health-care aides more than he does, but as thousands of them prepare to walk off the job in early October, they say they're not feeling the love back from the provincial government. \"That was a real slap in the face, a real slap in the face,\" said Tracey Drexler, an operating room assistant at the Victoria Hospital. Kinew's comments came during a press conference where the province said it had staffed 873 net new positions — 290 of which are health-care aides — as the provincial government nears its target of hiring 1,000 new health-care workers throughout the year. In the backdrop of that announcement, 25,000 health-care support workers represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union are poised to strike Oct. 8, unless the government dishes out an acceptable contract offer before then. Kinew said Thursday he hopes the current offer is accepted. \"This deal is 2½ times more than the last deal that health-care has got,\" Kinew said during the press conference. \"There's more money on the table. More health-care aides working in the system and more help is coming.\" When asked how the premier arrived at that figure, a spokesperson for Shared Health told CBC they couldn't speak to the specific details of the offer, other than to say \"its total value is 2.5 times that of the last collective agreement.\" Strike by 25,000 Manitoba health-care support workers could begin Oct. 8 as unions serve notice Kinew also said Manitoba's NDP government has \"taken steps to make life more affordable\" and said health-care aides will save \"at least\" $10 a week because of the gas tax holiday, which was extended until the end of the year Wednesday. With the provincial gas tax set at 14 cents per litre, in order to save $10, a driver would have to purchase 71.4 litres of gas per week. But Drexler said some of her colleagues can't even afford cars. \"We just want a living wage,\" said Drexler, who has worked in the sector for over two decades, spending the last two years at the Victoria Hospital. \"When I started this job, I could live comfortably. Now with a second job, I am barely putting food on the table.\" CUPE health-care co-ordinator Shannon McAteer said the strike mandate \"speaks volumes,\" because some workers who make $17 an hour are \"willing to put it on the line.\" \"They're willing to go on strike to get what they deserve, get the respect, get the recognition, get the wages and working conditions that they desperately deserve,\" she said. Some support staff looking for new jobs In a news release Thursday, CUPE said it surveyed more than 5,000 health-care support workers as part of a bargaining survey done in March. The survey said nearly 50 per cent of health care support workers have been, or plan to, look for a new job, according to responses from workers in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Shared Health, Southern Health-Santé Sud and the Northern Regional Health Authority. The report also said around 65 per cent of respondents looking for a new job were looking outside the public health care system entirely. The report also found only 28 per cent of health-care aides reported staffing levels were sufficient to provide proper care to patients, residents or clients. Additionally, around 75 per cent of workers surveyed reported working short-staffed once or more a week. \"They're not feeling the love,\" McAteer said. \"I think that's the way of saying it.\" Kathleen Cook, the health critic for the Opposition Manitoba Progressive Conservatives, also said retention is a \"critical part of what the NDP needs to focus on.\" CUPE recommends new deal for health-care workers, faces criticism after MGEU workers rejected similar deal MGEU health-care workers vote to reject new collective agreement McAteer said she remains hopeful a deal can be reached, but isn't feeling optimistic about that happening before Oct. 8. \"Health care used to be an employer of choice and now they are not,\" she said. \"People are looking to get out of health care, so announcing today that they're so happy or pleased or they think they've done amazing to fix the crisis and health care, that's what doesn't give me a lot of optimism because we just don't see it.\" Meanwhile, Drexler said walking off the job isn't something support workers take lightly. \"We all know that it's going to be the patients that are going to suffer and the caregivers that are going to suffer and the people who depend on home care to live their lives and go to work that aren't going to have that home care coming to help them out of bed in the morning,\" she said. \"And it weighs heavy on us, this is not something that we do easily.\" With files from Ian Froese CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices · About CBC News Corrections and clarifications · Submit a news tip · Report error Related Stories Striking North York health-care workers dispute employer’s use of government funding 98% of AUPE nursing care staff vote in favour of strike Toronto community, seniors housing workers vote to strike, citing understaffing, workplace violence Ontario college support workers reach tentative deal after more than a month on strike Part-time support staff at Ontario's colleges vote in favour of strike action if necessary"

Chris and Vicky will further deepen our bench of expertise.\" Mr. Bayliss has nearly a decade of investing experience, most recently as Vice President at SoftBank Investment Advisers, the manager of the SoftBank Vision Fund, where he successfully executed numerous key healthcare transactions and supported portfolio companies. Prior to SoftBank, he was an Analyst for Marcato Capital Management, a hedge fund focused on long term concentrated investments. He graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Economics. Previously, Ms. Valverde served as an Associate on the healthcare team at New Enterprise Associates (NEA) where she performed diligence for new investments and offered operational and strategic guidance that enhanced the growth trajectory of several portfolio companies. She also has experience working as an Investment Banking Analyst on the healthcare team at Goldman Sachs.

    "article_text": "A new study by Overnight Glasses reveals that many Americans are struggling to afford healthcare due to rising costs and limited access. Alaska, New York, and New Jersey were ranked as the most expensive states for healthcare services. Pexels A new study by Overnight Glasses ranks Alaska as the most expensive state for healthcare in the United States. The study found average health insurance costs in Alaska to be $948 per month, where MRI expenses reach a staggering $656. The analysis examined key healthcare costs across all 50 states to identify the regions where residents face the highest financial burden. Healthcare Costs Across The United States The study evaluated healthcare costs based on several factors, including: Health insurance premiums MRI expenses CT scan expenses Emergency room expenses Vision exam expenses Dental exam expenses These metrics were combined to create a composite score on a 100-point scale. A higher score indicates higher healthcare costs in a state. Alaska's healthcare system remains one of the most expensive in the United States despite its relatively small population of 733,536. Writer's pick California Bans All Plastic Bags; Sues ExxonMobil For 'Lying About Recylcing Being A Viable Solution For Plastic Waste' The state earned a top composite score of 82.97 in the study, solidifying its position as the costliest state for healthcare services. In addition to high costs for health insurance and MRIs, Alaska also reports steep expenses for CT scans ($499.25) and emergency room visits ($2,265 on average). New York And New Jersey: High-Cost Healthcare States New York closely follows Alaska in second place with a composite score of 74.43. The state has the second-highest healthcare spending per capita at $14,007 and ranks third in MRI costs at $599. Additionally, high costs for vision exams ($112) and dental exams ($209) contribute to its overall ranking as a high-cost state for healthcare. New Jersey ranks third with a composite score of 64.57. The state is known for having the highest emergency room costs in the United States, with an average cost of $3,377 per visit. Coupled with expensive diagnostic procedures like MRIs and CT scans, New Jersey residents face some of the most substantial financial challenges in healthcare. Additional States with High Healthcare Costs Completing the top five most expensive states are: Vermont (composite score: 58.77) California (composite score: 56.99) Massachusetts (composite score: 55.55) Vermont faces high health insurance premiums ($908) and spending per capita ($12,756). Despite its large population, California struggles with significant emergency room costs ($3,238). Massachusetts also has high healthcare spending per capita ($13,319) and an average health insurance cost of $639. Washington: Highest Healthcare Spending Per Capita Washington ranks 9th overall, but it stands out with the highest healthcare spending per capita, at $14,381. Although its costs for health insurance and vision exams may be lower than those of some other states, Washington's overall expenditures place it firmly among the most expensive regions for healthcare. Delaware rounds out the list in 10th place, with healthcare spending per capita of $12,899 and emergency room costs of $1,746. The Importance of Proactive Healthcare Strategies A spokesperson from Overnight Glasses commented on the study findings, emphasising the importance of proactive healthcare strategies. \"For individuals navigating these costs, being proactive—like exploring insurance options, utilising preventive care, and comparing healthcare providers—can make a big difference.\" \"As states continue to grapple with these expenses, there's a clear need for innovative solutions that prioritise both access and cost-effectiveness to ease the financial burden on residents,\" the spokesperson added. This comprehensive study highlights residents' significant financial challenges in states with high healthcare costs. The data reveals that healthcare expenses continue to rise, placing a substantial burden on individuals and families. For a detailed analysis, including weightings and data sources, please refer to the complete report available from Overnight Glasses. The Paradox Of US Healthcare Spending Despite the US leading in healthcare spending, many Americans still struggle to afford necessary medical care, highlighting a critical gap in the system. It is worth noting that Americans spend more money on healthcare on a per capita basis compared to people in any other developed nation. However, a new study by Gallup and West Health reveals that nearly half of Americans have not been able to pay for medical treatment or prescription drugs in recent times. Approximately 45 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup and West Health reported recently skipping medical treatment or medications due to cost or lack of accessibility. Writer's pick Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Health Network To Pay $65M After Hackers Post Nude Photos Of Cancer Patients Online Among this group, roughly eight percent indicated that they would be unable to afford necessary care if they needed it today. Gallup and West Health refer to this population segment as \"cost desperate.\" According to the study, although 55 percent of Americans are considered \"cost secure,\" meaning they can afford necessary medical care and medications, this percentage has decreased from 61 percent in 2022. This decline is consistent with comments made by then-US president Donald Trump in 2017, who suggested that healthcare in other countries is superior to the US system. The Burden of Rising Insurance Deductibles According to the Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF ), the average family insurance deductible in the United States has increased significantly, rising from $2,500 in 2013 to approximately $3,800 in 2022. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies insurance plans with deductibles of $3,200 or more as high-deductible plans. Even Americans with health insurance are facing challenges in affording and accessing care. Many individuals complain that their insurers are creating barriers to treatment through practices such as prior authorisation denials and claim denials. As an example, on Monday, demonstrators gathered outside UnitedHealthcare headquarters to protest the company's alleged refusal to approve care through these methods. \"Health insurance coverage has expanded in America, but we are finding it is private health insurance corporations themselves that are often the largest barrier for people to receive the care they and their doctor agree they need,\" Aija Nemer-Aanerud, campaign director with the People's Action Institute, told CBS Minnesota . A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare informed CBS Minnesota that the company has resolved the issues raised by the recent protests.

More than 25,000 health support workers could walk off the job Oct. 8, affecting the lives of thousands of hospital patients, personal-care home residents and people who rely on home-care services. The employees, who are represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 204 and the Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union, include health-care aides, laundry workers, dietary aides, ward clerks, recreation co-ordinators and other support staff. The unions are negotiating with Shared Health, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Prairie Mountain Health, the Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health. MALAK ABAS / FREE PRESS Shannon McAteer, health care co-ordinator for CUPE Manitoba, speaks at a news conference announcing a potential strike date alongside Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union president Kyle Ross on Tuesday. If an agreement isn’t reached before Oct. 8, thousands of staff in Winnipeg, Brandon, Selkirk, Dauphin, Winkler, Steinbach and Portage will hit the picket lines. “Workers can find jobs at Tim’s, McDonald’s or the deli counter at Co-Op for far more money and work that is physically and mentally less demanding,” MGEU president Kyle Ross said at a news conference Tuesday morning. Ross said support staff are looking to “close the ever-widening pay gap” between them and other health-care providers who’ve received pay raises in recent collective bargaining agreements. MGEU said the starting wage for health-care support workers in Manitoba, $17.07 per hour, is the lowest in the country. They are considered essential workers, meaning Manitoba law requires them to provide necessary health services. What will change if a strike occurs are non-essential aspects of support and care. That could mean fewer baths and reduced food services, among other effects. Angela Bouchard, the lead negotiator for MGEU’s support services staff, said the two unions have agreements with the employers as to which parts of the job are essential. “Some classifications will be reduced. Home care — we have about a 30 per cent reduction across the board, health-care aides — we might see a five to 10 per cent reduction, clerical staff — anywhere from 25 to 50 per cent reduction,” she said. Health-care workers represented by MGEU rejected a contract offer last month. The rejected deal included a one per cent wage increase retroactive to April 1 and an 11.25 per cent wage hike spread over the four years of the contract. Workers represented by CUPE also rejected their offer and voted to strike after the union recommended workers accept the offer. Shannon McAteer, CUPE’s health-care co-ordinator, said she didn’t regret endorsing the previous offer. “It was a fair and reasonable deal, but we heard loud and clear that the members want better working conditions, they want better wages, they want to be respected by their employer and the government,” she said. MALAK ABAS / FREE PRESS Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union president Kyle Ross announces a potential strike date during a news conference Tuesday. Since that deal was rejected, Ross said both MGEU and CUPE responded to the employer with an offer on Sept. 5 but have not heard back since. McAteer did not say what terms either union has put forward now, saying they were not going to “bargain in the media,” but said monetary gains are part of the counter-offer. In July, nurses avoided a strike after several rounds of bargaining. At the time, the Manitoba Nurses Union was told by Shared Health a mandate meant they could not offer additional monetary benefits.

When asked if there was concern health-care support workers would be told the same, Ross said both MGEU and CUPE were willing to work with the province. “Let’s be clear, they haven’t offered us what they’ve offered the nurses. The nurses have been offered more,” he said. A Shared Health spokesperson said additional bargaining dates are being scheduled now. “While we remain hopeful that an agreement will be reached and a strike’s impact to health services avoided, essential-service agreements are being finalized and we are preparing for all contingencies in order to maintain essential health services for Manitobans,” he said in an email. malak.abas@freepress.mb.ca Malak Abas Reporter Malak Abas is a city reporter at the Free Press .

THEIR NEWEST REPORT SHOWS NEW MEXICO IS BELOW THE NATIONAL BENCHMARK ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE ROLES. SOME OF THE DATA EXPLAINS THE ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 39% OF THE STATE’S DOCTORS ARE OVER 60 YEARS OLD, EXPECTED TO RETIRE BY 2030. IT ALSO INCLUDES TEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE WORKER SHORTAGE. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED A HEALTH CARE PERMANENT FUND AND WHAT THEY COULD DO IS TAKE ABOUT $2 BILLION OF ONE TIME MONIES THAT WE’RE GETTING FROM OIL AND GAS AND PUTTING THAT IN A FUND AND TAKING THE INCOME FROM THE FUND TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS. ANOTHER SOLUTION, NEW MEXICO JOINING INTERSTATE COMPACTS, SOMETHING NATHAN SAYS WOULD COST NEW MEXICANS NOTHING. THIS IS A COMPACT IS AN AGREEMENT IN THIS CASE BETWEEN STATES THAT SAYS YOUR DOCTORS CAN PRACTICE IN OUR STATE AND OUR DOCTORS CAN PRACTICE IN YOUR STATE. NEW MEXICO HAS JOINED ONE OF THESE AGREEMENTS FOR NURSES, AND IS ONE OF FIVE STATES THAT HAVE JOINED TWO OR LESS SUCH AGREEMENTS. NATHAN SAYS IT’S REALLY ABOUT THE FAMILIES LOOKING FOR CARE.

The flag-off ceremony included officials from SQUARE Pharmaceuticals Kenya and Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) Director Dr. Iruki Kailemia. The shipment consisted of 5,500 boxes of Angilock tablets, a medication for high blood pressure that combines two ingredients to help control blood pressure levels. Somalia will be the initial destination. \"This achievement reflects our dedication to providing high-quality healthcare solutions,\" Kailemia said, noting plans to supply other African and European countries from the plant. The firm has operated in Kenya since 2004, with its manufacturing facility opening in 2023. Kailemia said the export will boost confidence in Kenyan-made pharmaceuticals among local healthcare professionals. 'This export demonstrates that local pharmaceuticals can meet international standards,\" he added. The company employs 250 local workers and plans to increase the number to 1,000 as operations grow, with plans for a line of liquid medications and injections.

Meredith Rosenthal, the C. Boyden Gray Professor of Health Economics and Policy, offered her thoughts on the challenges related to health care affordability and opportunities for action in the short- and long-term. Q. Why is health care affordability such a pressing public health issue? A. Affordability is a widespread problem even as fewer Americans go without health insurance. The amount people spend directly on health care (not including insurance premiums), known as “out-of-pocket” costs, has been growing faster than inflation and this has several important implications. Surveys consistently show that people delay or forgo care due to cost, worry about their ability to pay for health care bills, and incur medical debt. Health care affordability—or a lack thereof—can harm individual health. Affordability impacts whether people can get the care they need, like insulin to manage their diabetes or following up on a mammogram. If those are too costly, people will delay or skip care, which has significant impacts down the line on both health outcomes and cost. As health care expenses continue to go up, household budgets have to adjust—which means people can’t afford the same kind of groceries or housing they’re used to. That is a public health problem, which has particularly burdensome effects on lower-income, high-need families. Finally, rising costs create an increased risk that people will face catastrophic health care situations that have massive financial implications, with consequences ranging from mortgaging their homes to personal bankruptcy. That also has a direct consequence on people’s well-being. Meredith Rosenthal Q. What are the biggest challenges facing the next administration on health care affordability? A. The biggest challenge is simple: The forces that make health care increasingly unaffordable are complicated. The biggest threat we’ve found is consolidation in medicine. For example, there is a growing trend of hospitals and other corporate entities buying up physician practices and then negotiating as a unit with health insurance companies, driving up prices significantly. To address the root causes, we have to recognize where medical monopolies are forming and try to prevent them from passing on inflated prices to consumers. Q. What are your top policy recommendations to address health care affordability? A. There are two kinds of solutions to improve affordability: the band-aids and the systemic shifts. The band-aids are short-term solutions that can improve affordability for folks in need now, including providing government subsidies to help consumers afford their copays. This assistance would alleviate the immediate price shock for patients and make care more accessible, which is a good thing. However, there is a downside—with the government on the hook for the bill, health care conglomerates are incentivized to raise prices even further. The short-term benefit can create long-term challenges. Another band-aid option is to cap the prices that, for example, hospitals can charge. This could get closer to the heart of the issue but brings its own serious risk; providers could opt out of the market for certain services, which could create shortages. Nailing that balance is a real challenge. Then there are efforts to address the underlying forces that drive price increases—chief among them antitrust enforcement to address the vertical integration currently occurring in health care, which is when independent physicians, hospitals, and physician groups merge to create a health care network. The combined powers of large consolidated health systems and other types of health care corporations mean that some entities can set health care prices with little oversight or pushback. The federal government has antitrust laws in place to address these sorts of monopolies, but it has traditionally been reluctant to challenge health care mergers, especially when those mergers involve vertical integration or other types of consolidation. Enforcing these antitrust laws is a very complicated task that requires coordination between the federal government and state attorneys general, as well as significant political will to stand up to the influence of health systems that have real sway in their communities. Given the challenges and drawbacks of band-aid solutions and systemic shifts, the ideal policy recommendations would strike a balance of short- and long-term solutions. Instituting present-day policies that save consumers money while building to break up the vertical monopolies dominating health care is the best-case scenario to create real and long-lasting relief for consumers. Q. What’s the evidence supporting those recommendations? A. My Harvard Chan School colleague Anna Sinaiko and I have found that vertical integration is increasing —and driving price increases. We’ve also found that vertical integration of primary care physicians and large health systems does drive an increase in per-patient spending —but has no impact on readmission rates, meaning the promise of “integrated” care remains elusive and the extra spending associated with integration is not necessarily making patients healthier. The cost increases alone are important for public health, which we know because there is a strong body of research indicating the importance of health care affordability to people’s physical and mental well-being. For example, Katherine Baicker, a former Harvard Chan School economist now at the University of Chicago, led several papers studying the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon following passage of the Affordable Care Act. The studies found self-reported physical health benefits , increased rates of diabetes detection and management , and better follow-through on preventive care. Beyond the physical benefits, the peace of mind offered by health coverage was noticeable. Newly enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries demonstrated lower rates of depression, thanks in part to reduced financial strain. By making care more affordable and accessible, we can significantly improve health. Q. What do you hope could be accomplished to make health care more affordable in the next four years? A. Policymakers need to consider both short-term fixes to help people most affected by high health care prices and longer-term policies that get at the root causes of declining affordability. Some “band-aids” could be readily implemented—including extending increased health insurance subsidies that were put into place during the public health emergency [of the COVID pandemic] to help people afford their coverage. We could also pursue targeted policies, such as expanding limits on out-of-pocket costs for critical medicines—for example, medicines that control asthma and cardiovascular disease—similar to the recent policies enacted to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin. These high-value treatments that keep people of out hospitals could be partially paid for by savings on health care expenditures and yield better outcomes. On the antitrust enforcement side, hope for action in the immediate future is mixed at best. Efforts to regulate health care prices at the federal and state level may have some role to play going forward, although such efforts face substantial political headwinds. For example, federal law permitted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate prices with manufacturers for a small number of drugs. Manufacturers sued the government but the price negotiations proceeded, with the results announced earlier this year. The federal government should try to learn from its first foray into price negotiation in Medicare and look for ways to continue to leverage its buying power to keep some of the highest cost drugs accessible and affordable—but those benefits only relate to Medicare. Whether and how Medicare’s new price limits can affect privately insured patients remains unclear. I hope that the next administration will make progress in this area, but true change will likely take longer than four years.

[Courtesy] The private sector plays a crucial role in Kenya's healthcare market, contributing to nearly 50 per cent of healthcare services, a report has revealed. Dubbed 'The State of Kenya's Health Market 2024', the report identifies several challenges within Kenya's healthcare market, including fragmented coordination between public and private healthcare providers, limited data sharing, financial constraints and supply chain issues. The report launched on Thursday indicates that despite improvements in healthcare service delivery, Kenya's healthcare system remains heavily reliant on donor funding, with counties financially dependent on national health financing. Based on an assessment across six key counties, the report highlights the challenges and opportunities that could reshape the country's healthcare system while offering critical insights into Kenya's evolving healthcare market and outlining strategies to improve access to high-quality healthcare services. Speaking at the launch on behalf of Health CS, Dr Martin Sirengo said the research is essential for both national and county governments, and it highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in reshaping our healthcare system. Sirengo emphasised the importance of addressing these challenges, particularly in maternal healthcare. . Keep Reading Kenya's healthcare inequality persists as self-care, local production gain momentum 35 private hospitals closed over SHA fraud No cash, no services: Private hospitals declare \"With all these interventions, why has the maternal mortality ratio not come down? We need to find answers to this problem,\" he remarked. Dr Sirengo said the time has come for the public and private sector to establish strategic partnerships and sustainably deliver UHC. He said with the government, private sector and development partners united in this vision, Kenya is poised to make significant strides in transforming its healthcare landscape and ensuring the well-being of all its citizens. Sirengo's sentiments were echoed by Dr Lyndon Marani, Technical Advisor for the USAID PSE Program who highlighted the importance of a robust legal and regulatory framework in driving the transformation of Kenya's health sector. He noted that the Kenya partnership and coordination framework offers a mechanism for managing the entire healthcare market. Dr Marani, however, acknowledged the need for county-level engagement documents to address implementation challenges. Marani also pointed to the Digital Healthcare Superhighway initiative, which aims to develop a digital ecosystem that will provide greater data availability, enabling decision-makers to better understand and strengthen the health market. \"Kenya's health market is vast, covering a wide range of services and products. These counties were selected to help identify key opportunities for improving market efficiency and patient outcomes,\" Marani said, referring to Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Homa Bay. Sylvia Wamuhu Chief of Party for the USAID PSE Program said there is a need for collaboration with the Ministry of Health to enhance the quality of services offered by private healthcare facilities. \"We are supporting private health facilities to enhance the competitive services they offer , ensuring that the quality of services provided meets the standards recommended by the Government of Kenya,\" Wamuhu said. She said one of the program's key goals is to increase the visibility of locally produced health products. \"As Kenyans, we need to change the perception that locally manufactured goods do not meet quality standards, they do,\" she stated. In her remarks, Dr Margaret Njenga, CEO of Population Services Kenya, highlighted the critical role of the not-for-profit sector in Kenya's healthcare market, working alongside public and private sectors to provide high-quality, affordable healthcare. \"We are bringing in the government, development partners, and the private sector so that patients can get high-quality services that are affordable,\" she said. She pointed out the financial constraints affecting healthcare facilities, despite Kenya's progress. \"As much as we have made progress as a country, we are yet to reach the recommended Abuja Declaration of 15 per cent health financing. Right now, we are at 11 per cent, and much more needs to be done,\" said Njenga.

While a key Senate committee scrutinized patient care ramifications from the Steward Health Care bankruptcy and California passed the first attorney general review of health care acquisitions, the FTC's muscular opposition to health care roll-ups and noncompetition covenants continues to reverberate. On Sept. 12, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing titled \" Examining the Bankruptcy of Steward Health Care: How Management Decisions Have Impacted Patient Care .\" The hearing focused on the consequences of the mismanagement of Steward Health Care and impacts on surrounding communities. Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) labeled the U.S. health care system as broken, prioritizing corporate profits over patient care. He blamed the role of private equity, particularly Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre deploying financial strategies that left hospitals deeply in debt and forced to close while he and his partners profited significantly. Chairman Sanders described private equity as driving up health care costs and diminishing care quality and demanded both accountability and reform. Ranking Member Bill Cassidy (R-LA) shared concerns about the level of patient care and mismanagement of hospitals by Steward Health Care. Chair Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy critiqued de la Torre's absence and indicated they are considering holding the CEO in criminal contempt for violating the congressional subpoena. At the same time, states are increasingly placing the corporate consolidation of medicine under a microscope. Indeed, officials in 10 other states have adopted rules or passed laws requiring closer scrutiny of health care markets. Earlier this month, the California state legislature passed a bill to require attorney general review for all health care acquisitions by private-equity firms and hedge funds. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Texas in Ryan vs. Federal Trade Commission set aside the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) controversial noncompete rule last month ruling that it would not become effective on Sept. 4 as previously scheduled and cannot be enforced by the FTC (see Brownstein's prior alert on the case here ). The case narrowly averted, for the time being, the FTC's noncompete rule banning all noncompete agreements for workers both proactively and retroactively, except under certain narrow circumstances, including an exception for a noncompete agreement entered into in the context of a sale of a business. However, numerous state legislatures have already taken up the charge of severely limiting or outright banning noncompetition covenants, with outright bans in California, Minnesota, North Dakota and Oklahoma and many other states including Colorado banning noncompetes with limited exceptions, such as high earners or key employees. While some state legislatures around the country have included carve-outs from their noncompete bans for high earners and for protection of legitimate intellectual property interests, particularly when developed by the departing employee, as well as noncompetes restricting a seller in connection with the sale of a business, the FTC did not permit these carve-outs from its noncompete ban. Without these tools, businesses would need to identify other approaches to secure intellectual property from unfair competition and protect the goodwill that they acquire upon the acquisition of another business. The FTC's aggressive opposition to noncompetes followed its lawsuit against U.S. Anesthesia Partners, Inc. (USAP) and its private equity sponsor, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, asserting they crafted a \"multi-year anticompetitive scheme\" to consolidate anesthesiology practices in Texas by \"rolling up\" and monopolizing the market for anesthesiology in Texas. In so doing, FTC Chair Lina Khan staked out a strong position on roll-up strategies, alleging that Welsh Carson created USAP in 2012 to acquire large anesthesia practices as part of a plan to increase prices and drive profits. The complaint further alleged that the private equity sponsor and USAP entered into price-setting agreements with independent anesthesiology practices and allocated markets under an agreement with a significant competitor. While the court later granted private equity firm Welsh Carson's motion to dismiss it from the lawsuit, the case is still pending against USAP. For its part, private equity argues that it plays a critical role in supporting quality, affordable health care in the United States. According to the American Investment Council, private equity has invested nearly $1 trillion into U.S. health care since 2006, representing nearly 12.7% of all health care investments during this period, helping fund innovations, deliver more effective treatments and increase access to care for millions of Americans and, in some cases, significantly decreasing patient mortality. While the FTC may yet appeal the Texas court's ruling on its noncompete ban, it has maintained its aggressive stance against health care mergers generally and private equity-backed rollups specifically. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care has created a rare moment of bipartisanship, with both the left and the right scrutinizing patient care and mismanagement. Dealmakers should proceed with caution in navigating a challenging regulatory environment for competition and consolidation issues.

    "article_text": "The overall performance of the US health care system ranked last compared with nine other high-income countries in a new report. John Minchillo/AP/File CNN — The US spends more on health care than any other high-income country, but a new report suggests that “Americans are sicker, die younger and struggle to afford essential health care.” Compared with nine other high-income nations, the United States ranked last overall this year, with a lower life expectancy and higher rates of death and disease despite spending the most on health care, according to the report , released Thursday by the independent research group The Commonwealth Fund. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - JANUARY 31: Respiratory Therapist Nirali Patel works with a COVID-19 patient in the ICU at Rush University Medial Center on January 31, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. Respiratory therapists work with physicians and nurses to help patients restore and maintain normal lung capacity and blood/oxygen levels. After two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an estimated 1,000,000 American deaths. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article US spends most on health care but has worst health outcomes among high-income countries, new report finds The three top-performing countries in the report were Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. “This report reveals that our health system is continuing to lag far behind other nations when it comes to meeting our citizens’ basic health care needs. The US spends more on health care than any other country, and Americans are sicker, die younger and struggle to afford essential health care. We spend the most and get the least for our investment,” Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said in a news briefing. “As a primary care doctor, I see the human toll of these shortcomings in our system on a daily basis. I have patients who need medications they can’t afford. I spend time going back and forth with insurance companies who have denied care I know my patients need, and I see older patients who arrive sicker than they should because they’ve spent the majority of their lives uninsured,” Betancourt added. “This report underscores the many lessons we could learn from others on how to strengthen our health care delivery and outcomes,” he said. “It provides a blueprint for health leaders and policymakers on how the US can achieve more equitable, affordable care for all Americans.” Countries with highest health care rankings Researchers at The Commonwealth Fund compared and analyzed the performance of health systems across 10 countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The researchers took a close look at how the health systems performed on 70 measures across five key domains in those countries: access to care, the health care process, administrative efficiency, equity and health outcomes. The assessments were based on data from the World Health Organization, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Our World in Data and international surveys that the Commonwealth Fund conducts. The countries with the highest overall rankings across the five key areas were: 1. Australia 2. The Netherlands 3. The United Kingdom 4. New Zealand 5. France The countries that had the lowest overall rankings across the five key areas were: 6. Sweden 7. Canada 8. Switzerland 9. Germany 10. The United States When the researchers analyzed each country by each key domain, the United States ranked last on access to care, indicating that Americans face the most barriers to accessing and affording health care. The nation also ranked last in health outcomes, including acute illnesses, chronic diseases and death. The researchers noted that people in the United States live the shortest lives and face the most avoidable deaths among the 10 countries, and the US had the highest rates of excess deaths related to the Covid-19 pandemic for people younger than 75, according to the report. The United States ranked ninth in equity, indicating that disparities persist in how people with various incomes and from different backgrounds may access and experience health care. The country also ranked ninth in administrative efficiency, indicating that doctors and patients in the US are more likely to report problems related to insurance approvals and billing. Jae C. Hong/AP/FILE Related article New poll shows jump in adults who rate the quality of US health care as ‘poor’ “Administrative requirements can cost time and money for patients and doctors,” Reginald Williams II, vice president of international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund, said in the briefing. “Many countries have simplified their health insurance and payment systems, usually through legislation, regulation and standardization. For example, other countries apply standardized payments to all physicians for services, and do that on a regional basis, so that doctors know what they’ll be paid, and patients know what portion they’ll be responsible for,” he said. “They make it much simpler.” The one domain for which the United States ranked high was the care process, which suggests that the health care it delivers includes aspects or attributes that are considered essential for high-quality care. The researchers noted that “all countries have something to learn from one another.” Yet there were relatively small differences in the overall performance among all of the countries except the United States, which was “the only clear outlier.” The other nine countries may have different health care systems, but they all had universal coverage, the researchers wrote, which ensures that any copayments for health services are small, improving both access and affordability. “A lot of the lagging performance of the United States’ health care system has to do with access to care and equity of care, both of which are heavily influenced by the availability and quality of insurance,” Dr. David Blumenthal, former president of The Commonwealth Fund, said in the briefing. “The United States lags both in having 20-plus million Americans still uninsured – 7% to 8% of the population – though an historic low, still very high by international standards,” he said. “It also lacks in terms of the ability of lower-income people to get access to basic services.” Portrait of a doctor listening to an elderly woman patient's heartbeat andreswd/E+/Getty Images Related article Older Americans worry they can’t afford their own health care Additionally, the researchers found that health care spending was similar in the other countries but not in the US, which spends far more on health care than its peers yet has the worst overall performance. The two countries with the highest overall rankings, Australia and the Netherlands, had the lowest health care spending To improve the state of its health care, the US can expand insurance coverage, shrink disparities in care, and reduce the administrative burden and complexities of insurance plans, the researchers wrote. It’s also important for the United States to “invest in interventions outside of health care to address the social drivers of health: poverty, homelessness, hunger, discrimination, gun violence, substance use,” Williams said. The report also called for a more robust primary care system in the United States. For instance, “primary care physicians in the Netherlands are required to have coverage after hours. As a person in the Netherlands, you always can get access to your primary care physician or a covering physician, 24/7, and that, of course, is not true in the United States,” Blumenthal said. “Americans are most likely to report difficulties getting after-hours care, resulting in their having to use emergency rooms for after-hours care,” he said. “That’s a very simple intervention that would reduce the cost of care, reduce the access problems and reduce the administrative complexity of care.” ‘The American electorate makes the choices’ The upcoming US presidential election could play a significant role in the future of the nation’s health care system, Blumenthal said. “The American electorate makes choices about which direction to move in, and that is very much an issue in this election,” he said. “If we are continuing to lay the foundation for improvement of our health care system, elections that result in expansions of insurance coverage, based on the existing programs, would take us in the direction that makes us closer in performance to other international comparisons.” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

The rankings in the new report parallel those in a paper that The Commonwealth Fund released last year that found the US had the highest rates of deaths from avoidable or treatable causes and the highest maternal and infant death rates yet still spends more on health care than any other high-income country. “We’re not getting the best value for our health care dollar,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in either report, said last year. To help fix the holes in the US health care system, Benjamin said, there are three steps the nation can take. “We’re still the only nation that does not have universal health care or access for all of our citizens,” Benjamin said. Second, “we don’t do as much primary care prevention as the other nations, and we still have a public health system, which is fractured,” he said. “The third thing is, we under-invest compared to other industrialized nations in societal things. They spend their money on providing upfront support for their citizens. We spend our money on sick care.”"

    "article_text": "Insider Stock Buying Reaches S$756.1k On Quantum Healthcare editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) September 18, 2024 3 min read It is usually uneventful when a single insider buys stock. However, When quite a few insiders buy shares, as it happened in Quantum Healthcare Limited's ( Catalist:V8Y ) case, it's fantastic news for shareholders. While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Quantum Healthcare Quantum Healthcare Insider Transactions Over The Last Year In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Chin Thean Quek bought S$300k worth of shares at a price of S$0.002 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of S$0.002 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Quantum Healthcare insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices. In the last twelve months Quantum Healthcare insiders were buying shares, but not selling. They paid about S$0.0033 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! Catalist:V8Y Insider Trading Volume September 19th 2024 Quantum Healthcare is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find small cap companies at attractive valuations, this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket. Insiders At Quantum Healthcare Have Bought Stock Recently Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Quantum Healthcare. CEO & Executive Director Gim Chua Tan bought S$48k worth of shares in that time. It's good to see the insider buying, as well as the lack of recent sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small. Does Quantum Healthcare Boast High Insider Ownership? Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Quantum Healthcare insiders own 71% of the company, worth about S$11m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders. Story Continues So What Does This Data Suggest About Quantum Healthcare Insiders? We note a that there has been a bit of insider buying recently (but no selling). Overall the buying isn't worth writing home about. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Quantum Healthcare insiders feel good about the company's future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Quantum Healthcare. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Quantum Healthcare (2 are a bit concerning) you should be aware of. If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

    "article_text": "Innovation How To Handle Healthcare Cybersecurity Challenges With Machine Learning Algorithms By Alexei Dulub , Former Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Sep 18, 2024, 07:15am EDT Share Save Alexei Dulub is the founder and CEO of PixelPlex , an R&D company powering meaningful digital transformation across industries. getty The healthcare sector is increasingly reliant on digital technologies, demonstrating a strong commitment to using advanced tools for better patient care and more efficient data management. However, this has also made the industry a lucrative target for cybercriminals. Machine learning (ML) algorithms offer a promising solution in this challenging scenario. Here, I’ll dive into how ML goes beyond just being a popular term to become a powerful tool in safeguarding our most sensitive healthcare data. Key Cybersecurity Risks In The Healthcare Sector First of all, I’d like to share the specific reasons why healthcare data is so attractive to cybercriminals. Reason number one is the high value of personal health information (PHI), which includes detailed medical histories, insurance information and personal identifiers. This data can be sold on the black market or used in identity theft schemes. Healthcare systems are also vulnerable due to their integrated platforms, ranging from electronic health records to patient portals, each presenting potential access points for cybercriminals. Last but not least is the critical nature of healthcare services. This aspect makes these organizations attractive targets for ransomware attacks, as they are more likely to pay quickly to resume operations and patient care. Cybersecurity Threats Facing Healthcare Providers Here is a list of the most common cybersecurity risks that not only exploit the vulnerabilities mentioned above but also pose significant threats to the confidentiality of patient data and the continuity of healthcare services. • Theft Of Patient Data: Cybercriminals often target patient records to sell on the black market or use in fraud schemes. • Insider Threats: Employees or associates with access to the healthcare systems can misuse their access for personal gain or inadvertently cause a data breach. • Ransomware Attacks: These involve encrypting an organization’s data and demanding payment for its release. • Phishing Scams: These scams trick employees into revealing sensitive information or credentials, leading to unauthorized access to healthcare systems. How Machine Learning Boosts Healthcare Cybersecurity We regularly apply ML algorithms in our software development projects and, specifically, in healthcare projects. Based on my experience, I can say that ML is a big step forward in healthcare cybersecurity compared to older methods. Traditional ways, like signature-based detection, have their limits. Basically, this method works by matching known virus patterns, but it can't spot new or slightly changed viruses that aren't already in its database. So, it's not great at catching new types of cyber threats that keep changing. In contrast, ML employs algorithms that learn from data, adapting continuously to new information. This capability allows ML systems to identify and respond to threats in real time, a crucial advantage in healthcare cybersecurity where the threat landscape is rapidly evolving. Let's explore other advantages that show why ML is an ideal solution for tackling cybersecurity threats in healthcare: Enhanced Data Analysis ML algorithms can analyze complex and diverse data sets more effectively than traditional methods. They can uncover hidden patterns and correlations that might indicate a security threat, offering a deeper insight into potential vulnerabilities. Automated Incident Response ML can automate responses to detected threats, significantly reducing the time and resources needed for manual intervention. This automation is vital in healthcare, where quick response to security incidents is crucial. Scalability ML solutions can efficiently handle the vast amounts of data generated in healthcare. They can scale up as data volume grows, ensuring consistent protection. Predictive Capabilities These systems can spot future security risks by looking at data patterns and trends. This helps in strengthening defenses early to prevent upcoming attacks. Customization ML algorithms can be tailored to the specific cybersecurity needs of a healthcare organization. Five Best ML Practices To Safeguard Your Organization I’d like to share the best ML practices we use in our projects. These practices can help strengthen your organization's cybersecurity defense. 1. Identify unusual patterns and data flows. ML algorithms swiftly analyze data to identify deviations from normal behavior, such as unusual login attempts or unexpected data access. This enables healthcare organizations to detect and prevent potential breaches or attacks promptly. 2. Detect phishing attempts. Traditional email filters might miss sophisticated phishing attempts, but ML can fill this gap. ML algorithms can analyze email content, including subtle cues and patterns that are typically overlooked, to identify and flag phishing emails. 3. Analyze cyber threat trends in real time. ML can then help create suitable defense mechanisms. By understanding the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, healthcare organizations can adapt their cybersecurity strategies accordingly. 4. Automate threat intelligence gathering. ML can automate the process of collecting and analyzing threat intelligence from various sources. This continuous, automated gathering and analysis of data enable healthcare organizations to stay ahead of new vulnerabilities and attack strategies, ensuring that their security measures are always relevant. 5. Implement ML-driven risk assessment. ML can analyze historical data and current trends. This helps in identifying potential areas of vulnerability within the organization's network, allowing for targeted strengthening of defenses. ML Challenges You Need To Address When applying ML, dealing with data privacy and ethical issues is really important. ML in healthcare means handling a lot of patient data, which brings up big privacy concerns. It's crucial to keep this data safe and private. Also, there are ethical issues with how ML is used, particularly in decision-making processes that affect patient care. There's a pressing need for transparency in these algorithms to prevent biases and ensure fair treatment across all patient demographics. Another significant challenge is ensuring that all employees receive comprehensive training on ML technology. They need to understand not only how to use it but also the fundamental principles of ML, its capabilities and its limitations. Overall, when used wisely and responsibly, ML becomes a powerful tool for healthcare providers to fight cyber threats. Its ability to adapt, learn and predict fits well for tackling the ever-changing and complex cybersecurity issues in the healthcare sector.

The Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses, available on Incredible Health's website and mobile apps, enables health systems and nurses to access a quick \"at a glance\" insight into the policy proposals that affect them most. In addition to highlighting relevant policies, the tool provides links to Incredible Health and third-party resources, actionable steps for getting involved with advocacy efforts, and facts on key policy supporters. \"Presidential elections always dominate news cycles, but it's important to recognize that healthcare policy is shaped by federal, state, and local policies, as well as licensing boards, and is built by one piece of legislation at a time,\" said Iman Abuzeid MD, CEO and co-founder of Incredible Health. \"We see it as our responsibility to ensure that nurses have easy access to policy information that impacts their lives, careers, and professions. Our Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses features clear calls to action, making it simpler for nurses and healthcare leaders to engage in the legislative process and advocate for the changes they want to see in their workplace and for the future of this critical workforce.\" The Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses includes policy insights focusing on: Nurse Mental Health and Wellbeing - The pandemic significantly impacted nurse mental health and well-being, with lingering effects of increased stress and burnout still felt today. The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act , signed in 2022, aims to improve access to and reduce the stigma of mental health treatment for healthcare workers. Congress is considering reauthorizing and funding the Act with a focus on reducing administrative burden, which is a top driver of burnout. Nurse mental health is an area of focus for Incredible Health, where millions of nurses have benefited from its Nurse Wellness Toolkit . Educational Support - Supporting nursing education is key to the future of the nursing profession. Legislation like the Stop Nurse Shortages Act increases access to accelerated nursing degree programs, increases the number of clinical training sites, and offers student financial assistance to increase the number of graduating nurses, including graduates from underrepresented backgrounds. Policies like these aim to increase the supply of qualified healthcare workers, which is especially critical as the US faces a nursing shortage that 90% of healthcare executives in Incredible Health's 2024 Healthcare Executive Report predict will worsen in the coming years. Workplace Safety and Violence - Workplace safety and violence are among the most pressing issues facing the nursing profession today. According to Incredible Health's 2024 State of US Nursing Report , 50% of nurses have been verbally and/or physically assaulted by a patient or a member of the patient's family within the past year. The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act calls on the Department of Labor to issue an occupational safety and health standard that requires covered employers within the health care and social service industries to develop and implement a comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan. \"Nurses are critical to our healthcare system and patient care, yet they are often left out of the conversations that directly impact their profession. With tools like Incredible Health's Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses, nurses are given the power to understand and actively participate in shaping the policies that impact them,\" said J. Corey Feist , JD, MBA, CEO & Co-Founder of the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation. \"We must always ensure that healthcare legislation is informed by those who are on the frontlines every day and that nurses feel empowered and equipped to advocate for their rights and working conditions.\" You can find Incredible Health's Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses here .

    "article_text": "Dublin, Sept. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Saudi Arabia IoT In Healthcare Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2019-2029F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Saudi Arabia IoT In Healthcare Market was valued at USD 387.22 Million in 2023 and is anticipated to project steady growth in the forecast period with a CAGR of 8.69% through 2029 The Saudi Arabia IoT in healthcare market is driven by several key factors. Increasing government initiatives and investments in digital health technologies, part of the country's Vision 2030 plan, are enhancing healthcare infrastructure and promoting the adoption of IoT solutions. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and a growing aging population further fuels demand for connected health devices that enable remote monitoring and personalized care. Technological advancements in IoT, including improved data analytics and real-time monitoring capabilities, are also accelerating market growth by enhancing patient outcomes and operational efficiencies. The focus on improving healthcare accessibility and reducing costs through innovative technologies is contributing to the market's expansion. The convergence of these factors is creating a robust environment for IoT solutions in healthcare, positioning Saudi Arabia as a key player in the regional digital health landscape. Growing Demand for Telemedicine The increasing demand for telemedicine services in Saudi Arabia is having a profound impact on the IoT in healthcare market, transforming how healthcare is delivered and accessed across the country. Telemedicine, which allows patients to consult healthcare providers remotely, addresses significant challenges in a country characterized by a vast geographic area and varied levels of healthcare accessibility. IoT devices play a critical role in this evolving landscape by enabling remote monitoring, virtual consultations, and seamless data sharing between patients and healthcare professionals. In Saudi Arabia, where large distances and regional disparities in healthcare access can limit patients' ability to receive timely medical care, telemedicine offers a valuable solution. Through virtual consultations, patients can connect with healthcare providers without the need for extensive travel, making healthcare more accessible to those living in remote or underserved areas. This is particularly beneficial in a country with diverse geographical terrains and varying levels of healthcare infrastructure. Enhancements in Healthcare Data Analytics Advancements in healthcare data analytics are playing a crucial role in driving the adoption of IoT technologies in Saudi Arabia, significantly transforming how healthcare data is utilized to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiencies. IoT devices, such as wearable health monitors, smart medical devices, and remote diagnostic tools, generate an immense volume of data that, when harnessed and analyzed effectively, offers profound insights into various aspects of healthcare. One of the primary benefits of integrating IoT data with advanced analytics platforms is the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions. In a healthcare setting, the data collected by IoT devices - ranging from vital signs and activity levels to detailed medical histories - provides a comprehensive view of a patient's health status. By employing sophisticated analytics tools, healthcare providers can synthesize this data to gain a deeper understanding of patient conditions, treatment responses, and overall health trends. Predictive analytics is a key component of this integration. It involves using historical data and statistical algorithms to forecast future health outcomes.

Speaking at the inaugural University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) Alumni Lecture, Dr. Apetorgbor emphasized that reliable electricity is essential for the functioning of life-saving medical equipment such as ventilators, incubators, and dialysis machines. \"The devices that sustain lives depend on a constant flow of electricity. Our commitment to ensuring uninterrupted power in healthcare cannot be overstated,\" Dr. Apetorgbor remarked, stressing the urgency of sustainable energy solutions for healthcare facilities. He linked his comments to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 7, which focus on good health and well-being, as well as affordable and sustainable energy. Dr. Apetorgbor advocated for increased investment in renewable energy sources and proposed that healthcare professionals receive capacity-building in energy management. He also suggested that universities introduce Power Crisis Management programs aimed at equipping healthcare workers with skills to manage energy-related challenges. The lecture, held under the theme “Enhancing Healthcare Delivery: The Role of Sustainable Energy and Reliable Technology,” called for collaborative efforts to integrate sustainable energy solutions into healthcare to improve service delivery and save lives. In her welcome address, UHAS Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lydia Aziato, praised the Alumni Association’s efforts, led by President Mr. Gabriel Agbanyo, for initiating the annual lecture series. She commended UHAS graduates for their contributions to the healthcare sector worldwide, stating, \"I am convinced our alumni will soon be among the shakers and movers of the healthcare sector both locally and globally.\" Professor Aziato also stressed the importance of energy and technology in the ongoing evolution of healthcare. The lecture was chaired by Togbe Dzomatsi II, representing the Agbogbomefia of the Asogli State, Togbe Afede XIV. Togbe Dzomatsi emphasized the need for education and stakeholder collaboration to ensure a sustainable energy future for healthcare and overall human development.

Itqan is hosting a one-day booth at Qatar University, connecting with students and faculty to highlight the vital role of simulation in healthcare education. Itqan is also participating in Qatar National Patient Safety Week further promoting its initiatives and advancements. “At Itqan, we provide hands-on simulation workshops that replicate real-life medical scenarios, allowing participants to experience clinical practice in a supportive and controlled environment. This immersive approach not only equips healthcare providers with the skills they need to excel but also inspires the next generation of medical professionals to pursue careers in this field. We invite all stakeholders, from policymakers to educators, to join us in advancing the field of healthcare simulation, improving patient outcomes, and ensuring that Qatar remains at the forefront of medical innovation,” added Dr Yousuf. Over the past two years, Itqan has hosted more than 5,000 students from approximately 70 schools, significantly increasing interest in healthcare professions through its partnership with the Health Profession Awareness Programme."

    "article_text": "Opinion The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill Price transparency is key to reducing health care costs by Vivian Ho, opinion contributor - 09/13/24 12:00 PM ET by Vivian Ho, opinion contributor - 09/13/24 12:00 PM ET Share ✕ LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email An ambulance drives through the Texas Medical Center Thursday, June 25, 2020, in Houston. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) Health care has emerged as a fault line in this year’s election campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris supports expanding the Affordable Care Act , while former President Donald Trump wants to scale it back. Yet there’s one health care policy that the Biden-Harris and Trump administrations both supported and can coalesce around again: price transparency. This bipartisan health care fix is supported by 92 percent of Americans, according to a new poll by Echelon Insights and SocialSphere. Thirty-two economists, including me, recently sent a letter to U.S. senators, urging them to pass the Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0 , co-sponsored by Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). This bill requires providers and insurers to publish their actual prices, including their cash and negotiated insurance rates, empowering consumers with choice and competition. Such systemwide price transparency can substantially reduce health care costs while boosting the economy and worker paychecks. Prices are a necessary component of functioning markets, and their absence in American health care is a major reason for runaway costs that burden patients, employers and workers. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , the average annual employer-sponsored family health insurance premium is $24,000, a 50 percent increase over the last decade. Hidden health care prices cause an information asymmetry that gives hospitals and health insurers unfair pricing power over consumers who are forced to pay with the equivalent of a blank check. It’s no surprise that health care costs are a top concern for voters. The Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University recently analyzed hospital and health insurance charges in Houston and found wide price variations for the same care — a sign of market failure. For example, among patients covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the average price of a hospital stay for 25 common diagnoses was $18,858 in the Houston Methodist hospital system, more than twice as much as at several independent hospitals in Harris County. The average price for 32 outpatient services negotiated by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas in Harris County varied from $1,500 to $3,000, depending on the hospital. The average price for 19 outpatient services negotiated by Aetna in Harris County ranged from less than $2,000 to more than $6,000, again depending on the hospital. Our analysis was only able to compare prices for a limited number of diagnoses and services because the data was non-standardized and incomplete. The Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0 would finally unleash all prices throughout the health care system in a standard format, allowing consumers to spot price variations and choose high-value care. Armed with this price information, employers could steer employees to less expensive care and share savings through lower premiums. Employers would also finally get access to their complete claims receipt data, which they could compare with health plan spending and posted prices to avoid overbilling, errors and fraud. Prices foster competition, greatly reducing pervasive waste and unproductive middle players that proliferate in the dark and drive-up costs. According to a 2019 JAMA study , 25 percent of U.S. health expenditures, which reached $4.5 trillion in 2022 , is administrative waste and unnecessary overcharging. This study implies an annual economic stimulus of around $1 trillion from an efficient and transparent system. Economists of all backgrounds support price transparency as a fundamental solution to the American health care cost crisis. But you don’t need to be an economist to understand the importance of upfront prices. Ordinary Americans already price shop for all other goods and services and would do so for non-emergency health care if given the chance. With the help of tech innovators and consumer-friendly apps, health care price disclosures would empower patients and businesses to choose affordable care. This Congress should conclude its term by passing the bipartisan Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0. It would bring Republicans and Democrats together during this contentious campaign season. More importantly, it would take a big step toward a pro-consumer health care system that reduces costs, raises worker pay and stimulates the economy at this time when it’s needed most.

    "article_text": "ENGLISH Greece Struggles with Healthcare Coverage: A Growing Crisis Φωτογραφία αρχείου: Shutterstock ANTHEE CARASSAVA 10/09/2024 08:13 A recent analysis by the ENA Institute has highlighted the growing challenges faced by Greeks in accessing healthcare coverage within the European Union. Despite the existence of public healthcare systems across all EU countries, many citizens struggle to meet their healthcare needs, and the situation in Greece has deteriorated significantly in recent years. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ According to Eurostat data, high costs, distance to healthcare facilities, and long waiting times are the primary reasons for this gap in healthcare coverage. In Greece, these issues have become particularly acute, with the percentage of individuals unable to cover their healthcare needs rising dramatically since 2022. Between 2020 and 2021, approximately 6.5% of Greeks were unable to cover their healthcare needs, compared to an EU average of around 2%. However, this figure surged to 9% in 2022 and 11.6% in 2023, surpassing the EU average by a significant margin. Cost is the most common barrier to healthcare access in Greece, with a staggering 9.4% of the population unable to afford necessary treatment in 2023. This rate is significantly higher than the EU average of 2.2%. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ Even among the wealthiest 20% of the Greek population, 2.9% are unable to cover healthcare costs, highlighting the widespread nature of this problem. While Greece had previously performed better than the EU average in terms of waiting times, this trend has reversed in 2023. This indicates that the challenges faced by Greeks in accessing healthcare are becoming increasingly multifaceted. The ENA Institute's analysis underscores the urgent need for reforms to address the growing healthcare crisis in Greece. Increasing access to affordable healthcare is essential for ensuring the well-being of the population and promoting social justice.

    "article_text": "Press Release Pharmacists Convicted of $13M Medicare, Medicaid, and Private Insurer Fraud Scheme Friday, September 6, 2024 For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs A federal jury convicted four pharmacy owners yesterday for conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud. According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Raef Hamaed, of Maricopa County, Arizona; Kindy Ghussin, of Greene County, Ohio; Ali Abdelrazzaq, of Macomb County, Michigan; and Tarek Fakhuri, of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, all licensed pharmacists, billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan for prescription medications that they did not dispense at pharmacies they owned in Michigan and Ohio. The defendants collectively caused over $13 million of loss to Medicare, Medicaid, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Hamaed, Ghussin, Abdelrazzaq, and Fakhuri were convicted of conspiracy to commit health care and wire fraud. Abdelrazzaq was also convicted of two counts of health care fraud and Fakhuri was convicted of one count of health care fraud. Sentencing hearings will be set at a later date. Hamaed, Ghussin, Abdelrazzaq, and Fakhuri face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the conspiracy count, and Abdelrazzaq and Fakhuri face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each health care fraud count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Special Agent in Charge Cheyvoryea Gibson of the FBI Detroit Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Mario Pinto of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made the announcement. The FBI Detroit Field Office and HHS-OIG investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Claire Sobczak, Kelly M. Warner, and S. Babu Kaza of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, currently comprised of nine strike forces operating in 27 federal districts, has charged more than 5,400 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $27 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes.

    "article_text": "Share Tweet Share In an increasingly complex world, where technology, science, and medicine are rapidly evolving, health care literacy is no longer a luxury but a necessity. The ability to understand and use health information effectively can mean the difference between life and death. However, it is important to distinguish between being health literate and health care literate. While both are critical, they serve different purposes in ensuring successful health outcomes. Health literacy refers to an individual’s understanding of medical science, including basic knowledge of the body, common illnesses, treatments, and preventive care. It encompasses the ability to comprehend health information, such as recognizing symptoms that might indicate a specific condition and knowing the benefits of preventive health care. Health literacy empowers individuals to make decisions about their day-to-day health and wellness, fostering a proactive approach to maintaining good health. On the other hand, health care literacy pertains to understanding the health care system itself—how it functions, how to access it, and how to navigate its complexities. Health care literacy involves knowing how to choose a health care provider, understanding the differences between various types of health insurance plans, and being able to follow the administrative processes necessary to receive and pay for care, such as obtaining referrals, understanding medical billing, and managing health records. In short, while health literacy is about understanding medical science, health care literacy is about understanding the systems and structures that deliver medical care. The distinction between health literacy and health care literacy is crucial. Being health literate allows you to grasp the basics of medical conditions and treatments, enabling you to take preventive measures and make informed decisions about your health. However, even the most health-literate individuals can struggle without adequate health care literacy. For instance, someone may understand the symptoms of a condition and the necessity of treatment but may be overwhelmed by the process of finding a specialist, securing insurance coverage, or understanding their rights as a patient. Moreover, health care literacy is critical in advocating for your health. Being able to communicate effectively with health care providers, understand the financial aspects of care, and make decisions aligned with your values requires a strong foundation in how the system operates. This is particularly important for managing chronic conditions or when dealing with complicated medical needs that require coordination across multiple health care providers. In today’s world, where information is abundant, and the health care landscape is ever-changing, being both health literate and health care literate is vital. Health literacy equips you with the knowledge of medical science, while health care literacy enables you to navigate the complexities of the health care system. Together, they empower you to make informed decisions, advocate for your well-being, and ultimately lead a healthier, more informed life. As life demands that you take an active role in your well-being, achieving both health and health care literacy becomes not just important but indispensable. Reyhan Haider is a researcher.

The HCMC task force, announced on May 9, 2024, will be composed of an interdisciplinary team that includes civil and criminal prosecutors, economists, health care industry experts, technologists, data scientists, investigators and policy advisors from across the Division’s Civil, Criminal, Litigation and Policy Programs, and the Expert Analysis Group. DOJ has indicated that the HCMC task force will address the following non-exhaustive types of “widespread competition concerns shared by patients, health care professionals, businesses and entrepreneurs”: Issues regarding payer-provider consolidation, Serial acquisitions, Labor and quality of care, Medical billing, Health care IT services, and Access to and misuse of health care data Of particular note, Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, highlighted the need for the Antitrust Division to adjust its enforcement in light of the changing health care market. Specifically, Kanter referred to the “platformization” of health care, whereby health care consumers experience health care delivered by “multi-sided giants, intermediaries that have a coordinated stack of businesses that flow together, including payers, including providers, including PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers], claims processing, banks”— in other words, vertically integrated health care businesses —who are “accumulating assets at an alarming rate” and becoming “gatekeepers of our health care system”. The unveiling of the HCMC task force follows a number of recent initiatives demonstrating the government’s focus on antitrust enforcement in health care: Since 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the agency which shares authority to enforce antitrust laws with DOJ, has been conducting an antitrust inquiry into pharmacy benefit managers’ (“PBM”) impact on access and affordability of prescription drugs. In 2022, the FTC issued compulsory orders for information and records to the six largest PBMs and, in 2023, to two group purchasing organizations that negotiate drug rebates on behalf of other PBMs. On February 3, 2023, the Antitrust Division withdrew three antitrust enforcement policy statements related to enforcement in health care markets which had created antitrust “safety zones” for mergers, joint ventures, group purchasing, and information sharing among industry participants. On March 5, 2024, the White House announced a new Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing co-chaired by the DOJ and the FTC to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior that hikes prices in key sectors including prescription drugs and health care. On March 5, 2024, DOJ, the FTC, and the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) jointly launched a cross-government public inquiry into private-equity and other corporations’ increasing ownership and control over health care. Specifically, the Request for Information (“RFI”) requested public comment on deals conducted by health systems, private payers, private equity funds and other alternative asset managers that involve health care providers, facilities or ancillary products or services. The RFI also requested information on transactions that would not be reported to the Justice Department or FTC for antitrust review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The deadline for public comment was extended to June 5, 2024. On April 18, 2024, DOJ, the FTC, and HHS launched an online portal, HealthyCompetition.gov , to allow the public to report potentially unfair and anticompetitive health care practices to the FTC and the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Collectively, the creation of the HCMC task force, in addition to these recent efforts, continue to demonstrate the federal government’s ongoing enforcement efforts against health care businesses. As such, health care providers should evaluate the competitive effects of any business decision, including mergers and acquisitions and anticompetitive agreements.

    "article_text": "Instead of making IVF free, Trump should set patients free from government’s failed healthcare model By Hadley Heath Manning Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print September 6, 2024 6:00 am Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print Former President Donald Trump is calling for the government or insurance companies to pay for in vitro fertilization treatments, making them free. Perhaps this stance is a political move intended to thwart accusations of pro-life extremism and win over moderate female voters. But it’s still a bad policy proposal — one that will empower insurance companies and ultimately make it harder for conservatives to articulate a better vision for healthcare. Trump should pivot and focus on taking down the administrative leviathan that is our insurance-centric healthcare system. This would appeal to many women, as both patients and caregivers. Recommended Stories The fundamental reason AI prosperity will resist this economic winter A call to Congress: Strengthen America by strengthening patents How America could lose at its own game While the government heavily influences our healthcare system — more than 40% of the country depends on government programs for healthcare — we do not have a totally government-run healthcare system as some of our peer countries in Europe do. Instead, we have an insurance-run healthcare system in the United States. The headaches of insurance-run healthcare do not discriminate by age, sex, race, or political affiliation. It would be hard to find someone who has not spent hours on the phone with a hospital billing department, only to be told to call their insurer, only to be told by their insurer to call the hospital back. Sadly, this is a common part of the U.S. healthcare experience. This makes for a great opportunity for Trump. He can define this problem and, even better, offer solutions. Some see our current healthcare system as the product of capitalism. But this explanation doesn’t make sense. Other industries, while they have all experienced inflation in recent years, do not have the same dysfunction we see in healthcare and insurance. The real culprit? Obamacare. Indeed, our insurance-centric system is Obamacare’s defining legacy. The program mandates that all Americans carry government-approved health insurance. Can you imagine anything better for the insurance business? Furthermore, the law (and the regulations that flowed from it) spell out particular services and treatments that must be included in that insurance coverage, including, for example, birth control. Conservatives were right to fight the so-called birth-control mandate. The Obama administration was wrong to force Catholic nuns to pay for coverage that they found objectionable on moral and religious grounds (and that they’d never need). The same could be said of a potential IVF mandate. But culture wars aside, there’s another reason we should not pay for all healthcare through health “insurance.” In the case of birth control, preventive care, or other routine healthcare, such coverage no longer serves as true insurance. Insurance is meant to be a backstop against unexpected costs, not a third party to every transaction. When we move from a true insurance model to nonsensical third-party payment, we simply add an unnecessary layer of costs and bureaucracy, and we invite the “group lunch” problem: We essentially tell patients never to care about healthcare prices, even for non-urgent care. Worse, we make healthcare providers accountable to insurance companies instead of patients because they will always answer first to whoever is paying the bill. As P.J. O’Rourke once quipped: “If you think healthcare is expensive now, just wait ‘til it’s free.” Indeed, we pay dearly for “free” coverage. We pay with higher insurance premiums, and we pay in a deeper sense as we lose control of our own care. Our options reduce to only what is in network, on the formulary, or preauthorized by the health insurance gods. But if anyone can tackle this problem, it’s Trump. He has the largest platform, and he can simplify complex topics in a way most Republican policy wonks cannot. But he must avoid mimicking the Left’s approach to healthcare, which will lead us to socialized care. The political Right cannot compete with the Left when it comes to government giveaways, nor should we try. But we can offer a competing vision. Rather than adding to the long list of what should be “free” in our healthcare system, Trump should focus on making only one thing free: patients. Let us choose how to pay for healthcare, allowing for more direct-pay options. Restore insurance to its rightful, limited role. This will lead to lower prices, more options, a better experience for patients, and better healthcare for all.

    "article_text": "Leadership Leadership Strategies Seven Pillars To Put Healthcare Consumers At The Heart Of The Digital Transformation By HEC Paris Insights , Contributor. Follow Author Sep 06, 2024, 09:16am EDT Sep 18, 2024, 03:58am EDT Share Save Comment Tech giants like Apple and Withings, alongside wellness apps like Yuka and Lumosity, have empowered consumers to monitor key health indicators, such as body mass index, heartbeat, and cognitive performance, on their own terms. Shutterstock The digital age has seen many industries undergo a profound transformation, evolving into agile \"Hybrid Organizations\" that blend traditional and digital business models. Lego, Utrecht University, Sephora, AXA and Disney are just a few of the examples that come to mind when assessing this revolutionary shift towards value creation and agility in our digital landscape. The healthcare sector, however, faces a unique set of challenges on its journey toward this transformation. With a complex landscape shaped by stringent regulations, diverse stakeholders—including healthcare providers, insurers, and government bodies—and the ever-evolving needs of patients and consumers, the healthcare industry must adapt swiftly to remain relevant. Not all health institutions have been able to enjoy the daring journey towards digital transformation that John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, or California’s Kaiser Permanente health care providers have known. The Self-Care Revolution One of the most significant shifts in healthcare is the rising concept of \"Self-Care\". In this model, individuals are increasingly taking responsibility for their health prevention, primary care, and recovery. Tech giants like Apple and Withings, alongside wellness apps like Yuka and Lumosity, have empowered consumers to monitor key health indicators, such as body mass index, heartbeat, and cognitive performance, on their own terms. At the same time, innovative companies like Laboratoire Gabriel Couzian natural dermo-cosmetic, or the digital native brands Mary Ruth Organics, and DIJO Probiotic have embraced direct-to-consumer (DTC) models, engaging immediately with individuals. DTC helps optimize care, reduce cost and explain routines-. With the development of personalization (thanks to Data and AI), patients will benefit from , predictive and preventive medicine. Seven Ways To Harmonize The Digital Landscape In Healthcare In light of these developments, the global healthcare industry would be well advised to pivot towards a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or Direct-to-Consumer model. This shift necessitates building trust with patients—who are increasingly seen as patient-consumers—and reimagining their roles within the healthcare value chain. Drawing inspiration from the digital transformations seen in industries such as retail, beauty, and consumer electronics, we propose seven strategic pillars that can serve as a roadmap for healthcare organizations aiming to thrive in this new landscape. 1. Develop a Vision Shared Within and Outside the Organization A successful digital transformation begins with a clear, compelling vision that resonates both internally and externally. This \"North Star\" should encompass well-defined values and a distinct organizational culture that are not compromised by short-term management decisions or uncertainties about outcomes. In the healthcare sector, where trust is paramount, it is essential to bridge the gap between the organization and its consumers through transparency, consistency, and reliability. Today's digitally empowered patients use online platforms to make informed choices, perform self-assessments, and voice their opinions. To build and maintain their trust, healthcare organizations must communicate with clarity and authenticity.

Diversify and Integrate Digital Business Models For many healthcare companies, the first step toward digital transformation is diversifying their business models by investing in digital technologies. However, diversification alone is not enough. To truly transform, these digital initiatives must be seamlessly integrated into the existing business structure, rather than operating as isolated verticals. The challenges faced by companies like Richemont with Net-a-Porter and Walmart with Jet.com highlight the importance of integration, while Microsoft's successful incorporation of LinkedIn demonstrates its potential. In healthcare, this two-step process of \"diversification and integration\" ensures that digital assets are leveraged effectively, enabling a smooth transition and a mindset shift across the organization. 3. Blend Digital and Traditional Expertise As healthcare organizations embrace digitalization, their structures, methodologies, and governance must evolve to support organic growth. Successful transformation requires the seamless integration of digital expertise across all functions and operations. This involves creating a workforce that combines in-house talent, external collaborators, and partners. Borrowing from digital-first companies, healthcare organizations should adopt a \"test, fail, fix, learn\" mindset and foster a culture of open innovation, where failures are viewed as opportunities for growth. Establishing a cross-functional Digital Board can facilitate a holistic approach and enable quick, informed decision-making. 4. Prioritize Patient/Consumer Centricity In the digital age, the culture of healthcare companies must pivot to become truly patient- and consumer-centric. With millions of health-related searches conducted on Google every day, consumers are actively taking charge of their health information. To meet their expectations, healthcare organizations need to develop a deep understanding of the consumer market, refresh their approach to brand development and positioning, master digital marketing, and deliver exceptional customer service. Moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all model, healthcare providers should take cues from the aforementioned digital-native brands that have successfully connected with consumers in personalized and meaningful ways. By committing to transparent, educational communication based on proven results, these brands build trust and loyalty, setting a new standard for patient engagement. 5. Empower Employees as Consumers and Citizens A key component of successful digital transformation is recognizing that employees are also consumers and citizens. When the boundaries between \"work\" and \"personal\" life blur—without infringing on personal space—employees can harness their creativity and initiative to drive meaningful change. Management should foster a culture of transparent communication, trust in self-responsibility, and responsiveness to societal concerns. By encouraging a mindset of responsible individual and collective entrepreneurship, healthcare organizations can better align with the evolving expectations and demands of both their workforce and consumers. 6. Build an Extended Partner Ecosystem Creating an ecosystem of partners and external resources is a proven strategy for achieving growth, flexibility, and knowledge sharing. However, this approach is only sustainable if it is built on a foundation of ethics, loyalty, and mutually beneficial relationships. The agility of a healthcare organization is closely tied to its partners' ability to adapt and innovate alongside it. In a sector where human lives are at stake, trustworthy and long-term partnerships are essential for driving meaningful transformation. By collaborating with partners who bring insights from other industries and sectors, healthcare organizations can accelerate their digital journey and enhance patient care. 7. Safeguard Medical Confidentiality The digital transformation of healthcare brings with it significant potential but also substantial risks, particularly concerning medical confidentiality and privacy. As digital tools collect and store personal data from both private and public sources, there is a growing concern that individuals' health information could be accessed by non-medical entities—such as governments, insurers, and tech firms—without explicit consent. To ensure that data is used solely to enhance patient care and, eventually, contribute to medical research, healthcare organizations must establish transparent consent processes, implement robust cybersecurity measures, and create an ethical framework for data usage that prioritizes patient approval. Protecting confidentiality and trust is crucial to the success of digital healthcare initiatives. Bridging The Gap The healthcare sector is one of the most complex and largest in the US economy. PAccording to OECD data , p er capita health spending increased in almost every peer nation to USA in 2022. .And according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , health care expenditures will grow from 17.7% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2018 to 19.7% in 2028. Along with its economic size and impact on the country’s general economy, comes rising costs, uncertainty over the durability of Medicare and the challenges of an aging population. These challenges can be attenuated through this journey toward harmonizing a consumer-centric healthcare organization with the digital transformation. We have outlined seven strategic pillars to guide in this process. They offer a comprehensive framework for revolutionizing the sector. By bridging the gap between traditional healthcare practices and the emerging digital-first landscape, these strategies ensure that patient and consumer needs remain at the forefront. Drawing from the successful digital transformations of other industries, healthcare organizations that embrace these pillars will not only enhance the delivery of care but also position themselves for sustainable, organic growth in an increasingly digital world.

Several studies have identified the role of health care providers in addressing women's oral health needs across various phases of their lives, yet a review in the area of perimenopause and menopause has not been undertaken. Therefore, the aim of this review was to explore current evidence regarding the oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of women in perimenopause or menopause and their health care providers. Additionally, guidelines and recommendations to inform strategies for oral health promotion are included. Methods: A systematic search was carried out across 5 databases. Inclusion criteria included articles published in English that examined at least one study outcome: oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of either women in perimenopause or menopause or of health care providers or guidelines around oral health care. Qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, and experimental studies with survey components were included with no restrictions on publication period, quality, or setting. Results: A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria, with a majority being of poor quality and mostly from low-income and middle-income countries. Overall findings indicated that there was a lack of knowledge and limited practices in maintaining oral hygiene and visiting the dentist among women in perimenopause or menopause. Health care providers exhibited poor attitudes in advising the importance of periodic dental check-ups and informing oral health changes during this period. There were also insufficient guidelines to adopt care for women and guide health care providers in their practice. Discussion: Women in perimenopause or menopause have limited oral health knowledge and unmet oral health needs. Appropriate guidelines and supportive strategies are required to assist health care providers in providing comprehensive care and encouragement to women in perimenopause or menopause to improve their oral health.

United States Food, Drugs, Healthcare, Life Sciences Husnain Siraj To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. The mental health landscape within the healthcare industry has been drawing increasing attention as providers, patients, and policymakers alike grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by mental healthcare needs. As awareness of mental health issues becomes more widespread, the healthcare sector is experiencing a pivotal moment where the demand for mental health services is rising sharply. The financial impact of these services is significant, and it is essential for healthcare organizations to understand and account for these effects accurately. Challenges in Mental Healthcare One of the primary challenges in mental healthcare is accessibility. Many patients face barriers to receiving care due to a shortage of mental health professionals, lack of insurance coverage, and the stigma associated with seeking mental health services. This gap in accessibility not only affects individuals' well-being but also leads to increased overall healthcare costs, as untreated mental health conditions often exacerbate physical health issues. Providers are seeking innovative ways to bridge this gap, including telehealth services, which have seen a dramatic increase in use due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities for Improvement Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for the healthcare industry to improve the delivery of mental health services. Integration of mental health into primary care settings, expansion of digital health platforms, and increased funding for mental health initiatives are all areas where progress can be made. Healthcare providers that invest in these areas may not only enhance patient care but also position themselves competitively in a changing market. Moreover, the destigmatization of mental health issues and the recognition of mental well-being as a vital component of overall health can drive further advancements in care quality and delivery models. Accounting for Financial Impact The financial impact of providing mental health services must be carefully considered for healthcare organizations. This involves navigating the complexities of insurance reimbursements, grants, and other funding sources dedicated to mental health. It is crucial for accountants in the healthcare industry to accurately record and manage the costs associated with mental health services to ensure sustainability. Recognizing the long-term cost savings that effective mental healthcare can provide by preventing more severe health complications and improving quality of life is also vital for a comprehensive financial strategy. Conclusion The healthcare industry's approach to mental healthcare challenges and opportunities is evolving rapidly. By addressing accessibility barriers, leveraging technology, and investing in integrated care, providers can improve mental health services and outcomes. Accurate accounting and financial management practices are necessary to navigate the economic aspects of these services effectively. As the industry continues to adapt, the emphasis on mental health will likely grow, making it an essential area for healthcare organizations to focus on for patient care excellence and financial resilience.

With an ageing population and rising chronic illnesses , the preventive nature of Chinese medicine can contribute to better health outcomes and alleviate the burdens on our healthcare resources. Advertisement To maximise the impact of Chinese medicine, three critical areas deserve our focus. First, we should refine licensing examination standards to elevate the clinical competence of Chinese medicine practitioners, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary skills to meet evolving healthcare challenges. Second, Hong Kong should establish a more defined role for Chinese medicine within the primary healthcare system , easing collaboration with the other healthcare disciplines. Third, the city should provide specialist training through Chinese medicine hospitals to develop practitioners’ advanced clinical competencies. The 2022 Primary Healthcare Blueprint recognised the potential of Chinese medicine in primary care, envisioning a collaborative approach with other healthcare professionals to shift the focus of healthcare from not only treating disease but also preventing them. Therefore, enhancing the professional standards and reputation of Chinese medicine practitioners must be a cornerstone of the blueprint. Heavily focused on theoretical knowledge, the current licensing exam for practitioners fails to adequately assess their clinical competence. Practitioners have noted that while graduates have a strong theoretical understanding, they often face challenges in applying knowledge to areas like prescription and acupuncture techniques. Advertisement To address this issue, the newly established Chinese medicine development blueprint subcommittee, which includes representatives from the three Chinese medicine schools in Hong Kong, should consider adapting mainland China’s examination model. In this system, students must pass practical skills assessments, encompassing diagnostics and treatment, before attempting the theoretical knowledge test. This approach ensures basic clinical proficiency. 08:51 Hong Kong’s first traditional Chinese medicine hospital to open in 2025, but why only now?

The amount covers claims for April and May of this year, reiterating the authority’s commitment to improving the sustainability and efficiency of healthcare delivery under the scheme. Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Dacosta Aboagye says, \"this substantial release not only bridges the debt gap but also reinforces our commitment to a robust and efficient healthcare system.

Published - September 04, 2024 04:04 pm IST Zubeda Hamid For nearly a month now, the country has been rocked by protests by medical professionals—services at many hospitals stalled, at many others, healthcare staff wore black badges while working, and in Kolkata, the epicentre of the protests, doctors have now begun telemedicine services to help patients while they continue their protest. The agitations began after the horrific rape and murder of a trainee doctor at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. The protesting healthcare workers are demanding, among other things, speedy justice for the victim as well as a Central law that protect healthcare workers and spaces. The Kolkata case, they point out is not the first: there have been scores of incidents of violence against healthcare workers across the country and the problem is escalating. What are the reasons behind violence in healthcare spaces in India? How many States have laws to protect healthcare professionals and why is there no Central law despite a 2019 draft bill? How can the government, the medical community and other stakeholders help build trust in the medical system once again?

The increasing frequency of product recalls is a major factor driving the demand for TIC services. The growing use of digital health technologies and medical devices also contributes to market growth. Moreover, heightened research and development efforts, along with investments from pharmaceutical and MedTech companies in creating new drugs and devices, require thorough testing, inspection, and certification to secure product approval. LAS VEGAS, Sept. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DelveInsight's Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Insights report provides the current and forecast market analysis, individual leading healthcare testing, inspection, and certification companies' market shares, challenges, healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market drivers, barriers, trends, and key market healthcare testing, inspection, and certification companies in the market. Key Takeaways from the Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Report As per DelveInsight estimates, North America is anticipated to dominate the global healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market during the forecast period. In the service type segment of the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market, the testing category accounted for the largest revenue share in 2023. Notable healthcare testing, inspection, and certification companies such as SGS Société Générale de Surveillance SA, DEKRA, Intertek Group plc, Nemko, Smithers, Eurofins Scientific, UL LLC, TÜV SÜD, Element Materials Technology, CSA Group Testing & Certification Inc., ALS, Applus+, Bureau Veritas, DeviceLab Inc., DNV GL, EdgeOne Medical Inc., F2 Labs, North American Science Associates, LLC, UX Firm, Neva Analytics, and several others, are currently operating in the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market.

To read more about the latest highlights related to the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market, get a snapshot of the key highlights entailed in the Global Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Report Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Overview Healthcare testing, inspection, and certification are critical components in ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products and services. Testing involves evaluating medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic tools to confirm they meet required standards and function as intended. This process often includes rigorous laboratory analysis and clinical trials, where the products are subjected to various conditions to assess their performance and safety. Inspection, on the other hand, involves examining healthcare facilities, equipment, and processes to ensure compliance with health regulations and quality standards. This can include routine checks, audits, and evaluations conducted by regulatory bodies or internal quality assurance teams. Certification represents the formal recognition that a healthcare product or facility meets established standards of quality and safety. Certification bodies, often accredited by national or international organizations, assess compliance through a combination of testing and inspections before awarding certification. This process not only helps to ensure that products and services are safe for public use but also promotes trust and reliability in the healthcare system. Regular recertification and continuous monitoring are essential to maintaining high standards and adapting to new advancements or changes in regulations. Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Insights In 2023, North America held the largest share of the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market. This dominance is attributed to the presence of major companies involved in drug and medical device development, which requires extensive testing, inspection, and certification. Additionally, the region's rising healthcare expenditures and well-developed healthcare infrastructure are significant factors contributing to the market's expansion. The growing investment in healthcare is spurring the demand for advanced medical devices for patients with chronic conditions. This heightened demand drives the need for rigorous testing and inspection to comply with regulatory standards, further boosting market growth in the region. To know more about why North America is leading the market growth in the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market, get a snapshot of the Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Outlook Healthcare Testing, Inspection, and Certification Market Dynamics The healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market is a crucial component of the global healthcare ecosystem, ensuring that medical products, services, and facilities meet rigorous standards for safety, efficacy, and quality. As the demand for advanced healthcare solutions grows, driven by an aging population and increased prevalence of chronic diseases , the market for testing and certification is expanding rapidly. This growth is also fueled by the rising complexity of healthcare products and technologies , including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and diagnostic tools. One of the key dynamics in this market is the stringent regulatory environment that governs healthcare testing and certification processes. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA in the United States and the EMA in Europe, impose strict guidelines to ensure that healthcare products are safe and effective. This regulatory oversight necessitates comprehensive testing and inspection procedures, which can be both time-consuming and costly for manufacturers. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on achieving regulatory compliance through rigorous testing protocols and obtaining certifications from recognized bodies. Another significant factor influencing the market is the rapid pace of technological advancement . Innovations in healthcare technology, such as digital health solutions and advanced diagnostic tools, are driving the need for more sophisticated testing and certification processes. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cutting-edge technologies into healthcare products requires new methodologies for evaluation and validation. This has led to increased investment in R&D to stay ahead of emerging trends and ensure that testing methods evolve in tandem with technological advancements. Market dynamics are also shaped by the increasing focus on personalized medicine and precision healthcare . As treatments and diagnostics become more tailored to individual patient needs, the demand for specialized testing and certification services is rising. This shift towards personalized approaches requires more nuanced and detailed testing protocols to ensure that treatments are safe and effective for specific patient populations . Consequently, there is a growing need for specialized testing facilities and expertise to address the complexities of personalized healthcare solutions. Lastly, globalization is playing a significant role in shaping the healthcare testing, inspection, and certification market. As healthcare products and services are increasingly traded across borders, there is a greater need for standardized testing and certification processes that can be recognized internationally. This has led to the development of global standards and harmonization efforts, which aim to streamline testing procedures and facilitate international trade. However, navigating the diverse regulatory landscapes across different countries can be challenging, requiring companies to adapt their testing and certification strategies accordingly.

    "article_text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — University of Florida Health (UF Health) and United Healthcare have failed to resolve their months-long contract negotiations, resulting in the expiration of their agreement on Sunday. This development has left thousands of patients across the First Coast without a network provider, worsening ongoing healthcare challenges in the region. >>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<< As of September 1, United Healthcare is excluding UF Health hospitals and physician groups in Gainesville, Jacksonville, and St. Johns from its network. According to UF Health , United Healthcare no longer covers UF Health physicians, hospitals, and other facilities for commercial and Medicaid Managed Care health plans in Gainesville and Jacksonville. Additionally, patients covered by United Healthcare’s Medicare Advantage plans will no longer have access to physicians with UF Health St. Johns or Flagler Hospital. UF Health Jacksonville, a safety net hospital, reported an $83 million operating loss last year, according to Fitch Ratings . In 2023, UnitedHealth Group’s profits reached a reported $22 billion . However, this exclusion does not impact Medicare Advantage plans or Dual Special Needs Plans (DSNP) at UF Health locations in Jacksonville, Gainesville, and Leesburg, according to United Healthcare. United Healthcare claims that it had agreed to terms with UF Health regarding its Medicaid network but alleges that UF Health did not respond to finalize the contract on August 31, disrupting access for approximately 30,000 people enrolled in Medicaid plans. The lack of a contract will also affect patients enrolled in employer-sponsored commercial plans and those covered by UF student health insurance plans. Despite this, UF Health’s psychiatric hospital and UF Health Central Florida remain under separate contracts and will continue to be included in United Healthcare’s network. “Our commitment to placing patients at the heart of our efforts is unwavering, and we have put processes in place to minimize any disruption in care to the extent we can, but unfortunately United Healthcare has given us no other choice,” said UF Health Physicians Chief Executive Officer Marvin Dewar in a news release. RELATED: UF Health Jacksonville $83M in operating losses; financial outlook downgraded by rating agency Dewar further explained that UF Health had invited United Healthcare to meet and finalize an agreement, “but they declined” and “insisted upon linking other products to the negotiations and abruptly imposing new conditions and language on items that had already been agreed upon.” United Healthcare provided a different account, claiming that UF Health’s last proposal, sent on August 29, included demands for a 30% price hike over the next two years, with more than a 20% rate increase in the first year. On August 30, United Healthcare sent back a counterproposal that included additional rate increases on top of what had already been proposed. According to United Healthcare, UF Health never responded to this last proposal and allowed the contract to expire. The two entities have been negotiating for months over reimbursement rates, with UF Health arguing that United Healthcare offered commercial rates below general inflation and “far below annual costs.” Dewar emphasized the importance of fair compensation, stating, “We deserve to be paid fairly and competitively for the care we provide to patients and the services we offer. Reasonable compensation is necessary for us to sustain our mission.” Both UF Health and United Healthcare confirmed they are “committed” to continuing negotiations. United Healthcare has urged UF Health to rejoin them at the negotiating table, while UF Health says it is negotiating in good faith but is awaiting a fair and sustainable offer. Patients affected by the contract expiration are encouraged to contact UF Health with questions at 1-855-834-7337 or 352-265-8585.

The contract between UF Health and United Healthcare expired Sunday. UF Health said in a news release Sunday that United Healthcare is excluding UF Health hospitals and physician groups in Jacksonville, St. Johns and Gainesville from its network. United Healthcare is no longer covering UF Health physicians, hospitals and other facilities for commercial and Medicaid Managed Care health plans in Gainesville and Jacksonville, according to UF Health. Patients covered by United Healthcare's Medicare Advantage plans will no longer have access to physicians with UF Health St. Johns or Flagler Hospital as of Sept. 1. This does not impact Medicare Advantage plans or Dual Special Needs Plans (DSNP) at UF Health Jacksonville, UF Health Gainesville and UF Health Leesburg, according to United Healthcare. UF Health Physicians Chief Executive Officer Marvin Dewar said the providers are working with Medicaid patients to limit provider changes and find ways to keep costs low. “We are going to find a way to continue to see those Medicaid patients who need to be seen even though we are out of network,\" Dewar told First Coast News on Monday. \"For patients who have commercial United Insurance, it's a little more complicated. We are out of network for that.\" United Healthcare said it agreed to terms with UF Health regarding its Medicaid network, but claims UF Health never responded to finalize the contract on Aug. 31, disrupting access for 30,000 people enrolled in Medicaid plans. A lack of contract between the two entities will also affect patients enrolled in employer-sponsored commercial plans. UF Health's psychiatric hospital and UF Health Central Florida are under separate contracts and will remain on United Healthcare's network, officials said. UF students who have a United Healthcare plan through the school's student health insurance program will be able to continue receiving care at the UF Student Health Care Center and all UF Health facilities as they always have. \"Our commitment to placing patients at the heart of our efforts is unwavering, and we have put processes in place to minimize any disruption in care to the extent we can, but unfortunately United Healthcare has given us no other choice,\" said Dewar in a news release shared on Sunday. Dewar claims UF Health invited United Healthcare to meet and finalize an agreement, \"but they declined\" and \"insisted upon linking other products to the negotiations and abruptly imposing new conditions and language on items that had already been agreed upon,\" the release states. United Healthcare claims UF Health's last proposal was sent on Aug. 29, and included demands for a 30% price hike over the next two years, with more than 20% rate increase in the first year. On Aug. 30, United Healthcare sent back a counter that included additional rate increases on top of what was already proposed, according to United Healthcare officials. \"All of our proposals ensured UF Health would be reimbursed at rates similar to their peers in the market. UF Health never responded to our last proposal and allowed our contract to expire,\" United Healthcare said Sunday. The two entities had been negotiating for months over reimbursement rates, with UF Health arguing United Healthcare offered commercial rates below general inflation and \"far below annual costs.\" \"We deserve to be paid fairly and competitively for the care we provide to patients and the services we offer,\" Dewar said. \"Reasonable compensation is necessary for us to sustain our mission.\" Both UF Health and United Healthcare confirmed they are \"committed\" to continuing negotiations. \"However, we need UF Health to join us at the negotiating table,\" United Healthcare said. \"We are continuing to negotiate in good faith but we are waiting for the health plan to respond with a fair and sustainable offer to make that happen.

    "article_text": "Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IRWD): The Best Multibagger Penny Stock of 2025? Fatima Farooq September 1, 2024 6 min read IRWD We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Multibagger Penny Stocks of 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IRWD) stands against the other multibagger penny stocks. What Are Multibagger Stocks And How To Identify Them The term \"multibagger\" was coined by Peter Lynch in his book titled \"One Up On Wall Street\" to describe those stocks whose share prices increase several times more than an investor's original investment. Typically, a multibagger stock is one that can be expected to rise by 100% or more - a huge number that warrants the immense attention investors are giving to multibagger stocks today. Lynch himself is an American investor who managed the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments from 1977 to 1990. On multibagger stocks, Lynch noted in his book that these are typically fast-growing companies with the potential to yield significant returns over time. He thus considers investment portfolios that own a diverse variety of numerous stocks to be better placed to benefit from multibagger stocks and their growth, in stark contrast to those portfolios that are overly concentrated on investing in a few companies. When aiming to invest in multibagger stocks, many investors may wonder about where they can begin to look for these miracle-growth companies. The first few things to consider when looking for such stocks include a company's fundamentals, ability to act as a pioneer in its industry, and the size of the market it operates in. Generally, a multibagger stock is one that has solid financials, such as robust revenue growth and rising profits, and one that is driving innovation in its industry. Additionally, smaller innovative companies operating in a large addressable market also have the potential to be multibaggers in their fields. This is why many multibaggers are actually penny stocks that are just beginning to generate profits and returns for their investors. Is The Market Favorable For Penny Stocks? A lot of investors may feel skeptical when it comes to investing in penny stocks or any small or microcap company - for good reason. These stocks are incredibly volatile and make for very risky investments, seeing as their business is just starting out, and there's really not much to go on with respect to past fundamentals. However, risky investments often end up being highly rewarding, which is why investors who have a greater tolerance for risk in their portfolios generally tend to take a leap with penny stocks. Story continues The market at present also seems to be gearing up to prove beneficial for the overall growth of penny stocks and small-cap companies. According to Chris Retzler, Needham Small Cap Growth Fund's portfolio manager, while smaller companies are known to be volatile, the long-term outlook for these companies is presently positive. He believes that in the second half of 2024, we may see a broadening of the market, which is generally good for the economy and particularly good for smaller companies that have been underperforming recently. According to Retzler, one of the main reasons for the growth potential of smaller companies is that they're incredibly liquid. This factor, coupled with the fact that we are set to see money starting to flow out of bigger companies only to be redirected to smaller companies, means that many small companies and penny stocks may begin to see their share prices rise exponentially. Additionally, the general market expectation to have lower interest rates over the next 12 months is also favorable for penny stocks that don't really need a lot of money to flow into them before they begin to see higher stock prices and multiple expansion. Will all these developments, many investors are itching to get their hands on multibagger penny stocks, which is why we've compiled the following list. Our Methodology We used a stock screener to identify stocks trading under $5 with an upside potential of 100% and above to compile our list.

Also Read: A-Nishchit Index 2024: Most Indians Expect Greater Financial Uncertainty, Unsure Of Future Well-Being, Says Survey Why is it important to have a plan for Healthcare Costs? Planning for healthcare costs in retirement is crucial because many people often underestimate these expenses. It’s vital to understand what Medicare covers and doesn’t cover, how to prepare for recurring out-of-pocket costs and the concept of co-payment. As healthcare needs increase with age, these costs can make up a significant portion of a retiree’s monthly budget. Healthcare needs can be hard to guess because old age brings various challenges. So, having a personalised health plan is vital for peace of mind. Such a plan can help address these expenses and provide peace of mind. Tips To Build A Plan For Healthcare Costs After Retirement Include Healthcare Costs In Your Retirement Plan When planning for healthcare costs in retirement, consider several important factors, including accounting for existing medical conditions, the state of residence in retirement and any hereditary health risks. Make sure to include the healthcare costs of your spouse and children in your financial planning. Given the rising healthcare costs, creating a medical expenditure portfolio in advance is crucial. This portfolio should address family size, the age of family members, pre-existing conditions, and your family’s medical history. Choose The Right Health Insurance Coverage Health insurance is crucial to retirement planning, especially in India, where medical costs can be substantial. Choose a health insurance policy that provides comprehensive coverage, including long-term care. Assess various plans to ensure they meet your needs and offer adequate protection against potential medical expenses. Even with a healthy lifestyle and no major illnesses, routine check-ups, medical tests, and medications can still be costly.

Δ And at the center of this ecosystem, caught between traditional processes and the promise of technologically driven transformations, sits better healthcare payments. To understand how the evolution of healthcare billing and payments can remove frictions from the complexities faced by consumers and providers, as well as help streamline care delivery, PYMNTS’ CEO Karen Webster sat down with Tom Furr , CEO of PatientPay , and Ryan Zemmin , CEO of ClearGage , to discuss not just the Tuesday (Aug. 27) merger of their two companies, but also how digital innovations are enhancing the patient experience in healthcare billing and payments. “We are trying to digitize a pretty paper-based system, which is how most healthcare bills are sent out,” Furr said. “Forty-five percent of bills in healthcare are sent through paper statements, and outside of healthcare that’s not the norm.” He attributed the persistence of paper billing to the inherent complexity of healthcare payments and the challenge of transitioning long-established practices. And while the pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital solutions as healthcare providers faced pressure to maintain efficiency, the macro backdrop has left healthcare systems struggling amid rising costs and reduced government support.

Traditionally, paper statements have been the primary method for billing patients, but this approach is seen as outdated and inefficient. As healthcare businesses strive to optimize their collection processes, many are turning to digital payment solutions to improve both the speed and success of patient payments. The recent merger between PatientPay and ClearGage, as the two executives explained, represents a strategic alignment aimed at addressing the evolving needs of the healthcare payment landscape. The merger was initiated after both companies recognized their complementary strengths and the potential for greater impact through collaboration. “We were looking for a PayFac [payments facilitator] solution, and ClearGage had a registered PayFac,” Furr said. “They also had a solid eligibility and estimation solution that perfectly complemented our back-end billing and payments capabilities.” By combining resources, the two companies aim to create a unified platform that enhances the patient experience while providing healthcare providers with the tools they need to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The merger is expected to bring together a broad range of capabilities, including treatment estimation, eligibility verification, and streamlined billing processes, under a single roof. After all, one of the most significant barriers to timely payments in healthcare is the complexity of the billing process. Patients often struggle to understand their bills, especially when multiple charges from different providers are involved. Even those well-versed in the industry can find healthcare bills confusing. “The reality is, if you can give somebody the insight ahead of time to what the cost of a procedure might be, and then provide them a range of options to pay for that service, it gives them much more confidence in their ability to not only to get the service, but to be able to afford it,” Zemmin said. As healthcare payments continue to evolve, both Zemmin and Furr emphasized the importance of transparency and consistency in the patient experience , an approach that not only benefits patients but also helps healthcare providers increase appointment adherence and reduce the administrative burden of chasing payments. The Path Forward Despite the progress being made in the healthcare billing and payments space, inconsistency across healthcare providers remains a challenge. Furr highlighted the siloed nature of healthcare, where patients often encounter different payment systems and experiences with each provider they visit. To address this, PatientPay has developed a patient-centered approach, similar to PayPal, that allows patients to manage all their healthcare payments in one place, regardless of the provider. “Healthcare has traditionally been built around medical groups, with little consideration for the patient experience,” Furr explained. “We’ve taken a different approach, focusing on the patient as the center of the healthcare payment ecosystem.” Tactics, like integrating explanation of benefits (EOB) data with billing information, can make it easier for patients to see exactly what they owe and why. This transparency, combined with the convenience of digital payment options, has led to a 44% payment rate among users who log into the PatientPay platform, Furr said, with 70% of those payments made via mobile devices. Ultimately, reducing paper statements and offering digital payment options not only streamlines the billing process but can also improve cash flow for medical providers. And the future of healthcare payments lies in further simplifying and standardizing the billing process across providers. Zemmin and Furr both envision a system where patients are provided with clear, upfront estimates, and the billing process is seamless and consistent across all healthcare interactions. By leveraging technology and focusing on the patient experience, they believe the industry can move away from the traditional, fragmented approach to a more unified and efficient system. “Taking the complexity of healthcare billing and simplifying it so patients can understand it, then giving them the ability to pay it easily, that’s the key,” Furr said.

View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.64n5pgkep Doctors and nurses seldom learn in school how to tell a family that their loved one is not going to survive. Yet health care professionals face the immense burden of tragedy, illness and dying in an intensely stressful setting as a routine, ongoing part of their jobs. Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, research was documenting rampant stress and burnout among health care professionals. The effects of this crisis are widespread in the U.S. In 2022, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy raised concerns about the alarming levels of burnout in the health care community in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies show that if current trends continue, the U.S. will see a shortage of 1.1 million registered nurses, 3 million other health care workers and over 140,000 physicians by 2033 . A 2022 Mayo Clinic study reported that only 58% of physicians would choose to become a doctor again if offered a chance to revisit their career choice, dropping from 72% from just one year before. Contribution of a study participant who chose to remain anonymous. CORAL For nearly two decades, our research group – a team of physicians, researchers, creative arts therapists and writers – has focused on understanding the impact of work-related stress on health care workers. In our experience, almost every health care worker has a story about navigating the times when the weight of the profession is just too much to bear. To help address this issue, in 2019, with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, our team established the Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab, or CORAL. Our aim is to use creative arts therapy as an intervention to improve the well-being of health care professionals and to restore their sense of purpose in these demanding work environments. As physicians who have worked in critical care and emergency medicine for many years, we think that this incorporation of creativity in health care is vital. The nation’s health depends on the well-being of the health care workforce. We believe that incorporating creativity and the arts as a tool for building resiliency in health care workers could help shift the culture of emotional isolation that health care workers live in. ‘Dancing on a Tightrope’ − work from study participant about balancing a sick child and having to put on a brave face for family and work; feeling ashamed for being tired. CORAL A challenge long in coming We as health care workers push ourselves to the limits to learn new ways to enhance human health. The irony is that this often comes at the expense of our own physical, emotional and mental health. We learn to mask emotions and internalize all the negative events we see in health care. But that is unsustainable. In the 2000s, up to 80% of critical care nurses reported experiencing burnout or other forms of psychological distress . This was contributing to a high turnover rate, with 67% of nurses planning to leave their positions within three years . That was leading to a rise in health care costs, compassion fatigue among workers and diminished quality of care for patients. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, which intensified the stress on health care workers: 3 in 5 physicians reported burnout during the height of the omicron variant in 2022. A combination of higher job demands, workload, job complexity, job pressure and intensive working time during the COVID‐19 pandemic increased stress among health care professionals and led to emotional exhaustion . Satisfaction with work-life balance dropped from 46.1% in 2020 to 30.2% in 2021 . In the post-COVID-19 era, health care workers like us are at higher risk for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder . Burned-out health care professionals are unlikely to seek professional treatment and, as a result, tend to experience heightened levels of substance use, depression and suicidal thoughts. A researcher’s view on impostor syndrome and the culture of not showing your feelings. CORAL Art as a way forward In ancient Greece and Rome, participation in the arts was “prescribed” for people with depression or anxiety. Likewise, for centuries, tribal communities have used dance, music and art to facilitate physical and mental healing in individuals. Our focus at CORAL has been on teaching health care workers how to use art-making to effectively process trauma and develop coping mechanisms through expression and community. We invite our participants, who include doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists and researchers, to tap into their authentic vulnerabilities and share stories they would not normally tell by using pen and paper, paintbrushes, guitars, songwriting and movement. From 2020 to 2023, we carried out six cohorts of our 12-week clinical trial of creative arts therapy interventions involving health care professionals working at least half-time. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four creative arts therapy groups: art, music, dance/movement and writing, with 12 weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each. We measured participants’ levels of anxiety, depression, burnout, PTSD and job satisfaction through validated questionnaires and asked the same questions again after the conclusion of the intervention. We also measured those scores in a control group that did not take part in the intervention. CORAL has been providing arts therapy services for years, but the team’s recent study allows it to measure the healing power of art. The results were eye-opening. Study participants experienced less burnout and expressed a lower desire to leave their jobs. Burnout scores for anxiety, depression, PTSD and emotional exhaustion decreased by 28%, 36%, 26% and 12%, respectively, in the participants receiving the creative arts therapy intervention. These improvements remained up to one year after the conclusion of the program. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that creative arts therapy can be an effective tool for dealing with health care worker burnout across the globe. We believe that creative art therapy is effective because it allows these health care professionals to be imperfect – freedoms that can be healing in and of themselves. They can use these opportunities to speak the unspeakable through an art form, which becomes a vehicle to help explore and recover from trauma. This in turn can increase their tolerance for imperfection as well as helping them to feel grace and compassion for themselves and each other. It expands their emotional vocabularies and, in so doing, builds their resilience. A nurse’s reflection on constantly living in the extremes. CORAL Remembering what it means to be human Though the roles of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are often glorified through terms such as “superheroes” and “guardian angels,” in reality they are human beings who make mistakes and get exhausted too. The creative process invites them to remember what it means to be human, to be vulnerable. A health care professional picking up a paintbrush for the first time since kindergarten can explore feelings that have been suppressed, memories that have been buried – and even forgiveness for mistakes they may have held onto for years. ‘Rawness Contained,’ by a physician participant of the creative arts intervention study. CORAL One participant in the CORAL program wrote in their feedback: “When I am given space to unmask and show all sides of who I am, I am creative and engaged. I think more deeply and clearly. I am more willing to take the risks necessary to have breakthroughs. I am a better colleague, mentor, friend, partner, and scientist. When I feel safe and supported, I can be whole.” Art & Science Collide series. This article is part of Art & Science Collide , a series examining the intersections between art and science.

    "article_text": "August 27, 2024 California’s Health Care Transactions Review Law: Regulatory Revisions Effective Immediately Deborah Daccord , Kathryn Edgerton , Stephnie John , Pamela Polevoy Mintz - Health Care Viewpoints + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Effective immediately, on August 22, 2024, the Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) adopted revisions to the cost and market impact review (CMIR) regulations ( Revised Regulations ), which govern California’s pre-closing health care transaction review process. As discussed in our prior post , certain health care entities must provide OHCA with notice of a transaction at least 90 days prior to closing. The Revised Regulations, among other things: (1) expand who must file a notice; (2) narrow the applicability of the health care professional shortage area threshold; (3) clarify calculation of California-derived revenue; (4) clarify confidentiality of expedited review request documents; and (5) add a required attestation. We describe these revisions to the CMIR regulations in detail below. Who Must File a Material Change Transaction Notice (MCN) Expanded The Revised Regulations expand the applicability of the MCN filing requirement beyond a health care entity that is “a party to” a material change transaction to encompass a health care entity that is “a subject of” a material change transaction. Pursuant to the Revised Regulations, a health care entity is a subject of a material change transaction if the transaction will result in the transfer of the health care entity’s assets, control, responsibility, governance, or operations, in whole or in part to one or more entities. Thus, a health care entity not party to a transaction may be required to file an MCN with OHCA if it is a subject of a material change transaction. Further, the Revised Regulations expand the applicability of the MCN filing requirement to consider common deal structures where a non-health care entity is a party to a transaction with a health care entity. For example, prior to the revision, a physician organization with $10 million in revenue or California assets would not be required to file an MCN if the counterparty to the transaction was not a health care entity (e.g., venture fund). However, post-revision, the physician organization would meet the threshold to file an MCN if the venture fund owned or controlled a health care entity with $25 million in revenue or California assets. Applicability of Primary Health Care Professional Shortage Area Threshold Narrowed Prior to the revision of the regulations, a health care entity met the threshold for filing an MCN if the health care entity was located in a primary health care professional shortage area (HPSA). Although it is simple to determine whether certain types of health care providers (e.g., hospitals, physician practices) are located in HPSAs, questions arise regarding how to determine whether other types of health care providers are located in HPSAs (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, health insurers). The Revised Regulations bring welcomed clarity that the HPSA threshold applies to providers and fully integrated delivery systems only. California-Derived Revenue Clarified The Revised Regulations clarified that for the purposes of determining whether a transaction meets the circumstances for filing only, “annual California-derived revenue” means revenue from the provision of health care services in California. Clarity is still needed as to what the provision of health care services in California means with respect to certain types of health care entities (e.g., laboratories). Confidentiality of Expedited Review Request Documents Clarified Pursuant to the CMIR regulations, a health care provider may request expedited review of its MCN if one or more of the parties to the transaction is in severe financial distress, including grave risk of immediate business failure. The Revised Regulations make clear that the process to request confidentiality of documents submitted in support of an MCN apply to documents submitted in support of a request for expedited review as well. Further, if a request for confidentiality is denied, even partially, the submitting health care entity may withdraw its request for expedited review. This clarification is particularly important because of the extremely sensitive business nature of the information required to support a request for expedited review. Attestation Added The Revised Regulations add a requirement that a health care entity attest, under the penalty of perjury, that it used reasonable diligence to ascertain the information required for the MCN. Practically, this means that the parties to the transaction must coordinate and share information early in the diligence process to ensure that each party has the information necessary to determine whether an MCN is required, and if required, that each party can attest that it acted with reasonable diligence to ascertain the required information. Final Considerations Although the Revised Regulations bring some welcome clarity, many questions abound. For example, how will OHCA determine the meaning of “related health care services”? How will OHCA judge whether a prior transaction is “similar to” the proposed transaction? Buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders entering into transactions involving health care entities with California revenue or assets will need to continue to assess the impact of the CMIR process and plan well in advance of closing before proceeding.

Jim Jordan On Kamala Harris's Healthcare Stance: 'She Wants To Take Your Private Healthcare Away Entirely!' Shivdeep Dhaliwal August 25, 2024 2 min read Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), recently expressed criticism of Kamala Harris’s healthcare policies on X, he alleged that she would take away private healthcare entirely. What Happened : On Thursday, Jordan posted his disapproval of Harris’s healthcare plans, comparing them unfavorably to those of former President Barack Obama . He stated, “President Obama once said, \"If you like your healthcare, you can keep it.\" Then countless Americans lost their healthcare. Kamala Harris is going a step further. She wants to take your private healthcare away entirely!” Don’t Miss: Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today? Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average? Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. The post comes in the wake of Harris’s endorsement by Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden’s exit from the presidential race. Harris, a former California Senator and San Francisco district attorney, has been discussing her stance on key issues, including healthcare. Why It Matters : Harris recently presented her economic agenda in North Carolina, emphasizing the expansion of Medicare negotiations to include all Americans and pledging to lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs. She highlighted her past efforts as California's attorney general in combating price inflation and vowed to eliminate medical debt, reported The Hill. Harris also criticized former President Donald Trump's stance on the Affordable Care Act and Medicare, asserting that his policies would undo the progress made. Harris stated, “We’ve come too far to let that happen.” Harris’s views on healthcare and other key political topics are significantly different from those of the Republican nominee, former President Trump. As reported in a Benzinga article , Harris’s potential presidency could result in higher corporate taxes , impact consumer staples, and boost the solar energy sector. Did You Know?

Philstar.com / File MANILA, Philippines — The country’s health care spending rose by 17 percent to P1.44 trillion in 2023 from P1.23 trillion in 2022 amid rising medical costs. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the total health expenditure accounted for 5.9 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, higher than the 5.6 percent share to GDP in 2022. The PSA said every Filipino spent an average of P11,083 for health care last year, 8.3 percent higher than the P10,238 expense in 2022. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist Michael Ricafort said in an email that the growth in total health expenditure and per capita health spending was higher than the average economic growth of 5.5 percent in 2023, “largely due to higher prices or inflation on medical or health care in the country.” Inflation averaged six percent in 2023, higher than the 5.8 percent in 2022. Among the health care financing schemes last year, household out-of-pocket payments contributed the highest to the current health expenditure at 44.4 percent. Government schemes and compulsory contributory health care financing schemes came in next with a 42.6 percent share, while voluntary health care payment schemes accounted for 13 percent. Moody’s Analytics economist Sarah Tan said in an email that out-of-pocket expenses by households tend to contribute the largest share to total health expenditure in the Philippines partly due to the lack of access to private medical insurance, with only around three in five Filipinos insured, plus the lackluster government spending. “However, we expect the role of the government to become more prominent moving forward as efforts are underway to increase their support,” she said. She cited the $450 million loan approved by the Asian Development Bank in December last year to help the government scale up its health care reform under the Build Universal Health Care Program as part of efforts being undertaken. She also said the increased allocation of funds to health care should see a top-up in government expenditure this year. “If the budget is fully utilized, the category comprising government schemes and compulsory contributory health care financing scheme will gradually take over as the largest contributor,” Tan said.

    "article_text": "News August 22, 2024 by Juliana Agbo ‘Competitive healthcare boosts development’ Experts in the health sector have advocated a competitive healthcare system to enhance regulatory capacity to ensure effective healthcare regulation and boost development. This was made known at the pre-summit webinar in preparation for the 30th Nigerian Economic Summit (#NES30), organised by Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), with the theme: “Strengthening Healthcare Regulatory Bodies in Nigeria”. National Coordinator of the Unlocking Healthcare Value-Chain Initiative, Dr. Abdu Mukhtar, noted healthcare contributes three to four per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a stark contrast to 17 per cent in United States and 15-20 per cent in Europe. He underscored the necessity of a robust healthcare system for national stability and competitiveness. Mukhtar outlined the government’s healthcare reform plan, anchored on effective governance, improved population health outcomes, unlocking healthcare value chain, and enhancing health security, particularly in pandemic preparedness. The plan, covering 2022-2026, includes cross-cutting themes as regulation, financing, and digitalisation. He discussed the Presidential Initiative to unlock healthcare value chain, launched in October 2023. This initiative involves 20 key regulatory agencies and five ministries and aims to increase local pharmaceutical production, reduce medical tourism, and attract investment. African leaders shift focus to healthcare Foundation advocates improved primary healthcare Centring care for maximal healthcare Ekiti State Commissioner for Health and Human Services, , and Steering Committee member of NESG’s Health Policy Commission (HPC), Dr. Oyebanji Filani, noted the role of a strong healthcare system in national development. Read Also: ‘Our goal is for every Nigerian to access adequate healthcare’ He noted the impact well-resourced regulatory bodies can have on public safety, investor confidence, and healthcare quality, saying addressing challenges can foster an environment conducive to healthcare development, which aids economic advancement. Deputy Registrar of Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), Dr. Victor K. Gbenro discussed MDCN’s role in regulating medical education and upholding standards in medical training and practice. She also addressed resource gaps that hinder the council’s ability to double the number of medical graduates. Director General of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, noted importance of local pharmaceutical manufacturing. She said manufacturing 70 per cent of pharmaceuticals locally and importing 30 per cent would allow for better monitoring and adherence to good manufacturing practices. Healthcare Quality Specialist, Dr. Ajibike Oyewumi, emphasised the importance of enhancing regulatory capacity through training, technology adoption, and establishing strong public-private partnerships.

    "article_text": "WHO records 1,940 health care attacks in Ukraine since war with Russia began So far this year, 34 health care workers and patients have died in attacks. By Mary Kekatos August 19, 2024, 1:48 PM The World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday it has confirmed 1,940 attacks on health care in Ukraine since the war with Russia began in February 2022. This is the highest number of attacks the WHO has ever recorded in any humanitarian emergency to date, according to the agency. During the course of the war, 86% of these attacks have targeted health care facilities, usually with heavy weapons, according to the WHO. The agency said attacks on health facilities have \"intensified significantly\" since December 2023 and are now occurring nearly every day. MORE: Ukraine destroys 3rd key bridge, threatening to cut off Russian troops, amid incursion, Russian military bloggers say \"In 2024, we are observing a lot of double-tap attacks,\" Dr. Jarno Habicht, the WHO representative in Ukraine, said in a statement. \"Now we have more shelling of civilian infrastructure than before. We are losing colleagues -- health-care workers, nurses, doctors, paramedics.\" \"This year, many more health-care workers have also been injured than before. According to WHO data, first responders and health transportation are 3 times more likely to suffer harm from attacks compared to other health-care personnel,\" the statement continued. Rubble and debris remain in a hospital destroyed by Russian shelling, Aug. 11, 2024, in Myrnohrad, Ukraine. Global Images Ukraine via Getty The WHO said so far this year, 34 health care workers and patients have been killed in health care attacks compared to 24 deaths in 2023. Additionally, 229 people have been injured in health care attacks so far this year, which is higher than the figures reported in both 2022 and 2023. According to the WHO, every fourth attack on health care this year has resulted in injuries.

This war is affecting every person across Ukraine -- including health-care professionals and providers -- in diverse and profound ways.\" Last month, Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv -- one of the most well-respected children's hospitals in the country -- was damaged when five Ukrainian cities fell under attack. At least two people were killed in the attack on the hospital, including one female physician, and at least seven children were injured, according to officials. In November 2022, a newborn baby was killed when a missile strike hit a maternity hospital in the town of Vilniansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the local mayor told ABC News at the time. MORE: Ukrainian soldiers, engineers add metal netting to US tanks and vehicles to protect against Russian drones For communities that are near the frontlines, access to health care has been severely impacted, increasing the risk of severe illness and death among residents. Since February 2022, an average of 200 ambulances have been damaged or destroyed every year in shelling attacks, according to the WHO. The WHO noted that Ukrainian health authorities have been responding to areas that are facing health needs and challenges but there are still gaps to fill. The WHO said it has distributed approximately 3,750 tons of medical supplies, including ambulances, medicines and generators, throughout the country. \"Ultimately, the healthcare workforce of Ukraine are genuine heroes,\" Habicht said. \"Despite ongoing attacks, despite all the challenges, they continue saving people's lives.\" Related Topics Russia Sponsored Content by Taboola Government shutdown updates: Senate vote marks step towards ending federal shutdown Nov 9, 11:48 PM Hurricane Melissa live updates: No official death toll in Jamaica Oct 30, 10:54 PM Government shutdown updates: House to return after Senate passes funding bill 1 hour ago Justice temporarily pauses order requiring Trump admin to fully fund SNAP Nov 7, 9:59 PM ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Many current health care proposals shift control and decision-making to the government—and do not provide what Americans want. Americans support plans that lower costs, give them access to high quality of care, and put them in the driver’s seat. Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Health care remains a top priority for Americans (69 percent of U.S. voters), REF who are concerned about cost, access REF and choice. REF Many current health care proposals shift control and decision-making to the government—and do not provide what Americans want. A majority of Americans oppose a plan that would, under a Medicare for All health care system, decrease access, increase costs, and decrease choices by: REF Creating “[l]onger wait times to receive health care treatment” (82 percent) Imposing “[m]andatory waiting periods for care” (79 percent) Providing “[f]ewer options for health care providers…and treatments” (76 percent) “Elimin[ating] Medicare” (75 percent) “Increasing taxes” (69 percent) “Elimin[ating] Medicaid” (68 percent) “Elimin[ating] private insurance” (62 percent) Public opinion is in flux, and malleable based on how the debate is framed. According to pollster Dr. Whit Ayres, founder and president of the North Star Opinion Research Corporation: “The numbers that you are going to see…are not in any way cut in stone. They are just a starting point for talking about health care, and they will move all over the place depending on which side is more persuasive in getting its points across. … [If those] in Congress leave the field without concrete health policy alternatives, forfeiting that game only hands victory to those who are campaigning for a single-payer plan.” REF Americans support plans that lower costs, give them access to high quality of care, and put them in the driver’s seat. REF Americans agree: America’s health care system should be the best in the world. It should offer lower costs and higher-quality care than it does today. (97 percent) Health care policy should empower people—not government bureaucrats or insurance companies—to make decisions for their themselves and their own families. (94 percent) Almost all Americans are likely to support a health care plan that increases access, lowers costs, and improves choice. They want a plan that will: “Encourage health care innovations and options” (96 percent) “Use proven tools to help people with pre-existing conditions get care without raising costs for other Americans” (96 percent) “Lower health insurance premiums for individuals by as much as 32 percent” (94 percent) “Allow more people access to personalized private coverage over government-run health programs like Medicare” (85 percent) Authors Elizabeth Fender Senior Brand Advisor, Operations Marie Fishpaw Former Visiting Fellow, Domestic Policy Read Full Report Heritage Offers Activate your 2025 Membership By activating your membership you'll become part of a committed group of fellow patriots who stand for America's Founding principles.

    "article_text": "Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways It’s a distant memory now, but Donald Trump publicly supported single-payer health care. Vice President Kamala Harris did, too. Neither candidate backs the idea now. This easily accessible history didn’t stop Trump from attacking Harris on Thursday as if she still supports single-payer — with the former president arguing that it would be bad to do so. During a rambling press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump said of Harris, “She cosponsored legislation to abolish very popular private health insurance, which 150 [million] Americans rely on, dumping everyone onto inferior socialist government run health care systems with rationing and deadly wait times, while massively raising your taxes. She wants to take away your private health care. “It’s the best health care in the world,” he continued, adding, “You’re all going to be thrown into a communist system … You’re going to be thrown into a system where everybody gets health care.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement None of this is true. Harris did previously support eliminating private health insurance in favor of enacting “Medicare for All,” or a universal health insurance program. She has since backed away from this idea. While Harris has not offered her health care plan yet, her spokesperson recently told NBC News , “The VP will not push single payer as president.” The United States’ health care system is exceptional, but not because it provides the best care in the world. Americans pay far more for health care than residents of other high-income countries — like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Australia — and experience the worst health outcomes. Our life expectancy is lower; infant, maternal, and avoidable deaths are all higher. While taxes would increase under a Medicare for All-style system, studies show Americans would save money in the aggregate. Today, more than eight percent of Americans are uninsured, and tens of millions are underinsured , meaning they have insurance but cannot afford to access the health services they need. On a financial level, forgoing medical care ultimately creates larger health expenses. Insurers also regularly deny patients’ care , because it helps pad their profits. Trump claimed Thursday that if the U.S. were to have a universal health care system, “You wait for your doctor, like 10 months, 12 months, 11 months, you gotta see some of these plans, how they work in other countries, it’s disgraceful.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Wait times in the U.S. are already long — not the absolute worst among wealthy countries, but poor nonetheless. Trump reiterated at the end of his health care rant that Harris “could change” her position. “She’s changed on everything,” he said. So has Trump. Years ago, he was a full-blown proponent of single-payer health care. “If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. I mean, it’s no good. So I’m very liberal when it comes to health care,” Trump told Larry King in 1999 . “I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He added that health care should be considered “an entitlement.” In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve , Trump wrote that America should “reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.” He wrote favorably about the Canadian single-payer system: “Administrative costs across America make up 25 percent of the health care dollar, which is two-and-a-half times the cost of health care administration in Canada. Doctors might be paid less than they are now, as is the case in Canada, but they would be able to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork. The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans.” Trump did not support a single-payer health care system during his 2016 campaign, but he still defended the idea in a Republican debate. “As far as single payer, it works in Canada,” he said. “It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age.” More from Rolling Stone Democrats Taunt Trump At Trump Tower Chicago Ahead of Convention Conservatives Are Already Working to Enact Their Project 2025 Agenda Tammy Duckworth: Trump Is 'Despicable' for Denigrating Veterans Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "EL PASO, Texas ( KTSM ) – A groundbreaking ceremony for a new Veterans Affairs health care center will be held on Wednesday, Aug. 28 at Fort Bliss, 18549 Heavy Medics. New VA health care center at Fort Bliss takes major step forward Last December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded a $617,499,000 contract to Clark Construction Group, Smith Group and HKS to construct a 492,995 gross-square-foot health care center (HCC) in El Paso, according to a press release sent by the VA. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “This historic investment in VA Health Care marks an exciting new chapter for Southwest Texas and Southern New Mexico Veterans,” Froy Garza, the El Paso VA Health Care System executive director said. “The construction of this state-of-the-art health care facility will build upon our commitment to meet the health care needs of those who have given so much in service to our country.” The VA said with a new central energy plant, the “energy-efficient” health care facility is projected to provide enhanced outpatient services to over 54,000 Veterans each year. This includes primary care, mental health, specialty care, ambulatory surgery and ancillary services. “The construction of the El Paso VA Health Care Center is the result of VA’s efforts to improve planning and implementation of a design-build project,” said Michael D. Brennan, PhD., VA Office of Construction and Facilities Management executive director. “Most importantly, upon completion, the facility will service and improve access to world-class health care for Veterans in the El Paso area.” The new El Paso HCC is being built on an approximately 36-acre site on Fort Bliss near the recently relocated William Beaumont Army Medical Center, according to the VA.

    "article_text": "This commentary is by Leslie J. Matthews, co-chair of the Vermont Workers’ Center campaign team. On August 12, the Green Mountain Care Board approved a 19.8% increase for BlueCross BlueShield premiums on Vermont Health Connect individual plans, along with a 22.8% increase for small group plans. This is the third year in a row with double-digit rate increases. As a longtime member of the Vermont Workers’ Center, I’ve been helping to lead the “health care is a human right” campaign since 2008. In 2011, the Vermont Workers’ Center and our partners were instrumental in gaining passage of Vermont’s landmark universal health care law that remains in state statute, with its promise unfilled. As a unionized state employee for 18 years (recently retired) I benefited from a mostly publicly funded, comprehensive health insurance program. Before landing a job with the state, though, I experienced the kinds of struggles to afford health care that I hear about when I speak with people around the state. I joined the Vermont Workers’ Center’s “health care is a human right” campaign because I know what it’s like to struggle to afford care, and because I feel a moral imperative to work to extend what state employees have — or better — to everyone in the state. In the 10 years since the governor and legislature abandoned universal health care, Vermont’s health care crisis has grown exponentially worse. The costs for care and insurance premiums continue to skyrocket. Nine out of 14 hospitals in the state ended the last fiscal year in the red , with the threat of hospital bankruptcy closures imminent. Close to 30,000 Vermonters were kicked off Medicaid from April to December of 2023 , forcing many to buy into high-deductible, expensive, marketplace insurance plans. Many must simply go without health care or insurance because they can’t afford it. Everyone, from policy experts and consultants, to legislators, health care providers, and the average person seeking care, agrees the system is failing us. In the words of consultant Dr. Bruce Hamory , “the health care system in Vermont, unfortunately, is badly broken.” While bold action is needed, meaningful political leadership is severely lacking. During this year’s legislative session, the House Health Care Committee advanced a significant and long-overdue proposal to substantially expand Medicaid, while increasing reimbursements to providers to ensure that hospitals and medical practices remain solvent. The bill was introduced with the support of 80 representatives and 14 senators. Listening to testimony before the House health care committee last winter, I heard a wide range of constituencies voice their support for the concept, including representatives of the Scott administration, provider organizations and patient advocates. I listened to gut-wrenching stories from health care providers who can’t afford health care for themselves, or who worry about their ability to stay in practice and care for patients. I heard Vermonters speak about the stress of living with constant uncertainty about whether they will be able to remain on Medicaid, or afford increasing insurance costs, while working to support their families. In the end, this effort to expand Medicaid was too ambitious for legislative leadership, who declined to include even a study of Medicaid expansion in the state budget. An updated study of the economics of publicly financed, universal health care was never on the table. We are tired of the excuses for a lack of action that is long overdue. The excuse we hear repeatedly for why we cannot move forward with universal, publicly financed health care is that “we can’t afford it”. Yet this week the Green Mountain Care Board approved double-digit increases in private health insurance premiums for the third year in a row. This is completely unaffordable for the vast majority of Vermonters, and unsustainable for our health care system. According to an analysis commissioned by the governor in 2014 (see Table 19), universal health care would actually have increased income for 93% of Vermont families, by shifting health care spending from private insurance premiums to tax-funded public financing, while controlling costs. What does it mean to say “we can’t afford” universal health care? It means we willingly accept that Vermonters will be forced to delay care, suffer, and even die due to lack of access to health care. The refusal to act in the face of this crisis may seem abstract, but in fact, it amounts to policy violence that causes unnecessary suffering. So many of us are affected by this health care crisis or are outraged by the moral failure of a system that rations health care according to ability to pay. Our collapsing health care system necessitates an all-hands-on-deck moment — we need a sustained effort of people impacted by this crisis to compel our elected government to respond to the will of the people. On Monday, September 23rd, we’re holding a rally and poor people’s trial of the health care system on the steps of the Vermont Supreme Court.

Since Independence, India has made remarkable strides in improving healthcare accessibility and availability, significantly reducing mortality rates and enhancing overall well-being ( arogya ). National initiatives have effectively controlled deadly diseases, boosting life expectancy from 32 years in 1947 to 70.19 years in 2022, marking a 100% increase over 75 years. Since 2014, the health sector in India has shown exponential improvement under Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s leadership. Today, India is at the forefront of global health care transformation, propelled by substantial investments and a steadfast commitment to enhancing health care access and affordability. Economic growth, supportive government policies, robust pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, and expanding middle class have been pivotal in transforming India into a rapidly evolving health care hub. Healthcare (Photo:Fortis Healthcare) The Arogya Bharat initiative, part of Ayushman Bharat, focuses on establishing Health and Wellness Centers (HWCs) and implementing the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). HWCs provide comprehensive primary health care, including maternal and child health, management of non-communicable diseases, and mental health support, easing the burden on higher-level facilities. PM-JAY, the world’s largest health insurance scheme, offers up to ₹ 5 lakh per family annually for secondary and tertiary care, reaching 56% of eligible beneficiaries and providing free treatment to millions. India's National Health Mission (NHM) since 2013 has enhanced health care delivery by improving immunization, maternal health outcomes, and disease control. Initiatives like the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI), National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) further demonstrate India's commitment to enhancing health care accessibility, affordability, and quality nationwide. India is rapidly emerging as a global leader in health care R&D innovation, significantly contributing to global health by making critical medicines affordable and accessible. The country ranks third worldwide as a producer of drugs and pharmaceuticals by volume, exporting to around 200 countries/territories. Through cutting-edge research and development, India is discovering new drugs and ensuring that essential medications are within reach for diverse populations. The Indian pharmaceutical industry is a powerhouse in vaccine production, supplying 62% of the global demand. It is a leading supplier of vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) used primarily against tuberculosis, and measles. Notably, at least 70% of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) vaccines, as per the essential immunisation schedule, are sourced from India, highlighting the country’s crucial role in global health initiatives. Additionally, India has made significant contributions to Ayush medicine alongside allopathic medicine. India's pharmaceutical exports, averaging $2-3 billion monthly, underscore its significant economic impact. The nation’s commitment to affordable drug development and expansive global distribution has positioned it as a key player in international health care. By continually enhancing its R&D capabilities, India is driving innovations that improve health outcomes and ensure that critical medicines are available to populations worldwide, fostering a healthier future for all. India's digital health landscape is transforming health care delivery through technological advancements and government initiatives like the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). Launched in 2020, NDHM aims to provide every Indian with a unique health ID and access to their health records, improving efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency. Telemedicine platforms such as eSanjeevani have expanded access to health care, allowing patients in remote areas to consult with doctors virtually. This has enhanced the healthcare ecosystem, increased efficiency, and improved doctor-patient connectivity. Digital health tools have also facilitated better Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) maintenance. We are also driving innovations in diagnostics, medical devices, health management systems, and mobile health applications. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data is pivotal in disease prediction, early diagnosis, personalised treatment plans, and optimising healthcare resources, leading to improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency. The health care sector in India is increasingly becoming a significant source of employment, providing opportunities across various domains such as health care services, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, and research. With a current workforce exceeding six million in 2024, the sector anticipates adding over 6.3 million new jobs by 2030. This growth is driven by an increasing population and health care demands, support roles for doctors, nurses, technicians, pharmacists, health care administrators, and researchers. The rise of health care startups and technological advancements further boosts employment in fields like telemedicine, health analytics, and digital health solutions. This growth not only addresses the country's health care demands but also contributes to economic development by generating employment opportunities at various skill levels, from frontline health care workers to highly specialised medical professionals and researchers. There is great potential to harness India’s capabilities further in healthcare. Under the Union minister for health and family welfare, JP Nadda, the sector is set to see some remarkable initiatives. This year, along with a 12.59% increase in the health ministry’s budget to ₹ 90,658.63 crore and ₹ 3,200 crore allocated to the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, a complete exemption of tax duty on three vital cancer medicines has also been announced. As way forward, addressing the shortage of health care professionals through training programmes and incentivising service in underserved areas is critical. Strengthening regulatory frameworks and implementing accreditation systems will ensure consistent quality of care across public and private health care providers. Investing in health care research and promoting innovation will be pivotal in addressing emerging health challenges, and raising collaboration between academia, industry and government to drive medical advancements. Expanding health insurance coverage and enhancing existing schemes like PM-JAY will provide comprehensive financial protection against all health expenses, reducing the economic burden on families. India's health care sector stands poised for continued growth and transformation, driven by a commitment to innovation, accessibility, and affordability. With sustained efforts and collaborative initiatives, India is set to consolidate its position as a global leader in healthcare excellence, ensuring a healthier and more prosperous future for its citizens and beyond.

HealthDay News — For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), wearable devices are associated with higher AF-specific health care use and informal health care resource use, according to a study published in the August 6 issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association . Lindsey Rosman, PhD, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and colleagues conducted a retrospective, propensity-matched study of patients with AF to compare AF-specific health care use and informal health care use between wearable users and nonusers during a 9-month period. Data were included for 172 patients with AF, 83 of whom used a wearable. The researchers found that wearable users reported higher rates of symptom monitoring and preoccupation than nonusers, and reported more AF treatment concerns. Overall, 20 percent of wearable users experienced anxiety, and in response to notifications of irregular rhythm, they always contacted their doctor. Significantly greater AF-specific health care use was seen among wearable users than nonusers after matching, including significantly higher rates of electrocardiograms, echocardiograms/transesophageal echocardiogram, and ablation. The likelihood of using informal health care resources was also significantly higher for wearable users vs nonusers. “These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the potential effects of wearable devices on patients’ health care use and psychological well-being, as well as the downstream effects on providers, clinic workflow, and health care expenditures,” the authors write. Several authors disclosed ties to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Abstract/Full Text"

    "article_text": "Freedom from dependence, a new era in health care Premium The landscape of Indian health care has undergone a seismic shift Updated - August 15, 2024 02:07 am IST Dr. Preetha Reddy READ LATER SEE ALL Remove ‘India is now recognised globally for its world-class medical services’ | Photo Credit: Getty Images India’s Independence Day, on August 15, is a time for reflection on the nation’s remarkable journey across various sectors. One of the most profound transformations we have witnessed, is in the health-care sector. From a time when Indians had to travel to the western world for advanced medical treatments, to today, where India stands as a global health-care hub, we have come a long way. This evolution not only signifies our medical prowess but also our economic resilience. Until the 1980s, it was a common practice for affluent Indians to seek advanced medical treatments abroad, especially in western countries. This dependency was not only a drain on our financial resources but also a testament to the gaps in our health-care system. However, the landscape of Indian health care has undergone a seismic shift. Today, India is recognised globally for its world-class medical services, attracting patients from over 147 countries. This transformation is a testament to the relentless efforts of our medical professionals, the strategic vision of our policymakers, and the resilience of our health-care institutions. Independence Day India, a beacon of democracy The seductive trap of the civil services The trial that progressed rapidly towards Independence Heal in India, a global care hub The shift from medical tourism to being a preferred medical destination has had significant economic implications. According to recent studies, India saves billions in foreign exchange annually as fewer Indians need to travel abroad for medical treatments. The cost of treatment in India is significantly lower than in western countries, with the same, if not better, quality of care. This has not only helped in retaining valuable foreign exchange but has also positioned India as a cost-effective health-care destination. Moreover, the inflow of international patients contributes to the economy, creating jobs and fosters growth in related sectors such as hospitality, transportation, and pharmaceuticals. The influx of medical tourists is estimated to generate revenues of over $9 billion annually, further boosting the nation’s economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s clarion call of “Heal in India” is more than a slogan. It is a vision for positioning India as a global health-care leader. With a concerted effort, India has made significant strides in medical tourism, though there is still room for growth when compared to our neighbouring countries. Our state-of-the-art hospitals, skilled medical professionals, and cost-effective treatments have made India a preferred destination for medical tourists. Patients from across the globe come to India for a wide range of treatments, from complex cardiac surgeries to advanced oncology. India’s health-care system has emerged as a beacon of hope and excellence. This is not just about treating ailments; it is about providing holistic care that addresses the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of patients. Our health-care professionals are not merely doctors and nurses; they are healers who embody compassion, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Challenges and opportunities While we celebrate our achievements, we must also acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. India continues to import a significant portion of its medical devices, which adds to the cost of treatments and impacts our self-reliance. According to a study by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), India imported medical devices worth over $6.24 billion in 2021-22. However, the “Make in India” initiative is gaining momentum, with increasing investments in the domestic production of medical devices. This shift not only aims to reduce dependency on imports but also to enhance the affordability and accessibility of medical care. The journey towards self-reliance in health care is ongoing, and the progress we have made is a testament to our collective resilience and innovation. The burgeoning medical device industry in India is a symbol of our growing capability to produce high-quality, affordable health-care solutions. This progress is a clarion call to our young innovators and entrepreneurs to step into the health-care arena and drive further advancements. As we look to the future, it is imperative to inspire Indian youth to consider careers in health care. The health-care sector is not just about medical treatments; it is about service to humanity and nation-building. The purpose of health care is universal, transcending boundaries and touching lives in profound ways. By choosing a career in health care, young Indians can contribute to the nation’s growth and make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions, across the world. The youth of India hold the keys to our future. Their energy, creativity, and passion are essential in driving the next wave of innovations in health care. By embracing careers in this sector, they can play a pivotal role in transforming our health-care system into one that is not only self-reliant but also a global leader. Health care offers a unique opportunity to blend science, technology, and compassion to create a lasting impact on society. Celebrating Independence with a vision As we celebrate India’s Independence Day, let us take pride in the strides we have made in health care. From being a nation dependent on the West for medical treatments to becoming a global health-care destination, our journey is nothing short of remarkable. Let us continue to build on this foundation, striving for excellence and self-reliance in health care. The journey from dependence to independence in health care is a microcosm of India’s broader path to self-reliance and excellence. It embodies the spirit of innovation, resilience, and service that defines our nation. In this spirit of independence and progress, let us commit to a future where India is not just a healer for its people but for the world. Let us strive for a health-care system that is inclusive, innovative, and inspiring. Together, we can build a health-care system that is a source of pride for every Indian and a beacon of hope for the world. Jai Hind!

This partnership aims to improve these figures and enhance health care access for millions. Life Expectancy in Bangladesh Life expectancy in Bangladesh has increased significantly, from 65.6 years in 2000 to 73.1 years in 2021. This compares favorably to Southeast Asia’s overall life expectancy, which rose by 5.01 years from 63.4 years to 68.4 years in the same period. Bangladesh has improved the accessibility of health care, but there is more to be done. Smiling Sun Clinics Smiling Sun Clinics has been a prominent part of health care in Bangladesh since 1997. It is the world’s largest nongovernmental organization (NGO) network of maternal and child health clinics globally. The NGO Health Services Delivery Project supports the Smiling Sun network , allowing millions of Bangladeshis to access health care. This network is composed of 25 NGOs and 399 clinics that are located in both urban and rural areas. The services provided include emergency obstetric care and maternity care. More than 10,000 part-time clinics also operate and refer clients to full-time clinics if they believe more care is required. This allows community health workers to offer personal health care to their communities and helps to ensure universal health coverage. The World Bank and USAID’s Roles in Health Care in Bangladesh By 2025, one in every 10 people in Bangladesh will be 60 or older and this figure is expected to rise to one in five by 2050. In response, the World Bank organized a workshop in August 2023 to bring together health experts, stakeholders and policymakers. The goal is to foster progress in shaping health care to better address the needs of an aging population in Bangladesh. Additionally, in August 2023, the World Bank approved $200 million to support primary health care in the country. This pledge benefited the Urban Health, Nutrition and Population Project, which will help 2.5 million children and provide 250,000 pregnant women with at least four antenatal checkups. Furthermore, in 2019, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programs in Bangladesh provided more than 46 million health service consultations. Technological improvements included developing solutions to detect deadly drug-resistant TB within two hours and digitizing national health information. UNICEF’s Role UNICEF’s immunization programs in Bangladesh have reached 3.5 million newborns with the Measles and rubella vaccine (MR1). Additionally, its nutrition interventions have improved the health and growth of countless children. The organization also helps strengthen health care infrastructure and train health workers to enhance service delivery for vulnerable populations. – Amy Fox Amy is based in Birmingham, UK and focuses on Good News and Global Health for The Borgen Project.

Article Insights Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton are most popular: within Compliance topic(s) Listen to this post As we previously reported here , nearly all health care facilities in California will soon be required to increase the minimum wage paid to health care workers, ranging anywhere from $18 per hour up to $23 per hour depending on the type of health care facility. The increased health care minimum wage was set to go into effect on June 1, 2024; however, on May 31, 2024, Governor Newsom signed SB 828 , which provided for a one month delay, to July 1, 2024. Now, there is a further delay after Governor Newsom and state legislators came to an agreement to delay implementation of the increased health care minimum wage until October 15, 2024 (possibly until January 1, 2025) upon passage of AB 159. On June 29, 2024, Governor Newsom signed AB 159 , which indicates the increased health care minimum wage would go into effect on October 15, 2024, contingent on the state bringing in at least 3% more revenue from July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 than the Newsom administration expected at the time of the enactment of the 2024 Budget Act. If the state does not reach that benchmark, the wage increases will take effect the sooner of January 1, 2025 or 15 days after the Department of Health Care Services has notified the Legislature that it initiated the data retrieval necessary to implement an increase to hospital quality assurance fee revenues for the program period beginning on January 1, 2025 (the \"notification date\"). The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement recently released FAQs , which provide further information, including which health care employers and employees may be affected by the health care minimum wage increase. Pursuant to AB 159 , each wage increase will occur as follows: Health care facilities that employ 10,000 or more full-time employees: Covered health care employees must be paid at least $23/hour beginning on October 15, 2024, or the sooner of January 1, 2025 or 15 days after the notification date (depending on what transpires with revenue and funding as noted above). Thereafter, the minimum wage will increase by $1/hour on July 1 each year, ultimately reaching $25/hour on July 1, 2026. Starting January 1, 2028, the minimum wage will increase annually (on January 1) at the lesser of 3.5% or the Consumer Price Index. Hospitals with a high or elevated governmental payor mix, and rural independent health care facilities: Beginning on October 15, 2024, or the sooner of January 1, 2025 or 15 days after the notification date (again, depending on what occurs with revenue and funding), covered health care employees must be paid at least $18/hour. Thereafter, the minimum wage increases on July 1 each year by 3.5%, reaching $25/hour on July 1, 2033. Starting January 1, 2035, the minimum wage will increase annually (on January 1) at the lesser of 3.5% or the Consumer Price Index. Clinics: Beginning on October 15, 2024, or the sooner of January 1, 2025 or 15 days after the notification date (depending on what occurs with revenue and funding), and continuing to June 30, 2026, covered health care employees must be paid at least $21/hour. Between July 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027, these employees must be paid at least $22/hour. And starting on July 1, 2027, these employees shall be paid at least $25/hour. Starting January 1, 2029, the minimum wage will increase annually (on January 1) at the lesser of 3.5% or the Consumer Price Index. Other health care facilities: Beginning on October 15, 2024, or the sooner of January 1, 2025 or 15 days after the notification date (again, depending on the revenue and funding contingencies noted above), and continuing to June 30, 2026, covered health care employees must be paid at least $21/hour. Between July 1, 2026 and June 30, 2028, these employees must be paid at least $23/hour. And starting on July 1, 2028, these employees shall be paid at least $25/hour. Starting January 1, 2030, the minimum wage will increase annually (on January 1) at the lesser of 3.5% or the Consumer Price Index. Takeaways While there is a delay in the effective date of the increased health care minimum wage until at least October 15, 2024, this should not deter health care employers from analyzing now whether they are appropriately classifying themselves and their workers to determine which category of minimum wage increase will apply to them. Health care employers should review the FAQs and consult with their legal counsel to ensure they are prepared for these changes in the coming months.

Abram’s articles from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP are most popular: within Food, Drugs, Healthcare and Life Sciences topic(s) in United States Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP are most popular: within Criminal Law topic(s) Key Points Congress is increasing oversight and legislative activity related to the role of private equity in health care. Sen. Markey and Rep. Jayapal jointly introduced the Health Over Wealth Act on July 25, which aims to curb or outright prohibit private equity investment in patient-facing health care providers. This sweeping legislation proposes a wide-range of policies, including new transparency requirements, changes to the tax code to discourage sale-lease back transactions in health care, new federal licensing requirements for private equity to purchase health care providers, significant penalties for closing hospitals or reducing access to services, new divestment and civil penalty provisions, and even an outright ban on private equity acquisition of health care providers under certain circumstances. While the Health Over Wealth Act is unlikely to become law in its current form, it provides further insight into the concerns on the part of some members of Congress regarding the role of private equity in health care and potential areas of future federal and/or state action. Background Over the last several years, various members of Congress have been increasingly engaged on the issue of private equity in health care. The recent introduction of the Health Over Wealth Act by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA-07) is the most recent example and comes on the heels of Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) unveiling The Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act of 2024 earlier this summer, which seeks to create new civil and criminal penalties for health care investors who are responsible for \"triggering events\" that result in patient injuries at health care facilities. This policy alert provides an overview of the Health Over Wealth Act and the potential path forward for this legislation as stakeholders continue to monitor congressional activity focused on private equity investment in health care. Key Provision of the Health Over Wealth Act The Health Over Wealth Act focuses on transparency through new and extensive data collection. The legislation would require for-profit health care companies and private equity-owned health care providers to publicly report 10 years of data on their debt, equity, leverage, executive pay, fees, profits, health care charges to patients and insurance plans, sale-lease back arrangements and any reductions in services, wages or benefits for workers, fund profits and performance, and the disclosure of names of limited partners (among other things). The transparency provisions are aimed at gathering data related to specific critiques of private equity ownership in health care (primarily accusations of better profits and worse outcomes). As we have seen in other legislation in this space (such as the air ambulance provisions in the No Surprises Act 1 ), we would expect any future legislation to include additional data reporting and transparency requirements even if such data reporting and transparency requirements are not as rigorous as those set forth in this bill. The Health Over Wealth Act also establishes a task force to monitor changes in the health care marketplace, address and limit the role of private equity and consolidation in health care, and address changes to the health care marketplace and private equity or market consolidation patterns related to health care disparities or disparate outcomes. The bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to annually report to Congress on recommendations for limiting the role of private equity in health care, taking into account the implications on health outcomes and staff working conditions, and identify emerging trends within the health care marketplace that may undermine access to care, quality of care, patient safety or create financial instability or risk for health care providers. Under the bill, the Task Force is to be chaired by the Secretary, co-chaired by a practicing health care provider and specific criteria is outlined regarding the members the Secretary shall appoint to serve on the Task Force. Of note, the bill requires the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General to serve as advisory members to the Task Force. The bill also seeks to disincentivize real estate investment trust (REIT) sale-leaseback transactions in health care by: (a) Eliminating preferential tax treatment for REITs that have significant sale-leaseback arrangements in health care. (b) Prohibiting any registered investment company from \"stripping assets\" from health care entities or undermining the quality, safety or access to health care. The bill also would (i) require private equity-owned health care companies to set up escrow accounts with sufficient cash to cover five years of operating expenses to ensure continuation of care in the event of a hospital closure or service reduction, (ii) create a new federal private equity health care investment licensing process, (iii) permit HHS to revoke investment licenses from private equity firms that price gouge, understaff or create access barriers to care, (iv) set forth penalties for violations that span special civil monetary penalties (requiring repayment of all federal funds received by the health care provider) to mandatory divestment, (v) sets forth a process for proposing regulatory and legislative recommendations related to private equity's role in health care, and (vi) authorize the Secretary to prohibit future private equity investments in health care until a new task force reports on ways to curb private equity investment in the health care space. Outlook for the Legislation While the Health Over Wealth Act is unlikely to advance, the introduction of this legislation in both the Senate and House reflects a growing critique by some members of Congress (and some policymakers in the last two administrations) of private equity ownership of patient-facing health care providers. While there is currently no consensus on the specific legislative proposals in the Health Over Wealth Act, expect the scrutiny of private equity investments in patient-facing health care to continue to grow in the months and years ahead—and with it the mounting potential for some future legislative action. This is the key reason stakeholders should continue to carefully monitor the latest congressional developments in this space.

Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. A health care proxy, sometimes known as a health care agent or surrogate, is someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf when you can’t. Appointing a health care proxy requires that you set up a durable power of attorney for health care. Although many people name a health care proxy as part of their end-of-life plan , it’s possible (and maybe advisable, depending on your circumstances) to appoint this advocate at any time in your life to ensure your medical preferences, as set out in your living will , are respected and upheld if you’re incapacitated. Key Points A health care proxy is someone you legally appoint to make medical decisions if you’re incapacitated. Your health care proxy typically relies on your living will, which is a legal document that spells out the treatment you might want under certain circumstances. The laws for setting up a health care proxy vary by state, like most powers of attorney, so it’s wise to consult a professional. What a health care proxy does The primary responsibility of a health care proxy is to advocate for your medical preferences and wishes and ensure they’re carried out to the best of their abilities. This duty includes making decisions regarding treatment options for your physical and mental health , surgeries , medications , and (when necessary) end-of-life care . Your proxy may also oversee your medical records . In addition, a health care proxy acts as a liaison between medical professionals and the people you love, ensuring that medical decisions align with your wishes and best interests. In other words, this role requires several skills, including the ability to convey your wishes to others; make difficult medical decisions (possibly under pressure); and discuss these choices with professionals and family members. Why you need a health care proxy The need for a health care proxy transcends age, health status, and personal circumstances. Medical emergencies or grave illnesses can strike at any moment, leaving patients unable to communicate their wishes regarding their own medical care. Appointing a health care proxy legally ensures your preferences are honored while sparing your loved ones the burden of making difficult decisions during an already stressful time. Moreover, having a health care proxy can give you a sense of control and peace of mind, knowing that your expressed values and priorities will guide your care. Still, it’s important for you and your health care proxy to understand and acknowledge that a crisis, by definition, can be hard to predict. There are limits to how many specifics can be addressed in advance; a lot depends on the skill of the person you choose. How a health care proxy uses a living will How does your health care proxy know your preferences? A living will is the legal document that details how to proceed with medical treatment if you’re incapacitated. Your living will expresses your preferences regarding life-sustaining and end-of-life procedures, including administering pain medication, resuscitation , tube feeding, organ donation , and more. Many people have strong beliefs or embrace traditions that may not permit certain treatments. A living will spells out those guidelines. A living will versus a living trust They may sound similar, but a living will and a living trust aren’t the same thing (although both can be part of a sound estate plan ). A living trust involves creating a legal entity that owns your assets , such as a house, and eliminates the need to have your will probated after you die. A living will , in contrast, is a document that outlines your decisions about health care should you become incapacitated. It provides details about your desire for resuscitation, whether you should be kept alive by artificial means such as a ventilator, and more. A health care proxy relies on the living will and ensures that your wishes and preferences are carried out. Without a proxy to legally enforce your wishes, some decisions could be overlooked or executed in a way you might not have wanted. How to set up a health care proxy Establishing a health care proxy is a relatively straightforward process: Choose someone you trust. As your representative and medical power of attorney , your proxy should be familiar with your values, beliefs, and medical preferences—and confident in carrying out your wishes. It helps if the person you choose is also comfortable with your family or other loved ones, and capable of making difficult decisions under pressure. Discuss your wishes. Talk to your health care proxy about the medical interventions you would want, your values, and in the case of a more serious condition, your end-of-life wishes. If your wishes change for any reason, be sure to let them know. Create a legal document. Set up a durable power of attorney for health care with your state’s health department or local agency on aging. If you’re a veteran, your local Department of Veterans Affairs office can help. Working with a lawyer will ensure this form meets state requirements, but it’s possible to file it without one. Depending on where you live, you may need to have the document witnessed and notarized. Distribute copies. Be sure to provide copies of the health care proxy document to the person you’ve chosen as your proxy, as well as to your doctor(s), family members, and institutions involved in your medical care. Review your plans regularly and update them as needed. Life happens. Your health can change, and so might your priorities. Regularly review and update your health care proxy document, inform your health care proxy of any changes, and redistribute the revised document to everyone who needs it. If you need or want to change your health care proxy, you can do so at any time simply by filing a new advance directive. Health care proxy checklist The American Bar Association recommends these parameters when choosing a health care proxy: Open full sized image Consider your choice carefully. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The bottom line Choosing a health care proxy is a fundamental component of advance care planning that enables you to maintain some control over your medical care, even if you’re injured, ill, or otherwise incapacitated. By designating a trusted agent and articulating your medical preferences, you can help your medical team and family navigate the potential complexities of your care with confidence. Setting up a health care proxy is also an act of compassion for the people you love. It will help to answer questions that arise and ease their minds so they can focus on your well-being.

    "article_text": "Bryan Mena, CNN August 10, 2024 at 1:00 PM 18 Copied Stígur Már Karlsson/Heimsmynd/E+/Getty Images America’s lucrative job market of recent years is now long gone, with the unemployment rate recently rising to i ts highest level since October 2021 . But there’s still some serious momentum in one industry. These workers have plentiful jobs available to them across the country and are raking in higher wage gains than the broader private sector. Employers in this industry also hire quickly and typically offer cushy perks such as massive sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement. Enter America’s top job creator: The mighty health care industry. So far in 2024, health care has added a stunning 59,000 jobs a month, on average, through July, according to Labor Department data released in early August. That’s the most of any industry, and it includes positions such as nurses, home health aides and emergency medical technicians. Demand for health care workers remains red hot, according to recent government data on job openings. In June, the health care and social assistance industry had the highest seasonally adjusted job openings rate of any industry, at 7.6%, well above the total rate across the job market of 5.5% that month. “Health care is a major, major engine of growth. I mean, it’s just incredible how much demand there is for those workers,” said Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter’s chief economist. That has translated into fatter paychecks for health care workers compared to the general private sector. In the second quarter from a year earlier, employees in the health care and social assistance industry saw their wages grow 4.5%, a stronger clip than the private sector’s 4% gain during the same period, according to the latest data from the Employment Cost Index. “Our population is aging and we are still recovering in a lot of ways from the Covid-19 pandemic, which really put a strain on a lot of our resources,” David Mafe, chief diversity officer and vice president of human resources at UCHealth, a nonprofit health system in the Denver metropolitan area, told CNN. “Health care has been going through these hiring challenges for a really long time.” Health care services are also mostly resistant to the ebb and flows of the economic cycle. For example, even during recessions, people will still need knee surgeries, C-sections, chemotherapy or any other necessary medical service. Higher wage growth and robust benefits The competition for workers is so fierce in health care that employers are putting their best foot forward. UCHealth, which employs 33,000 people, usually has 2,700 job openings at any given time, Mafe said. He added that it’s been particularly challenging hiring respiratory therapists and skilled positions related to imaging or radiology. “We’ve had to be more aggressive with salaries over the last year and a half than before.” Mafe said. “We’re constantly looking at our benefits and ensuring that the things we offer to our staff are actually relevant to them and relevant to their families.” UCHealth employees who work an average of 20 hours or more per week have “the opportunity to be eligible for 100% of tuition, books and fees paid for by UCHealth for specific educational degrees,” according to a description of the program. That includes college degrees and clinical certificates, “enabling those in entry-level roles to grow into professional and higher-income positions,” the description details. Quicker to hire Novant Health, a health care provider of around 40,000 employees based in North Carolina, has been on a massive hiring spree, dishing out hefty sign-on bonuses to sweeten the deal, Sebastien Girard, the company’s chief people and belonging officer, told CNN. The number of nurses the company hired increased by 46% from 2022 to 2023 and is “on track to surpass 2023 recruitment numbers this year,” the company said in a statement to CNN. Newly hired nurses in “high-demand specialties” are offered sign-on bonuses of up to $30,000, the company said. Novant Health has been hiring at an even faster clip recently: Girard said a new process to speed up hiring has resulted in reducing the time to fill positions by 91%, now taking 10 days to successfully hire a nurse. “Virtually every nurse or health care tech in the country has a job,” Girard said. “We’re recruiting from all over the nation.” So, how do I pivot to health care? Mafe and Girard both said they regularly hear of newly hired workers who just pivoted to a career in health care. It will require going back to school, and the length of time depends on the specific job. For example, it takes less than a year to become a certified phlebotomist, for which there is strong demand. However, becoming a registered nurse could take anywhere from two to four years.

    "article_text": "Stígur Már Karlsson/Heimsmynd/E+/Getty Images Washington CNN — America’s lucrative job market of recent years is now long gone, with the unemployment rate recently rising to i ts highest level since October 2021 . But there’s still some serious momentum in one industry. These workers have plentiful jobs available to them across the country and are raking in higher wage gains than the broader private sector. Employers in this industry also hire quickly and typically offer cushy perks such as massive sign-on bonuses and tuition reimbursement. Enter America’s top job creator: The mighty health care industry. So far in 2024, health care has added a stunning 59,000 jobs a month, on average, through July, according to Labor Department data released in early August. That’s the most of any industry, and it includes positions such as nurses, home health aides and emergency medical technicians. Demand for health care workers remains red hot, according to recent government data on job openings. In June, the health care and social assistance industry had the highest seasonally adjusted job openings rate of any industry, at 7.6%, well above the total rate across the job market of 5.5% that month. “Health care is a major, major engine of growth. I mean, it’s just incredible how much demand there is for those workers,” said Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter’s chief economist. That has translated into fatter paychecks for health care workers compared to the general private sector. In the second quarter from a year earlier, employees in the health care and social assistance industry saw their wages grow 4.5%, a stronger clip than the private sector’s 4% gain during the same period, according to the latest data from the Employment Cost Index. “Our population is aging and we are still recovering in a lot of ways from the Covid-19 pandemic, which really put a strain on a lot of our resources,” David Mafe, chief diversity officer and vice president of human resources at UCHealth, a nonprofit health system in the Denver metropolitan area, told CNN. “Health care has been going through these hiring challenges for a really long time.” Health care services are also mostly resistant to the ebb and flows of the economic cycle. For example, even during recessions, people will still need knee surgeries, C-sections, chemotherapy or any other necessary medical service. Higher wage growth and robust benefits The competition for workers is so fierce in health care that employers are putting their best foot forward. UCHealth, which employs 33,000 people, usually has 2,700 job openings at any given time, Mafe said. He added that it’s been particularly challenging hiring respiratory therapists and skilled positions related to imaging or radiology. “We’ve had to be more aggressive with salaries over the last year and a half than before.” Mafe said. “We’re constantly looking at our benefits and ensuring that the things we offer to our staff are actually relevant to them and relevant to their families.” UCHealth employees who work an average of 20 hours or more per week have “the opportunity to be eligible for 100% of tuition, books and fees paid for by UCHealth for specific educational degrees,” according to a description of the program. That includes college degrees and clinical certificates, “enabling those in entry-level roles to grow into professional and higher-income positions,” the description details. Quicker to hire Novant Health, a health care provider of around 40,000 employees based in North Carolina, has been on a massive hiring spree, dishing out hefty sign-on bonuses to sweeten the deal, Sebastien Girard, the company’s chief people and belonging officer, told CNN. The number of nurses the company hired increased by 46% from 2022 to 2023 and is “on track to surpass 2023 recruitment numbers this year,” the company said in a statement to CNN. Newly hired nurses in “high-demand specialties” are offered sign-on bonuses of up to $30,000, the company said. Novant Health has been hiring at an even faster clip recently: Girard said a new process to speed up hiring has resulted in reducing the time to fill positions by 91%, now taking 10 days to successfully hire a nurse. “Virtually every nurse or health care tech in the country has a job,” Girard said. “We’re recruiting from all over the nation.” So, how do I pivot to health care? Mafe and Girard both said they regularly hear of newly hired workers who just pivoted to a career in health care. It will require going back to school, and the length of time depends on the specific job. For example, it takes less than a year to become a certified phlebotomist, for which there is strong demand. However, becoming a registered nurse could take anywhere from two to four years. Since demand for health care workers is so hot, however, students are usually offered a job right before they graduate or obtain a certification, Mafe and Girard both said. Pollak recalled one worker who pivoted to health care and immediately reaped the rewards. “One job seeker we spoke with recently was a personal trainer, and during the pandemic, with all the lockdowns in California, she realized she couldn’t make ends meet, and so she borrowed money to do nursing school,” Pollak said. “She’s now a (neonatal intensive care unit) nurse, and she said she feels she could go anywhere and do whatever she wants. She’s been able to get a remarkable amount of flexibility and set her hours, and she got hired before she even graduated, with no interview.”"

    "article_text": "Visitors wear protective masks at the Government Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad in this file photograph. | PTI A new study from the National Institutes of Health shows a jump in both hospital-acquired infections and resistance to the antibiotics used to treat them. The findings are based on data gathered at 120 US hospitals from January 2018 to December 2022, a five-year period that included the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Nasia Safdar , a professor of infectious medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, discusses why infection rates have gone up and how you can protect yourself as a hospital patient or visiting family member. What are health care-associated infections? These are infections that occur as a result of exposure to the health care system . People coming in for care are typically quite sick, so they’re at risk of acquiring bacteria that can then cause an infection while they’re in the hospital, or shortly after they’re discharged from the hospital. Why do infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant ones, spread so easily in hospitals and other health care settings? There is a certain profile of bacteria and germs that develop in health care facilities. And that profile is typically bacteria that are resistant to many commonly used antibiotics . Patients are already vulnerable and may have compromised immune systems. On top of that, add the risks associated with heavy-duty antibiotic usage, surgeries, procedures and medical devices like urinary catheters and intravascular catheters, which go into the bloodstream. The result is a population at risk for acquiring these bacteria circulating in the environment. What does it mean for an infection to be antibiotic-resistant? For any typical infection, there might be a range of choices for treatment. There is what’s called first-line treatment, which is the first antibiotic you would go to . These are typically antibiotics that can treat the infections really well, but without harming the good bacteria that live in your intestine. But when bacteria get resistant to antibiotics, we have to go to more broad-spectrum antibiotics , which might still be effective for treatment but also might have more side effects or destroy some of the good bacteria in the intestine. What can hospitals and clinics do to prevent or reduce the spread of infections? One is infection prevention , and the other is antibiotic stewardship , or the judicious use of antibiotics. Both work synergistically with each other. Within the infection prevention category, you have hand hygiene , which is critical not just for health care personnel but also for patients themselves. There is also the use of gowns and gloves, when necessary, to make sure that if one patient has a transmittable condition, that pathway is interrupted by health care workers wearing the right PPE, or personal protective equipment . I also think only using devices such as urinary catheters or intravascular catheters when they’re truly needed is another way to prevent patients from becoming infected. And then, within the antibiotic stewardship category, there’s a need to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. What has happened in recent years regarding the rates of health care-associated infections? Before the pandemic, I think the field was quite optimistic because we were seeing reduced rates of antibiotic-resistant, device-related infections. A lot of those gains were reversed after the arrival of the pandemic. There was a lot of unnecessary use of antibiotics during that time. And so now we see sharp increases in many of those antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This has led to concern that whatever success we had was fragile and short-lived. We now want to make sure we’re not as vulnerable as we became during the pandemic. Medical personnel with a Covid-19 patient in this file photograph from January 2022. Credit: PTI. Can you give us some background on Candida auris ? Candida auris is an emerging pathogen. Unlike some other antibiotic-resistant germs in health care systems, this one is a fungus – or a yeast, which is the other terminology for it. And it spreads quite quickly in health care systems . Candida auris persists in the environment and on the skin and can cause severe bloodstream infections in vulnerable patients. It has been responsible for a number of outbreaks, and the treatment options are much more limited when compared with other infectious germs. With the arrival of the pandemic, there was a sharp increase in Candida auris infections. They rose by several hundred percent nationwide after smoldering for a while. That sharp spike concerns us. Can the spread of these infections be reduced by manipulating the gut microbiome? Many of these germs live in the intestine. They are generally kept at bay by the good bacteria that we all have in our intestines. But sometimes, when we use antibiotics, or use devices or do surgery, those good bacteria are destroyed . And then these germs can find a hospitable niche and grow and cause infections. Diet plays an important role in keeping our gut microbiome healthy . Most Americans don’t get enough fiber . But a high-fiber diet keeps your gut bacteria healthy and helps you put up more of a resistance to germs when they try to invade. What can patients or their families do to reduce the odds of getting an infection in a health care setting? Make sure that both patient and health care workers observe hand hygiene. Use hand sanitiser. It works . It’s convenient. It’s readily available. It’s a great way to prevent infections in health care systems. But there are some instances where you would want to use soap and water instead. Soap and water is a better option when hands are soiled with blood, stool, diarrhea or other body secretions. Also ask about the health care system’s rates of infections. Those are things typically tracked closely by health care systems, and the information is often publicly available . Ask your health care team about the medication you’re getting for treatments, particularly if they’re antibiotics. Then ask how long you should take them, what side effects to anticipate, and the effect they’ll have on your gut bacteria. Watch the full interview to hear more.

Sen. Markey and Rep. Jayapal jointly introduced the Health Over Wealth Act on July 25, which aims to curb or outright prohibit private equity investment in patient-facing health care providers. This sweeping legislation proposes a wide-range of policies, including new transparency requirements, changes to the tax code to discourage sale-lease back transactions in health care, new federal licensing requirements for private equity to purchase health care providers, significant penalties for closing hospitals or reducing access to services, new divestment and civil penalty provisions, and even an outright ban on private equity acquisition of health care providers under certain circumstances. While the Health Over Wealth Act is unlikely to become law in its current form, it provides further insight into the concerns on the part of some members of Congress regarding the role of private equity in health care and potential areas of future federal and/or state action. Background Over the last several years, various members of Congress have been increasingly engaged on the issue of private equity in health care. The recent introduction of the Health Over Wealth Act by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA-07) is the most recent example and comes on the heels of Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) unveiling The Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act of 2024 earlier this summer, which seeks to create new civil and criminal penalties for health care investors who are responsible for “triggering events” that result in patient injuries at health care facilities. This policy alert provides an overview of the Health Over Wealth Act and the potential path forward for this legislation as stakeholders continue to monitor congressional activity focused on private equity investment in health care. Key Provision of the Health Over Wealth Act The Health Over Wealth Act focuses on transparency through new and extensive data collection. The legislation would require for-profit health care companies and private equity-owned health care providers to publicly report 10 years of data on their debt, equity, leverage, executive pay, fees, profits, health care charges to patients and insurance plans, sale-lease back arrangements and any reductions in services, wages or benefits for workers, fund profits and performance, and the disclosure of names of limited partners (among other things). The transparency provisions are aimed at gathering data related to specific critiques of private equity ownership in health care (primarily accusations of better profits and worse outcomes). As we have seen in other legislation in this space (such as the air ambulance provisions in the No Surprises Act 1 ), we would expect any future legislation to include additional data reporting and transparency requirements even if such data reporting and transparency requirements are not as rigorous as those set forth in this bill. The Health Over Wealth Act also establishes a task force to monitor changes in the health care marketplace, address and limit the role of private equity and consolidation in health care, and address changes to the health care marketplace and private equity or market consolidation patterns related to health care disparities or disparate outcomes. The bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to annually report to Congress on recommendations for limiting the role of private equity in health care, taking into account the implications on health outcomes and staff working conditions, and identify emerging trends within the health care marketplace that may undermine access to care, quality of care, patient safety or create financial instability or risk for health care providers. Under the bill, the Task Force is to be chaired by the Secretary, co-chaired by a practicing health care provider and specific criteria is outlined regarding the members the Secretary shall appoint to serve on the Task Force. Of note, the bill requires the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General to serve as advisory members to the Task Force. The bill also seeks to disincentivize real estate investment trust (REIT) sale-leaseback transactions in health care by: (a) Eliminating preferential tax treatment for REITs that have significant sale-leaseback arrangements in health care. (b) Prohibiting any registered investment company from “stripping assets” from health care entities or undermining the quality, safety or access to health care. The bill also would (i) require private equity-owned health care companies to set up escrow accounts with sufficient cash to cover five years of operating expenses to ensure continuation of care in the event of a hospital closure or service reduction, (ii) create a new federal private equity health care investment licensing process, (iii) permit HHS to revoke investment licenses from private equity firms that price gouge, understaff or create access barriers to care, (iv) set forth penalties for violations that span special civil monetary penalties (requiring repayment of all federal funds received by the health care provider) to mandatory divestment, (v) sets forth a process for proposing regulatory and legislative recommendations related to private equity’s role in health care, and (vi) authorize the Secretary to prohibit future private equity investments in health care until a new task force reports on ways to curb private equity investment in the health care space. Outlook for the Legislation While the Health Over Wealth Act is unlikely to advance, the introduction of this legislation in both the Senate and House reflects a growing critique by some members of Congress (and some policymakers in the last two administrations) of private equity ownership of patient-facing health care providers. While there is currently no consensus on the specific legislative proposals in the Health Over Wealth Act, expect the scrutiny of private equity investments in patient-facing health care to continue to grow in the months and years ahead—and with it the mounting potential for some future legislative action. This is the key reason stakeholders should continue to carefully monitor the latest congressional developments in this space. 1 See H.R. 133, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (116th Cong.), Division BB.

    "article_text": "Abstract The introduction of digital technology represents a total paradigm shift in the way we approach and handle many facets of our life, not merely a move from conventional to computerized platforms. The medical field is not an exception. Electronic health records and telemedicine are both included in the notion of digital transformation in healthcare. Digital Health encompasses the application of digital tools in healthcare. It has enabled stakeholders of health deliver and access healthcare with more ease over the last couple of years as already proven by some of the sources cited in this review. This review examines and buttresses the critical role that digital transformation plays in bringing down healthcare expenses all over the world and need for increased incorporation of digital healthcare tools in healthcare industries across the nations of the earth. Introduction The World Health Organization defines Health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO constitution 1946). This definition underscores the overwhelming importance of the subject matter of health and why it must be taken seriously. Simply put, to be healthy is to be free from diseases, be physically, mentally and socially fit. Achieving this is the primary goal of many health care organizations and agencies all over the world and healthcare reforms as years go by are necessary if a nation is to continuously come closer to achieving better healthcare outcomes for her people. One of the ways healthcare has evolved is the incorporation of digital technology in healthcare delivery and practice (Isidori et al., 2022). The term “digital health” refers to the vast, multidisciplinary field that encompasses ideas from the nexus of technology and healthcare (Athmara 2024). By combining software, hardware, and services, digital health brings digital transformation to the healthcare industry (Stoumpus et al., 2023). Digital health encompasses wearable technology, telehealth and telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth) apps, electronic health records (EHRs), electronic medical records (EMRs), and customized medicine(Dinh-le et al., 2019). Patients, healthcare professionals, researchers, application developers, and producers and distributors of medical equipment are among the stakeholders in the subject of digital health. In today’s healthcare system, digital healthcare is becoming more and more significant. Hospital IT, medical technology, health analytics, healthcare informatics, health information technology (health IT), and healthcare tools are terms associated with digital health. Digital Health, the Concept It is not a novel idea to use information and communications technology to deliver digital health interventions that enhance quality of life and prevent illness. However, the significance and evolution of digital health platforms, health systems, and related technology continue to grow in the face of global concerns about aging, child illness and mortality, epidemics and pandemics, high costs, and the effects of poverty and racial discrimination on access to healthcare (Butcher and Hussain, 2022). The U.S. Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other government health insurance plans have led to significant advancements in digital health. Even though the ACA had some technological difficulties when it first went into effect, one of its goals was to use technology to raise the standard of healthcare. As an illustration, this involved raising the standard of EHRs and computer models that monitor healthcare costs. Healthcare informatics is the application of technology and data to enhance patient health and treatment quality. This makes it possible for medical experts to evaluate new initiatives, search for opportunities for advancement in the healthcare industry, and incorporate cutting-edge medical technology (Hinrichs and Zarcone, 2013). The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the ongoing digital revolution in healthcare, adding gasoline to the flames of change. Patient-facing technologies, including as online symptom checks, patient portals, remote patient monitoring tools, and telemedicine, are among the most influential COVID-19 technologies, according to Forrester Research (Bernstein, 2021). Importance of Digital Health More than only technology and tools are employed in digital health, according to Deloitte Insights, which also sees “radically interoperable data, artificial intelligence (AI), and open, secure platforms as central to the promise of more consumer-focused, prevention-oriented care.” Significant improvements in digital healthcare are still being brought about by advances in AI, big data, robots, and machine learning. Additionally, changes in the field of digital healthcare are bringing forth advancements in remotely monitored devices and applications, robotic caregivers, and consumable sensors (Bernstein, 2021). AI will facilitate significant scientific advancements, hastening the development of novel treatments and vaccinations to combat illnesses. AI-powered digital therapies and tailored advice will help users to avert health problems before they arise. AI-generated insights will impact treatment and diagnosis decisions, resulting in safer and more efficient therapies. Furthermore, supply chain and intelligent manufacturing technologies will guarantee that patients receive the appropriate interventions and therapies at the precise time they need them (Gorki and Medhi, 2024; Alowais et al., 2023). Priority The worldwide digital health market is expected to develop at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.9% between 2020 and 2027, when it is expected to reach $833.44 billion (Global Wellness Institute, 2024). The market research agency located in Ottawa claims that the increase in healthcare applications is driving this surge. Due to the region’s growing older population, high smartphone adoption rate, and effort to create applications and digital healthcare platforms to lower healthcare expenses, North America has a leading share of the worldwide digital health industry (Bernstein, 2021). Examples of digital health technology Time savings, increased accuracy and efficiency, and the blending of technology in novel ways for the healthcare industry are all goals of digital health advances. These developments have the potential to combine blockchain technology with electronic medical records, mHealth with IoT, and medicine with augmented reality (AR) (Haleem et al., 2022). The term “internet of medical things” (IoMT) describes the networked medical equipment and applications that are connected to health information technology (IT) systems. IoT application cases include reducing the risk of contracting infectious illnesses, enhancing patient-doctor contact through telemedicine, and utilizing a variety of smart sensor technologies that can gather data at the user level. For instance, COVID-19 increased the need for telehealth services as more clinicians were using technology to give patients with virtual care (Osama et al., 2023). MHealth which includes wearables, apps, and mobile technology is expanding, especially in relation to managing chronic, long-term illnesses. It offers access to health care support and monitoring. Demand for wearables which blur the boundary between consumer and medical devices for personal health monitoring has increased as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Heart rate variability, pulse oximeters, electrocardiography, and continuous glucose monitoring are among the functions that wearable device vendors have incorporated (Deniz-Garcia et al., 2023). Blockchain-based EMRs, which seek to improve data quality and interoperability and save the time required to obtain patient information, are another noteworthy use. The advantages of blockchain in digital healthcare include scalability, data privacy, and access security. Healthcare apps that use AI can improve human decision-making by automating and expediting labor-intensive processes that were previously done by hand. For example, a lot of hospitals gather and treat patients based on real-time information by using AI-based patient monitoring solutions (Reegu et al., 2023). AI in medical imaging can minimize the number of clicks required to complete a task and decide what to do next depending on context. Digital twins, another AI application, may be used to simulate patients and medical equipment and demonstrate how the equipment would function in real-world scenarios (Cellina et al., 2023). Surgical visualization, illness simulation, and patient and physician education can all benefit from augmented reality (AR), which combines digital information with the user’s surroundings in real time. Big data, which compiles data from many health apps and systems, has advantages as well as disadvantages. Massive amounts of data are still being created(Venkatesan et al., 2021). Big data in healthcare Big data in healthcare emerged as a result of the digitalization of health information. Healthcare big data is also a result of the rise of value-based care, which encourages the sector to use data analytics to make wise business decisions. Healthcare big data refers to collecting, analyzing, and leveraging consumer, patient, physical, and clinical data that is too vast or complex to be understood by traditional means of data processing, instead, data scientists and machine learning algorithms handle large amounts of data (Dash et al., 2019). Nonetheless, faced with the challenges of healthcare data such as volume, velocity, variety, and veracity, health systems need to adopt technology capable of collecting, storing, and analyzing this information to produce actionable insights (Al-Talafhah et al., 2023). In healthcare, big data can provide the following benefits: • Lowering drug mistakes. Software can identify discrepancies between a patient’s condition and prescriptions by examining patient data. It can then alert patients and medical providers to possible drug errors. • Supporting care that is preventative. Emergency departments have a high proportion of repeat patients, sometimes known as frequent flyers. This kind of patient may be recognized with the use of big data analysis, and programs for prevention can be created to protect them from coming back. • Hiring more precisely. In order to better schedule personnel, hospitals and clinics may be able to estimate admission rates with the use of predictive analysis (Bernstein, 2021). Benefits of digital health In addition to helping people monitor and manage chronic illnesses, digital health has promise for disease prevention and reduced healthcare expenses. Additionally, it may customize medication for each patient. The advancements in digital health might also be advantageous to healthcare practitioners. Because digital tools greatly increase access to health data and allow individuals more influence over their health, they provide healthcare practitioners with a comprehensive picture of their patients’ health. Better medical outcomes and more efficiency are the end results (Samal et al., 2021). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website: “Digital technology has been driving a revolution in health care, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to mobile medical apps and software that support the clinical decisions doctors make every day.” Digital health technologies offer enormous promise to advance both the individual’s access to healthcare and our capacity to correctly identify and treat illness (FDA, 2020). Furthermore, patients now have more access to information and new methods to monitor their health thanks to technology like social media, internet apps, and cellphones. “Together, these advancements are leading to a convergence of people, information, technology, and connectivity to improve health care and health outcomes,” according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA claims that digital health technologies assist providers in cutting costs, increasing quality, improving access, decreasing inefficiencies, and personalizing patient care (FDA, 2020). Simultaneously, patients and consumers may more effectively monitor and track wellness and health-related behaviors thanks to digital health technologies. While wearable medical technology, telemedicine, virtual reality (VR) tools, and 5G enhance patient care, medical practitioners may optimize their processes using AI-powered solutions (Willis et al., 2022). Findings on cost-effectiveness of digital interventions by Gentili et al. (2022) showed a growing body of evidence and suggested a generally favorable effect in terms of costs and health outcomes. In a similar study by Mensah et al (2023), Digital Health Technology was perceived to have impacted positively on healthcare professionals’ work by reducing the workload of the clinical staff and time spent by patients to receive services as compared to the paper-based system. Further studies by Nascimento et al (2023) provided insight into the effect of digital health technology on health care workers’ competencies and the result showed association of digital health technologies with the enhancement of healthcare workers’ performance, improvement of clinical practice and management and improvement of access to care and the delivery itself. All of these lead to reduction in the cost of health care. Conclusion A significant amount of research in this review indicates that digital health solutions may significantly lower healthcare expenditures while simultaneously enhancing patient outcomes and making the job of delivering healthcare a lot more easier for healthcare providers and staff. Digital health has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector, encompassing telemedicine, AI-powered diagnostics, data analytics, and tailored patient care. Digital health may help cut wasteful spending, better allocate resources, and raise the general effectiveness of healthcare systems by expanding access to treatment, optimizing clinical processes, and facilitating data-driven decision-making. Integrating digital health solutions is becoming more and more important as the healthcare sector develops in order to create a more patient-centered, cost-effective, and sustainable healthcare system. We can build a better future for healthcare where everyone has access to high-quality treatment and costs are lowered for people, employers, and society at large by utilizing the potential of digital health.

Over the past week, Team USA rugby player Ariana Ramsey has taken to TikTok to document her first experience with France’s universal public healthcare system. And she is thrilled. “Not only in the village do we have free food, but we have free dental, free healthcare,” she said upon learning about the benefit for all participating athletes. “I literally just got a pap smear for free, and I have a dentist appointment and eye exam next week.” @ariana.ramsey I quite literally love it here. The way the Olympic village has free healthcare, but America doesn’t😣 #o #olympics o #olympicvillage o #olympian t #teamusa r #rugby b #bronzemedalist ♬ original sound – Ari Ramsey Although citizens in the Olympics’ host country are heavily taxed, France runs a “statutory health insurance system” providing universal coverage for its residents. The system covers most costs for hospital, physician, and long-term care. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked France’s healthcare system the highest, with Ramsey’s home country, the United States, coming in 37th . In a follow-up video, the 24-year-old bronze medalist revealed that her medical journey has inspired her to campaign for free healthcare back home. “The fact that I’m actually so excited to be getting free dental is crazy,” she remarked. “This is gonna be my new fight for action: free healthcare in America.” @ariana.ramsey ♬ original sound – Ari Ramsey As noted by the Paris 2024 organizing committee , the Olympic Village provides a range of free healthcare services to athletes, including cardiology, orthopedics, physiotherapy, psychology, podiatry, and sports medicine, with dermatology available for Paralympic athletes. This complimentary healthcare has been available to participants since the 1932 Los Angeles Games.

Strengthening the province’s health care system is a top priority for Alberta’s government. By attracting experienced international health professionals to the province, critical supports are added to the province’s health system so Albertans can access care when and where they need it. In April 2023, Alberta’s government created a Dedicated Health Care Pathway through the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program. This program helps attract international health care professionals to Alberta to help address labour shortages. Since its launch, the Dedicated Health Care Pathway has successfully nominated 122 health care professionals in 2023, and 258 in the first half of 2024. Nine professions are eligible under this pathway, including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and psychologists. More than 150 professionals are heading to communities outside Edmonton and Calgary. “I am proud of the incredible success of the Dedicated Health Care Pathway, and very pleased to see so many experienced health professionals going to areas outside of Calgary and Edmonton. With this program, we are increasing timely access to care for Albertans, no matter where they live.” The Dedicated Health Care Pathway is designed to attract and retain health care professionals who have received authorization to practice in Alberta and have an Alberta job offer in the health care sector. Once nominated, the individual then applies for permanent residence through the federal government as a provincial nominee. “We are committed to recruiting and retaining health care workers in Alberta by reducing barriers and improving opportunities for them. Through the Alberta Health Workforce Strategy, programs like the Dedicated Health Care Pathway provide solutions for those who come to work in health care in our province to stay and build a life here. We will continue to plan for the talent required to address Albertans’ existing and emerging health care needs.” “The Government of Alberta has been responsive to the urgent need for more health care professionals, and we are grateful for the continued support and collaboration. The Dedicated Health Care Pathway has made a significant impact on our ability to attract international applicants to AHS, particularly trained nurses who bring the knowledge and experience that we currently need.” The Alberta Advantage Immigration Program helps strengthen and grow the province’s economy by addressing labour challenges across all sectors, including health care. Quick facts: 2023: Of the 122 health professionals nominated in the pathway, 59 were destined for locations outside Calgary and Edmonton, including 19 physicians and 25 registered nurses. 2024: Of the 258 health professionals nominated as of July 2024, 93 were destined for communities outside Calgary and Edmonton, including 14 physicians and 61 registered nurses. To be eligible, applicants must have received authorization to practice in Alberta by the relevant regulatory college and have a job offer in Alberta’s health care sector.

Information in the story may be outdated or superseded by additional information. Reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story. PROVO — The Utah Supreme Court ruled Thursday that 94 Utah County women can sue their OB-GYN, agreeing with their attorney's arguments that sexual assault is not health care and reviving their lawsuit. The women claim that David Broadbent sexually assaulted them during medical treatment. Many of the women said they were unaware of what to expect at an appointment when they went to his office near BYU. It wasn't until later, the stories in the lawsuit say, that they realized he had crossed a line and there was a reason behind their emotional distress around the appointment. Many of the women wore blue in solidarity to the courthouse on Oct. 20, 2023, as attorneys argued the case before the high court. Broadbent worked in Provo for over four decades as an OB-GYN. Some of the allegations in the lawsuit include digital penetration without warning, making sexual comments and feeling women's breasts but not for a medical purpose. The opinion, written by Justice Paige Petersen, states that many of the women said they felt distraught, terrible and violated after appointments with Broadbent. Fourth District Judge Robert C. Lunnen dismissed the lawsuit in 2022. He said that describing the incidents alleged in the lawsuit as \"appalling\" would be an understatement, but ultimately determined he did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. He said the lawsuit was against a medical professional for actions alleged during medical appointments and the proper steps for filing a medical malpractice lawsuit, under the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act, were not completed. Attorney Terence Rooney, the women's attorney, told the Supreme Court judges in October that Lunnen made a mistake when labeling what happened to the women as \"health care.\" \"That abuse is diametrically opposed to health care. … They are not intertwined in any way; they are distinct opposites,\" he told the justices. The Utah Supreme Court reversed Lunnen's decision, saying the act applies to injury \"arising out of health care rendered ... by the health care provider.\" It said the women don't claim they were injured during health care but that Broadbent \"abused his position as their doctor to sexually assault them under the pretense of providing health care.\" The justices said just because the alleged assaults occurred during medical appointments does not make them health care — the alleged actions were not medical treatment and did not have a medical purpose. \"The point of their claims is that his actions were not really health care at all,\" the opinion said. The lawsuit was also filed against Intermountain Health and MountainStar Healthcare, because some of the allegations occurred while Broadbent was working at their facilities. It claims that the women reported what had happened, but the medical companies did not adequately respond. Broadbent was criminally charged for the first time related to the actions alleged in the civil lawsuit in June. The Utah County Attorney's Office said he remains under investigation for other allegations. × Related stories Utah County doctor sued by nearly 100 women now faces criminal charge Utah high court considers case of 94 women alleging abuse against Provo OB-GYN Judge dismisses lawsuit from nearly 100 women claiming they were assaulted by Provo OB-GYN Most recent Police & Courts stories Inmate charged with capital murder accused of assaulting Utah County deputies at jail – again Idaho attorney general's office says no charges warranted against sheriff after turbulent town hall Teen dies in Fruit Heights after being electrocuted, falling from power pole Related topics Utah Police & Courts Utah County Emily Ashcraft    Emily Ashcraft is a reporter for KSL.com.

Image: iStock The African National Congress (ANC) remains adamant about the implementation of NHI, with the president as well as the minister of health saying after this week’s ANC policy meeting that government will proceed with the implementation. However, three important questions remain: how will government fund National Health Insurance (NHI), what will government do to manage and prevent illness, something that South Africans have already seen destroy the public healthcare system, and how will government prevent corruption in the health system? “We have highlighted the social and economic value of affordable, accessible, quality healthcare that is available equally to all South Africans. We will therefore proceed with the implementation of the National Health Insurance,” Cyril Ramaphosa said. Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said the section of the NHI Act, which outlines transitional mechanisms, would be implemented “immediately”. He said this includes setting up advisory committees and amending other health-related laws to be in line with the NHI. However, he did say that he would listen to concerns from stakeholders and help people understand the NHI. “The real poor people who are (set to be) beneficiaries haven’t spoken. Nobody is carrying their voice.” ALSO READ: What you need to know about SA’s medical aid schemes and NHI Doing the calculations – we might need up to R1.3 trillion to implement NHI Funding the NHI came under the spotlight recently at the Momentum Health Solutions Healthcare Insights Summit 2024, where Damian McHugh, chief marketing officer for Momentum Health Solutions, outlined what the cost of NHI could be. He pointed out that there is not much information available about how much the NHI will cost. The current budget for public healthcare is about R270 billion, while the cost of private healthcare claims was R230 billion, making up a total of R500 billion for the year for public and private healthcare. “While there is a difference of R40 million, the difference of R40 million is not much, but the number of people served is materially different. You can see the inequality in healthcare just by looking at the quantity of money spent covering almost 51 million people in the public sector compared to the 9 million people in the private healthcare sector.” ALSO READ: How will NHI impact employers and employees? Healthcare cost per life of R21 000 If you take the money spent and divide that by the number of beneficiaries in the private sector, you get a sense of what the claims cost per life would be in the private sector. The cost per life is R21 000. McHugh says to calculate the projected cost of the NHI ’s phase one, which will focus on primary healthcare, using the cost per life for private healthcare of R21 000 as a base, 61 million people times R21 000 comes to R1.3 trillion for a national healthcare system with the same quality and accessibility as the current private healthcare system. “There will obviously be savings, such as tax credits, which will come off the R1.3 trillion, but this is how much money will be needed if we want a similar set of outcomes regarding quality and accessibility.” He says even if the system needs R900 billion, it is still significantly more money than we have. ALSO READ: Health minister says NHI will be implemented over next four years For primary healthcare only, NHI will need R360 billion Broken down into the current private sector spread, this means 37% for hospitals, 28% for specialists and 16% for medicine, 8% for supplementary and allied health professionals, 5% for general practitioners, 2% for dentists and 2% for dental specialists and medicine dispensed. “As phase one is only aimed at primary healthcare, we can take hospitals and specialists out of the equation, but doctors, dentists and medicine remain. If we use the private healthcare sector as a base again, we will need almost R360 billion to provide primary healthcare at private sector prices.“ Then McHugh says, there are still administration costs, managed care and wellness costs that must be provided for. ALSO READ: R1.4 billion in budget for NHI: what does that mean? Management to prevent fraud “And what we really need is the ability to manage fraud. If we do not manage pre-authorisation or people abusing the system, the costs will just balloon. We even have fraudulent claims in the private sector.” McHugh emphasises that NHI will also have to manage and prevent illness as it is not only a fund that only pays when you are sick. “It must prevent the cost of care but the NHI Act is silent about how we will change the behaviour of ‘Oh, I have access to a doctor so let me just get a sick note’. That is not what we want.” He says chronic care could be another drain on funds as it can result in significantly higher risk if it is not controlled. “We need this detail about the NHI or otherwise our taxes will just go up and up.” Read more on these topics Dr Aaron Motsoaledi National Health Insurance (NHI) EDITOR'S CHOICE News Convicted murderers and rapists slipped through EMPD vetting and served in uniform Crime AKA-Tibz murder case: Ndimande brothers arrive in SA from eSwatini [VIDEO] Politics ‘SA should gear up for the post-Trump administration’ Politics Bojanala MMC suspended over EPWP workers abuse allegations South Africa Aarto delay ‘inevitable’: Here is the new implementation date Download our app Get the latest news and updates on Whatsapp The latest news directly in your inbox SUBSCRIBE AND WIN!

    "article_text": "Ransomware in the global healthcare industry By Leon Ward Published 1 year ago No Comments Tweet The World Health Organization (The WHO) hosted a webinar on the 18 July to discuss the critical importance of cybersecurity in the healthcare sector, highlighting the severity of the situation the industry is currently facing. Healthcare organizations are increasingly relying on digital systems to facilitate their daily workflow, but the prevalence of outdated legacy technology in the sector is rendering it vulnerable to cyber-attacks with severe consequences. As has been demonstrated with recent high-profile attacks on healthcare organizations, such as the US’ Ascension and Change Healthcare incidents, and the UK’s NHS attack, the healthcare industry must review its priorities, the threats it faces, and its security measures, without delay. Investing in data availability Healthcare organizations store valuable personal and health information within Electronic Health Records (EHR). These records contain data that are hot commodities on the black market: from full names, birth dates, and health monitoring information to social security numbers, billing and insurance details. Storing data digitally allows healthcare organizations to share important information quickly between staff and across borders, facilitating faster, more comprehensive patient care, but it also carries risk. Employees often have access to more information than they need to see. Should an employee accidentally click a phishing link or be exposed to malware, a bad actor can potentially access an organization’s entire system. Further, storing data digitally makes healthcare organizations dependent on their systems, meaning that in the event of a cyber-attack they can be brought to a standstill. For example, the Ascension Healthcare Incident resulted in ambulances being diverted, and staff resorting to writing information on paper, slowing essential operations. Immediate access to accurate patient data is not just a convenience; it’s a matter of life and death. However, this urgency for data accessibility must be balanced with stringent security measures. The vulnerability of confidential medical data to malware and ransomware attacks necessitates unwavering vigilance and robust security controls. Relying on legacy systems Many medical facilities and clinicians operate on outdated systems and devices, often running obsolete software versions and lacking adequate security measures. A single compromised legacy system can serve as a gateway for major data breaches, highlighting the critical need for modernization and security upgrades. The risk for such an event is high as legacy systems are often unsupported by their original developers, leaving them without essential security patches and updates. Unfortunately, it’s not just the resilience of their own systems healthcare organizations should be considering. An emerging trend that is quickly gaining traction in the threat landscape is supply-chain attacks: which is when an organization is subjected to a cyber-attack, and it travels to their partners and customers. The UK's NHS fell victim to a ransomware attack on its third-party partner, Synnovis. This can result in considerable impacts on healthcare services, and potentially life-threatening delays. In this particular instance, blood testing at two NHS hospital trusts is still only operating at 54 percent of normal levels, 6000 outpatient appointments and 1500 operations have been cancelled. This places healthcare organizations in a precarious position, as these attacks can be inserted at any point in the supply chain. To mitigate this risk, they must understand the cybersecurity posture of their partners, and establish a collaborative relationship that emphasizes sharing threat intelligence. This will improve the cybersecurity posture of the entire supply chain. Integrating modern assets Another challenge the healthcare industry faces is that while they embrace new technologies to enhance efficiency and patient care, like IoT medical devices and EHR applications, they also expand and complicate their attack surface. This exposes sensitive data to a myriad of threats and makes it hard to monitor for threats and anomalies. The intersection of innovation and security presents a daunting challenge for healthcare organizations striving to embrace progress without compromising patient privacy and safety. This puts the healthcare industry in a difficult position. Shying away from adopting new technologies can cause organizations to sacrifice the quality of their care, and lead to them having outdated technology and security measures, which increases the risk of a cyber-attack. However, integrating new technologies and driving innovation in their sector can create numerous challenges that their security teams struggle to keep pace with. Ransomware is becoming democratized From a risk perspective, valuable, easily accessible data with outdated cybersecurity measures, and an industry with a low tolerance for downtime, creates the perfect target for cyber-attacks. Bad actors are economic with their attacks: often valuing low-risk, high-reward targets that are likely to acquiesce to their demands. According to a recent Sophos State of Ransomware 2024 Report , ransomware attacks within the healthcare industry are not only on the rise, but over half the victims would pay up to 111 percent of the original ransom. The threat landscape is also evolving, with ransomware quickly becoming a democratized industry. New developments such as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and Ransomware-for-Hire Services enable anyone to launch a ransomware attack, even if they lack technical skills. Gen AI-based attacks are also increasing; resulting in more sophisticated attacks and phishing campaigns that can be more difficult to identify. Combating the Threats To combat the threats outlined above, a threat intelligence platform can be a robust solution that helps simplify cybersecurity efforts and support digital transformation. By aggregating all sources of threat intelligence and vulnerability data into a central repository, healthcare organizations can gain a holistic view of their cybersecurity landscape, enhancing visibility and informed decision-making. They can also enable an organization to prioritize threats based on their impact on the health system environment. This means that teams can filter out noise and focus on critical assets and vulnerabilities, ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most needed. Additionally, they can automate the dissemination of threat intelligence, empowering healthcare organizations to quickly share information against cyber adversaries. Armed with intelligence, teams can proactively hunt for malicious activity, swiftly identifying and neutralizing threats before they can wreak havoc on patient records and organizational integrity. A threat intelligence platform accelerates analysis and response to attacks, enabling rapid mitigation against evolving threats. Through assessing and understanding its current cybersecurity posture, and the threat landscape, the healthcare industry will be able to update its cybersecurity infrastructure in a more comprehensive fashion. Threat intelligence platform solutions enable healthcare organizations to improve the overall security of their supply chain, and patch its existing cybersecurity issues, whilst maintaining its daily operations.

    "article_text": "Leadership CIO Network The Crucial Role Of Healthcare CIOs In AI Governance By David Chou , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. David Chou is a nationally recognized healthcare technology executive Follow Author Aug 02, 2024, 12:26pm EDT Share Save This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images AI can significantly enhance efficiency in healthcare organizations' clinical and operational settings. However, many lack the proper governance to utilize AI tools effectively. To begin their organization's AI journey, healthcare CIOs must lead this strategic process, focusing on four key pillars in the governance model. AI Ready Culture For AI to be implemented effectively in healthcare, CIOs and executive leaders must build a culture that embraces this transformation. Organizations should consider integrating AI gradually, allowing for a smooth transition and reducing the shock of sudden process overhauls. One common misconception about AI is that it will replace human workers. Leaders must communicate that AI aims to enhance efficiency and patient care, not to eliminate jobs. By fostering an environment that sees AI as a supportive tool, healthcare professionals can become more open to adopting and integrating these technologies into their workflows. An example of AI's helpfulness is its ability to manage large data sets and identify patterns not immediately apparent to human eyes, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Meanwhile, healthcare CIOs are implementing ambient AI solutions to enhance the patient experience. AI Data Governance Establishing effective data governance has been a significant pain point for CIOs and data leaders in healthcare organizations. This task is challenging because it requires organizational leaders to define data definitions, which is tedious and time-consuming. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor AI data governance must now address discrimination, bias, and equity. Organizations must design and monitor AI systems to prevent discriminatory outcomes and ensure equitable healthcare delivery. Critical tasks include collaborating with stakeholders like healthcare providers, researchers, and patient advocates to identify and mitigate bias in AI algorithms. They must train AI systems on diverse and representative datasets to reflect varied patient populations. Healthcare organizations must implement continuous monitoring and independent audits to verify that AI tools perform as intended and maintain equity in healthcare delivery. Lifelong AI Learner Investing in education and training for the healthcare workforce on AI is crucial for successful implementation. Healthcare professionals must understand AI technologies and their limitations. Training programs should emphasize the ethical use of AI, its capabilities, and how to integrate AI tools into clinical workflows. This training empowers healthcare providers to use AI responsibly and effectively, enhancing patient care and operational efficiency. AI technology will become as essential in healthcare as smartphones are in everyday life. Just as smartphones integrate various functionalities to enhance daily activities, AI will be a versatile tool in healthcare, streamlining operations and improving patient care. Patient First Patient safety must be the foremost concern in any AI deployment. AI applications should enhance, not compromise, patient care. Healthcare organizations must rigorously validate AI to ensure it improves health outcomes, recognizing the need to personalize each result. Protecting patient privacy is paramount in developing and deploying AI tools. These tools must comply with all relevant privacy regulations and safeguard patient information from unauthorized access. Key steps include developing AI with a privacy-first mindset and implementing robust data protection measures and access controls. In conclusion, healthcare CIOs can lead responsible AI governance for their organizations by ensuring robust data governance, protecting patient privacy, strengthening cybersecurity, and educating the workforce on AI technologies. These steps allow CIOs to guide organizations toward effective and ethical AI implementation, ultimately enhancing patient care and operational efficiency. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

There was also an influx of new state legislation, including efforts to directly restrict private equity investment, but many efforts failed to pass this legislative term. This Holland & Knight alert provides a midyear review of the ongoing federal and state scrutiny focused on private equity investments in the healthcare industry and what investors and platform companies can expect for the rest of the year. At the end of last year, Holland & Knight predicted that \"the current enforcement environment will continue into 2024 and will focus heavily on the healthcare industry, along with private equity transactions or 'roll-ups.' Companies in those industries should expect heightened scrutiny leading to more antitrust investigations and litigation.\" (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, \" A Year in Review in Healthcare Antitrust: What Healthcare Providers Need to Know ,\" Dec. 15, 2023.) As the summer draws to a close, the speed of proposed legislation at the state level, as well as the states taking first-mover positions, have been a surprise. At the macro level, the first half of 2024 saw two U.S. senators propose bills attempting to regulate private equity's involvement in the healthcare industry while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) aggressively targeted private equity for its role in healthcare. Although Congress appears more focused on other pressing matters, the FTC might find support from key state attorneys general in future actions, making a possible change in the agency's administration less impactful. We also saw an influx of new state legislation, including efforts to directly restrict private equity investment. Many bills either failed to pass or may not pass in time before the end of the legislative sessions, suggesting 1) a reduced appetite by states to burden themselves with increased administrative oversight without fully assessing the need and 2) increased industry stakeholder involvement in the discussion of those laws. Some of these bills, however, may be resuscitated during the 2025 legislative sessions. The speed at which these bills are being introduced suggests coordination of efforts across state lines. Amid a flurry of activity at both the state and federal level (especially with regulators reacting to Steward Health Care's financial situation), this report provides a summary of the activity year to date and looks at what healthcare investors and platform companies can expect for the rest of the year. Proposed Federal Legislation This year's federal legislative session saw the introduction of two new pieces of legislation aimed at curbing private equity investment in healthcare. First, The Health Over Wealth Act introduced by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and second, The Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). These laws, among other things, would require private equity-backed businesses to conduct more public reporting. Private equity sponsors would also be required to obtain licenses to make healthcare investments and private equity sponsors and healthcare executives could potentially be subject to criminal and civil penalties if their actions are found to have contributed to the death or injury of patients. Although there is a growing interest in private equity and healthcare-focused federal legislation, little substantive action has been taken on either of these bills. The 2024 legislative session is heading toward its August recess and will end in early January 2025. Various other controversies seem to be in focus, which may make it unlikely anything will come to fruition with respect to private equity investments in healthcare. If Republicans have control of either the Senate or House in 2025, restrictive legislation aimed at private equity firms may face substantial headwinds during next year's legislative session. FTC's Focus on Private Equity's Role in Healthcare The FTC and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a joint request for information in May that focused on private equity's role in the consolidation of healthcare organizations (Healthcare RFI) and even held public workshops that highlighted the FTC's concerns. Private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, however, scored a win with its dismissal from an FTC action targeting alleged \"roll-up strategies\" of a portfolio company. (For more information, see Holland & Knight's previous alerts, \" Recent Ruling Shows Healthcare Private Equity Firms a Path Through the New Antitrust Era ,\" June 4, 2024, and \" Private Equity Firm Welsh Carson Dismissed from FTC Antitrust Action ,\" May 15, 2024.) The FTC and DOJ responded by posting a second request for information (RFI) focused on serial acquisitions and \"roll-up strategies\" with an emphasis on private equity's role across multiple industries, including healthcare. On the last day of the comment period for the Healthcare RFI, 11 attorneys general 1 filed a comment expressing concerns about private equity's role in healthcare. The letter claimed private equity investments increased the debt burden on the industry and resulted in cost-cutting pressures and increased prices for consumers, which the letter asserts have lowered quality and decreased access to healthcare. The letter also discussed alleged negative effects on hospitals, nursing homes and physician practices, citing examples including the Steward Health Care bankruptcy in May 2024. The attorneys general pressed the federal government to \"explore all avenues to prevent conduct by private equity in healthcare that harms patients, healthcare workers, and taxpayers.\" They also called for increased transparency of private equity ownership and control, banning anticompetitive contractual provisions in federal contracts, such as anti-steering, and offered a joint state-federal investigation of potentially anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. In defense of private equity investment in the healthcare industry, the American Investment Council filed a public comment that provided arguments that private equity investment improved quality of care and operational efficiencies, increased access to care in rural communities and provided necessary capital for better management, advanced technologies and new treatment offerings. In addition, the FTC finalized its final rule on the restrictions of noncompetes, which has significant implications for the healthcare industry. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, \" New FTC Rule Bans Non-Compete Agreements in All Employment Contracts ,\" April 23, 2024.) Since the FTC finalized its rule, one federal judge has upheld the rule, while another has attempted to block it. Although the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued the FTC to block the regulation, it remains to be seen what will happen to the rule that is to go into effect on Sept. 4, 2024. (See Holland & Knights previous podcast, \" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Sues the FTC Over Power Grab ,\" May 29, 2024.) Additional challenges would appear inevitable following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo that overturned the Chevron deference. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, \" What's Next for the Regulatory Landscape Post- Chevron ? ,\" July 2, 2024.) Successful State Legislation Indiana: Signed into law on March 1, 2024, Indiana's Senate Bill No. 9 2 – Reporting of Health Care Entity Mergers and Acquisitions – became effective on July 1, 2024 (Indiana Law). On its face, the Indiana Law appears to be one of the broadest state healthcare transaction review laws enacted to date. However, several unanswered questions remain regarding the applicability of the Indiana Law given the lack of defined terms and written guidance. Other than a fairly limited FAQ (Indiana FAQ) 3 provided by the Indiana Office of the Attorney General (Indiana AG), Indiana has not yet promulgated regulations, rules or guidance related to the Law. Noteworthy elements of this legislation include: $10 Million Threshold. The Indiana law requires that an Indiana healthcare entity that is involved in a merger or acquisition with another healthcare entity where the sum total of each of the healthcare entities' assets, including combined entities and holdings, meets or exceeds $10 million, 4 to provide written notice to the Indiana AG's office 90-days prior to the anticipated date of the transaction. Healthcare entities include any organization or business that provides medical, surgical or dental services as well as private equity partnerships. Transaction Size Doesn't Matter. The Indiana Law is focused on the total assets of each of the transacting parties and does not reference the size of the transaction. Indiana Location. The Indiana Law does not contain any limitation on the location of assets inside or outside of Indiana, although the Indiana FAQ states that at least one of the healthcare entities must be located in or provide services in Indiana to trigger the requirement to provide written notice. Direct Acquisitions of Physician Groups. Though the Indiana Law still has certain undefined features that make it difficult to fully analyze the precise impact on healthcare investors, it appears to capture the direct acquisition of a physician group's assets by a private equity management service organization (MSO) – given that the \"merger and acquisition\" definition includes the acquisition of a healthcare entity's assets . Remains to Be Seen. It is not entirely clear whether, and to what extent, the Indiana Law might trigger AG notice for upstream affiliated MSO entity-level transactions that do not directly or indirectly impact the governance or control of any downstream MSO-contracted physician practice entities or other healthcare entities. It is possible that these types of transactions may not trigger a notice; a private equity partnership, although defined as one of the types of \"healthcare entities,\" only appears to be a \"healthcare entity\" only if it is seeking to enter a merger or acquisition with another healthcare entity that is not a private equity partnership. 5 For those with pending transactions that could require Indiana AG notice under the Indiana law, the AG has provided an email address to submit clarifying questions. 6 At some point in the near future as the Indiana AG receives more questions and future submissions, it is likely that the Indiana AG will provide additional direction through sub-regulatory guidance or the promulgation of actual regulations to help provide more clarity on the parameters of the Indiana law. Pending State Legislation and Rules California. Even though California's existing law went live on Jan. 1, 2024, regulators and legislators spent the last seven months exploring how to increase the scrutiny of healthcare transactions and private equity investment in the healthcare industry. The Health Care Quality and Affordability Act 7 (California Act) and its implementing regulations already serve as one of the most onerous state healthcare transaction laws in the nation. However, California's Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) recently has been seeking how to expand its reach on healthcare transactions after only a few filings has been made to date. Moreover, Assembly Bill 3129, another proposed bill covering the subject that is discussed in detail below, looks to add 1) a separate pathway for attorney general review of certain private equity investments in healthcare and 2) restrictions on private equity's control of physician and dental practices. OHCA's Proposed Revisions to its Regulations OHCA recently proposed significant revisions to the California Act's regulations after receiving only two submissions to date since Jan. 1, 2024. Though the final revisions may not be available for some time, the most significant proposed changes from prior drafts are highlighted below: \"Subject Of.\" OHCA proposed that a healthcare entity must file if it is the subject of a material transaction involving other parties. The \"subject of\" language applies to a healthcare entity when it concerns its assets, control, responsibility, governance or operations in whole or in part. A transaction with a parent company of a healthcare entity could also trigger an obligation to file. Revenue Threshold Changes. The proposed revisions expand the language around which entities are considered part of the revenue threshold to also potentially tie in subjects of the transaction (as discussed above) as well as parent entities, or any entity that owns or controls the healthcare entity undergoing the analysis. These proposed revisions showcase an intent by OHCA to capture more transactions, but also raise more questions. For example: What are the bounds of the \"subject of\" language? Would it include a landlord, an electronic medical records provider or a management services organization? By folding in parent entities, how far up the chain in the organization will be affected? Will this capture out-of-state transactions conducted by parent corporations of healthcare entities in California? Holland & Knight submitted a public comment to OHCA that dives deeper into the proposed regulations. In its board meeting on June 26, 2024, OHCA acknowledged public comments (including Holland & Knight's) but it did not address them. Rather, OHCA seemed concerned about private equity using \"loopholes\" to conduct transactions above the healthcare entity level. It remains to be seen what additional revisions will be made to the proposed regulations. OHCA projects it will post a notice of emergency rulemaking on Aug. 6, 2024. If that occurs, the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL) would open a review for public comments Aug. 21-25, 2024. OAL would review any received public comments for 10 days and any revisions would become effective Sept. 3, 2024. 8 AB 3129 – Subjecting Private Equity Investment in Healthcare to Attorney General Review California Assembly Bill 3129 9 (the California Bill) introduced in February 2024 would require private equity and hedge funds to receive the California Attorney General's consent before conducting certain healthcare transactions in California. (For detailed discussions of the California Bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alerts, \" California Court Decision Further Scrutinizes the Friendly PC Model – Now What? ,\" June 24, 2024, \" New Bill Would Empower California AG to Curtail Healthcare Private Equity Transactions ,\" June 12, 2024, and \" Private Equity Healthcare Transactions Under Scrutiny ,\" March 14, 2024.) On May 21, 2024, the California Bill passed the Assembly and moved to the Senate where it faced additional reviews and amendments. On June 27, 2024, there was a win for the healthcare industry when the drafters removed a vague section that if read broadly could have prohibited private equity-backed Management Services Organizations (MSOs) and Dental Services Organizations (DSOs) from providing management services to practices. The drafters also broadened the definition of hedge fund to include entities that solely provide or manage debt financing secured in whole or in part by the assets of a healthcare facility, including, but not limited to, banks and credit unions, commercial real estate lenders, bond underwriters and trustees. The California Bill now sits with the Senate Committee on Appropriations, which has scheduled its hearing on Aug. 5, 2024. 10 There is not much time remaining to complete the legislative process, as the last day for bills to pass is Aug. 31, 2024, and the California governor's last day to sign or veto bills is Sept. 30, 2024. 11 If enacted by these deadlines, the California Bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2025. 12 Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania legislature has three proposed bills ( H.B. 2012 , 13 H.B. 2344 14 and S.B. 548 15 ) sitting in both the state House of Representatives and Senate that aim to impose notification requirements on healthcare facilities, systems or providers engaging in certain healthcare transactions. H.B. 2012's requirements also capture out-of-state healthcare companies, either medical or dental, that generate at least $10 million in revenue from in-state patients. Parties subject to the bills would be required to provide notice of a transaction involving a merger, acquisition or affiliation with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office 90 to 120 days prior to the effective date of the agreement. Pennsylvania's legislature is on a break and will not reconvene until Sept. 16, 2024. It remains to be seen if one or more of these bills will make progress prior to the 2024 session closing on Nov. 14, 2024. Stalled Bills Connecticut. Proposed legislation in Connecticut would have required the state's Office of Health Strategy to develop and implement a plan by Jan. 1, 2025, concerning private equity firms acquiring or holding ownership interest in healthcare facilities (Connecticut Bill). The plan would include an assessment of whether a certificate of need (CON) should be required for private equity firms looking to acquire a healthcare facility as well as recommendations for disclosure and notice requirements. The Connecticut Bill covered all healthcare institutions including, but not limited to, hospitals, hospice, residential home care, nursing homes, substance use treatment facilities, outpatient clinics and clinical laboratories. The Connecticut Bill currently sits in committee and failed to pass during this year's legislative session, which has closed for 2024 and will not resume until early 2025. See H.B. 5319 . Massachusetts. In 2024, a healthcare bill was reintroduced in Massachusetts intended to protect community hospitals from unfair competition by enhancing the scope of the existing market review process. The original version, H.B. 4653 (Massachusetts Bill), initially proposed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives, would broaden the reach of the commonwealth's Health Policy Commission (HPC) by requiring material change notices for any transactions involving a \"significant equity investor,\" which was defined as any private equity company with a financial interest in a provider or other investors with at least a 10 percent interest. The Massachusetts Bill also would have allowed the HPC to examine size and market share of corporate affiliates or significant equity investors, limit the amount of debt a provider organization with private equity investment could acquire and potentially would have added a layer of review concerning reporting and fees of oral healthcare providers. The Massachusetts Bill was passed by the state House and sent to the state Senate, where it was debated and then passed with amendments, reemerging as S. 2881 . The Senate's version made substantial changes to the Massachusetts Bill, including making any transactions with private equity firms reviewable and granting the HPC the ability to make adjustments to transactions. Moreover, the amended version added a new section that codified many standard corporate practice boundaries on the operations of MSOs, but also added restrictions that would invalidate many standard contract provisions between MSOs and medical practices. The Senate's version was sent back to the House where it was not accepted. The Senate insisted on its amendment and appointed a committee of conference. The House and Senate failed to reach a consensus by July 31, 2024 (the end of the legislative session). It remains to be seen if the Massachusetts Bill will remerge in some form in subsequent formal or informal legislative sessions. Minnesota. Minnesota legislation ( HF 4206 in conjunction with SF 4392 ) would have prohibited any private equity company or real estate investment trust (REIT) from acquiring or increasing ownership interest in or financial control over a healthcare provider. A healthcare provider was defined in the statute as \"any entity that provides health or medical care services for a fee.\" 16 It would have included nursing homes, clinics, ambulatory centers, dental organizations and physician organizations. The Minnesota Bill was proposed earlier this year and ended up in the Committee of Commerce Finance and Policy by the end of the 2024 legislative session. The session will not resume until January 2025. Oregon. The Oregon Legislature introduced a bill this past session that would have prohibited doctors and other healthcare professionals in a healthcare company from owning shares, holding director or officer positions or having a significant role in both the medical practice and an MSO. An MSO would also be prohibited from hiring, firing or telling medical workers how to perform their jobs, and medical professionals would be prohibited from exercising any management or control over the dealings of the MSO. The bill also would have voided any noncompetes, nondisclosures or nondisparagement agreements between any business entity and medical professionals. The bill did not pass during the 2024 legislative session. The 2025 session will begin early next year. See H.B. 4130 B . Washington. Legislation was reintroduced legislation in Washington to enhance the state's requirements concerning material change notices under its existing law . The bill would have required parties to give notice to the Attorney General 120 days prior to the closing of a transaction instead of 60 days. It also would have broadened the scope of who must give notice, including insurance holding companies and parent organizations of healthcare services providers. It required that any material change transaction must result in improved health outcomes, increased access to medically underserved areas, reduced costs for patients and other various aims for the public good. The bill did not pass in the 2024 regular session and currently sits with the Senate in committee. The legislature will not reconvene until early 2025. See S.B. 5241 . Final Takeaways Although we anticipate that the FTC and certain states will continue to propose and enforce more stringent measures against private equity firms investing in healthcare organizations, other states are remaining on the sidelines and taking their time to study their markets, transactions filed to date and current regulatory frameworks. With the exception of Indiana, most proposed state legislation has not been successful so far this year. This suggests a more cautious approach from states, which may fear overburdening their healthcare agencies and attorneys general with additional review requirements, as well as greater participation from the industry in crafting legislation and regulations. Many of the stalled bills are not necessarily dead, however, and may resurface during the 2025 legislative sessions. Holland & Knight will continue tracking these bills and providing updates as information becomes available. For additional information, please contact the authors.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! The American health care system is broken. Conflicts of interest dominate the structure, killing any chance we have for a healthier nation. Patients pay more and stay sick. Politicians argue and nothing changes. But this problem presents a unique opportunity for our fractured society: as \" Fox and Friends Weekend\" co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy said last week , better health outcomes may be the most unifying issue of our time. In 2019, to no great fanfare, the Trump administration made vital adjustments to set the stage for transforming today’s chronic disease system that keeps patients sick to a true health system that makes people well. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump (Getty Images) Under the leadership of Seema Verma, then director of our nation’s Medicaid and Medicare systems, we developed crucial infrastructure to demonstrate the transformative potential of integrated health care systems. Simply put, four new Medicare billing codes were added to fund chronic care management and continuous remote disease monitoring. 5 STEPS TOWARD A FRESH APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE REFORM With this, we set a course to address more than 75% of the nation’s $4 trillion in annual health care costs: chronic disease management. Before we could implement this simple bipartisan reform, the coronavirus pandemic seized the world. Priorities changed quickly. These codes, and the work that went into establishing them, are still the foundation of fundamental reform. The next administration, Republican or Democrat, must follow through on that work to transform structural health care problems. This will cut costs while improving the health of our nation. Video Our problems are driven by the conflict of interest between health care providers and insurers. Providers are incentivized to maximize patient visits and treatments; insurers strive to minimize payouts. This misalignment plagues our nation with fragmented care, higher costs and poor patient outcomes. AI COULD PREDICT WHETHER CANCER TREATMENTS WILL WORK, EXPERTS SAY: ‘EXCITING TIME IN MEDICINE' Indeed, this conflict kills. To address this, we must integrate health care services with insurance functions under a unified model. Integrated and aligned, health care providers and insurers work together to improve patient health outcomes. By also leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and \"internet of things\" (IoT), we will create continuous and proactive engagement with patients, particularly those with chronic conditions. This model provides personalized care and early interventions, reducing the need for costly emergency treatments and hospitalizations. Video HOW AI IS REVOLUTIONIZING THE WORLD OF MEDICINE The primary focus of this model is patient well-being and improved outcomes. AI monitoring helps predict health issues and enables timely interventions which prevent complications and greatly enhance patient outcomes. Importantly, effective chronic disease management also reduces overall costs to the health care system. Continuous monitoring and data analytics allow for better risk assessment and management. Insurers can dynamically adjust premiums based on real-time health data, rewarding patients for healthy behaviors and adherence to treatment plans. This incentivizes patients to take better care of their health and reduces the financial risk for insurers by minimizing high-cost claims. The integration also leads to significant cost savings by reducing administrative overhead and eliminating redundant processes. With a unified system, there is a seamless flow of information between patients, health care providers and insurers. This brings better resource utilization and operational efficiency while improving workflows that highlight prevention. OBAMACARE ISN’T AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. REPUBLICANS SHOULD PUT PATIENTS AND DOCTORS BACK IN CHARGE Video The savings can be reinvested into patient care and technology advancements . This will further improve the system and our nation’s health. For health care providers already integrated, like University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente, the model improves crucial metrics for success: more consistent patient engagement and better health outcomes. Providers will be able to prioritize their time to those who will benefit the most while doctors supervise AI-driven routine interactions. Meanwhile, much healthier patients will enjoy personalized care and lower insurance premiums. HEALTH CARE IS ‘OVERWHELMINGLY COMPLEX’ FOR OLDER ADULTS, EXPERTS SAY: ‘EVER-INCREASING HURDLE’ Video Technology advancements are key to addressing ongoing health care structural problems. AI and IoT devices monitor patient health in real-time, detecting potential health issues early and facilitating timely interventions. For instance, AI can help assess and identify patients at high risk of developing chronic conditions, prompting preventive measures to avert serious health problems. By understanding and engaging patient behaviors, we can encourage adherence to treatment plans and healthy lifestyle choices. To reduce the frequency and severity of claims, chronic disease patients can be urged toward more healthy behavior – \"no more sweets today\" texts can save lives. The integrated model has far-reaching implications for both the health care and insurance sectors. It challenges the traditional silos and fosters a collaborative approach to health care delivery and insurance management. By aligning the goals of both sectors, the model ensures financial incentives are directed toward maintaining and improving patient health, not just managing illness. Video CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This shift toward a proactive, patient-centered approach is particularly transformative for managing chronic diseases , which are major cost drivers in the health care system. With the continuous engagement and personalized care Director Verma envisioned in 2019, patients with chronic conditions can achieve better health outcomes. This saves money and lives. The future of health care is clear and bipartisan: an integrated system focused on improved health outcomes. Building on the infrastructure we established in 2019, this model leverages advanced technologies and a unified approach to healthcare and insurance, promising sustainable and scalable improvements – and better care for all.

    "article_text": "Dublin, Aug. 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Middle East And Africa Practice Management System Market - Forecasts from 2024 to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Middle East and Africa Practice Management System Market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period to reach US$659.902 million by 2029, from US$376.446 million in 2022 Practice management systems improve the ability to meet important regulatory requirements reducing the time and resources required for manual data entry and ensuring that key regulatory data elements are completed by the physician easily by receiving a notification alert. These systems also offer improved and more accurate invoicing procedures and insurance details, as well as alerts for receiving advance beneficiary notice, which helps to reduce claim denials. As a result, using medical practice management software saves time and resources in the long run, propelling the market forward. Middle Eastern companies are migrating to the hybrid cloud as CIOs seek to improve their business applications and competitiveness. The local private clouds are where core applications and sensitive data, such as patient records, are stored. Furthermore, because of government reforms and increased technological breakthroughs in the field of healthcare IT, the software category is expected to account for the notable market share over the projection period. Market Drivers: Increasing healthcare expenditure The healthcare sector in the Middle East is experiencing a significant surge in opportunities. According to trade.gov, the 2022 federal budget of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) allocated a substantial amount of USD 15.8 billion (AED 58.931 billion) for public spending, with 8.4% specifically earmarked for healthcare. Looking ahead to 2023, Saudi Arabia is poised to invest a substantial $50.4 billion in healthcare and social development, representing 16.96 percent of its budget for that year. This allocation makes healthcare the second-largest expenditure, following closely behind education. They are placing a growing emphasis on enhancing healthcare systems and advancing digitalization. This trend is expected to result in a heightened demand for healthcare services, leading to increased investments in healthcare infrastructure and technology. Growing technological advancements The healthcare IT sector in the region is experiencing significant advancements in technology adoption. Smart hospitals are actively integrating sophisticated health management information systems, interconnected medical devices, and digital healthcare records. This shift towards digitization is propelled by the increasing demand for efficient record-keeping, adherence to regulatory standards, and the pursuit of enhanced patient care. Illustrating this technological progression is the initiative taken by Emirates Health Services, which signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to implement an AI-based system in September 2023. The focus of this MoU is to leverage Generative AI technology in the development of patient room monitoring systems. The objective is to elevate the standards of healthcare services, aligning with the strategic priorities and goals of the government and Emirates Health Services (EHS). In the Middle East, the healthcare industry is generating a substantial volume of data, encompassing record-keeping and patient care information. This robust data output underscores the industry's dedication to modernization and its strategic use of technology to achieve improved healthcare outcomes. Market Restraint: Shortage of practicing experts The practice management system market's expansion is expected to be restricted by a scarcity of qualified IT specialists in the healthcare industry, as well as high maintenance and security expenses. The burden of rising healthcare expenses, the necessity for an integrated care system, and increased federal incentives are predicted to boost market expansion, while data privacy concerns and the expensive time required for integration are expected to stifle it. The shortage of on-site IT support services is a significant issue in this market. Middle East and Africa practice management market segmentation by type into integrated and standalone The segmentation of the Middle East and Africa Practice Management Market on type into Integrated and Standalone solutions.

View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.hsdmvj5nr A majority of Australians voted “no” to an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. But if we dig deeper into the data from the 2023 referendum, there is more to learn, especially about the health of Indigenous Australians living in communities with strong opposition to the Voice. It is a picture both striking and urgent. In research published today we show for the first time that Indigenous Australians living in regions more strongly opposed to the Voice had poorer health. When we mapped community-level opposition to the Voice to Australians’ health, we found Indigenous Australians were more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to report poorer general and mental health. But Indigenous Australians were less likely to access health care. These inequalities were larger in areas with higher opposition to the Voice. Our results likely reflect underlying negative attitudes towards Indigenous Australians and fewer culturally sensitive options for accessing health care in some regions. Both impact Indigenous Australians’ health in numerous ways. What we did and what we found We started with the national map of voting patterns to identify regions with the highest level of opposition to the Voice (defined in this study as regions of Australia where more than 72% of community members voted “no”). Next, we compared regions with high versus lower levels of opposition to the Voice with Australians’ health. We did this using a 2021 national survey , which included information on self-reported general health, mental health, and use of health care in the past year. Our study showed that compared to Indigenous Australians living in areas with low opposition to the Voice, Indigenous Australians living in communities with the highest opposition to the Voice were more likely to report poor general and mental health, and were less likely to have visited any health care provider in the past year. We did not see the same disparities for non-Indigenous Australians. For example, in areas with the greatest support for the Voice, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians reported similar levels of poor mental health (16% for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous). Whereas in areas with the strongest opposition to the Voice, 27% of Indigenous Australians reported poor mental health compared with 15% of non-Indigenous Australians. In areas with the greatest support for the Voice, the proportion of Indigenous Australians who had seen any health care provider was 78%, which was higher than the proportion for non-Indigenous Australians, at 71%. But in areas with strongest opposition to the Voice, the proportion visiting any provider was markedly lower for Indigenous Australians (54%) but not for non-Indigenous Australians (68%). Altogether, this suggests that despite being in poorer health, Indigenous Australians living in areas with stronger opposition to the Voice are less likely to access health care. Why is this happening? There are several possible explanations for these results. A strong possibility, which aligns with recent research , is community-level opposition to the Voice could capture underlying negative attitudes towards Indigenous Australians. So what we’re seeing may reflect the impact of such negative attitudes over time on people’s health. This aligns with much international research showing how community-wide stigma and discriminatory environments lead to poorer health among minority and historically marginalised groups. Generally, we see this play out in higher rates of smoking and drinking , and reduced access to health care . These attitudes could impact Indigenous Australians’ experiences of health care. For example, we know previous experiences of racism while accessing health care deters Indigenous people from engaging with mainstream health care . Alternatively, there may not be enough culturally safe health care options in regions with the highest opposition to the Voice. Indigenous leaders in Australia have continued to share their experiences of racism before, during and after the Voice referendum. While the direct impact of racism is evident in the testimony of these individuals, relatively little attention has been paid to the impact of structural racism at the community level. But we cannot say from our research what motivated people to vote “no” and a “no” vote cannot be taken as evidence of racism. But whatever the motivation for voting “no”, it is Indigenous Australians’ health that is uniquely impacted in these high-opposition regions. Where from here? Our results suggest that when it comes to future health policy and programs, we need to consider multiple, community-level solutions. In particular, we should pay particular attention to areas where there was greater opposition to the Voice, as these are the areas associated with the worse health and less use of health care. In these areas, in particular, we need more culturally safe health care , tailored care that is inclusive and free of racism. This is so patients can access relevant and appropriate health services to improve their health . We also need to look more broadly to change community attitudes about Indigenous Australians if we are to reduce systemic racism , stigma and its impacts on health. Our results are just a snapshot The Voice referendum opened our eyes to the fundamental struggle Indigenous Australians face in advancing Indigenous self-determination as the ultimate way to improve life opportunities and health. But our findings reflect just one moment in time. So we need more research to better understand the systemic nature of the observed health disparities. Health and social policy needs to account for these systemic issues and ultimately place greater attention on how community-level attitudes can shape the health of Indigenous Australians.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jul 31, 2024, 07:30am EDT Share Save CEO, Atlas Surgical Group , one of the largest ASC groups in U.S. Author of \"Success in Amb. Surgery Ctrs\" and \"The Healthcare Entrepreneur.\" getty Martin Luther King Jr. once said , “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman.” Healthcare is considered one of the basic foundations of modern society, as its implementation in maintaining population health can improve economic stability and living standards. Healthcare goes beyond health and affects productivity in society overall. Complex health-related challenges in many countries persist within their healthcare systems, which are sources of valuable data on what can go wrong and what must be addressed urgently. The problems are symptomatic of systemic failings that impact access, cost competitiveness and quality care delivery in the context of efficient resourcing. These areas are essential not just to save lives but to protect the viability of healthcare systems in the long term. The Biggest Challenges As I see it, there are seven major challenges in healthcare currently. Access To Care Healthcare access disparities persist across geographies and populations, especially in low-income communities . This can result from the fact that, for certain people, accessing basic healthcare is simply impossible. Health conditions in underserved populations are worsened by deficiencies in healthcare facilities and professionals and the scarcity of services due to the remoteness of certain locations. Healthcare Finance Rising healthcare costs create financial burdens for employers and families, making quality care unattainable. When healthcare remains expensive, many avoid getting help, leading to a multiplication of health conditions and costs. Healthcare costs are among the most significant financial burdens facing Americans , with medical bills being a leading cause of bankruptcy . Quality Of Care Poor care can lead to medical errors or misdiagnoses and even be deadly. In neighborhoods that lack quality care, patients might not be admitted for as long as it can be avoided or not kept in-house for the requisite amount of time needed to heal, sometimes resulting in catastrophic complications that could have been avoided. Workforce Shortfalls Across the world, there is a deficit of health personnel severely limiting the provision of care. Most areas needing this experience are in developing countries, but there is a substantial dearth within areas of most of the developed nations as well. The World Health Organization predicts a global shortage of 10 million health workers by 2030. This jeopardizes the provision of services across the care spectrum. Fragmented Care Healthcare systems often operate in silos, with different providers working in isolation. This makes it difficult for patients to receive coordinated and comprehensive care, leading to poor health outcomes and increased costs . Waste Of Resources Wasted time and money are resources that could be better spent elsewhere in the form of efficient healthcare delivery. Further, a system that does not have seamlessly integrated medical data can cause worse utilization of diagnostic devices that, in turn, can increase patient waiting times and overall costs. Lack Of Patient Engagement Patients who are engaged are more likely to adhere to treatment plans, adopt healthier lifestyles and have better health outcomes. But not every healthcare system correctly includes patients in their care, and failing to do so can interfere with the effectiveness of treatments. The Potential Solutions Meeting these challenges requires broad reforms and commitment from healthcare providers, policymakers and the public. Key steps include: Improving Access To Care Expanding healthcare infrastructure and increasing the availability of medical professionals in underserved areas are crucial steps. I speak loftily, but I've seen how there is so much wastage of funds in areas that are not clinically relevant and just divesting those to medicinal expansion would do the job. Telemedicine can also play a significant role in improving access to care for remote populations. Reducing The Cost Of Care Easier said than done, but implementing cost-control measures, such as negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on drug costs and reducing hospital administrative overhead, can help make healthcare more affordable. Additionally—and this is the hill I will die on—promoting preventive care can reduce the need for expensive treatments in the long term. Enhancing The Quality Of Care Standardizing medical care protocols and investing in quality improvement initiatives can help ensure that everyone receives the same high-quality care. Continuous education and training for healthcare professionals can bring this change around. Addressing Workforce Shortages Investing in the education and training of healthcare workers can lead to some very positive long-term changes. International collaboration to train and deploy healthcare professionals in underserved areas is already underway and appears promising. We should also improve working conditions. Promoting Integrated Care Developing integrated care models that facilitate collaboration among healthcare providers can improve care coordination and patient outcomes. Health information technology can support these efforts. Reducing Waste And Inefficiency Streamlining administrative processes and eliminating unnecessary procedures is the dream of every conscientious doctor. Adopting evidence-based practices and focusing on value-based care can also help. Engaging Patients In Their Care Empowering patients through education and involving them in their decision-making processes can improve outcomes. Tools such as patient portals and mobile health applications can facilitate patient involvement. In closing, healthcare is crucial for ensuring the well-being of people worldwide. However, the system faces numerous challenges that must be addressed through concerted efforts and sustained commitment from all involved. While the path to reform is complex and requires effort and time, the potential benefits are huge and could lead to improved health outcomes and a more equitable healthcare system for the whole world.

On July 17, 2024, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signed into law the Fair Contracting for Health Care Practitioners Act. Effective January 1, 2025, the Act limits the use of non-competes for health care practitioners and requires employers to provide notice to patients of a health care practitioner’s departure. In passing the Act, legislators intended to improve the attraction and retention of health care practitioners in Pennsylvania and limit the negative impacts of non-competes in the healthcare industry. With specific regard to the types of prohibited covenants, the Act renders void and unenforceable any “noncompete covenant” between an employer and health care practitioner “which has the effect of impeding the ability of the health care practitioner to continue treating patients or accepting new patients.” That definition is arguably broad enough to encompass patient nonsolicitation provisions, although such provisions are not specifically referenced. The Act applies only to certain “health care practitioners”: medical doctors, osteopaths, nurse anesthetists, registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The Act also imposes patient notification requirements on all entities falling within the definition of “employer.” Following the departure of a health care practitioner, an employer must notify the health care practitioner’s patients seen within the past year of that: (1) the health care practitioner departed; (2) the patient may receive care from the departed health care practitioner or another health care practitioner, including how the patient can transfer records to another health care practitioner other than with the employer; and (3) the patient may be assigned to another health care practitioner within the employer. Finally, the Act does not restrict the ability of employers to enforce contractual provisions allowing an employer to recover reasonable expenses from a health care practitioner (1) directly attributable to the health care practitioner and accrued within three years prior to separation when the health care practitioner voluntarily separates from the employer; (2) related to relocations, training, and the establishment of a patient base; and (3) amortized over a period of up to five years from the date of separation by the health care practitioner. Importantly, the Act does not restrict: Non-competes one year or less in duration if the health care practitioner voluntarily separates from the employer; or Non-competes executed prior to January 1, 2025. With regard to the non-competes entered in the context of a sale of a business, the Act does not apply to non-competes connected to (1) the sale of a health care practitioner’s ownership interest in an entity or all or substantially all of the assets of the business entity; (2) transactions resulting in the sale, transfer, or change in control of the business entity; or (3) a health care practitioner’s receipt of an ownership interest in the business entity.

    "article_text": "Stacker-Science By Stacker Published July 30, 2024 2:19 PM Rido // Shutterstock Nurses battling burnout are choosing less stressful work environments A nurse taking care of little boy hospitalized in a bed. After years of burnout, many health care professionals are switching jobs or leaving the field entirely as industry challenges and difficult working conditions persist. Health care workers are no strangers to workplace stress. High patient-to-nurse ratios, low pay, and workplace safety concerns have long been typical challenges faced by nurses and other health care providers. It comes as no surprise that health care professions make up about half of the 2024 U.S. News and World Report’s 20 most stressful jobs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high patient volume, a shrinking workforce, and new isolation policies that led to understaffing only exacerbated these challenging dynamics—and they show no sign of letting up. Now, four years after the onset of COVID-19, the 2023 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report indicates burnout levels are still on the rise. An online job bank for health practitioners, Vivian Health , examined data from the Department of Health and Human Services , the Department of Labor , and other sources to explore the myriad factors leading nurses and other health care professionals to make career shifts to avoid burnout. Over a third of health care professionals say their level of burnout is worse this year than in 2023, according to the 2024 Vivian Healthcare Workforce Report . A 2022 National Center for Health Workforce Analysis job satisfaction survey found over half of nurses have considered leaving their profession, citing burnout and stressful work environments as two leading reasons. The picture is more dire in critical care: In 2021, an American Association of Critical-Care Nurses survey found that 67% of nurses planned to leave their current position in the next three years. Amid ongoing struggles, health care workers are making career shifts, opting for less stressful work environments like outpatient settings instead of hospitals and critical care. Vivian Health Long hours drain on mental health A bar chart showing the top reasons for nurses quit their jobs during COVID-19. Safety and stress were the most common. Leading up to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, burnout among the health care workforce had reached “crisis levels,” with about half of nurses and physicians reporting burnout symptoms, according to the National Academy of Medicine. While health care workers have long dealt with challenging working conditions, COVID-19 exacerbated workplace stress. In surveying health care workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 in 2 people felt burned out in 2022, compared to 1 in 3 people who reported burnout levels in 2018. Rising levels of workplace harassment and decreased trust in management were also concurrently reported. Staff shortages, isolation policies, and the politicization of COVID-19 all contributed to burnout among health care workers during the pandemic. Health care workers responsible for implementing mask policies and other COVID-19 restrictions became the enforcers, prompting strained patient relationships. Frontline workers responded to these challenges in several ways. In 2023, 75,000 health care workers went on strike against Kaiser Permanente over wages and staffing shortages, which became the largest health care worker strike in U.S. history. Some health care professionals, discouraged by staffing shortages, low pay, and the rising threat of on-the-job violence, opted to leave the workplace altogether. Others sought opportunities in outpatient settings and clinics, where flexible scheduling and less stressful workdays can allow for an improved work-life balance. Ambulatory care, in particular, is an attractive outpatient setting. With inpatient beds routinely filled in hospitals, ambulatory care that services less acute needs appeal to many health care workers. With their lower costs and shorter required stays, outpatient services like retail clinics, urgent care, and primary care clinics provide a more intimate and cost-effective experience for providers and patients alike. Plus, the field is growing: The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that more than half of the 3.4 million health care jobs will be in ambulatory care services by 2028. Vivian Health Some fields more impacted than others A bar chart showing which nursing fields have had the biggest drops in job satisfaction from 2017 to 2021, including orthopedics, general medical surgical, emergency or trauma care, infectious or communicable disease, and labor and delivery or neonatal care. People in certain health care settings report very high levels of stress, with job satisfaction declining among nurses in emergency and trauma care. Health care workers in critical care settings are also the most likely to experience on-the-job violence in the form of verbal and physical abuse, often from patients’ family members. According to a 2023 global survey of health care workers from 69 different countries, 73% reported experiences of on-the-job violence the year before. Nursing homes are also high-stress environments. While nursing homes reported critical staff shortages, a closer look at workplace data shows the outpatient nursing sector grew by more than 5% from 2020 to 2023. This data indicates that nurses are leaving high-stress assisted living facilities in favor of lower-impact environments, such as at-home health care services. The research examined in the 2022 surgeon general’s advisory addressing burnout suggests workers of color, including those from Black and Asian ethnic backgrounds, across the health care system are at increased risk of burning out. They are more likely to report inadequate access to protective equipment and report higher rates of testing positive for COVID-19. In Indigenous communities, workers face additional challenges, including reduced access to medical resources and frequent hospital closures. People in rural areas deal with similar issues, such as staffing shortages and hospital closures. For early career nurses, challenges related to COVID-19 surges that drained critical staffing pools trickled down to pre-licensure programs. Unable to participate in hands-on preclinical training to limit the spread of pandemics, some studies suggest that nurses who graduated amid the coronavirus pandemic were less prepared to meet the demands of a global health crisis , resulting in higher rates of burnout. Early career nurses whose workload increased during the COVID-19 pandemic were also more likely to report feelings of burnout and fatigue. And, they were three times more likely to self-describe as “emotionally drained,” “burned out,” or “at the end of their rope” than their more tenured colleagues. The compounded consequences of these studies are dire: In 2022, McKinsey researchers projected a gap of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses in the United States by 2025. Dragana Gordic // Shutterstock Health care workers prioritize work-life balance A health care worker leaving a building in uniform. Burnout among health care workers has a profound impact on the entire health care system. It results in poor outcomes for patient care, including decreased time spent between patients and providers, increased medical errors and hospital-acquired infections, and more staffing shortages. Workplace burnout also increases the risk for heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, fertility issues, and other mental and emotional disruptions. Moral distress and moral injury, or the profound guilt or shame when making challenging health care decisions, are also associated with burnout. Addressing burnout in the U.S. health care system will require dramatic changes. Cultural shifts—such as the CDC’s recommendation for more supportive management that includes worker input—could go a long way in relieving stress and retaining health care staff. In 2022, the U.S. surgeon general issued an advisory calling for the protection of the health and safety of all health care workers, sending a strong signal about reducing career fatigue. On a systemic level, creating opportunities for workers to take paid leave or short reset breaks is also recommended. Employers are encouraged to eliminate punitive policies or attitudes toward seeking mental health and substance use treatment that might deter health care workers from accessing these resources. Federal funding for public health and policy investment are also practical steps to curb staff shortages in this sector while ensuring that health care workers, who put so much of their lives into helping others, can thrive.

The President noted that these projects are being undertaken by indigenous Ghanaian contractors, providing direct and indirect jobs to Ghanaians. Upon completion, the Agenda 111 hospitals will employ approximately 67,635 people, significantly boosting employment in the healthcare sector. In addition to infrastructure development, the Akufo-Addo government has recruited 202,527 medical personnel since 2017, including doctors, nurses, support staff, pharmacists, medical herbalists, and allied health professionals. The National Health Insurance Scheme has also seen a resurgence, with active membership increasing from 10.6 million in 2016 to 17.9 million at the end of 2023. “Our work is far from complete. We are committed to continuing our efforts to improve healthcare delivery across the country, with the ultimate goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030,” President Akufo-Addo affirmed. The President’s speech highlighted the significant progress made in healthcare infrastructure under his administration, reflecting a commitment to ensuring access to quality healthcare for all Ghanaians and laying the groundwork for a brighter, healthier future.

    "article_text": "Dublin, July 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global Healthcare Supply Chain Management Market - Focused Insights 2024-2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Healthcare Supply Chain Management Market was valued at USD 3.42 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach USD 5.74 billion by 2029, rising at a CAGR of 9.01% The global healthcare supply chain management market report includes exclusive data on 38 vendors. The healthcare supply chain industry is experiencing consolidation as larger players seek to gain market share, expand their geographic footprint, and enhance their service offerings through mergers and acquisitions. This consolidation trend is reshaping the competitive landscape, with larger, more diversified companies competing against smaller, niche players. Technological innovation drives competition in healthcare supply chain management, with companies investing in advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to optimize processes, improve visibility, and enhance efficiency. Companies that can leverage technology to offer innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of healthcare providers and patients gain a competitive edge in the market. Building strong customer relationships and delivering high-quality service are essential for healthcare supply chain management success. North America accounted for over 40% of the market share and stands first in the global healthcare supply chain management market. The North American market is one of the largest globally. It encompasses a wide range of software offerings designed to address the needs of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, laboratories, medical device manufacturers, and other healthcare entities. The market has been experiencing steady growth due to digitizing healthcare operations, adopting cloud-based solutions, and emphasizing cost containment and operational efficiency. MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS Personalized and Patient-centric Healthcare Personalized and patient-centric healthcare is revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered, focusing on tailoring medical treatment and services to meet each patient's unique needs and preferences. This holistic approach extends beyond clinical care to encompass various aspects of healthcare delivery, including supply chain management. In this context, personalized and patient-centric supply chain management involves optimizing the healthcare supply chain to ensure that the right products are available to patients when and where they need them. This requires shifting from traditional supply chain models to a more agile and responsive approach that considers individual patient characteristics, clinical needs, and care pathways. Key principles guiding personalized and patient-centric supply chain management include demand forecasting and inventory optimization, utilizing data analytics and predictive modeling to anticipate patient demand and adjust inventory levels accordingly. Additionally, customized delivery models are essential, offering flexible options such as home delivery services, mobile healthcare solutions, and personalized medication packaging to enhance convenience and accessibility for patients. Supply chain visibility and transparency are also critical, enabling healthcare providers to track the movement of medical products from manufacturer to patient in real-time, thus proactively addressing supply chain disruptions and ensuring timely delivery of care. By embracing these principles, healthcare organizations can transform the healthcare supply chain into a patient-focused ecosystem that delivers tailored solutions to meet the diverse needs of individual patients, ultimately driving improved outcomes, satisfaction, and value across the healthcare continuum. Adoption of AI and RFID Tracking In recent years, the healthcare industry has witnessed a transformative shift towards leveraging cutting-edge technologies to optimize supply chain processes. Among these technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking have emerged as powerful tools revolutionizing the way healthcare supply chains operate. Adopting AI and RFID tracking solutions offers healthcare organizations unprecedented opportunities to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and traceability throughout the supply chain. AI-powered algorithms are increasingly being integrated into supply chain management systems to analyze vast amounts of data and derive actionable insights. By leveraging AI, healthcare providers can improve demand forecasting accuracy, optimize inventory levels, and identify cost-saving opportunities. Additionally, AI algorithms can streamline procurement processes by automating supplier selection, contract management, and order processing. This reduces administrative burden and ensures timely access to critical medical supplies and equipment. Furthermore, RFID tracking technology has gained traction in healthcare supply chains for its real-time visibility and traceability of assets and inventory. RFID tags embedded in medical products, equipment, and packaging enable automatic identification and tracking as they move through the supply chain. This enables healthcare organizations to accurately monitor the location, status, and condition of assets, reducing the risk of stockouts, expiration of medications, and supply chain errors. Increasing Digital Transformation and Automation in Healthcare The healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with digitalization and automation emerging as key drivers of change. This paradigm shift extends to supply chain management, where the adoption of digital technologies and automation is revolutionizing how healthcare organizations manage inventory, procure supplies, and deliver care. As healthcare providers seek to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes, increasing digital transformation and automation in supply chain management have become imperative. Digital transformation in healthcare supply chain management involves leveraging technology to digitize and streamline processes, from procurement to distribution. Cloud-based supply chain management systems offer a centralized platform for managing inventory, orders, and logistics, enabling real-time visibility, collaboration, and decision-making across the supply chain. Advanced analytics and predictive modeling tools provide insights into demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier performance, empowering healthcare organizations to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource allocation. Furthermore, automation is pivotal in enhancing efficiency and reducing manual intervention in supply chain processes. Robotic process automation (RPA) automates repetitive tasks such as data entry, order processing, and invoice reconciliation, freeing up valuable time and resources for healthcare professionals to focus on more strategic activities. Additionally, automation technologies such as robotic dispensing systems and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) optimize inventory management and warehouse operations, minimizing errors and maximizing throughput. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS Inventory Management and Distribution Logistics Challenges Inventory management and distribution logistics are critical components that significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of delivering care. Fluctuating demand poses a significant challenge for healthcare organizations as predicting and managing inventory levels becomes increasingly complex. Demand for medical products and equipment can vary based on seasonal trends, population demographics, and public health emergencies. Healthcare providers must implement robust demand forecasting techniques and inventory optimization strategies to maintain adequate stock levels to meet patient needs while minimizing excess inventory and stockouts. Inventory management and distribution logistics present significant challenges for healthcare supply chain management. Healthcare organizations must implement robust strategies, leverage technology, and foster collaboration with stakeholders to address these challenges effectively. By optimizing inventory management processes, improving visibility and transparency, and enhancing distribution logistics, healthcare providers can ensure timely access to medical products and equipment, minimize costs, and ultimately enhance patient care delivery.

Zabaneh +2 Authors Your Author LinkedIn Connections To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Article Insights Duane Morris LLP are most popular: within Privacy, Litigation and Mediation & Arbitration topic(s) On July 17, 2024, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signed into law the Fair Contracting for Health Care Practitioners Act. The Act, which will go into effect on January 1, 2025, will limit the use of noncompete covenants for healthcare practitioners in the commonwealth and require employers to provide notice to patients of a healthcare practitioner's departure. According to the Pennsylvania Legislature, the Act is intended to limit what it views as the negative impacts of noncompetition provisions in the employment of covered healthcare practitioners and improve the attraction and retention of those healthcare practitioners in Pennsylvania. How Does the Act Limit Noncompetes with Healthcare Practitioners? Under the Act, any noncompete covenant with a healthcare practitioner signed after the effective date is void unless: The covenant lasts no longer than one year; and The healthcare practitioner was not dismissed by the employer. What Types of Agreements Are Covered by the Act? A \"noncompete covenant\" under the Act is an agreement with a covered healthcare practitioner that \"has the effect of impeding the ability of the health care practitioner to continue treating patients or accepting new patients, either practicing independently or in the employment of a competing employer after the term of employment.\" Covered healthcare practitioners include: Medical doctors; Doctors of osteopathy; Certified registered nurse practitioners; Certified nurse anesthetists; and Physician assistants. The Act allows the use of noncompetes in business agreements related to certain sales or mergers of a business entity and certain transactions resulting in a change of control of the business entity where the healthcare practitioner receives an ownership interest in the business entity. The statute does not precisely define how these requirements might apply in various contractual arrangements once the Act goes into effect. The Act, however, does not affect any existing contracts. What Notice Must Employers Provide to Patients of a Healthcare Practitioner's Departure? Under the Act, within 90 days of a healthcare practitioner's departure, the employer must notify patients seen within the last year and with whom the practitioner had an \"ongoing outpatient relationship\" of two years or more: Of the practitioner's departure; That the patient may be assigned a new practitioner in the employer's practice if the patient chooses to continue receiving care from the employer; and How the patient may transfer health records if the patient chooses to receive care from the departing practitioner or another practice. The notice is not required to include any details related to the departing practitioner's future services. Can Employers Recover Expenses Related to the Healthcare Practitioner? Once the law takes effect, employers will be prohibited from recovering expenses related to relocation, training and establishment of a patient base if the employer terminates or dismisses the healthcare practitioner. Employers will be permitted, however, to recover such reasonable expenses from a healthcare practitioner who elects to terminate his or her employment with that employer, provided those relocation, training and patient-base establishment expenses incurred by the employer can be directly attributed to the separating healthcare practitioner. What Should Employers of Healthcare Practitioners Do Now? Well in advance of the scheduled January 1, 2025, effective date, employers should work with counsel to review and assess potential changes to their current healthcare practitioner agreements and forms, as well as their notices to patients of practitioner departures.

    "article_text": "Infections Spreading in US Hospitals Are on The Rise. Here's Why. Health 29 July 2024 By Nasia Safdar, The Conversation (Virojt Changyencham/Getty Images) A new study from the National Institutes of Health shows a jump in both hospital-acquired infections and resistance to the antibiotics used to treat them. The findings are based on data gathered at 120 U.S. hospitals from January 2018 to December 2022, a five-year period that included the COVID-19 pandemic . Dr. Nasia Safdar , a professor of infectious medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, discusses why infection rates have gone up and how you can protect yourself as a hospital patient or visiting family member. Nasia Safdar discusses the dangers of hospital-acquired infections. The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion that have been edited for brevity and clarity. What are health care-associated infections? Nasia Safdar: These are infections that occur as a result of exposure to the health care system . People coming in for care are typically quite sick, so they're at risk of acquiring bacteria that can then cause an infection while they're in the hospital, or shortly after they're discharged from the hospital. Why do infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant ones, spread so easily in hospitals and other health care settings? Nasia Safdar: There is a certain profile of bacteria and germs that develop in health care facilities. And that profile is typically bacteria that are resistant to many commonly used antibiotics . Patients are already vulnerable and may have compromised immune systems. On top of that, add the risks associated with heavy-duty antibiotic usage, surgeries, procedures and medical devices like urinary catheters and intravascular catheters, which go into the bloodstream. The result is a population at risk for acquiring these bacteria circulating in the environment. What does it mean for an infection to be antibiotic-resistant? Nasia Safdar: For any typical infection, there might be a range of choices for treatment. There is what's called first-line treatment, which is the first antibiotic you would go to . These are typically antibiotics that can treat the infections really well, but without harming the good bacteria that live in your intestine. But when bacteria get resistant to antibiotics, we have to go to more broad-spectrum antibiotics , which might still be effective for treatment but also might have more side effects or destroy some of the good bacteria in the intestine. What can hospitals and clinics do to prevent or reduce the spread of infections? Nasia Safdar: One is infection prevention , and the other is antibiotic stewardship , or the judicious use of antibiotics. Both work synergistically with each other. Within the infection prevention category, you have hand hygiene , which is critical not just for health care personnel but also for patients themselves. There is also the use of gowns and gloves, when necessary, to make sure that if one patient has a transmittable condition, that pathway is interrupted by health care workers wearing the right PPE, or personal protective equipment . I also think only using devices such as urinary catheters or intravascular catheters when they're truly needed is another way to prevent patients from becoming infected. And then, within the antibiotic stewardship category, there's a need to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. What has happened in recent years regarding the rates of health care-associated infections? Nasia Safdar: Before the pandemic, I think the field was quite optimistic because we were seeing reduced rates of antibiotic-resistant, device-related infections. A lot of those gains were reversed after the arrival of the pandemic. There was a lot of unnecessary use of antibiotics during that time. And so now we see sharp increases in many of those antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This has led to concern that whatever success we had was fragile and short-lived. We now want to make sure we're not as vulnerable as we became during the pandemic. Can you give us some background on Candida auris ? Nasia Safdar: Candida auris is an emerging pathogen. Unlike some other antibiotic-resistant germs in health care systems, this one is a fungus – or a yeast, which is the other terminology for it. And it spreads quite quickly in health care systems . Candida auris persists in the environment and on the skin and can cause severe bloodstream infections in vulnerable patients. It has been responsible for a number of outbreaks, and the treatment options are much more limited when compared with other infectious germs. With the arrival of the pandemic, there was a sharp increase in Candida auris infections. They rose by several hundred percent nationwide after smoldering for a while. That sharp spike concerns us. Can the spread of these infections be reduced by manipulating the gut microbiome? Nasia Safdar: Many of these germs live in the intestine. They are generally kept at bay by the good bacteria that we all have in our intestines. But sometimes, when we use antibiotics, or use devices or do surgery, those good bacteria are destroyed . And then these germs can find a hospitable niche and grow and cause infections. Diet plays an important role in keeping our gut microbiome healthy . Most Americans don't get enough fiber . But a high-fiber diet keeps your gut bacteria healthy and helps you put up more of a resistance to germs when they try to invade. What can patients or their families do to reduce the odds of getting an infection in a health care setting? Nasia Safdar: Make sure that both patient and health care workers observe hand hygiene. Use hand sanitizer. It works . It's convenient. It's readily available. It's a great way to prevent infections in health care systems. But there are some instances where you would want to use soap and water instead. Soap and water is a better option when hands are soiled with blood, stool, diarrhea or other body secretions. Also ask about the health care system's rates of infections. Those are things typically tracked closely by health care systems, and the information is often publicly available . Ask your health care team about the medication you're getting for treatments, particularly if they're antibiotics. Then ask how long you should take them, what side effects to anticipate, and the effect they'll have on your gut bacteria. Watch the full interview to hear more.

    "article_text": "facebook icon Over 7,100 Michigan Medicine hospital workers are in a contract battle to win substantial increases in pay and benefits, safe staffing levels and other improvements in working conditions. The workers include physician assistants, medical technicians, respiratory therapists, phlebotomists and patient services staff at the Ann Arbor-based healthcare system, which reported $226.5 million in operating profits for the last fiscal year ending June 30. Michigan Medicine healthcare workers are fighting for safe staffing levels and better pay and working conditions. [Photo: SEIU Michigan] Like other healthcare corporations, Michigan Medicine received hundreds of millions in federal COVID-19 relief funding and has used it, not to improve patient care and the conditions of its workers but to expand its profit-making operations. After securing $256 million in federal funds, Michigan Medicine and its University of Michigan Health subsidiary have been “gobbling up more and more market share in the state,” including the acquisition of Lansing-based Sparrow Health with six hospitals, the construction of a new $920 million healthcare pavilion in Ann Arbor and expansion into the Grand Rapids area. The University of Michigan Board of Regents has resisted workers’ demands and, according to a statement from United Michigan Medicine Allied Professionals (UMMAP), has engaged in a “nine-month-long filibuster” over a new contract. Despite this, UMMAP and the other unions, United Physician Assistants of Michigan Medicine (UPAMM) and Service Employees International Union (SEIU), have not held a strike vote and have organized an impotent “Fair Compensation Request” letter-writing campaign to the UM Board of Regents and a two-hour informational picket on July 29 involving workers who are not scheduled to work. Jerry White, the Socialist Equality Party’s candidate for US vice president, issued the following statement to Michigan Medicine workers: I want to express my solidarity with Michigan Medicine workers, who like healthcare workers across the US and the world, are fighting for wage increases to protect their living standards against the ravages of inflation, safe staffing levels and good working conditions. While Michigan Medicine and other healthcare monopolies are making billions in profits, workers are facing impossibly high housing, education and healthcare costs and are only surviving by increasing their credit card debts. The hospital executives hypocritically called healthcare workers “heroes” as they forced workers into COVID-infected hospitals, leading to the deaths and debilitation from Long COVID of so many of your brothers and sisters. After pocketing billions in federal COVID relief money, they have engaged in a wave of mergers and acquisitions, contracting out whole departments to private equity investors, and conducting a ruthless job- and cost-cutting campaign. This risks the health and lives of workers and patients alike, even as the pandemic rages on. Healthcare workers have been at the forefront of the resurgence of the class struggle over the last several years, including almost of half of the 33 largest strikes in the United States in 2023. But only three healthcare strikes involving 1,000 or more workers have been called this year. That is not because the crisis has lessened. It is because the union bureaucracy is determined to prevent any strikes from interfering with its all-out campaign to elect Kamala Harris and the Democrats. But the Democrats, no less than Trump and the Republicans, defend the for-profit healthcare system, which is responsible for the miserable conditions you and other healthcare workers confront today. This includes Obamacare, which was drafted by the insurance companies and healthcare monopolies and incentivizes hospitals to slash costs and cut staff. This has led to the burnout of healthcare workers, increased infections and preventable deaths in hospitals and the scapegoating of workers like Vanderbilt nurse Radonda Vaught for the inevitable medical errors that occur. Safe staffing and other improvements will not come from appeals to the UM Board of Regents, a gang of corporate executives and politicians who oversaw the brutal suppression of campus protests against the US-backed genocide in Gaza. Nor will it come from the establishment of more joint labor-management staffing committees, which are subordinated to corporate profit. It will only be won through mobilizing the strength of all Michigan Medicine workers in a common strike action and by appealing to broader sections of the working class. This means building rank-and-file committees to transfer power from the union apparatus to the workers on the hospital floor. A special warning must be made about the leaders of the American Federation of Teachers and former UAW President Bob King, who is now the executive director of UMMAP. Both have long served the interests of big business and the Democratic Party, and rank-and-file workers can place no trust in them. Staffing problems are not an accident. They are a deliberate policy. Hospitals are run as leanly as possible to maximize profit. At the same time, the Biden administration has overseen the dismantling of any COVID-19 public health measures, even as the death toll surpasses 420 a day and more than 1.4 million Americans have perished from the virus. The Democrats and Republicans also claim there is no money for decent living standards and healthcare even as they spend $1 trillion on war, and the healthcare giants rake in hundreds of billions. That is why profit must be taken out of the medicine. The Socialist Equality Party calls for the establishment of a socialist healthcare system to guarantee free, high quality healthcare for all. This will only be accomplished through the development of a powerful and politically independent movement of the working class.

Article Insights Ropes & Gray LLP are most popular: within Insurance, Media, Telecoms, IT and Entertainment topic(s) Introduction Massachusetts is one of the latest states expected to pass a law with significant implications for private companies investing in health care businesses in the state. On July 18, 2024, the Massachusetts Senate passed S2871 (H4653), An Act Enhancing the Market Review Process 1 (the \"Bill\"), a redrafted version of a health care reform bill that was passed in the Massachusetts House in May 2024. The House and Senate are meeting in conference committee, and there is momentum in the legislature for a vote of acceptance to occur before the end of the Massachusetts legislative session on July 31, 2024, after which the Bill will go to Governor Maura Healey for signature. Barring the inclusion of additional language stating the Bill will be immediately effective, it will become law 90 days after signing. Similar to the other state health care transaction laws sweeping the country (for more information on these laws, see Navigating Emerging State Regulation of Health Care Map ), the Bill expands the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission's (\"HPC\") authority to review and propose modifications to \"material change\" transactions that the HPC finds would have a negative impact on health care costs. The Bill will also significantly increase reporting requirements and scrutiny by the Center for Health Information and Analysis (\"CHIA\") into investments in health care by private equity (\"PE\") firms, and will prohibit certain arrangements between management services organizations (\"MSOs\") and \"health care practices,\" which will have implications for PE firms and others. Our key takeaways from the Bill, and a summary of relevant provisions, follow. * * * Key Takeaways New Changes Target Private Equity. PE firms and PE-backed health care entities should be aware of increased oversight into PE transactions relating to health care entities. This follows a trend toward increased scrutiny of PE investment in health more broadly by state and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, and Department of Health & Human Services. 2 In particular and as described below, the Bill expands the existing Notice of Material Change (\"MCN\") requirements to capture providers and provider organizations that are owned or controlled by PE firms, such that any transaction with PE firms and other investors must be reported. As many types of transactions with PE firms were previously not subject to the HPC MCN review process, PE firms should now expect to be scrutinized closely. Additionally, the Bill expands the authority of the Attorney General of Massachusetts (\"AG\") to assess and propose modifications to proposed transactions, which also brings investors under more extensive oversight. Taken together, these amendments suggest that more aggressive review of and enforcement against investors should be expected. Further, these changes appear to directly address the issues resulting from the Steward Health Care crisis, and track with current proposed federal legislation by Senators Warren and Markey aimed at addressing corporate and, more specifically, PE firms' involvement in health care. Expanded Transaction Oversight. The Bill expands the HPC's authority to review and recommend modifications to proposed transactions that it finds will have a significant material negative impact on health care consumers. Notably, although the HPC cannot approve or deny any transaction, failure to complete the proposed modifications can give rise to liability under Massachusetts laws governing consumer protection. That said, the Bill empowers, and we are likely to see, the HPC start to impose conditions on transactions, and it will be important to monitor regulations and guidance developed by the HPC should the Bill pass. At its Public Meeting earlier this month, the HPC discussed state policy opportunities including broadening existing state-level health care transparency and oversight processes to include PE firms and imposing conditions on transactions. 3 As written, the language of the Bill introduces uncertainty regarding the time period for a transaction to close and will therefore need to be addressed in the context of definitive agreements between transacting parties to minimize the potential of the HPC imposing onerous conditions on the proposed transaction. Challenges to the Captive-MSO Model. The Bill also impacts the \"friendly PC\" model commonly used by health care entities. As described below, the Bill creates significant limitations on what MSOs can do in Massachusetts. While the Bill largely codified the existing approach taken by regulators in the Commonwealth to MSOs, it also went further to restrict the way MSOs, and others, interact with health care practices, such as by prohibiting MSOs from exercising ultimate control over the finances of the health care practice and prohibiting MSOs from restricting the ability of a person who owns stock in the health care practice to transfer, alienate or otherwise exercise discretion and control over their stock. The new requirements only apply to contracts entered into after the effective date and to businesses that practice through clinicians licensed in medicine, nursing, psychology and social work, but will potentially disrupt future arrangements going forward. Limits on Real Estate Agreements. The sale-leaseback deal between Steward and Medical Properties Trust (\"MPT\"), a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), in which Steward sold its Massachusetts properties to MPT and saddled its hospitals with exorbitant lease payments, has served as a cautionary tale that the legislature seeks to prevent from happening again.. While the House bill prohibited sale-leaseback agreements with REITs, the Bill now requires that the parties to the proposed transaction file an MCN with the HPC prior to effectuating the sale. Further, the Bill adds the definition of an \"unsafe financial actor\" to include REITs with a financial interest in a provider or provider organization closing, declaring bankruptcy, or otherwise discontinuing its operations within 15 years of the REIT's interest in the provider or provider organization. * * * Summary of Material Changes The Bill amends the Commonwealth's MCN requirements and increases reporting requirements by health care entities. Currently, Massachusetts law requires health care service providers and provider organizations to notify the HPC, CHIA, and the AG 60 days \"before making any material change to its operations or governance structure.\" This requires entities to notify regulators of prospective transactions, although the current law does not single out any particular investor type and does not allow the HPC to propose modifications to a transaction. The Bill expands the MCN process to require notice (i) when a for-profit entity makes a significant new investment in or acquires, or gains ownership or direct or indirect control of, a provider or provider organization, (ii) for substantial acquisitions or sales of assets for an ownership share or for the purpose of a lease-back arrangement; and (iii) if a covered entity converts from nonprofit to for-profit status. 4 The Bill gives the HPC the authority to assess a penalty against a provider organization that fails to provide requested information of up to $10,000 per week for each week of delay, with a maximum annual penalty of $500,000. For proposed transactions involving for-profit investors, the Bill requires additional information to be submitted, including fully audited financial information of the investor and any other health care entity acquired by the investor for the preceding five fiscal years. The HPC may require post-transaction submissions from the health care entity for all transactions for a period of five years to assess the impacts of the transaction and compliance with any conditions or commitments agreed to in the notice and approval process. The Bill also allows the HPC to review additional factors relating to the proposed transaction in a cost and market impact review (\"CMIR\") and recommend modifications to those proposed transactions. The HPC may request information from any provider, provider organization, payer, investor or other party associated with the proposed transaction. A private party's failure to modify the proposed material change can give rise to liability associated with the material change application under Massachusetts laws governing consumer protection. The Bill empowers the AG to bring an injunction to block the transaction if the criteria assessed in the CMIR are met. The Bill also expands the AG's authority to collect information from private investment entities and issue civil investigatory demands on institutional providers and their parent organizations. 5 This provision goes further than the existing law or the House bill passed in the spring. The Bill imposes new restrictions for PE-backed provider organizations and reporting and financial requirements for PE firms. The Bill extends CHIA authority to collect more extensive information from provider organizations (for example, financial information about a parent entity's out-of-state operations, and financial information about corporate affiliates). 6 The Bill imposes new restrictions on PE-backed provider organizations—these entities (i) must meet a certain maximum adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio; and (ii) may not become highly leveraged or transact with an \"unsafe financial actor.\" 7 During the term of the investment, the provider organization may not provide capital distributions, perform stock buybacks, stock redemptions or similar transactions, pay to a PE firm management fees or similar fees or costs; or \"perform any other action or exceed any other metric the commission determines may cause a provider organization to become financially distressed.\" The Bill requires a PE firm to deposit a bond with the Department of Public Health upon submission of an MCN and cannot use provider or provider organization assets. The HPC determines the amount of the bond, which will equal the provider's or provider organization's estimated operating expenses for one year plus friction of administering the bond. The Bill also allows CHIA to assess penalties on entities that fail to provide requested information within two weeks following the receipt of the written notice of up to $25,000 per week for each week the requested information is delayed. 8 The Bill expands corporate practice of medicine (\"CPOM\") requirements relating to clinical interference and ownership and places restrictions on the types of services that an MSO can provide under a management services agreement. The Bill applies to health care practices in any form, through which registered practicing clinicians offer health services. It also enhances the CPOM clinical interference provision, prohibiting MSOs from conducting certain common activities on behalf of health care practices, such as negotiating with third-party payers without prior informed consent. Further, the Bill prohibits MSOs from entering into agreements where any \"health care practice\" would be unable to exercise complete control and discretion over the finances or capital of the health care practice, including, but not limited to, restricting the ability to create, buy or sell stock; issue dividends or sell the health care practice; or restrict the ability of a person who owns stock in the health care practice to transfer, alienate or otherwise exercise unfettered discretion and control over their stock. The Bill places restrictions on the types of services that an MSO can provide under a management services agreement. Under the Bill, a health care practice must maintain ultimate decision-making authority over (i) personnel decisions; (ii) coding or billing decisions; (iii) the selection and use of property; (iv) the number of patients seen in a given period of time or the amount of time spent with each patient; (v) the appropriate diagnostic test for medical conditions; (vi) the use of patient medical records; (vii) referral decisions; and (viii) any other clinical function. Notably, the definition of \"health care practice\" under the Bill only captures a business that practices through clinicians licensed in medicine, nursing, psychology, and social work. Among other changes, the Bill also imposes additional disclosure requirements for hospitals seeking licensure and licensing requirements for a new class of entities including, pharmacy benefit managers, urgent care centers, and office-based surgery. Further, while the House bill prohibits sale-leaseback agreements with REITs, this Bill requires a formal MCN before such arrangement can be effectuated.

    "article_text": "More Omanis visiting Malaysia for healthcare, tourism Kabeer Yousuf Published: 8:33 PM, Jul 28, 2024 The rising number of tourists from Oman adds to the growing number of visitors seeking Malaysian medical care from around the world SHARE Listen As many as 18,078 tourists from Oman visited Malaysia in 2023, with nearly 1.36 per cent of them being healthcare tourists, according to a tourism roadshow by the Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) recently held in Muscat. This increasing trend in the number of healthcare tourists visiting the South Asian country is due to frequent direct flights and the local authorities combining the concept of hospitality with healthcare, which has been attracting Omani tourists in large numbers. According to representatives of MHTC from Kuala Lumpur, the rising number of tourists from Oman adds to the growing number of visitors seeking Malaysian medical care from around the world. The concept of healthcare tourism has been gaining popularity worldwide, with many GCC guests preferring to receive medical treatment while on holiday. The availability of convenient direct flights to Kuala Lumpur offered by Oman Air and SalamAir further supports this trend. Malaysian healthcare is accessible not only in terms of transportation, but also in terms of short waiting times for healthcare appointments. \"We receive a significant number of health tourists from Oman, as well as other GCC countries, in various medical facilities in the country. Patients from Australia, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UK and the USA also seek healthcare services in Malaysia,\" a tourism representative said. The Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) has 92 member hospitals that provide this service, and some of the hospitals where Omanis seek treatment include Prince Court Medical Center, Sunway, Alpha IVF, Subang Jaya Medical Center, KPJ Tawakkal, Pantai Hospital, TMC Fertility, KPJ Ampang Puteri Specialist Hospital, and Gleneagles Hospital in cities like Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Treatments are sought in various specialisations such as cardiology, fertility, oncology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, urology, neurology, aesthetics, dental care, health screening and premium wellness.

    "article_text": "Decoding Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH): A Strategic SWOT Insight GuruFocus Research July 26, 2024 5 min read MOH Robust growth in premium revenue, up 17% from the previous year. Strategic acquisitions and contract wins expanding market presence. Challenges with Medicaid redeterminations and competitive bidding processes. Opportunities in government-sponsored healthcare programs amidst evolving market dynamics. Molina Healthcare Inc ( NYSE:MOH ), a leading provider of managed healthcare services, recently released its 10-Q filing on July 25, 2024. The company, known for its Medicaid-related solutions for low-income families and individuals, operates through a network of subsidiaries licensed as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The filing reveals a significant increase in premium revenue, reaching $9.4 billion for the quarter, up from $8.0 billion in the previous year. This growth is a testament to the company's expanding membership base and strategic initiatives. However, the net income saw a slight decrease from $309 million to $301 million year-over-year, indicating areas where operational efficiencies could be enhanced. As we delve into a SWOT analysis, we will explore the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Molina Healthcare Inc's market position and future prospects. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with MOH. Decoding Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Financial Growth and Stability: Molina Healthcare Inc has demonstrated robust financial performance, with a 17% increase in premium revenue year-over-year. This growth is attributed to an expanding membership base across all segments, primarily due to new Medicaid contract wins, acquisitions, and organic growth within the company's current footprint. The consistent rise in premium revenue underscores the company's ability to attract and retain members, which is a critical strength in the competitive healthcare market. Strategic Acquisitions and Market Expansion: The company's strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of ConnectiCare, have bolstered its market presence and diversified its offerings. With approximately 140,000 new members added from this acquisition alone, Molina Healthcare Inc is well-positioned to leverage its increased scale to drive operational efficiencies and negotiate favorable terms with providers. Additionally, the company's successful bids for new contracts, such as the Medicaid contract in Mississippi, further solidify its competitive edge and growth trajectory. Investment Income and Cost Management: Molina Healthcare Inc's investment income has seen a 19% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year, contributing positively to the company's operating income. Moreover, the company has maintained a disciplined approach to managing its general and administrative expenses, achieving a lower G&A ratio compared to the previous year. This financial prudence enhances the company's ability to reinvest in growth initiatives and manage medical costs effectively. Story Continues Weaknesses Dependence on Government Contracts: A significant portion of Molina Healthcare Inc's revenue is derived from government-funded programs, making it susceptible to changes in policy, funding, and competitive bidding processes. The recent exclusion of Molina Healthcare of Virginia as an awardee for the Cardinal Care Managed Care procurement highlights the risks associated with reliance on government contracts. Such developments can impact the company's revenue streams and necessitate a strategic response to mitigate potential losses. Operational Challenges: The company faces operational challenges, such as the impact of Medicaid redeterminations, which could affect membership retention and revenue projections. Additionally, the cybersecurity incident involving Change Healthcare, a major claims processing vendor, underscores the need for robust data security measures and contingency planning to ensure uninterrupted operations and protect member data. Market Concentration Risks: Molina Healthcare Inc's business is concentrated in a few key states, such as California, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. While this concentration has contributed to the company's growth, it also exposes the company to risks associated with regulatory changes, economic downturns, or competitive pressures within these specific markets. Diversifying its geographic footprint could help mitigate these risks and ensure long-term stability. Opportunities Growth in Government-Sponsored Programs: The evolving dynamics of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces and the increasing integration of Medicare and Medicaid programs present significant opportunities for Molina Healthcare Inc. The company's expertise in managing government-sponsored healthcare plans positions it well to capitalize on these trends and expand its member base. Technological Advancements: Investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and other technological innovations offer opportunities for Molina Healthcare Inc to enhance operational efficiencies, improve care management initiatives, and reduce administrative costs. Embracing digital transformation can also lead to improved member experiences and competitive differentiation in the market. New State Contracts and Expansions: The company's proactive approach to bidding for new state contracts and expanding into new regions, as evidenced by the Nebraska Medicaid contract commencement, provides avenues for growth. Winning these contracts can increase Molina Healthcare Inc's market share and reinforce its reputation as a reliable provider of managed healthcare services. Threats Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and Molina Healthcare Inc must navigate a complex landscape of federal and state laws. Compliance failures or adverse legal actions, such as the ongoing legal action in Virginia, could result in significant fines, sanctions, or reputational damage, posing a threat to the company's operations and financial health. Competitive Pressures: The managed care industry is characterized by intense competition and consolidation. Molina Healthcare Inc faces the threat of emerging competitors and larger entities that may have greater resources or more aggressive pricing strategies. Staying ahead requires continuous innovation, strategic partnerships, and a focus on member satisfaction. Economic and Market Volatility: Economic downturns, shifts in healthcare spending, or changes in government funding for Medicaid and Medicare programs This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

    "article_text": "Share Tweet Share As a physician who grew up in a small town in central Illinois, I’ve witnessed firsthand the decline of rural health care in America. The hospital where I first became interested in medicine is now half its original size, merged with a larger health system, and struggling to stay afloat. This story is all too common across rural America, where health care access is becoming increasingly scarce, and the challenges for providers are mounting. The rural health care crisis The statistics paint a stark picture: while roughly 20 percent of Americans live in rural areas, only about 10 percent of physicians practice there . By 2025, the country is facing a projected s hortage of 20,000 primary care physicians in rural communities . This disparity extends beyond primary care to subspecialists, hospitalists, and emergency physicians. Financial pressures are exacerbating the problem. As COVID-19 subsidies expire and reimbursements decline, rural hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open. A new study by the health analytics company Chartis reveals the dire financial situation of small, rural hospitals. The report shows that 50 percent of these facilities operated at a loss in the most recent year, an increase from 43 percent in the prior year. Furthermore, the analysis identified 418 rural hospitals across the country that are at risk of shutting down due to financial instability. This financial instability creates a vicious cycle, making it harder to recruit and retain health care professionals, invest in necessary technology, maintain quality care, and remain independent. According to the Chartis study, financial pressures are pushing rural hospitals to merge with or be acquired by larger health care networks. The report indicates that approximately 60 percent of rural medical facilities are now connected to major health systems. The unique challenges of rural health care Rural health care providers face a trifecta of pain points: limited access to care, difficulty in delivering high-quality services, and financial constraints. The shortage of health care professionals is particularly acute, with nurses and physicians often drawn to urban areas by higher salaries and more resources. From a resource perspective, rural hospitals often lack the financial strength to invest in cutting-edge technology and related assets. This technological gap widens the divide between rural and urban health care capabilities, potentially compromising patient care and operational efficiency. To address these challenges, we need a multi-faceted approach involving policy changes and technological innovation. Policy interventions: Enhanced reimbursement rates for rural health care providers to ensure financial viability Expansion of loan forgiveness programs for medical and nursing students who commit to practicing in rural areas Increased federal and state funding for rural health care infrastructure and technology Technology opportunities: Telemedicine: COVID-19 demonstrated that telehealth can provide quality care and improve access to specialists. We must continue to invest in and expand these services. Interoperability: Seamless sharing of medical data is crucial for coordinating care between rural providers and urban specialists. Cloud-based technologies: These can help rural hospitals access specialized care and augment services, even with limited budgets. AI and ambient listening tools: While potentially beneficial, these must be implemented thoughtfully to ensure they truly save time for clinicians. Addressing the shortage of clinicians in rural areas also requires a multifaceted approach to education and training. It is essential to provide support for medical schools that offer programs specifically tailored to rural health care needs. To build a sustainable pipeline of clinicians who understand and are committed to serving rural populations, we need a concerted effort to recruit students from these communities and create incentives for them to return to and practice in these areas. Specialization and focused care strategies encourage rural hospitals to concentrate their resources on areas where they excel. To ensure access to a broader range of specialties, these hospitals can form partnerships and utilize technology (such as remote patient monitoring and virtual nursing), optimizing their offerings while maintaining care coverage and independence. The role of health IT Technology has the potential to be a game-changer for rural health care, but only if it’s designed with rural providers in mind. Too often, rural hospitals are left with scaled-down versions of systems designed for large urban centers. These systems can be difficult to use, implement, and train on, especially without dedicated IT support staff. We need to advocate for health information technology solutions that address the unique challenges faced by rural health care providers. These solutions should be user-friendly and straightforward to implement — specifically designed to accommodate rural workflows and requirements. The focus should be on enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing administrative overhead. These technologies must be cost-effective and within reach for health care facilities operating with limited financial resources. By prioritizing these aspects, we can ensure that rural hospitals and clinics have access to the technological tools they need to improve patient care and maintain financial stability. ADVERTISEMENT IT leaders in rural hospitals must vocalize their unique needs and demand better solutions from vendors. They deserve tools that enable them to provide the best possible care for their communities, not afterthoughts or hand-me-downs from larger systems. With 60 million Americans living in rural areas and an aging population, the need for quality rural health care will only increase, and the time to act is now. We must work to prevent further hospital closures and ensure that rural communities have access to the care they need and deserve. This call to action applies to all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Health care providers must advocate for themselves and their patients by making their needs known. Policymakers need to acknowledge the unique challenges of rural health care and enact policies that promote its sustainability. Technology vendors should tailor their offerings to meet the needs of rural providers, focusing on creating efficient, easy-to-use, and affordable solutions. Patients must speak up and engage with local and federal representatives to emphasize the importance of access to rural health care. Rural health care can be revitalized and made more sustainable by working together and leveraging policy changes, technological innovations, and community engagement. The health of millions of Americans depends on our collective ability to bridge the urban-rural health care divide. Jay Anders is a physician executive.

    "article_text": "Dublin, July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global Healthcare Logistics Market - Focused Insights 2024-2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Healthcare Logistics Market was valued at USD 185.77 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach USD 290.73 billion by 2029, rising at a CAGR of 7.75%. The global healthcare logistics market report consists of exclusive data on 41 vendors. The global healthcare logistics market is highly fragmented and is classified by the presence of a few key vendors holding a majority of the share. The vendors offer logistics services in varied industries such as aerospace, consumer and retail, e-commerce, energy, automotive, healthcare, etc The market is rapidly evolving in response to demand for faster deliveries by end users and increased visibility into shipments. Cencora, CEVA Logistics, Deutsch Post DHL, FedEx Corporation, Kuehne + Nagel, DB Schenker, and UPS are the key vendors in this market. These companies have a broad geographical footprint, a strong focus on innovation in logistics, and a diversified service portfolio. The North American region dominates with the largest market share of over 34% in the global healthcare logistics market. This dominance is mainly due to the presence of the majority of healthcare suppliers in the region. High acceptance, prevalence of chronic disease, and growing geriatric population are some factors contributing to this region's growth. The APAC region shows significant global healthcare logistics market growth during the forecast period. The emerging Asian markets have garnered significant attention from the pharmaceutical industry due to their immense potential. The market is heavily influenced by government spending on research and development (R&D) and increasing health awareness, particularly in emerging markets like India and China. Factors such as the proportion of the senior population (aged 65 years and above) and the rising life expectancy have significantly contributed to creating new business opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry across the APAC region. MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS Optimizing Healthcare Supply Chain Through Digital Transformation In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly turned to digital transformation to address the challenges and complexities of supply chain management. Healthcare organizations can unlock numerous benefits and efficiencies throughout the supply chain process by integrating advanced technologies into their operations. One key aspect of digital transformation in healthcare supply chains is adopting advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies enable organizations to analyze vast amounts of real-time data, identify patterns and trends, and make data-driven decisions. For example, AI-powered predictive analytics can help forecast demand for medical supplies, allowing organizations to optimize inventory levels and prevent stockouts or overstocking. Blockchain provides a secure and transparent way to track and trace products throughout the supply chain. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in digitalizing healthcare supply chains. IoT devices such as RFID tags and sensors can be attached to medical supplies, equipment, and patients to monitor their location, condition, and usage in real-time. M&A Strategies Expanding Healthcare into Non-Acute Settings The shift towards non-acute care settings represents a fundamental transformation in healthcare delivery, driven by the need to improve access, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes. Ambulatory surgery centers, community clinics, and home care services offer more convenient and less expensive alternatives to traditional hospital-based care, particularly for routine procedures and chronic disease management. Mergers and acquisitions are significant in this transition as healthcare organizations seek to expand their reach and capabilities by integrating non-acute services into their networks. For example, a health system may acquire a local hospital that operates ambulatory surgery centers or a network of clinics, allowing for better coordination of care and improved patient access across the continuum. The move towards non-acute care settings and preventative care reflects a broader shift towards value-based healthcare models prioritizing patient-centered, holistic wellness approaches. Through strategic M&A activities and targeted initiatives, healthcare organizations aim to create more efficient, equitable, and sustainable healthcare systems that meet the diverse needs of patients and communities. Adoption of Cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems Adopting cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the healthcare supply chain has significantly improved data management practices. These systems serve as centralized hubs for storing and managing vast amounts of data related to inventory, procurement, distribution, and other supply chain activities. One of the key benefits of cloud-based ERP systems is their ability to integrate data from various sources into a single, unified platform. This integration facilitates real-time visibility into inventory levels, demand patterns, and supply chain performance metrics across multiple facilities and locations. With all relevant data accessible from a centralized location, supply chain managers can make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, cloud-based ERP systems enable the deployment of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies leverage the rich data stored in the ERP system to drive predictive analytics and optimization algorithms. For example, AI and ML algorithms can analyze historical demand patterns to forecast future inventory needs more accurately, helping organizations optimize stock levels and reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory. Moreover, AI-powered analytics can identify potential disruptions in the supply chain, such as delays in product delivery or fluctuations in demand, allowing supply chain managers to address these issues before they escalate proactively. By leveraging AI-driven insights, healthcare organizations can improve supply chain resilience, minimize risks, and enhance operational efficiency. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS Supply and Equipment Shortages In the healthcare industry, supply-chain challenges persistently plague providers, hindering their access to essential supplies and equipment. These challenges, initially heightened by the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to reverberate, affecting routine and pandemic-related items. Despite concerted efforts to maintain adequate stock levels, healthcare providers struggle to balance product availability, timely delivery, cost-effectiveness, and appropriate measurement units. Surveys conducted in 2023 indicate that supplier shortages remain pervasive, with over 90% of providers grappling with ongoing difficulties obtaining critical supplies. These shortages have profound implications for healthcare delivery, impacting patient care, operational efficiency, and overall healthcare system resilience. Healthcare providers must navigate an uncertain landscape, seeking alternative sourcing strategies, optimizing inventory management practices, and collaborating closely with suppliers to mitigate supply-chain disruptions. SEGMENT ANALYSIS INSIGHT BY PRODUCT TYPE The global healthcare logistics market by product type is segmented into pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The pharmaceuticals segment will dominate with the largest market share in 2023. The growth can be attributed to the increasing healthcare expenditure, a surge in R&D investments, and the emergence of biologics and biosimilars. Pharmaceutical supply chain management involves strategically coordinating the complete value-added process of a product within the pharmaceutical industry, along with its associated logistics. This encompasses collaborative efforts among manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, business partners, and consumers, from procurement to final delivery. INSIGHT BY FUNCTIONALITY TYPE The global healthcare logistics market by functionality is categorized into transportation (road, water, air), warehousing, etc. The air transportation segment shows prominent growth, with the fastest-growing CAGR during the forecast period. Air freight has emerged as a vital component of the global economy, enabling swift and efficient transportation of goods worldwide, thus helping segmental growth. While air transport has historically been the pharmaceutical industry's favored choice for international shipping due to its unparalleled speed and adaptability, a notable shift is occurring as more industry leaders turn their attention to ocean freight as a preferable alternative. The economic appeal is substantial, with air freight costing four times more than surface shipping. This shift is particularly compelling considering regulatory pressures from health authorities, which drive suppliers to reduce costs aggressively. INSIGHT BY END-USER TYPE The pharmacies segment holds the largest global healthcare logistics market share by end-user. The segmental growth is because pharmacies or drugstores are places where the medicines are dispensed or compounded. The pharmacists are responsible for the composition of the dosage forms of drugs, such as sterile solutions for injections, capsules, and tablets. As the pharmaceutical industry grows, pharmacists emerge as trusted professionals, fueled by promising technologies and trends highlighted in recent forecast reports, with a focus on sustainability and development; health system pharmacists play a pivotal role, supported by advancements in communication technology and risk management under supply chain management, all aimed at enhancing patient healthcare systems.

Another key driver of the increasing demand for full leasing is the growing complexity of regulatory compliance and accreditation standards. Healthcare providers face stringent equipment quality, safety, and data security requirements, necessitating access to high-quality, compliant technology. Leasing enables organizations to access certified equipment and stay abreast of regulatory changes without significant financial risk. Leveraging Remote Equipment Management in Healthcare Equipment Leasing In healthcare equipment leasing, recent trends have significantly shifted towards integrating remote equipment management solutions. With the advent of connected medical devices and IoT-enabled equipment, leasing providers offer innovative solutions, allowing healthcare organizations to remotely monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot leased assets in real time. These solutions enable enhanced equipment performance monitoring through intuitive dashboards and analytics tools, scheduled maintenance, predictive analytics to anticipate potential failures, and real-time issue resolution to minimize downtime. Adopting remote equipment management improves uptime and reliability, reduces maintenance costs, enhances patient care and safety, and increases operational efficiency. As healthcare providers continue to embrace digital transformation, remote equipment management is poised to become a cornerstone of healthcare equipment leasing, offering unparalleled visibility and control over leased assets. Inflated Cost of Healthcare Equipment The inflated cost of healthcare equipment is a pressing issue that impacts healthcare providers globally. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including the high research and development expenses incurred by manufacturers, stringent regulatory requirements, and the need for cutting-edge technology to meet evolving healthcare demands. Additionally, monopolies or oligopolies within the medical device market can increase prices due to limited competition. Furthermore, the complexity of healthcare equipment, specialized components, and the need for precision engineering contribute to higher manufacturing costs. These inflated costs are often passed on to healthcare facilities and patients, resulting in financial strain on healthcare systems and barriers to accessing essential medical equipment. As a result, there is a growing demand for alternative financing solutions, such as leasing, which can help mitigate the upfront financial burden of purchasing expensive equipment while providing access to the latest technologies. Addressing the inflated cost of healthcare equipment requires collaboration among stakeholders to promote transparency, competition, and innovation in the medical device industry. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS Growing Popularity of Refurbished Equipment The growing popularity of refurbished equipment poses a potential threat to the healthcare equipment leasing market in several ways. Firstly, refurbished equipment typically comes at a lower cost than leasing new equipment, making it an attractive option for healthcare organizations looking to save money. As a result, some healthcare facilities may purchase refurbished equipment outright rather than entering into leasing agreements. This reduces the potential customer base for leasing companies and diminishes their revenue streams. Secondly, technological advancements and improvements in the quality of refurbished equipment have made it increasingly competitive with new equipment. Healthcare organizations may find that refurbished equipment meets their needs adequately, especially for less complex medical procedures or diagnostics. This reduces the perceived value proposition of leasing new equipment, further dampening demand for leasing services. SEGMENTATION INSIGHTS INSIGHT BY EQUIPMENT TYPE The global healthcare equipment leasing market by equipment type is segmented into medical imaging, surgical & therapeutic equipment, patient monitoring equipment, laboratory equipment, and durable medical & storage/transport equipment. The medical imaging segment holds the largest market share in 2023. The medical imaging equipment leasing market is expected to grow as healthcare providers seek to balance the need for advanced diagnostic capabilities with financial constraints. The trend towards value-based care and the increasing emphasis on early diagnosis and preventive healthcare will further drive demand for the latest imaging technologies, making leasing an increasingly attractive option. INSIGHT BY LEASE TYPE The global healthcare equipment leasing market by lease type is categorized into new and used/refurbished equipment. The new equipment segment shows significant growth, with the fastest-growing CAGR during the forecast period. The market is witnessing steady growth in recent years. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including increasing consumer awareness and technological advancements. Continuous scientific and technological advancements in the healthcare sector necessitate investments in new equipment to maintain a competitive edge. However, acquiring new healthcare equipment can pose financial challenges for healthcare settings. Leasing has emerged as a valuable solution to overcome these challenges. Despite having limited budgets, healthcare facilities striving to provide the highest quality care or enhance their services often lease new healthcare equipment instead of purchasing used equipment. INSIGHT BY END-USER TYPE The hospital segment accounts for the largest share of the global healthcare equipment leasing market based on end-user type. Hospitals utilize more healthcare equipment than any other healthcare setting. Diagnostics serve as the primary screening method in hospitals, which are often the first point of contact for various infections and diseases. The increasing prevalence of infectious diseases has led physicians in hospitals to rely more on diagnostic imaging equipment, thereby driving up demand for such equipment. Addressing the ever-increasing costs has become a growing challenge for hospital administrators, who must tackle this issue head-on. Leasing healthcare devices and technology presents an effective strategy for boosting hospitals' bottom line while ensuring their equipment remains up-to-date.

    "article_text": "Home News Opinion Customs duty changes and skilling moves in Budget 2024 to benefit healthcare Customs duty changes and skilling moves in Budget 2024 to benefit healthcare Duty exemption on some cancer medicines will make treatment more accessible. In future, budget needs to consider higher healthcare allocations Sangita Reddy July 24, 2024 / 18:06 IST A standout provision for healthcare is the customs duty exemption on three critical cancer medicines. The 2024 Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman brings a mixed bag of initiatives that, while not overwhelmingly focused on healthcare, it does provide certain critical measures aimed at improving various aspects of the industry. Customs duty removal to help cancer patients Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad A standout provision for healthcare is the customs duty exemption on three critical cancer medicines: Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab. This move significantly reduces the cost burden on cancer patients, making life-saving treatments more accessible and affordable. With cancer being a leading cause of death in India, this step could improve survival rates by allowing more patients to afford necessary treatments. Specialized training programs can be developed for healthcare professionals to ensure effective administration and monitoring of these medications, including upskilling nurses and pharmacists on the latest cancer treatment protocols. Fiscal push to encourage domestic diagnostic industry Related stories Bigger Banks, Bigger Ambitions: Why India must build banks with global heft ‘Predictable tactic’: India slams Pakistan for blaming it over Islamabad car blast Weight loss drug Wegovy to become cheaper as Novo Nordisk cuts prices by up to 37% The budget proposes changes in the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on x-ray tubes and flat panel detectors used in medical x-ray machines. Aligning these duties with domestic capacity addition aims to boost local manufacturing, enhancing the availability of cutting-edge diagnostic tools and supporting the Make in India campaign. Technical training programs in medical equipment manufacturing and maintenance can be established, upskilling workers in the latest manufacturing technologies, quality control processes, and maintenance procedures for advanced diagnostic tools. Skilling initiative can help healthcare industry One other significant aspect of the budget is the government's commitment to skilling 4.1 crore youth over five years, with a central outlay of Rs 2 trilion. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between education and employment, providing young Indians with the skills needed to thrive in various industries, including healthcare. Proper training programs can equip youth with skills in healthcare administration, medical coding and billing, clinical data management, and healthcare IT, alongside essential soft skills like communication and teamwork. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The budget places a notable emphasis on research and development (R&D), with a substantial allocation aimed at fostering private sector-driven innovation at a commercial scale. The establishment of the Anusandhan National Research Fund for basic research and prototype development, coupled with a financing pool of ₹1 lakh crore, is set to catalyze advancements in medical science and healthcare technologies. This move is expected to encourage private enterprises to invest in cutting-edge healthcare solutions, ultimately benefiting the entire sector. Specialized training programs in biomedical research, clinical trials, bioinformatics, and medical device innovation can be developed, including partnerships with universities and research institutions for hands-on experience. The budget encourages the use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to support skilling initiatives. By leveraging CSR contributions, the government aims to enhance the reach and impact of its skilling programs. This collaborative approach between the government and the private sector can significantly boost the availability of skilled professionals in the healthcare industry, addressing the current shortfall in trained personnel. Companies can create training programs in healthcare technology, patient care services, and healthcare management, designed in collaboration with healthcare providers to meet industry needs. Health needs more budgetary allocation Comparatively, healthcare expenditure in this budget has seen incremental enhancements rather than a substantial overhaul, supporting various health initiatives and reflecting a balanced distribution of resources across multiple sectors. Through measures aimed at skilling youth, fostering R&D, supporting working women, and leveraging CSR funds, the budget lays the groundwork for a more robust and inclusive healthcare system. By realistically addressing these areas, the government sets the stage for incremental yet impactful improvements in the healthcare sector, reflecting a balanced approach to national development. Seen in conjunction with the Rs 96,589 cr of the interim budget allocation, it is a step forward but probably not enough. The next budget is only seven months away and our hope is that health in center stage in 2025.

This digital transformation aims to revolutionize healthcare delivery across the country. The Minister of Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, announced this during his mid-year budget review on the floor of Parliament on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. “Mr. Speaker, as part of government's digitisation agenda, the e-Health project is progressing steadily with concentration on health centres and polyclinics, this year. As of June 2024, a total of 49 polyclinics and 144 health centres have been connected, enhancing access to patient data at the point of care, claims management, and real-time bio-surveillance data. This has significantly strengthened the country's health delivery system,” the minister said. He highlighted the government's dedication to using technology to improve healthcare for all. This e-health system promises increased efficiency, better access, and a more patient-centered approach. Mohammed Amin Adam highlighted the government's commitment to leveraging technology to enhance healthcare delivery across the nation. \"Our government is dedicated to improving healthcare access and quality for all Ghanaians. By integrating e-health systems into our polyclinics and health centres, we are revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered, making it more efficient, accessible, and patient-centered,\" he stated. The e-health initiative is part of a broader strategy to modernize Ghana's healthcare infrastructure, ensuring that medical services are more efficient and responsive to the needs of the population. This system allows for better management of patient records, real-time monitoring of health data, and improved coordination of care among healthcare providers. Dr. Adam explained that the e-health system would significantly enhance the capacity of health facilities to provide timely and accurate diagnoses and treatments. \"With the e-health system, healthcare providers can access patient records instantly, leading to quicker and more accurate diagnoses. This system also facilitates better coordination between different levels of care, ensuring that patients receive the best possible treatment at the right time,\" he said. The integration of e-health systems is expected to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare workers, allowing them to focus more on patient care. By automating routine tasks and streamlining workflows, the e-health system aims to improve the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery. In addition to improving clinical outcomes, the e-health system is also designed to enhance health data management and reporting. This will enable the Ministry of Health to monitor health trends more effectively, plan resources better, and respond to public health emergencies with greater agility.

Ramsay's Chief Nurse and Clinical Services Director, Associate Professor Bernadette Eather, said the program would be used to onboard and upskill more nurses to work in cath labs at Ramsay hospitals across the country. \"Working in the cath lab is a special skill set and one that many of our nurses have expressed an interest in learning or improving,\" A/Prof Eather said. \"Ramsay is committed to offering our nurses and health care professionals leading education and training opportunities to help them develop in their nursing careers.\" The new program will complement existing upskilling opportunities provided by the Ramsay Nursing and Midwifery Academy, which was launched in 2021. \"Ramsay Health Care nurses are committed to providing excellent health care for their patients, and we're committed to helping them grow their skills and excel in their nursing careers,\" A/Prof Eather said. Ramsay Health Care has 32 cath labs across 18 of its private hospitals in Australia.

    "article_text": "When Will Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXR) Turn A Profit? editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) July 20, 2024 3 min read CTXR Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ:CTXR ) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a late-stage biopharmaceutical company, engages in the development and commercialization of critical care products. The US$149m market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$34m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$37m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Citius Pharmaceuticals' investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Citius Pharmaceuticals Citius Pharmaceuticals is bordering on breakeven, according to the 3 American Pharmaceuticals analysts. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of US$15m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven just over a year from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 63% is expected, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. NasdaqCM:CTXR Earnings Per Share Growth July 20th 2024 We're not going to go through company-specific developments for Citius Pharmaceuticals given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that typically pharmaceuticals, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period. Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Citius Pharmaceuticals currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making pharma, which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company. Next Steps: There are too many aspects of Citius Pharmaceuticals to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Citius Pharmaceuticals' company page on Simply Wall St .

Ahead of the budget, experts from the healthcare sector have emphasized the need for increased government spending, improved infrastructure, and enhanced innovation to build a robust healthcare system in India. Apart from that, the Indian healthcare industry holds greater expectations from the budget, right from affordability and accessibility to quality enhancements and more research and development. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Expressing his views, Dr Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers - India (AHPI), said, \"Increased government spending is necessary to address emerging health threats and achieve universal health coverage.\" He said the government should prioritize a comprehensive approach to building a 'Healthy India,' focusing on sanitation, clean drinking water, and nutrition. \"Public health institutes should be professionalised under autonomous state boards, and the Ayushman Bharat Yojana needs restructuring to include all SECC-2011 beneficiaries. Encouraging the private sector to establish tertiary care hospitals in tier-III towns and opening exclusive PG colleges will address infrastructure shortages. Additionally, promoting the indigenization of high-tech medical equipment and advancing the National Digital Health Mission is also crucial,\" he stated. Suneeta Reddy, managing director of Apollo Hospitals Group, said it is crucial to acknowledge the vital connection between our nation's economic health and its healthcare infrastructure as India approaches another Union Budget.

To achieve the 5 trillion dollar economy goal, a robust healthcare sector must be central to our strategy, Reddy said. \"Granting the healthcare sector 'national priority' status, similar to the IT sector in the 1990s, can spur this transformation. Boosting domestic manufacturing of medical devices through tax incentives and regulatory support will reduce dependency on imports, enhancing affordability and accessibility,\" she said. Probal Ghosal, chairman and director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, urged the government to increase healthcare spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, focusing on rural areas. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad \"Rationalizing the GST framework and prioritizing capacity building and training for healthcare professionals is vital. Enhancing healthcare infrastructure in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and encouraging private investment in medical colleges and healthcare facilities are essential. Encouraging private investment in medical colleges through land allotments, subsidies, and loan moratoriums, along with mandating doctor rotations and incentivizing specialists in smaller cities, will ensure equitable expertise distribution. Additionally, increasing budgetary allocations for primary care and expanding primary health centres (PHCs) through public-private partnerships (PPPs) is essential,\" Ghoshal said. IMA president Dr R V Asokan pointed out that the \"the allocation varying from 1.1 to 1.6 per cent GDP together by the various governments is one of the lowest in the world\". Moreover, the expenditure incurred on health determinants like drinking water, sanitation should be provided for separately. \"Thus, the minimum allocation for health alone should be around 2.5 per cent of the GDP. Despite numerous policy pronouncements prioritizing health, the governments in India at the Centre and state levels have historically underfunded the public health sector, resulting in poor health outcomes and rising inequity in access to health care,\" he said. India's overall health spending (public and private) is currently estimated to be 3.8 per cent of its GDP, lower than the LMIC average of health spending share of GDP of around 5.2 per cent. India's health system is overwhelmingly financed by out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures incurred by households,\" he said. The IMA has also written a letter to the Union finance minister flagging its demands ahead of the budget. Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, CEO and MD of Fortis Healthcare, echoed silimar demands of prioritizing healthcare infrastructure by increasing GDP spending to 2.5 per cent. \"We urge the government to designate healthcare as a national priority and implement transformative measures to establish India as a global healthcare powerhouse. The sector currently faces challenges such as a shortage of skilled workforce, indirect taxation issues, and unused Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit,\" he said. To ensure sustained and accelerated growth, policies conducive to private sector investment must be focused upon, Dr Raghuvanshi said. The government should strengthen public-private partnerships by introducing new models and policies to boost the adoption of digital healthcare services and promote medical value travel. \"This can be achieved by facilitating international insurance recognition for Indian healthcare providers to attract more international patients,\" he said. Vikram Thaploo, CEO-Telehealth at Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Limited, said, \"We anticipate a budget that fortifies the healthcare foundation of our country, as a strong and resilient healthcare ecosystem is a critical driver of India's economic growth.\" He added: \"The Union Budget for 2023-24 allocated INR 89,155 crore to the Ministry of Health, a nearly 3.4 percent increase from Rs 86,200 crore in FY 2022-23. A strategy combining Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), Research and Development (R&D), and enhanced funding for rural healthcare infrastructure is crucial. Allocating a significant portion of the budget to research and development in healthcare and increasing funding for rural facilities will ensure equitable access.\" PTI first published: Jul 20, 2024 04:42 pm Discover the latest Business News , Sensex , and Nifty updates.

In a purported effort to retain health care practitioners for the commonwealth and promote continuity of care for patients, Gov. Josh Shapiro signed the Fair Contracting for Health Care Practitioners Act into law on July 17, 2024. In addition to narrowing the scope of noncompetes in certain limited instances, it imposes a separate patient notice requirement following the “departure” of a health care practitioner. The act is not effective until January 1, 2025. The act applies to specific health care practitioners: medical doctors, osteopaths, nurse anesthetists, registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The act: Prohibits noncompete covenants for more than one year in length in certain circumstances Prohibits the enforcement of a noncompete covenant against a health care practitioner if the health care practitioner is “dismissed” Permits an employer to recover certain reasonable expenses “related to relocation, training and establishment of a patient base” but prohibits recovery if the health care practitioner is “dismissed” Permits noncompete covenants related to sales or merger of a business entity Permits noncompete covenants where the health care practitioner receives by purchase, grant, award or issuance of an ownership interest in a “business entity” In addition, the act requires an employer to notify “patients seen within the past year” of: (1) the “departure” of a health care practitioner, (2) how to transfer patient records to “departed health care practitioner or another health care practitioner” and (3) “that the patient may be assigned to a new health care practitioner within the existing employer if the patient chooses to continue receiving care from the employer.” An employer is required to provide these notifications within 90 days of the health care practitioner’s departure. However, the notification requirement applies only where the health care practitioner had an “ongoing outpatient relationship with the patient for two or more years.” The act does not define many terms and is such a hodgepodge of concepts and requirements that it will be a health care employers’ nightmare. Some unanswered questions include: Are reasonable noncompete covenants enforceable where the health care practitioner receives a tiny “ownership interest”? Are noncompete covenants effective for more than one year enforceable where an employment agreement is not renewed? Is a patient nonsolicitation provision included within the scope of the act? Is the patient notice requirement triggered regardless of the reason for the end of the employment relationship? Does the death or retirement of a health care practitioner trigger a potential notice requirement? Is there no patient notice requirement where the health care practitioner is employed for only 23 months (i.e. two years)? How is patient notice accomplished? Is a website posting sufficient? Is there any penalty for noncompliance? When we ring in 2025, let the litigation begin.

The Final Rule also updates the Notice of Privacy Practices for both reproductive health care information and for the final rules published earlier this year for the Confidentiality of Substance use Disorder Patient Records – otherwise known as the “Part 2 Rules. ” Compliance with the Final Rule is required by December 23, 2024, except for the changes to the Notice of Privacy Practices, the compliance for which is required by February 16, 2026 (which is meant to coincide with the compliance date for the Part 2 Rules). Additional Prohibitions on Reproductive Health Care Information Health care providers, health plans and their business associates are now prohibited from using or disclosing PHI when the PHI is requested to conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into or impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances, or to identify any person relating to those activities. The above prohibition applies where a health care provider, health plan or business associate has reasonably determined that one or more of the following conditions exists – The reproductive health care is lawful under the law of the state in which such health care is provided under the circumstances in which it is provided. The reproductive health care is protected, required, or authorized by Federal law, including the U.S. Constitution, regardless of the state in which such health care is provided. If the reproductive health care was not provided by the health care provider, health plan or business associate that receives the request for PHI, the provider, plan or business associate can assume that the health care is lawful unless it (1) has actual knowledge that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided or (2) receives factual information from the person making the request for the use or disclosure of PHI that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. The Final Rule continues to permit health care providers, health plans and business associates to use or disclose PHI for purposes otherwise permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule where the request for the use or disclosure of PHI is not made to investigate or impose liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. For example, a covered entity or business associate could use or disclose PHI to defend itself in an investigation, proceeding or lawsuit involving the provision of reproductive health care. The Final Rule also permits a covered entity or business associate to decline to recognize a person as an individual’s personal representative in domestic violence or endangerment situations. New Attestation Rules for Reproductive Health Care In addition to the current authorization rules, the Final Rule adds new attestation rules with respect to reproductive health care. Before using or disclosing PHI that is potentially related to reproductive health care, the health care provider, health plan or business associate must receive a valid attestation from the person requesting the use or disclosure, if the use or disclosure is related to any of the following – Health oversight activities Judicial and administrative proceedings Law enforcement Coroners or medical examinations A valid attestation must include the following elements – The name of any individual(s) whose PHI is sought, if practicable; or if not practicable, a description of the class of individuals whose PHI is sought. The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, who are requested to make the use or disclosure. The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity is to make the requested use or disclosure. A clear statement that the use or disclosure is not for a prohibited purpose (e.g., is not for a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into any person for the act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances). A statement that a person may be subject to criminal penalties if that person knowingly and in violation of HIPAA obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual or discloses individually identifiable health information to another person. Signature and date of the person requesting the PHI, which may be electronic. Similar to the authorization rules, the attestation rules also include a plain language requirement, set forth rules on compound attestations, and set forth rules on defective attestations. OCR also intends to publish model attestation language before December 23, 2024. Notice of Privacy Practices The Final Rule requires covered entities to significantly revise their Notices of Privacy Practices to reflect the changes related to reproductive health care privacy. For example, the privacy notice will have to describe and provide at least one example of the new prohibitions that relate to reproductive health care. In addition, the notice will have to describe the uses and disclosures for which an attestation is required and provide at least one example, The Final Rule also requires revisions to the Notice of Privacy Practices for the Part 2 Rules. Compliance is not required until February 16, 2026. Key Takeaways for Self-Insured Group Health Plans As noted in our prior blog post concerning the Part 2 Rules, a number of documentation updates may be needed to comply with the Part 2 Rules. Similar changes are also required with respect to the Final Rule by December 23, 2024, as follows – Vendor Contracts . Plan sponsors as well as vendors may need to review their agreements to determine if changes are necessary. Business Associate Agreements . For vendors that are subject to both the Part 2 Rules and the HIPAA Privacy Rules, plan sponsors should review their business associate agreements to determine if revisions are necessary for the Part 2 Rules and/or the Final Rule. For vendors that are only subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rules, depending on the wording of the business associate agreement, updates may be needed for the Final Rule. HIPAA Policies and Procedures Manual . A self-insured health plan sponsor is liable for all compliance with HIPAA even though sponsors delegate most administration to vendors. These delegations should be set forth in the vendor contracts and BAAs. But, they also should be set forth in the health plan’s policies and procedures manual, which will need to be updated for both the Part 2 Rules and the Final Rule. HIPAA Health Plan Document Provisions . The HIPAA language in the health plan document will need to be updated for both the Part 2 Rules and the Final Rule. HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices . While an updated notice is required, the compliance date is extended to Feburaty 16, 2026.

    "article_text": "The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has said the nation’s healthcare sector is facing the danger of depletion of experienced professionals and aging workforce. Prof Rowland Osuoji, a Consultant Paediatric Surgeon, said this while delivering the 5th Prof Festus Nwako Memorial Lecture at the Anambra NMA 2024 Scientific Conference and Annual General Meeting held in Onitsha on Friday. Osuoji, who is the President of the Association of Paediatric Surgeons of Nigeria, delivered a lecture entitled, ‘Excellent, Resilient and Equitable Healthcare System Amidst Economic Downturn’. He said shortage of healthcare professionals in Nigeria became worse in the mid 1980s when the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) reduced the purchasing power of the people and regretted that nothing had been done to effectively arrest the trend. According to him, the development led to a brain drain, as highly skilled older colleagues left and relocated abroad. “That is the current brain drain, but the difference is the younger ones are involved, and it is more frightening, for obvious reasons. “Who will replace the aging healthcare workforce?,” NAN quoted him as saying Osuoji added the economic downturn had manifested in reduced government revenues, healthcare budgets, increased unemployment and poverty, thereby putting pressure on demand for healthcare services. He said the sector also had the challenges of insufficient and inconsistent government funding, heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments, poor condition of healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas. The don recommended adoption of health insurance schemes that encourage private sector involvement, telemedicine, community engagement and equitable healthcare for all Nigerians irrespective of their socioeconomic status. “Collaborative efforts among policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities are essential. “Prioritise investments in healthcare infrastructure, innovation, and equitable access to ensure robust health systems capable of withstanding economic challenges in Nigeria,” he said.

    "article_text": "Ottawa Ottawa seniors get health care delivered to their doorstep In an effort to break down health-care barriers for seniors, several Ottawa groups teamed up to Thursday to bring medical services to residents of one west Ottawa condo. Several groups hosting pop-up clinics at west Ottawa condo Emma Weller · CBC News · Posted: Jul 19, 2024 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: July 19, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 4 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Tamara Chipperfield, chief executive officer of the Pinecrest-Queensway Community Health Centre, hopes the monthly clinics will help connect seniors to other health-care services. (Nick Persaud/CBC) Social Sharing In an effort to break down health-care barriers for seniors, several Ottawa groups have teamed up to bring medical services to their doorsteps. The Pinecrest-Queensway Community Health Centre, the Ottawa Paramedic Service, Ottawa Public Health and drugstore chain Rexall hosted a wellness clinic Thursday at a condo building on Ambleside Drive. Seniors living in the building were able to walk downstairs and have a nurse, physician, pharmacist and paramedics at their service. They could get medical assessments on site, and referrals elsewhere if their needs were more complex. Thursday's clinic was the third held at the west Ottawa condo, with more planned in the months ahead. Number of Ontarians without family doctor reaches 2.5 million, college says Many seniors don't have access to primary medical care, organizers said, meaning it may be years since they've last seen a physician. \"It's all about providing care for these residents in their community and [to] try to break down barriers to health care,\" said Marc-Antoine Deschamps with the Ottawa Paramedic Service. Marc-Antoine Deschamps is with the Ottawa Paramedic Service, and says clinics like these can help relieve pressure on hospitals. (Nick Persaud/CBC) Clinics like these could help relieve the pressures on local hospitals, Deschamps said. If the medical teams catch issues like high blood pressure or diabetes in the early stages, it could prevent 911 calls down the line and free up space in emergency rooms, he said. \"We can reduce the burden on health care by addressing detailed care concerns early on,\" he said. Tamara Chipperfield, chief executive officer of the Pinecrest-Queensway Community Health Centre, hopes that the clinic will link people to other services — instead of forcing them to rely on ERs. \"One of our key jobs is to ensure that those wrap-around supports are available to people so that people know outside of this clinic where and how they can access allied health services,\" she said. \"We shouldn't be asking everyday citizens to bind together to figure out how they can convince health care to come to their community.\"​​​​ - CanAge CEO Laura Tamblyn Watts Ruth Becker, a pharmacist at Rexall, said these sorts of clinics can also help people stay in their homes longer without needing assistance from a caregiver. \"I believe that there is a better quality of life if people are able to stay and live where they are already happy living and if we bring the health care to them,\" Becker said. \"At the core of what I believe in, as a health-care professional, is helping people age where they are happy.\" 'Not a perfect model' The idea of the clinic originated from a group of older adults who live in the three neighbouring Ambleside Drive buildings. They came together through Oasis, an organization that brings seniors together and helps them create a community. After being frustrated with the current health-care system, they reached out to the organizations that helped organize Thursday's clinic. \"We shouldn't be asking everyday citizens to bind together to figure out how they can convince health care to come to their community,\" said Laura Tamblyn Watts, chief executive officer of CanAge, a national seniors' advocacy group. \"We should be having a community plan for health care, not the opposite way around.\" With Ontario's senior population about to spike, report predicts big demand for home care Ontario moved 424 people into nursing homes they didn't choose Tamblyn Watts said while these clinics are a step in the right direction, they're \"not a perfect model.\" She wants to see the federal government to implement a plan to ensure seniors have the proper resources to live long, healthy lives. \"Our health-care system needs to start taking our aging population seriously,\" Tamblyn Watts said.

    "article_text": "AP Texas By Associated Press Published July 18, 2024 7:58 PM Associated Press BOSTON (AP) — The Massachusetts Senate approved a bill Thursday aimed in part at addressing some of the issues raised after Steward Health Care said it plans to sell off all its hospitals after announcing in May that it filed for bankruptcy protection. Democratic Sen. Cindy Friedman, Senate chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, said the bill is meant to address the state’s struggling health care system, which she said is putting patients and providers at risk. “Most concerning of all is that we have lost the patient and their needs as the primary focus of the health care system,” she said. “The recent events concerning Steward Health system have exacerbated a preexisting crisis across all aspects of the system. They may not have been the cause, but they certainly are the poster child.” Friedman said the bill significantly updates and strengthens the state’s tools to safeguard the health care system by focusing on the major players in the health care market — including providers, insurers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and for-profit investment firms — to ensure that patient needs come first. The bill would expand the authority of state agencies charged with measuring and containing health care costs and strengthen the health care market review process with the goal of stabilizing the system. The bill would also limit the amount of debt a provider or provider organization in which a private equity firm has a financial interest can take on; update programs aimed at constraining health care costs and improving care quality; and require that for-profit health care companies submit additional information on corporate structure, financials and portfolio companies to the state’s Health Policy Commission. The commission is an independent state agency designed to advance a more transparent, accountable and equitable health care system through data-driven policy recommendations, according to state officials. The House has already approved their version of the bill. Both chambers will now have to come up with a single compromise bill to send to Gov. Maura Healey. The debate comes as questions loom about the future of hospitals owned by Steward Health Care. The Dallas-based company, which operates more than 30 hospitals nationwide, has said it plans to sell off all its hospitals after announcing in May that it filed for bankruptcy protection. The company said it does not expect any interruptions in its hospitals’ day-to-day operations throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward has eight hospitals in Massachusetts including St. Elizabeth’s Hospital and Carney Hospital, both in Boston. Also Thursday, U.S. Sens. Edward Markey and Bernie Sanders said the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions plans to vote next week to subpoena Steward CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre. In a written statement, Markey and Sanders pointed to what they described as “a dysfunctional and cruel health care system that is designed not to make patients well, but to make executives extraordinarily wealthy.” “There could not be a clearer example of that than private equity vultures on Wall Street making a fortune by taking over hospitals, stripping their assets, and lining their own pockets,” they said, adding, “Working with private equity forces, Dr. de la Torre became obscenely wealthy by loading up hospitals from Massachusetts to Arizona with billions in debt and sold the land underneath these hospitals to real estate executives who charge unsustainably high rent.” A spokesperson for Steward Health Care did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "article_text": "The BC Conservative Party unveiled its health-care platform on Thursday, a plan built on hiring back unvaccinated workers and using private providers to cut down on wait times. The announcement comes with just three months to go before British Columbia’s provincial election. Calling it a “patients-first” model, BC Conservative Leader John Rustad said the plan would maintain a publicly-funded system that provides care through private, out-of-province and public facilities. “We need to fix things, and that new model will be taxpayer-funded but delivered by both government and non-government facilities,” Rustad said. 1:50 BC United launches health-care plan He said the plan would cut health-care administration, offer direct funding through a “patient-based” funding model, and hire more nurses and doctors. Story continues below advertisement The plan did not address how the province would address ongoing recruitment and retention problems with health-care workers, save to promise to hire back those who refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine and offer new incentives to work in rural centres.

The party also promised a “wait times guarantee,” with those left too long being sent out of province for care. Rustad could not provide an estimate on how much the plan would cost but acknowledged there would be an “initial spike” in spending. “I don’t have the precise numbers,” he said. “There are a lot of complexities that have to be put in place as we do the transition.” “We will be working with the health care system, what we are seeing with cancer right now is horrendous,” he added. 1:52 Poll: BC Greens now ahead of BC United Trending Now U.S. trade policy is ‘radically different’ now, Carney says 18-year-old woman dies during cruise ship voyage, FBI joins investigation The plan drew swift critiques from public health-care advocates. Story continues below advertisement “When you fold private health care into a universal system there are no more hours, no more services being provided,” said Ayendri Riddell with the British Columbia Health Coalition. “Services just shift to most profitable patients.” With jurisdictions across Canada facing the same struggles to recruit health-care workers, critics also said the plan would pull staff from the public system to private facilities, potentially lengthening wait times. The BC NDP was also quick to attack the plan, saying it would amount to massive cuts. “What is very clear in these documents is they want remove $4 billion and promote privatization,” Langford-Juan de Fuca MLA Ravi Parmar said.

If the reproductive health care was not provided by the health care provider, health plan or business associate that receives the request for PHI, the provider, plan or business associate can assume that the health care is lawful unless it (1) has actual knowledge that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided or (2) receives factual information from the person making the request for the use or disclosure of PHI that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. The Final Rule continues to permit health care providers, health plans and business associates to use or disclose PHI for purposes otherwise permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule where the request for the use or disclosure of PHI is not made to investigate or impose liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care. For example, a covered entity or business associate could use or disclose PHI to defend itself in an investigation, proceeding or lawsuit involving the provision of reproductive health care. The Final Rule also permits a covered entity or business associate to decline to recognize a person as an individual’s personal representative in domestic violence or endangerment situations. New Attestation Rules for Reproductive Health Care In addition to the current authorization rules, the Final Rule adds new attestation rules with respect to reproductive health care. Before using or disclosing PHI that is potentially related to reproductive health care, the health care provider, health plan or business associate must receive a valid attestation from the person requesting the use or disclosure, if the use or disclosure is related to any of the following – Health oversight activities Judicial and administrative proceedings Law enforcement Coroners or medical examinations A valid attestation must include the following elements – The name of any individual(s) whose PHI is sought, if practicable; or if not practicable, a description of the class of individuals whose PHI is sought. The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, who are requested to make the use or disclosure. The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity is to make the requested use or disclosure. A clear statement that the use or disclosure is not for a prohibited purpose (e.g., is not for a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into any person for the act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances). A statement that a person may be subject to criminal penalties if that person knowingly and in violation of HIPAA obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual or discloses individually identifiable health information to another person. Signature and date of the person requesting the PHI, which may be electronic. Similar to the authorization rules, the attestation rules also include a plain language requirement, set forth rules on compound attestations, and set forth rules on defective attestations. OCR also intends to publish model attestation language before December 23, 2024. Notice of Privacy Practices The Final Rule requires covered entities to significantly revise their Notices of Privacy Practices to reflect the changes related to reproductive health care privacy. For example, the privacy notice will have to describe and provide at least one example of the new prohibitions that relate to reproductive health care. In addition, the notice will have to describe the uses and disclosures for which an attestation is required and provide at least one example, The Final Rule also requires revisions to the Notice of Privacy Practices for the Part 2 Rules. Compliance is not required until February 16, 2026. Key Takeaways for Self-Insured Group Health Plans As noted in our prior blog post concerning the Part 2 Rules, a number of documentation updates may be needed to comply with the Part 2 Rules. Similar changes are also required with respect to the Final Rule by December 23, 2024, as follows – Vendor Contracts . Plan sponsors as well as vendors may need to review their agreements to determine if changes are necessary. Business Associate Agreements . For vendors that are subject to both the Part 2 Rules and the HIPAA Privacy Rules, plan sponsors should review their business associate agreements to determine if revisions are necessary for the Part 2 Rules and/or the Final Rule. For vendors that are only subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rules, depending on the wording of the business associate agreement, updates may be needed for the Final Rule. HIPAA Policies and Procedures Manual . A self-insured health plan sponsor is liable for all compliance with HIPAA even though sponsors delegate most administration to vendors. These delegations should be set forth in the vendor contracts and BAAs. But, they also should be set forth in the health plan’s policies and procedures manual, which will need to be updated for both the Part 2 Rules and the Final Rule. HIPAA Health Plan Document Provisions . The HIPAA language in the health plan document will need to be updated for both the Part 2 Rules and the Final Rule. HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices . While an updated notice is required, the compliance date is extended to Feburaty 16, 2026."

VANCOUVER - The leader of the Conservative Party of British Columbia says as premier his government would pay to send people outside the province for health care and expand private clinics in an effort to fix a system \"in crisis.\" Read unlimited articles for free today: Email Address: Password: I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . or Already have an account? Log in here » Hey there, time traveller! This article was published 18/07/2024 (482 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. VANCOUVER – The leader of the Conservative Party of British Columbia says as premier his government would pay to send people outside the province for health care and expand private clinics in an effort to fix a system “in crisis.” John Rustad acknowledged Thursday that if his party were to form government in October the plan would cause the provincial budget to “spike,” but said in the long-term it will bring down per-capita health-care spending. “Our health-care system in B.C. is in crisis. More than that, it is failing. More money into the system is not the solution,” he said. B.C. Conservative Party leader John Rustad speaks to members of the media during a year-end availability at legislature in Victoria, B.C., on Wednesday, December 6, 2023. Rustad says as premier his government would pay to send people outside the province for health care and expand private clinics in an effort to fix a system \"in crisis.\" THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito “What we need to be doing (is) actually be looking at models from throughout the world that work well and look at how we can be using those in B.C.” Rustad’s promises, three months before the provincial election, also include compensating health workers who lost their jobs for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The health-care plan is the first major platform piece for the party and has the governing New Democrats accusing Rustad of planning big health cuts, while the Opposition BC United claims he stole their ideas. Rustad said expanding publicly funded partnerships with non-governmental clinics for specific procedures and diagnostic services will get people off wait-lists and that similar models in Europe prove it can be done “seamlessly.” He could not provide numbers for how much he expects the health-care overhaul would cost. “My anticipation is that we will see an initial spike up in spending as the model comes in place, but then that will level off to a place where we’ll see the cost per capita dropped over time,” he said. “I don’t have the precise numbers,” he said. “There are a lot of complexities that have to be put in place as we do the transition.” Documents released by the B.C. Conservatives to accompany the plan highlight a report by Deloitte that projects Canadian health spending as a per cent of GDP will grow to 13.9 per cent by 2040 and suggest “modernization” can bring that down to under 11 per cent. The report includes calls for more virtual care and improved data collection. New Democrat member of the legislature Ravi Parmar told reporters after Rustad’s announcement the reduction would mean a loss of $4.1 billion in health spending. “At a time when we should be investing more in health care in British Columbia, John Rustad and the Conservatives are proposing taking money away from our health-care system,” he said. A statement from BC United says it was the first party to propose to publicly fund treatments at existing private clinics to immediately clear waiting lists and hire back health care workers who were fired due to the vaccine mandate. “The Rustad Party copying our health care platform, which was created with the input of our strong team of physicians running for BC United in the upcoming election, simply shows that BC United is leading the charge to fix the NDP’s health care crisis,” candidate for Surrey-Cloverdale, Dr. Claudine Storness-Bliss, said in the statement. Jason Sutherland, with the University of British Columbia’s Center for Health Services and Policy Research, said multiple Canadian provinces, including British Columbia, outsource some surgeries to private clinics. He said no province does enough volume of those procedures to know what the impacts of a large program would be. “If they can scale up and find enough surgeons, where do they find all of the other skilled people that they need for surgery? Like anesthesia nurses, post-op recovery room nurses?” he said. “If they recruit them from the hospitals, then the public hospitals aren’t going to be able to do the surgeries they were doing before. So, if they lured them away, are they harming public hospitals? I think that’s an untested hypothesis currently in Canada.” Rustad said his plan to attract more workers includes speeding up the hiring process and “creating an environment where health-care workers want to be able to be here.” Sutherland said private clinic surgeries can be more expensive because the companies spend capital to build facilities, and want a return on their investment. “Activity-based funding is a viable option. But in our experiences, it’s more associated with pushing through more volume to improve access, but that in turn drives costs higher,” he said. “That’s what our review of the evidence is showing. So that we would not expect costs to go down, we would expect them to go up.” Sutherland said there could be many factors contributing to the health-care spend rates in other countries that aren’t related to the model of funding they use. “(It could be) more invested on health prevention, promotion, home care, hospital-at-home programs, other programs that would be competing with elective surgery,” he said. “What is it that increases health-care spending? Hospitals is the biggest cost bucket.” Rustad said a new “wait-time guarantee” for certain procedures would mean that if patients can’t been seen on time they would be sent for care outside the province. He said his government would do away with the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health-care workers and a committee would decide how the “thousands” of people who were fired would be compensated and hired back. A 2024 B.C. Supreme Court decision upholding the province’s vaccine rules says approximately 1,800 health-care workers lost their jobs due to being unvaccinated contrary to these mandates.

    "article_text": "Manitoba Some Manitoba health-care staff feeling 'overlooked' with wages similar to restaurant, grocery workers: MGEU A provincial union leader says it's understandable some public-sector workers in Manitoba's health care system would feel overlooked if they are paid as much as those cooking burgers at fast-food joints. MGEU urges government to act quickly as vacancy rates in some cases exceed 30 per cent Ian Froese · CBC News · Posted: Jul 18, 2024 4:11 PM EDT | Last Updated: July 19, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 5 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Kyle Ross, president of the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union, is urging the provincial government to embark on an aggressive recruitment and retention strategy to improve conditions for various support and technical health-care positions. (Justin Fraser/CBC) Social Sharing A provincial union leader says it's understandable some public-sector workers in Manitoba's health care system would feel overlooked if they are paid as much as those cooking burgers at fast-food joints. \"You start at $17 an hour working as a custodian, while McDonald's in Swan River is hiring at $17 an hour — so where are you going to go? These jobs aren't competitive,\" said Kyle Ross, who represents thousands of health-care workers in rural Manitoba whose positions have nowhere near the public profile as doctors or nurses. \"If we want a strong health-care system, we have to be able to recruit people. It should be a coveted job.\" Ross, president of the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union, held a news conference Thursday to demonstrate the staffing crisis on support and technical jobs in the sector, ranging from health-care aides to home care attendants, mental health workers and custodial staff. The union laid out its case in a 24-page self-created report, which focuses on the regions in which its 7,700 health-care members work: Prairie Mountain, Interlake-Eastern and Southern Health. MGEU called on the government to act, including with an \"aggressive\" recruitment and retention strategy. The report makes 10 recommendations for improvement. Ross said many of MGEU's members feel their contributions aren't valued to the extent of their other colleagues. Valued part of health-care team \"I think sometimes the workers who work in dietary, who … do those jobs, clean the hospital are overlooked,\" he said. \"It's a challenging environment for them, but they are a very important member of the team.\" The union president said boosting these workers' wages would alleviate some of those issues. As it stands, the starting wage for health-care aides and home care attendants is just over $20/hour, while it's more than $17 for laundry aides and $18.32 for clerks, MGEU's report said. However, in some of the same communities, the report states those workers could make $21 an hour as a bank teller or grocery store cashier, or between $18 to $22 as a deli clerk. \"With this kind of wage competition, health care employment simply doesn't hold the appeal that it once had,\" the report said. Health-care aides say overwhelming work conditions at Winnipeg care home putting residents at risk Weeks-long strike ends as health-care workers with Ten Ten Sinclair vote to accept new deal That same document reveals more than 30 per cent of health-care aide jobs in Prairie Mountain are unfilled. The vacancy rate exceeds 40 per cent in 16 of the health region's facilities. \"Insufficient staff means that each patient gets less time with a care provider,\" the report said. \"The results are fewer baths, diapers going unchanged, wounds not being monitored or re-dressed as often, exercise routines getting rescheduled, meal times being rushed, and less time for conversation and companionship.\" To address these shortages, health authorities have increasingly turned to private agencies for help. Prairie Mountain and Interlake-Eastern spent a combined $8.3 million on private health-care aides in 2021-22. Two years later, the health regions saw that amount triple to nearly $29.7 million. Over a two-year span, the Prairie Mountain and Interlake-Eastern regional health authorities tripled the amount of money it spent on private agency health-care aides. (CGN089/Shutterstock) Ross is urging the government to immediately begin phasing out the use of private agency staffing. He said the government and health-care employers could reallocate the savings into establishing a more attractive compensation package for public-sector workers. He added turning more part-time positions into full-time roles would also act as an incentive. Ross said health-care officials don't have time to waste. \"I've visited many work locations in Prairie Mountain and when you go there, these workers are at the end of their career. They're getting ready to retire and there's no one to backfill.\" While Ross said he isn't \"under the delusion\" the health-care system can be fixed in a few months, he urged the NDP government to move quickly so his members aren't left behind any more. MGEU is currently negotiating for improvements in wages and other areas as it seeks new contracts for its workers. The previous collective bargaining agreement expired in March. 'We are doing the work,' health minister says of system fixes Manitoba Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara said the union's recommendations for change largely fit with the NDP's government's priorities for improving provincial health care. \"Many of the recommendations, if not all if them, align with the government's priorities,\" Asagwara said in a late-day press conference. The minister several times blamed the prior Progressive Conservative government for the poor condition of the health system and staffing anxieties. The NDP took power in October last year. \"It's going to take us time to move us in the right direction,\" Asagwara said. \"But we are doing the work.\" Asagwara said the government is committed to being at the bargaining table to hammer out a fair deal for workers. \"Our government has been able to achieve that with other unions,\" Asagwara said.

    "article_text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Health Ministry is considering a National Health Fund for better healthcare financing, says Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad. The Health Minister said the ministry is cognisant of the burden of high out-of-pocket (OOP)spending on healthcare. Malaysians' OOP spending on healthcare stood at 37%. He said the ministry’s approach to healthcare financing would reduce OOP spending and ensure efficient healthcare spending. “The Health Ministry, as the provider of public healthcare services in the country, has received a total of RM41.2 billion under Budget 2024, approximately 10.5% of the total Budget. However, as a middle-high-income country, there could be higher allocation. But I understand the (government’s) fiscal position,” he said. Therefore, he said that even if an additional allocation cannot be provided, the ministry would use its resources effectively through innovative and creative approaches to health financing. The government, he said, believes that the people’s confidence would improve with transparent healthcare allocation. “As a step in that direction, a National Health Fund which is managed with transparency, efficiency and integrity is being considered to pool funds from various sources including tax revenue, non-tax revenue and funds from the ministry’s enforcement activities including from sugar-sweetened beverages tax,” he said. He said this would raise stakeholders' awareness of the importance of healthcare financing. Dzulkefly said that the ministry is studying the direction of the reforms to the healthcare financing system and that an announcement will be made soon. Dzulkefly had also proposed for the National Health Fund in 2020. Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

    "article_text": "... By Ian Randall Deputy Science Editor Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member Nearly half of all Americans struggle to afford access to quality health care and prescription medications. This is the warning of the latest report from the Healthcare Affordability Index, which tracks how many in the U.S. have been forced to avoid medical care or haven't been able to fill their prescriptions in the last three months—and how many would struggle to pay for care if it was needed. Affordability has fallen six points since 2022, down to a record low of 55 percent since the index was launched back in 2021. According to the researchers, this descent mainly affects two age groups: those aged 50–64 (down eight points to 55 percent over the same period) and those 65 and older (down eight points to 71 percent). However, the age group most struggling to afford health care is adults under 50—with 53 percent unable to cover their bills, down five points from 2022. ... The Healthcare Affordability Index is produced every 1–2 years by West Health—a group of nonprofit organizations focussed on aging and healthcare—and polling firm Gallup. \"After an uptick in 2022, health care affordability in America is headed in the wrong direction,\" said West Health president Timothy Lash in a statement. Read More Venus’s Clouds May Contain Alien Life, Astrophysicists Say 4 min read Iceland Volcano Video Reveals How Drones Avert Disaster 3 min read Fat Cats May Help Us Lose Weight 3 min read \"The good news is that health care provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act—including empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, which has not yet taken effect—may help slow these negative trends and provide more stability.\" However, Lash continued, \"Much more must be done to rein in prices for Americans of all ages. \"High prices are one of the biggest impediments to a healthy aging population and a prosperous economy.\" It may provide little comfort, but those struggling with medical costs are far from alone, Lash told Newsweek. \"Millions find themselves in similar situations. Skipping medication or avoiding treatment could have devastating consequences. \"The best thing is to check with your local providers and insurers to understand what the true costs are and what financial assistance could be provided,\" Lash advised. In the opinion of West Health, Lash added, changes are needed at a policy level. \"Healthcare provisions including empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices will help increase affordability, but we must go beyond that to ensure an illness doesn't get worse or turn into a financial disaster for any American. \"High healthcare prices are a policy choice. It's time to enact different policies including fully transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based payment models, implementing more population-specific and person-centered care models, and increasing generic drug competition.\" To calculate the index's latest value, the researchers polled 5,149 US adults from across the country using a combination of both mail- and web-based surveys. Each participant was grouped into one of three categories based on their reported ease in accessing and paying for medical care, prescription drugs included. \"Nonfinancial barriers may include lack of transportation, limited provider networks, inadequate insurance coverage, or other issues,\" Lash said. \"We wanted to account for barriers other than financial. However, the Index shows high prices are the biggest barriers.\" Those in the \"cost secure\" category noted no recent issues accessing or paying for health care. In contrast, \"cost insecure\" respondents reported being recently unable to either access or pay for care and medicine, while those dubbed \"cost desperate\" faced both hurdles. ... Overall, the survey found that 45 percent of American adults are either cost insecure or desperate, compared to 39 percent in 2022 and 44 percent in 2011. According to the researchers, younger adults are more than three times more likely to be cost-desperate than their counterparts aged 65 and over, at 10 versus 3 percent. The analysis also highlighted other inequalities, with Black and Hispanic adults significantly more likely to find themselves cost-desperate than their white counterparts—at 11 and 14 percent, compared to 7 percent. Furthermore, 11 percent of women were classified as cost desperate, nearly twice as many as their male counterparts (at 6 percent.) Is US health care good value for money? While U.S. health care appears to have grown less affordable overall, it would appear that the public is growing slightly happier with quality of such relative to the amount paid. In fact, the amount of Americans who believe the care they receive is worth the cost has increased by 9 percent since 2021, according to the accompanying Healthcare Value Index also published by West Health and Gallup. However, overall, public satisfaction could be improved, with 36 percent of US adults believing that they—and Americans generally—are being overcharged for their care. The findings follow those of the recently released West Health–Gallup Survey on Aging in America, which reported that one-in-three Americans—some 72.2 million people—have avoided seeking out health care in the last quarter due to cost. \"The year 2022 showed encouraging trends of increased health care affordability, post-pandemic,\" said Gallup senior researcher Dan Witters. \"The decline in 2024 is concerning in that it shows the fragility of American's purchasing power amid a high-priced health care system. \"In a relatively short time, many adults have gone from feeling confident they can cover their health care costs, to struggling to cover their medical bills.\" The full findings of the Healthcare Affordability and Value Indices have been published on the Gallup website .

This is especially important as downtime in medical equipment can lead to patient safety issues, revenue losses, and higher costs. In the USA, medical errors are of course one of our leading causes of death due in large part to problems with equipment. Equipment breakdowns can be reduced by up to 60%, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by applying predictive maintenance services. With the US healthcare business increasingly consolidated, there is a significant market for health technology management (HTM) in the United States. As healthcare consolidates and integrates, they also want standardized IT solutions as well as efficiency through their larger networks. But this quest for an efficient and compliant ecosystem also provides the perfect opportunity domain in which HTM firms can contribute their expertise to streamline, secure, and sustain convoluted health technology infrastructure. Healthcare technology management (HTM) firms are well positioned to support integrations that allow large health systems advantages of economies-of-scale but performance-as-a-specificity by providing a full spectrum of services, which can ensure integrated technologies from an operational and technical sense in tandem with the compliance necessities as benchmarked under data-centric governance.

Recently, the healthcare sector experienced a marked increase in data breaches with more than 700 incidents impacting millions of patient records being reported per year by the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services (USDHHS). These breaches leak not only private patient data but also cost millions an average of $10.93 million for a healthcare sector breach, the highest figure across all industries still more on criminal recovery fees paying them off into the client’s company if it comes to that! Against the backdrop of stringent regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance, it emphasizes another crucial aspect - namely that healthcare is possibly one area where cybersecurity can have significant implications in terms of protecting patient data within a regulatory standard. Healthcare Technology Management Market Key Segmentation: By Services Type Maintenance & Repair Integrated Software Platform Cyber Security Capital Planning Quality & Regulatory Compliance Labor Management Supply Chain (Procurement) By Facility Acute care facility Post-Acute Care Facility Non-Acute Care Facility Regional Analysis North America had a dominant market share of 40% in 2023. Factors contributing to the dominance of North America include a well-established healthcare industry, high adoption rates for digital health technologies, and strong regulations necessitating robust cybersecurity implementations. The United States is most invested in healthcare IT security, with widespread attention on the issue following well-publicized data breaches exemplifying a typically weaker point within the sector. These breeds of occurrence have stirred a pro-active reaction including major funding towards cybersecurity solutions and staff training. This is further supported by the fact that many of the leading cybersecurity firms and healthcare-focused researchers are located in North America as well. Regulations like HIPAA add stringent data protection requirements on healthcare providers, making them spend tons more resources in keeping patient records secure to avoid fines and maintain confidentiality. The result is an environment of compliance and forward movement in good security practices everywhere. North America enjoys clear dominance in the health sectors of cybersecurity - all these are a direct consequence of its proactive attitude, stringent regulatory requirements, and substantial investments related to protecting confidential patient data as well as ensuring trustworthiness (trust) about digital healthcare solutions.

    "article_text": "The World Bank recently approved $150 million in financing to improve the quality and accessibility of primary health care services in Sri Lanka. These services encompass essential functions such as birth control, immunizations and general health counseling. This investment marks one of the most significant health care projects in Sri Lanka’s history. Although Sri Lanka’s health care system has shown resilience, it still requires additional support to address ongoing challenges, necessitating foreign aid. The World Bank recognizes the hard work and dedication of Sri Lanka’s primary health care workers and aims to create a more responsive and accessible health care infrastructure. With one of the world’s fastest aging populations, this project is crucial for enabling the health care system to adapt and respond effectively to new and emerging challenges. Sri Lanka in Context Sri Lanka urgently needs more health care resources due to capacity challenges and the lack of formal referral mechanisms. These ongoing issues have resulted in the underutilization of primary health care facilities and overcrowding at tertiary care centers, leading to poor service and long wait times. Longstanding structural weaknesses, worsened by an economic crisis , have compromised the quality of the country’s health care. Additionally, fiscal indiscipline in Sri Lanka has led to high fiscal deficits and substantial gross financing needs, creating significant financial debt and causing severe shortages of goods in 2022. Noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cervical cancer are the leading causes of death and illness in Sri Lanka, responsible for 80% of all deaths. Effectively controlling and managing these diseases requires robust screening, early diagnosis, treatment and follow-up—services that primary health care can adequately provide. The Sri Lanka Primary Health Care System Enhancing Project focuses on these ongoing evolving health priorities, investing in preventive care and promoting primary care facilities as the first point of contact for health care services. Sri Lanka Primary Health Care System Enhancing Project The newly approved funds will establish the Sri Lanka Primary Health Care System Enhancing Project, which aims to improve the quality of care and increase the utilization of primary medical care institutions. This project is designed to provide essential health care services to local communities that currently lack access to quality health care. It includes several key components: Primary health care services. Increasing the availability of primary health care services and enhancing the capacity of existing institutions. Medical supplies. Enhancing the availability of essential medical equipment, medicines, supplies, laboratory testing equipment and transportation. Health care workforce. Sustaining and strengthening the primary health care workforce by supporting recruitment, retention, distribution and delegation of health care workers in primary health care institutions. Additional services. Expanding primary health care services to include additional services for the aging population, persons with disabilities, individuals with poor oral health and young children, utilizing newly acquired equipment. Looking Ahead The $150 million financing from the World Bank aims to bolster Sri Lanka’s primary health care system by addressing critical capacity issues and enhancing service delivery. This funding can potentially increase access to essential medical supplies, strengthen the health care workforce and expand services for the aging population and those with disabilities. By focusing on primary health care, Sri Lanka seeks to improve disease management and meet the growing health needs of its population . – Mathieu Paré Mathieu is based in Toronto, Canada and focuses on Global Health for The Borgen Project.

    "article_text": "Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALNY) rallies 3.8% this week, taking five-year gains to 246% editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) July 14, 2024 3 min read ALNY When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ:ALNY ) which saw its share price drive 246% higher over five years. On top of that, the share price is up 76% in about a quarter. Since the stock has added US$1.2b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Alnylam Pharmaceuticals wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit. For the last half decade, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals can boast revenue growth at a rate of 44% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. So it's not entirely surprising that the share price reflected this performance by increasing at a rate of 28% per year, in that time. This suggests the market has well and truly recognized the progress the business has made. To our minds that makes Alnylam Pharmaceuticals worth investigating - it may have its best days ahead. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGS:ALNY Earnings and Revenue Growth July 14th 2024 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Alnylam Pharmaceuticals stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits . A Different Perspective It's nice to see that Alnylam Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 28% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Alnylam Pharmaceuticals better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here. 繼續閱讀 If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.

    "article_text": "Interested In MPH Health Care's (FRA:93M1) Upcoming €1.20 Dividend? You Have Four Days Left editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) July 14, 2024 3 min read 93M1.F Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see MPH Health Care AG ( FRA:93M1 ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase MPH Health Care's shares before the 19th of July in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of July. The company's next dividend payment will be €1.20 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of €1.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, MPH Health Care stock has a trailing yield of around 4.8% on the current share price of €24.80. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether MPH Health Care can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for MPH Health Care Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. MPH Health Care is paying out just 17% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. MPH Health Care paid a dividend despite reporting negative free cash flow over the last twelve months. This may be due to heavy investment in the business, but this is still suboptimal from a dividend sustainability perspective. Click here to see how much of its profit MPH Health Care paid out over the last 12 months. DB:93M1 Historic Dividend July 14th 2024 Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing? When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's not ideal to see MPH Health Care's earnings per share have been shrinking at 4.4% a year over the previous five years. Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. It looks like the MPH Health Care dividends are largely the same as they were nine years ago. If a company's dividend stays flat while earnings are in decline, this is typically a sign that it is paying out a larger percentage of its earnings. This can become unsustainable if earnings fall far enough. Story Continues Final Takeaway Has MPH Health Care got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have shrunk noticeably in recent years, although we like that the company has a low payout ratio. This could suggest a cut to the dividend may not be a major risk in the near future. In summary, MPH Health Care appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it. On that note, you'll want to research what risks MPH Health Care is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for MPH Health Care that you should be aware of before investing in their shares. A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a full list of high-yield dividend stocks. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Encouraging patients to share their stories and experiences can build trust and understanding, enhancing the therapeutic relationship. Healthcare providers can use narrative medicine to connect with patients on a deeper level, making them feel heard and valued. Sharing inspiring stories of recovery can offer hope and motivation to others, fostering a supportive community. Digital storytelling is also gaining traction in the healthcare world. This approach uses multimedia presentations to narrate patient experiences. A video or audio recording of a patient's journey can be a compelling tool for both education and connection. It offers a real, first-person perspective that can be more impactful than traditional methods of communication. This can be particularly useful for healthcare professionals to understand patient needs and for policy makers to make informed decisions. By recognizing and interpreting patients' stories, providers can improve patient care and foster a more inclusive healthcare environment. Doctor Marketing, MD advocates using personal and patient stories both in one-on-one patient interactions and in broader health education materials. This method not only engages patients but also cultivates a more compassionate approach to medical practice. Building a Connection Through Patient Stories Connecting with patients through storytelling can enhance empathy, improve communication, and foster a more inclusive healthcare environment. This approach benefits patients and healthcare professionals alike, making medical care more personal and effective. Optimizing Storytelling in Healthcare Settings Storytelling in healthcare settings can improve communication, empathy, and patient engagement . It involves healthcare education , digital tools, and evidence-based approaches to achieve meaningful impact. Incorporating narratives into medical education can enhance learning and understanding. Why Storytelling Matters in Medical and Healthcare Marketing Humanizes the Practice : Stories transform clinical environments into relatable, human-centered spaces. They showcase the compassionate side of healthcare professionals, making them more approachable and trustworthy. Builds Trust : Patients are more likely to trust a healthcare provider who shares success stories and testimonials. These narratives act as social proof, validating the quality of care provided. Enhances Engagement : Engaging stories captivate audiences more effectively than statistics and facts. They encourage patients to spend more time on your website, follow your social media, and ultimately choose your practice. Crafting Effective Healthcare Stories Focus on the Patient : Center your stories around patient experiences. Highlight their struggles, the treatment process, and their recovery. This resonates deeply with potential patients who may be facing similar issues. Showcase Staff Stories : Share stories about your healthcare team. Highlight their expertise, dedication, and the reasons they chose to work in healthcare. This builds a personal connection and showcases the human side of your practice. Use Visuals : Incorporate photos and videos to make your stories more vivid. Visual content is more engaging and can convey emotions and experiences powerfully. Keep It Authentic : Authenticity is key. Ensure that the stories you share are genuine and reflect real experiences. Avoid overly polished or exaggerated narratives that may come across as insincere. Highlight Outcomes : Focus on positive outcomes and transformations. Show potential patients the benefits of choosing your practice through real-life examples. Platforms for Sharing Stories Website : Dedicate a section on your website for patient testimonials and success stories. Include written narratives, videos, and photo galleries. Social Media : Use platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to share short stories, patient quotes, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your practice. Blog : Maintain a blog where you regularly publish detailed stories about patient journeys, staff experiences, and healthcare insights. Email Newsletters : Incorporate stories into your email newsletters to keep your audience engaged and informed. Storytelling in healthcare is a powerful tool to attract and retain patients. By sharing authentic, engaging stories, you humanize your practice, build trust, and create lasting connections with your audience. Start integrating storytelling into your marketing strategy to see a significant impact on patient engagement and loyalty.

    "article_text": "DUBAI , UAE , July 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- XRP Healthcare LLC is proud to announce the successful registration of its trademark in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This milestone follows the company's strategic incorporation in the crypto -friendly Gulf state late last year and underscores its commitment to global expansion and brand protection. Continue Reading XRP Healthcare LLC Successfully Registers Trademark in the UAE, Strengthening Global Expansion and Legal Compliance (PRNewsfoto/XRP Healthcare) In addition to the UAE, XRP Healthcare has secured trademark registrations in the United Kingdom and Uganda . The UK trademark was registered shortly after the company's formation in September 2022 , marking the beginning of XRP Healthcare's commitment to protecting its brand. Registration in Uganda is crucial for branding its future healthcare establishments across Africa with the XRP Healthcare logo, ensuring consistency and recognition. The new trademark in the UAE further solidifies XRP Healthcare's presence and safeguards its brand in a key international market. The registration of the XRP Healthcare trademark in these strategic regions brings significant benefits, including enhanced brand protection and the ability to operate confidently within diverse and dynamic markets. This achievement is part of a broader strategy to ensure legal compliance and establish a strong foundation for business operations worldwide. XRP Healthcare has been diligently working behind the scenes to meet all legal requirements, demonstrating its dedication to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and legal integrity. The successful trademark registration in the UAE positions XRP Healthcare to create additional revenue streams through royalties from businesses and companies seeking to license the XRP Healthcare brand and logo. This strategy allows XRP Healthcare to capitalize on its strong brand reputation while supporting other healthcare-oriented enterprises. Examples of potential licensees include: - Hospitals and Clinics: Healthcare providers looking to enhance their brand credibility and recognition. - Pharmaceutical Companies: Businesses seeking to align with a trusted healthcare brand. - Medical Device Manufacturers: Companies aiming to leverage the XRP Healthcare brand to promote their products. - Health and Wellness Centres: Establishments focusing on holistic health services. - Individual Practitioners: Healthcare professionals wanting to affiliate with a reputable brand. This approach not only generates new revenue but also expands the reach and influence of the XRP Healthcare brand within the healthcare sector. XRP Healthcare is actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions in Uganda as part of its broader strategy to enhance healthcare access and quality across Africa . The successful trademark registration in the UK, Uganda and now the UAE provides added security and value to these initiatives, ensuring that the XRP Healthcare brand is protected and recognized. Peter Waiswa, a seasoned Ugandan healthcare expert, has recently joined the XRP Healthcare team. His extensive experience and insights into the local healthcare landscape will be invaluable as XRP Healthcare continues to expand its operations and impact in Uganda . \"Governments often lack the resources to address all healthcare needs adequately. Therefore, initiatives like those led by the private sector, such as XRP Healthcare, are valuable. They can leverage expertise and resources from international investors to enhance the local healthcare sector through strategic investments.\" Keith Errey , CTO, added, \"The team's hard work behind the scenes is making these achievements possible. Our goal is to make healthcare truly affordable and accessible whenever people need it.\" Whitney Lynn , Chairman, commented, \" This achievement demonstrates our commitment to brand integrity and legal compliance. It provides a solid platform for future collaborations and expansions.\" Laban Roomes, Business Development Officer, noted, \" The ability to license our brand in the UAE offers significant opportunities for revenue generation and brand influence.

    "article_text": "The Australian Digital Health Agency has outlined specific steps to increase the uptake of healthcare identifiers across health facilities. ANZ Health Information Exchange (HIE) By Adam Ang | July 11, 2024 | 8:12 PM Photo: Cavan Images/Getty Images The Australian Digital Health Agency has released a five-year roadmap for raising the uptake of national healthcare identifiers in Australia. Developed with the Department of Health and Aged Care and Services Australia, the National Healthcare Identifiers Roadmap 2023-2028 outlines s pecific actions to take for the broad adoption of healthcare identifiers, which are unique numbers used to identify individuals, healthcare provider individuals, and healthcare provider organisations. These identifiers are issued through the national system, HI Service, operated by Services Australia. WHY IT MATTERS The federal government envisions a future where national healthcare identifiers are readily available and universally used by all individuals and healthcare providers in all health information exchanges and digital health projects involving health information sharing. It also aims to reduce or eliminate the mismatch in individuals' identification; streamline the management of identifiers and associated documents, such as digital certificates; and enable individuals to use identifiers to control their information and manage their privacy. \"Increased adoption of the national healthcare identifiers will mean Australians will avoid having to retell their story as they move across the health system,\" Simon Cleverley, assistant secretary of Digital Health at DoHAC, explained. \"Access to information in real time will also support healthcare providers to make well-informed clinical decisions and care plans.\" In the coming years until 2028, the government will pursue the activities outlined in the roadmap, focusing on legislative changes, service improvements, technical updates, and operational enhancements. It seeks to reform the HI Act, which implements the national system for assigning unique healthcare identifiers; publish a federal government policy position on HI Service adoption; develop a simple guide to the HI Act; create a template of policies and guidelines on healthcare identifiers use ; and issue a policy on healthcare identifiers use in consumer applications. Work to improve the HI Service includes enhancing data matching (including for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples) and data quality, reviewing existing messages and responses, improving search considerations, creating individual healthcare identifiers for newborns, and enabling consumers to enter or verify registration data and easily update their information. On the technical side, the government seeks to create guidance for organisations on appropriate structures, the conduct of a conformance review and update of the HI Service, the update of its technical standards, the extensibility of the HI Service architecture, and the development of guidelines on clinical systems architecture and functional requirements. To improve operations, a stakeholder engagement and communication plan and educational materials for the HI Service will be developed. There will be a review of support arrangements and monitoring and feedback processes and the continuous improvement of the HI Service. Finally, there will be a review and update of the HI Service's governance structure and processes. THE LARGER CONTEXT The creation of the National Healthcare Identifiers Roadmap is part of actions outlined in the National Healthcare Interoperability Plan 2023–2028. The plan also seeks the wide uptake of healthcare identifiers \"to enable a connected and interoperable health system where every person, healthcare provider, and organisation can be accurately and quickly identified.\" Also part of the ADHA's Interoperability Plan is collaborating with industry. In 2022, the agency partnered with Health Level Seven Australia to raise the adoption of FHIR standards across the Australian health system. ON THE RECORD \"Healthcare identifiers are the linchpin for safe, secure, and seamless information sharing across the nation’s healthcare system in near real time. They are central to the evolution of digital health and will empower Australian healthcare consumers to have continuous care across all healthcare facilities in every corner of Australia,” Peter O’Halloran, chief digital officer at ADHA, said in a media statement.

The incident, which occurred a couple of weeks ago, was a disturbing subject during the 5th anniversary celebration of the Community 22 Polyclinic (CPC) in Ashaiman. Professionalism: Speaking in his capacity as the chairman for the anniversary themed \"Continuing Our 5-Year Journey of Excellent Healthcare Delivery through Innovation, Professionalism, and Community Involvement,\" Nii Adzor expressed profound grief over the loss, attributing it to the negligence of a nurse on duty at the Tema General Hospital at the time. He emphasised that such lapses in the healthcare system are unacceptable and called for immediate measures to prevent future occurrences. \"This unfortunate event has brought immense sorrow to our family, and there is a need for us as a society to look at the critical need for efficient healthcare services. Many innocent lives have been lost as a result of a nurse's negligence at work. Where do we crack the whip?\" he quizzed. Lack of oxygen: He indicated again that the lack of oxygen supply at a crucial moment is a glaring example of the systemic issues that need to be addressed urgently. The Chief commended the Community 22 Polyclinic for its consistent delivery of quality healthcare services since its establishment. He praised the clinic’s management and staff for their dedication and proactive approach to handling medical emergencies, which has significantly benefited the residents of Ashaiman and beyond, to the point that the facility has not recorded any deaths. Commendation: \"CPC has been a source of hope and a model for excellent healthcare delivery in our community. Their commitment to patient care and readiness to handle emergencies are commendable. Besides, since its inception, they haven't recorded any deaths,\" he said. Nii Annang Adzor also touched on the importance of proactivity among healthcare professionals. He urged nurses and other medical staff to remain vigilant and responsive to the needs of patients, emphasising that their roles are crucial in saving lives and maintaining public trust in healthcare institutions. Support: In a gesture of support, the chief pledged to donate GHC10,000 towards the completion of the clinic's maternal ward. This contribution, he hopes, will enhance the clinic’s capacity to provide comprehensive maternal and child healthcare services. Nii Adzor called on the Regional Health Director to partner with his firm in providing accommodation for health practitioners. He noted that adequate housing is essential for attracting and retaining skilled healthcare workers, which, in turn, ensures the sustainability of high-quality healthcare services in the region. \"The wellbeing of our healthcare workers is paramount. By providing them with suitable accommodation, we can help create a conducive environment for them to perform their duties effectively,\" he added. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Polyclinic equally thanked the Ashaiman chief for his support and exceptional leadership qualities.

    "article_text": "Dublin, July 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"U.S. Pediatric Home Healthcare Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Service (Rehabilitation Therapy Services, Skilled Nursing Services), Region, and Segment Forecasts, 2024-2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The U.S. pediatric home healthcare market size is anticipated to reach USD 21.24 billion by 2030 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.85% from 2024 to 2030 The anticipated growth is observed due to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in children and technological advancements to provide medical assistance and continuous care at home for children with medical complexities. The National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs conducted in 2019-2020 revealed that 14.1 million children in U.S., comprising approximately 19.4% of all children, had special healthcare needs. Sickle cell disease is the most commonly inherited blood disorder in the U.S. Children with sickle cell disease experience recurring episodes of severe pain and face ongoing medical challenges. Receiving early and consistent medical care and treatment can reduce complications and help children lead active lives. Asthma, being the most common chronic disease in children, has affected more than 4.5 million children in U.S. have asthma. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for home healthcare services due to restrictions on movement and social distancing measures. Moreover, the number of children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN) is increasing, which necessitates the provision of pediatric home healthcare services. These services can improve the child's quality of life and significantly reduce medical expenses.

    "article_text": "Dalian, China, (ANTARA/PRNewswire)- \"AI in healthcare is extremely challenging. For companies, it requires not only solving scientific problems but also understanding AI technology and respecting the complexity of the healthcare industry.\" At the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as Summer Davos, in Dalian, Ms. Gong Rujing (Yingying), Chairwoman and Founder of Yidu Tech, was invited as a distinguished representative of the healthcare technology sector. She shared her unique insights into the future of AI in healthcare during the thematic dialogue on \"Healthcare Analytics, Not Moving Fast Enough.\" This year marks the 10th anniversary of Yidu Tech and Ms. Gong Rujing's decade-long dedication to the healthcare industry. \"I will continue this mission for decades to come and strive to do even better,\" she stated. From the inception of her entrepreneurial journey 10 years ago, she has been driven by the mission to leverage the power of technology to deliver precise healthcare to every individual. Ms. Gong described the past decade as a journey filled with miracles and achievements. During this period, Yidu Tech has progressively established close collaborations with key stakeholders in the healthcare industry, including government agencies, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, insurance firms, experts, and clinicians. As of March 31, 2024, Yidu Tech's \"AI Medical Brain\" YiduCore has been authorized to process and analyze over 5 billion medical records, covering more than 2,500 hospitals. Leveraging YiduCore's accumulated understanding of AI technology and medical knowledge, Yidu Tech and its partners are jointly driving innovation and progress in the healthcare field. In regional population health management, Yidu Tech has assisted in constructing urban \"health brains,\" with several benchmark projects implemented in cities such as Beijing and Ningbo. In AI-powered clinical research, Yidu Tech has supported researchers and clinicians in producing over 240 high-level papers, accelerating the application of research outcomes. Additionally, Yidu Tech provides clinical trial services to globally renowned pharmaceutical companies, helping them optimize trial processes, reduce costs, and bring new drugs to market more swiftly, ultimately benefiting patients. In healthcare management, Yidu Tech's AI technology plays a crucial role by analyzing vast amounts of medical data to provide comprehensive decision support to healthcare administrators, helping them optimize resource allocation and improve service efficiency. The number of active users on Yidu Tech's health management platform, each completing at least one transaction, has reached nearly 27.6 million. \"These achievements are all empowered by medical data analysis and AI technology.\" \"We are now entering a new era of AI technology.\" The development of large language model technologies has opened up new possibilities across various industries. Yidu Tech has independently developed a large model specific to the medical field and is advancing its application across the entire healthcare industry chain, including medicine, pharmaceuticals, insurance, and patients. The goal is to promote further progress and innovation through new AI technologies. However, Ms. Gong also emphasized that the healthcare industry is professional, complex, and sensitive, and the application of new technologies must address challenges such as data security, privacy protection, and ethics. \"Data security and privacy protection are fundamental to the development of AI technology and medical big data technology. We must ensure that all stakeholders are satisfied with compliance, security, accessibility, and privacy protection.\" She illustrated this point with a vivid example: \"If a patient is in a coma and in critical condition, unable to express their wishes, should the doctor immediately access their medical records without the patient's consent? This requires deep consideration and balance.\" \"AI technology still has a long way to go.\" She called on policymakers, healthcare institutions, and technology companies to work together to realize the immense potential of healthcare data. Ms. Gong highlighted that building trust is key, and enhancing data operability is essential to fully unleash the power of data. \"It's not just about better data quality; it's about a better future for health.\" Joining Ms. Gong in the dialogue were Professor Chong Yap Seng, Dean of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore; Dr. Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit; and Dr. Angela Wang Nan, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of Neusoft Group, and Chairman and President of Neusoft Europe.

Amidst the ongoing pandemic recovery and a renewed focus on public health infrastructure, stakeholders are looking towards strategic investments and policy reforms to drive equitable access, innovation, and sustainability within the healthcare sector. The interim budget underscored the importance of expanding medical education facilities within existing hospitals alongside efforts to promote preventive healthcare. A notable initiative targeted at reducing cervical cancer cases through vaccination for girls aged 9-14 was also announced. Moreover, plans for a comprehensive scheme integrating various mother and child care programs highlight the government's commitment to enhancing healthcare services. The budgetary allocations for flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana have seen increases reflecting a strategic focus on improving healthcare access and outcomes across the country, mission was increased from Rs2,100 crore in 2023-24 to Rs4,108 crore in 2024-25. Additionally, the introduction of digital health initiatives, such as the U-WIN platform aims to optimize vaccine distribution and strengthen immunization efforts through enhanced data management capabilities. Now the upcoming budget holds immense significance for the healthcare sector as it navigates through a period of transformation and challenges. The expectations are high for Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to announce measures that not only address immediate healthcare needs but also pave the way for long-term sustainable growth. From infrastructure investments to digital health integration and reforms in insurance and education, the budget is anticipated to set a course that strengthens India's healthcare ecosystem for years to come. A critical aspect of the healthcare demands revolves around accessibility and affordability. Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat have laid the foundation for universal health coverage. The sector advocates for subsidies or free health check-ups, especially for women and children, aiming to improve preventive care and early detection of diseases.In line with the government's Digital India initiative, there is a strong opportunity to integrate advanced digital health technologies into mainstream healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics are seen as transformative tools that can enhance medical outcomes, streamline healthcare delivery, and reduce costs. The sector expects incentives and support for domestic manufacturing of medical devices, aligning with the 'Make in India' campaign and reducing dependency on imports.Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer pose a significant health burden in India. Experts expect a need for increased budget allocation for the prevention, treatment, and management of NCDs. This includes supporting research, public awareness campaigns, and accessible treatment options to curb the rising prevalence of these diseases. The healthcare sector also expects strategic moves to address the improvement in the healthcare system at the grassroots level. Additionally, there is a call for initiatives that support training and reskilling healthcare workers to leverage new technologies and meet evolving healthcare demands effectively. Key priorities include addressing the effort to expand recruitment efforts. These measures are crucial for improving healthcare delivery and meeting the growing demand for quality medical services across the country.In health insurance, stakeholders seek fiscal reforms that promote a more inclusive and sustainable health coverage model. This includes revisiting GST tariffs on healthcare services and products ensuring affordability and accessibility across all socioeconomic segments. Moreover, encourages insurance coverage for preventive healthcare measures rather than solely focusing on reactive medical treatments. Healthcare in India has witnessed a significant surge in medical tourism, marked by a notable rise in foreign visitors. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry states â€œThe Medical Value Travel in India is expected to grow at CAGR of 21.1% from 2020-2027. The MVT market in India was estimated at around $ 6 billion in 2022 and is projected to increase to $13 billion by 2026â€. This growth underscores India's increasing prominence in the world as a preferred destination for medical treatments, driven by competitive costs, advanced healthcare facilities, and renowned medical expertise. Hence to continue to maintain the prominence of India's capability in healthcare services and excellence in innovation, it is of utmost importance that the government introduce key policy reforms to further elevate India's stature in medical tourism. We expect that the upcoming budget underlines the clear goal to enhance our healthcare system that ensures every citizen has access to affordable and quality healthcare.

    "article_text": "ADVERTISEMENT DERICK NGAIRA: Quality, affordable healthcare a cornerstone for sustainable development As we mark World Population Day 2024, the country should commit to prioritising health. by DERICK NGAIRA Africa 10 July 2024 - 20:28 ADVERTISEMENT In Summary Allocating domestic resources strategically towards healthcare infrastructure and services is more than just a fiscal choice. A healthy population is not just a measure of prosperity but a fundamental human right that underpins the societal well-being and economic stability of a country. Audio By Vocalize As Kenya joins the world in commemorating World Population Day on July 11, it's imperative to emphasise that the development of a nation hinges profoundly on the health of its citizens and investment in the health sector. This year’s theme is “ Investing in data collection is important to understanding problems, tailoring solutions, and driving progress”. Allocating domestic resources strategically towards healthcare infrastructure and services is more than just a fiscal choice. A healthy population is not just a measure of prosperity but a fundamental human right that underpins the societal well-being and economic stability of a country. Kenya’s healthcare system faces a myriad of challenges. They range from inadequate domestic financial resources, perennial strikes by healthcare workers, to overreliance on donors and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure (OPP). The reduction of the health care budget in the 2024/25 financial year to Sh127 billion, down from Sh138 billion set in the 2023/24 financial year is a huge blow considering the sector is already struggling to meet its core mandate. Evidence analysed by the African Institute for Development Policy (AFIDEP) indicates that health significantly influences the per capita gross domestic product (GDP). A World Health Organization (WHO) study on the impact of maternal mortality on GDP in the African region found that maternal mortality has a notable negative effect on GDP. The study indicates that the death of one mother reduces the per capita GDP by US$ 0.36 annually. By prioritising domestic investment in healthcare, the country builds resilient healthcare systems that meet the diverse needs of the growing population. Robust hospitals, clinics, and health dispensaries with the requisite equipment and staffed by skilled healthcare professionals form the backbone of effective healthcare delivery. Infrastructure investment extends beyond physical facilities. They must include digital health technologies, telemedicine capabilities, and data-driven healthcare management systems that enhance efficiency and accessibility. Investment in healthcare services must pay special consideration to equitable access to quality care for all citizens without incurring exorbitant medical costs. To achieve this, expanding healthcare coverage to enhance affordability is key to cushioning the vulnerable populations. The benefits that come with comprehensive healthcare coverage are immense. From improving health outcomes to reducing disparities in health access among different socioeconomic groups, the overall result is a reduction in overreliance on OOP expenditures. Evidence generated by AFIDEP indicates that a 1 per cent increase in OOP spending correlates with a 3 per cent reduction in economic growth. Conversely, a 1 per cent increase in government general health expenditure (GGHE) and compulsory health expenditure (CHE) contributes significantly to a 5 per cent rise in per capita economic growth. In addition, investing in public health initiatives is crucial for preventing disease and promoting health at a population level. Effective public health interventions include vaccination programmes, health education campaigns, disease surveillance systems, screening services and environmental health initiatives. These efforts not only save lives but also reduce healthcare costs associated with treating preventable illnesses. A study conducted by Mwai et al. (2023) on the investment case for primary healthcare (PHC) in Kenya indicates that for every $1 invested in PHC interventions, up to $16 can be saved in expenditures related to conditions such as stunting, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), anaemia, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and maternal and child health morbidity. Such findings underscore the transformative impact of strategic investments in public health, not only in improving health outcomes but also in optimising healthcare spending efficiency. Lastly, investing in healthcare workforce development is essential. Adequately trained and motivated healthcare professionals are indispensable for delivering high-quality care and driving healthcare innovation. To ensure a sustainable healthcare workforce capable of meeting healthcare challenges, investments in education, training, and professional development programmes for healthcare workers are unavoidable. They are essential in safeguarding the fundamental right to health for all citizens. It helps build a society where everyone has the opportunity to lead a healthy and productive life, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location. As we mark World Population Day 2024, the country should commit to prioritising health as a cornerstone of sustainable development.

    "article_text": "July 10, 2024 HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Healthcare Privacy is Now Effective Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith & Davis LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: On June 25, 2024, the Final Rule issued by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) that amended the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) became effective as a means of further protecting personal health information (PHI) related to reproductive healthcare privacy. Following the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization holding that the right to an abortion is not a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution, OCR responded by promulgating new regulations to protect the integrity of the provider-patient relationship as a means of preserving a person’s expectation of privacy for reproductive healthcare services. As of this date, covered entities and business associates have 180 days, or until December 22, 2024, to comply with the provisions of the Final Rule. The first part of the Final Rule limits the use and disclosure of PHI related to healthcare if it is for certain non-healthcare purposes. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse, or its business associate, is prohibited from using this PHI to (1) conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into, or to impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive healthcare if, under the circumstance, such healthcare is lawful in the state in which it is provided, or (2) from identifying any person for the purpose of conducting such investigation or imposing such liability. This prohibition applies when one or more of the following has been reasonably determined: The type of reproductive healthcare is lawful in the state where such healthcare is provided and under the circumstances under which it is provided; The type of reproductive healthcare is protected, required, or authorized by federal law, including the U.S. Constitution, regardless of the state in which such healthcare is provided; and The type of reproductive healthcare is provided by a person other than the covered healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse (or business associates) that has received the request for PHI with the presumption that the reproductive health care provided is lawful. In other words, a healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse, or its business associate, is prohibited from disclosing PHI related to reproductive healthcare received by a resident of one state who traveled to another state to receive reproductive healthcare, such as an abortion, when it is lawful in the state where such healthcare was provided. A covered entity and business associate is also prohibited from disclosing PHI related to reproductive healthcare if the use of the reproductive healthcare, such as contraception, is protected by the U.S. Constitution. Alternatively, the Final Rule does not prohibit the use or disclosure of PHI related to reproductive healthcare if the purpose is to investigate alleged violations of the False Claims Act, federal nondiscrimination laws, or abusive conduct, such as sexual assault, if it occurs in connection with reproductive healthcare, in addition to audits conducted by the Office of Inspector General initiated to protect the integrity of the Medicare or Medicaid programs. The second part of the Final Rule requires attestation from the requestors that they are not seeking PHI related to reproductive healthcare for a prohibited purpose.

    "article_text": "Agencies (Representative image) Mumbai: At a time when healthcare insurance premiums are steadily inching up, the Aditi insurance scheme piloted by Bengaluru-based hospital chain Narayana Hrudayalaya (NHL) stands out. For an annual premium of Rs 10,000 for a family of four, it provides a cover of Rs 1 crore for surgeries and Rs 5 lakh for medical treatments at NHL network of hospitals. In a first such move for a leading healthcare player, NHL last week announced Aditi scheme under Narayana Health Insurance . It is initially being rolled out in Mysuru. NHL has adopted the ‘managed care’ model wherein healthcare is provided at subsidised costs to those who subscribe to the insurance plans or become members. The model has been implemented globally with reasonable success. For instance, in the US, hospital chains such as Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger Health System and Intermountain Healthcare have different formats of providing managed care services. In India, too, Bengaluru-based healthcare startup Even, founded in 2020, offers a managed care plan to its members for as low as Rs 400 per month for a person. This model attempts to address the issues that are faced by the insured in the conventional health insurance schemes that have an open network of hospitals. Live Events The insurance company cannot enforce standard room rates across an open network that has all kinds of hospitals. It has little control on preventing incidences of over-treatment. This becomes easier in case of a managed care model with a restricted network of hospitals. There is hardly any incentive for an integrated healthcare player providing the healthcare service to push the insured to undergo needless hospitalisation and procedures. A limited network of hospitals also makes it possible to have better control on costs, thereby reducing the cost of medical care for the insured. However, the model suffers from certain restrictions. It provides a limited ability to go outside the network, except during emergencies. It will work very well for a local, individual cohort of patients in a particular city that are being catered to by a few hospitals of the chain. But cannot work for large corporates that have to provide health insurance for their employees across the country. Besides, a vertically integrated healthcare player that provides insurance as well as treatment needs a strong governance system. Otherwise, there can be an incentive to avoid surgeries due to the inherent conflict of interest with the care provider and the payer being the same entity. In a bid to control costs, there can emerge instances of delayed or denied care. Moreover, the financial risk as well as regulatory compliance increases for the healthcare entity that operates as a managed care organisation. An established mid-sized healthcare chain like NHL with its network of 21 hospitals across India is well placed to roll out such a model and gradually expand it nationally. The healthcare player can leverage the value of its integrated network to benefit middle-class households and local businesses to get access to affordable healthcare. This model is essentially catering to the middle-class households that are not necessarily eligible for Ayushman Bharat but cannot afford paying high premiums and copays under private healthcare insurance schemes. For a large under-penetrated market like India, different models of healthcare delivery need to co-exist to cater to different income groups. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

WHEN WE LOOK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS GRAPHIC, YOU SEE WHAT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT JOBS, PRIMARILY THOSE ARE TEMPORARY HELP AGENCIES, EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS THAT THERE’S BEEN A VERY BIG INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT IN THOSE IN THAT INDUSTRY, AND THAT’S LARGELY THE RESULT OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRIES HAVING TO REACH OUT TO THOSE TO HIRE TEMPORARY AND TRAVELING NURSES, ETC. RIGHT. I VISITED A FAMILY MEMBER RECENTLY, BRIAN, IN A HOSPITAL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND SHE HAD JUST HAD SURGERY AND I NOTICED THAT THE STAFFING ON THE WARD WAS VERY THIN COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS BECAUSE I USED TO WORK IN HOSPITALS.

NOW, WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GRAPHS BELOW THAT, WE SEE OVERALL POPULATION GROWTH EXPECTED TO GROW MUCH MORE SLOWLY. AND WE’RE OUT OF TIME.

    "article_text": "Image: — © AFP Anthony WALLACE Image: — © AFP Anthony WALLACE Telemedicine’s climb appears to be stalling, a trend that could compound the already staggering financial losses —$150 billion annually for the U.S. healthcare industry – due to patient no-shows. One of the most common reasons given for no-shows, particularly among seniors, is lack of transportation. Chris Ochs, chief development officer at Kerico , a company that provides non-emergency medical transportation services, explains why access to reliable transportation is critical for patients, care providers and communities. As patients increasingly return to in-person medical visits, the U.S. healthcare system is beset with a new set of challenges. The first is that telemedicine services, which provided a convenient alternative during the height of the pandemic, are now experiencing a decline in usage . Simultaneously, the demand for reliable transportation to medical appointments is increasing, particularly among senior citizens who cite transportation issues as the primary reason for missing appointments 65 percent of the time. Ochs explains that studies have shown that transportation barriers are directly linked to reduced use of regular outpatient care, increased emergency department visits and higher readmission rates. These factors not only contribute to elevated healthcare costs but also strain clinic revenue, staff productivity, and create scheduling and operational stress. Ochs urges healthcare providers, policymakers and community leaders to prioritize investments in non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) as a cost-effective solution to mitigate the impending crisis. He argues that by providing reliable transportation, communities can significantly improve healthcare accessibility and reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system. Research indicates that for every dollar spent on NEMT, $11 is saved in long-term care. “As a nation, we must act swiftly to address this impending healthcare crisis,” Ochs explains. He adds: “Investing in reliable non-emergency medical transportation is not just a matter of convenience; it’s a critical step in ensuring equitable access to healthcare, improving patient outcomes and reducing the financial strain on our healthcare system.” His final recommendation is: “By prioritizing NEMT, we can build a more resilient and patient-centric healthcare infrastructure that serves the needs of every individual in our communities.” In this article: Medical , Nurse , Patient , TeleHealth , telemedicine Written By Dr. Tim Sandle Dr. Tim Sandle is Digital Journal's Editor-at-Large for science news.

Serving as a crucial link between medical professionals and patients, these frontline caregivers play a multifaceted role in ensuring the well-being of individuals under their care. Different roles Allied health professionals encompass a diverse array of roles crucial for the identification, evaluation, and prevention of diseases and disorders, as well as for the provision of rehabilitative and management services. From dental hygienists ensuring oral health to diagnostic medical sonographers using ultrasound for internal imaging; from dietitians offering nutritional guidance to medical technologists conducting laboratory analyses, each profession has its role to play. Occupational therapists aid individuals regain functional independence, while physical therapists focus on restoring mobility and reducing pain. Radiographers operate imaging technology for diagnostic purposes, respiratory therapists specialise in treating breathing disorders, and speech-language pathologists address communication and swallowing difficulties across age groups. While providing essential care and support to patient, paramedical staff assist doctors in various procedures. Their duties encompass a range of tasks, including assisting with personal hygiene, monitoring vital signs, aiding in mobility, performing basic tests, participating in patient treatment plans, and offering emotional support to patients and their families. Educational requirements Individuals interested in pursuing a career as a healthcare professional have several educational pathways to consider. While a high school diploma or equivalent is typically preferred by most employers, there are options available for further education and training. Diploma programmes cover essential topics such as anatomy, physiology, patient care techniques, and medical terminology over a span of 12 to 24 months. For those seeking a more in-depth education, Bachelor’s degree programmes in healthcare or related fields provide theoretical knowledge combined with practical training over three to four years. Alternatively, certificate programmes offer focused, skill-based training in specific areas such as basic life support and anatomy within a shorter time frame, typically ranging from three to 11 months. Each path provides its own benefits and caters to different career goals and levels of specialisation within the field. In addition to formal education and certifications, allied health professionals must possess a diverse set of skills and qualities. Compassion, empathy, and a genuine desire to alleviate suffering are paramount, as they often interact with individuals who may be in distress. Paramedical staff may find employment in various healthcare settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, medical equipment manufacturing companies, pharmaceuticals, emergency services, educational institutions, and home care agencies. Opportunities In the realm of allied health professionals, various job titles and career progression pathways offer diverse opportunities for professional growth and advancement. Entry-level positions often include roles such as technicians, nursing assistant, or medical assistant, where individuals provide direct patient care and support to healthcare professionals. With experience and further education, paramedical staff can progress to roles such as senior technician or healthcare assistant, where they may take on additional responsibilities such as training new staff or supervising junior colleagues. Beyond clinical roles, healthcare assistants can transition into administrative positions within healthcare facilities, such as medical office manager or healthcare administrator, where they oversee operations, manage budgets, and coordinate patient care services. Overall, the field of healthcare assistance offers a range of job titles and career progression opportunities, allowing individuals to tailor their professional journey according to their interests, skills, and aspirations.

    "article_text": "(Los Angeles Times) Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Proposition 34 would limit how certain healthcare providers spend revenues from a federal prescription drug program. The measure is an effort by the real estate industry to limit spending by the L.A.-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has bankrolled several rent control initiatives, including one on the 2024 ballot. What will the measure do? The measure applies to healthcare providers who have spent over $100 million in any 10-year period on things besides direct patient care and have run multifamily housing with more than 500 \"high-severity health and safety violations.\" If a healthcare provider meets that standard they would be required to spend 98% of their revenues from a federal prescription drug program on direct patient care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The measure also permanently allows the state to negotiate Medi-Cal drug prices on a statewide basis. Who are the supporters? The measure is sponsored by the California Apartment Assn., which has tangled with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation for years over its efforts to enable stricter rent control laws through ballot initiatives. Proposition 34's language does not name the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the measure's backers say it could apply to other healthcare groups as well. But no other health organization has such a well-publicized history of spending money on things other than direct patient care, operating housing with health and safety complaints and forcing the real estate industry to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to beat back rent control. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, commonly referred to as AHF, takes in about $2 billion a year in revenue. Most of that comes from a federal discount drug program called 340B that requires drug makers to sell their drugs at discounts to certain healthcare providers, who then turn around and charge health insurance companies more for the drugs. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office , the program is supposed to enable providers like AHF to serve more low-income patients, but federal and state law \"does not directly restrict how providers spend their revenue from federal drug discounts.\" In recent years, AHF has drawn criticism that its foray into housing strays from its mission of helping those living with HIV or AIDS. In recent years, the healthcare foundation has spent more than $300 million to fund rent control initiatives and buy apartment buildings across the country, including in and around Skid Row, saying housing is a public health issue, including for those with HIV or AIDs. The foundation says it's taken nearly 1,000 people off the streets and put them into permanent housing at its Skid Row-area properties, but those buildings have also been beset with heating, plumbing, elevator and electricity failures and vermin infestations, The Times found in an investigation published last fall. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Other supporters of Proposition 34 include health organizations such as the ALS Assn. and the California Chronic Care Coalition. Who are the opponents? The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, as well as outside groups like Consumer Watchdog and the National Organization for Women. Why is this on the ballot? The California Apartment Assn . says the measure will increase spending on patient care and, by permanently allowing the state to negotiate Medi-Cal drug prices, will lock in \"billions of dollars in state savings every year\" and thus lessen the rationale for taxes on its members. Much of the recent advertising in favor of Proposition 34 hasn't named AIDS Healthcare Foundation or its President Michael Weinstein specifically, but the apartment association has previously singled them out as a target. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Last year, a California Apartment Assn. communications director wrote on the trade group's website that Proposition 34 was \"aimed at preventing Weinstein from misusing taxpayer dollars on future rent control campaigns or other political ventures unrelated to the core mission of the AHF.\" The real estate group's Protect Patients Now campaign committee also singled out Weinstein and AHF, when it listed them as the only named targets on the front page of its website. The post on the apartment association's website has since been removed, as have the AHF and Weinstein references on the campaign committee's website, but they both remain visible in internet archives. Nathan Click, a spokesman for Protect Patients Now, did not respond to a request for comment. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The AIDS Healthcare Foundation has accused Protect Patients Now of \"lying to voters and taxpayers about how AHF makes its money\" and has called the measure anti-tenant and anti-patient. AIDS Healthcare argues the measure is unconstitutional because the proposition singles it out for punishment, which supporters argue is false because, in theory, other organizations could qualify. AHF sued to remove Proposition 34 from the ballot but was unsuccessful. Mary-Beth Moylan, a law professor at University of the Pacific, said courts generally are reluctant to remove measures before an election, but judges may look more favorably upon AHF's claims if Proposition 34 passes and the organization challenges it, as it has vowed to do. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I think there is a good chance a court would find this unfairly punishes and targets a particular organization and person and that is really not allowable,\" Moylan said. If the measure passes and the courts uphold it, Moylan said, \"it would be really unfortunate in terms of precedent setting.\" \"It would encourage other groups to do these kind of retaliatory initiatives,\" she said. How much money has been raised? The California Apartment Assn. has contributed nearly all of the supporting funds. The opposition is funded by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. CEO of GLLG, Glenn Llopis covers leadership and business strategy Follow Author Jul 02, 2024, 05:20pm EDT Dec 03, 2024, 03:57pm EST Share Save Comment Healthcare Leadership In Crisis: Time For Reinvention By LightFieldStudios Sharing our frustrations about our personal experiences with healthcare in the United States can sometimes feel like screaming into the void. Many of us feel that when it comes to our health and our very lives, we are anonymous cogs in a massive machine that just moves us along standardized paths. Sure, we might get some great treatment along the way (if we have enough money or good insurance), but we also might just feel lumped in with the masses and not seen or heard as an individual level. The encouraging news is that those working in healthcare feel the same frustrations the rest of us do. They want change just as much as we do. They know the industry needs to evolve, but most are unsure how to make that happen in an industry with such entrenched systems. I know this because I have spent a lot of time interacting directly with hundreds of people at every level of the industry, both clinical and administrative. In fact, I just finished hosting and facilitating an invigorating 2024 Healthcare in the Age of Personalization Summit . This two-day virtual summit featured a wide range of experts in the field, covering topics such as transforming organizational cultures, adopting a personalization mindset, healthcare leadership skills requirements, employer branding, operationalizing personalization, navigating healthcare’s operational unknowns, health inequities, digital transformation pros and cons, and much more. This article is the first in a 14-part weekly series, during which I will share summit insights from a roster of healthcare leaders spanning all facets of healthcare organizations from the boardroom and C-suite to the patient’s bedside. We heard from presidents and CEOs; from administrators who specialize in strategy, human resources, communications, and branding; and from doctors, nurses, and educators. Why such a wide range? Because transformation in healthcare requires everyone. First, here’s a taste of what’s to come. These are just some of the themes that emerged over two days of enlightening conversations among summit participants—themes that I will explore in more depth throughout this series: MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Healthcare is big business. As it operates today, our industry incentivizes the medicine, not the cure. So, how do we change? As much as healthcare is about innovation and technology, at heart it’s about humans as individuals. How do we keep that at the center? Are you trying to build empathy within a culture of bullies? The importance of organizational culture in your pursuit of personalization. CEOs have a lot to learn from nurses about leadership. People use a lot of tools to capture information from the frontline: but do you take action as a result? We have to learn to be open to contrary ideas and not run away from the discomfort they bring. How to ensure operational efficiency without sacrificing the personalized care that is crucial for great patient care and outcomes. Is Your Organization Ready for ‘The Individual Revolution’? We’re in an era that RBC Capital Markets calls “ The Individual Revolution .” Power is shifting from traditional institutions to individuals. This shift is poised to redefine the global economy and disrupt existing centers of powers. It's no longer about businesses defining individuals; it's about individuals shaping the process toward a shared mission. Personalization is shaping healthcare's future, but healthcare leadership has not been trained to practice personalization. Leaders need entirely new skills to be effective in this Individual Revolution. Is your organization offering training for these new skills, or are you stuck with training that solidifies irrelevant and ineffective leadership methods? Most are stuck. That’s why this summit focused on how healthcare organizations can consider both patients and employees as important consumers whose needs and expectations must be met for the organization to succeed. This involves improving patient care and also enhancing the employee experience. Employees as Consumers – On day 1, there were six sessions to help people understand how to work, lead, and conduct business differently now that employees are consumers. Leaders must learn how to know employees’ capacities and empower them to use their unique skills, competencies, and insights to innovate and mobilize change. This can guide healthcare providers’ transformation toward a more responsive, effective, and sustainable system through the development of new care models, improved patient and employee engagement, new supply chain strategies, a more inclusive and resilient work environment, and much more. Patients as Consumers – The day 2 sessions focused on patients as consumers, to help people understand the symbiotic relationship between employees and patients and their impact on health outcomes. This requires physicians and caregivers to know patients as individuals and learn what matters to them. This also presents the opportunity to leverage data analytics and digital technologies to create personalized treatment plans that improve patient outcomes, enhance patient satisfaction, and reduce healthcare costs. Healthcare organizations are experiencing many threats: an aging population that needs more care, while also experiencing a shortage of physicians and nurses to deliver that care, among many other challenges. But it's not the threats themselves that make healthcare leaders vulnerable. It's their inability to respond in real time when those threats arise. We have reached a critical juncture in healthcare leadership that demands reinvention in the ways that we work, lead and conduct business, given the scale, scope, pace, and interconnectedness of healthcare's challenges. Leaders must stop ruling by standards that don't account for what matters to patients, employees, and the communities they serve. In other words, personalization is the driving force of healthcare's transformation. Yet healthcare leaders are unprepared for this new reality. I've learned many things about operationalizing personalization over the past five and a half years of leading this work, but one thing stands out the most. Personalization threatens standardization, and standardization fights back hard. So, what does that mean for us as leaders? Our responsibility is to coach leaders that are stuck in the limitations of old outdated standards and help them see personalization as a critical growth opportunity in healthcare. Watch this short video for an introduction to the topics of this series. Over the next several weeks, I’ll continue to pass along the experiences and insights from the summit. Next up: the introduction of the Day 1 topic: employees as consumers. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"
