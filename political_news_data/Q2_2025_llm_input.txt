‘Planned obsolescence’ is a charge that has been levelled at tech companies like Apple, with good reason – but there’s still plenty of life in old devices ‘Not for you’ upgrade: Apple’s iOS 26 upgrade was not available to older devices. Photo: Getty Adrian Weckler Sat 14 Jun 2025 at 03:30 Do gadget makers deliberately make products break or become almost useless after a few years to encourage a new cycle of purchases? That’s the theory known as ‘planned obsolescence’ and it’s a regular charge made against the tech industry. I was thinking about this last week when Apple announced its latest round of software updates for iPhones, MacBooks and iPads.

Command Line AI Tech Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s AI hiring spree ﻿How Meta’s CEO is spending heavily to reboot his AI team. Also, Apple has an AI problem. ﻿How Meta’s CEO is spending heavily to reboot his AI team. Also, Apple has an AI problem. by Alex Heath Jun 14, 2025, 12:16 AM UTC Link Share Getty Images / The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. AI researchers have recently been asking themselves a version of the question, “Is that really Zuck? ” As first reported by Bloomberg , the Meta CEO has been personally asking top AI talent to join his new “superintelligence” AI lab and reboot Llama. His recruiting process typically goes like this: a cold outreach via email or WhatsApp that cites the recruit’s work history and requests a 15-minute chat. Dozens of researchers have gotten these kinds of messages at Google alone. For those who do agree to hear his pitch (amazingly, not all of them do), Zuckerberg highlights the latitude they’ll have to make risky bets, the scale of Meta’s products, and the money he’s prepared to invest in the infrastructure to support them. He makes clear that this new team will be empowered and sit with him at Meta’s headquarters, where I’m told the desks have already been rearranged for the incoming team. Most of the headlines so far have focused on the eye-popping compensation packages Zuckerberg is offering, some of which are well into the eight-figure range. As I’ve covered before , hiring the best AI researcher is like hiring a star basketball player: there are very few of them, and you have to pay up. Case in point: Zuckerberg basically just paid 14 Instagrams to hire away Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang . It’s easily the most expensive hire of all time, dwarfing the billions that Google spent to rehire Noam Shazeer and his core team from Character.AI (a deal Zuckerberg passed on). “Opportunities of this magnitude often come at a cost,” Wang wrote in his note to employees this week. “In this instance, that cost is my departure.” Zuckerberg’s recruiting spree is already starting to rattle his competitors. The day before his offer deadline for some senior OpenAI employees, Sam Altman dropped an essay proclaiming that “before anything else, we are a superintelligence research company.” And after Zuckerberg tried to hire DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu , he was given a larger SVP title and now reports directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai . I expect Wang to have the title of “chief AI officer” at Meta when the new lab is announced. Jack Rae , a principal researcher from DeepMind who has signed on, will lead pre-training. Meta certainly needs a reset. According to my sources, Llama has fallen so far behind that Meta’s product teams have recently discussed using AI models from other companies (although that is highly unlikely to happen). Meta’s internal coding tool for engineers, however, is already using Claude. While Meta’s existing AI researchers have good reason to be looking over their shoulders, Zuckerberg’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale is making many longtime employees, or Scaliens, quite wealthy. They were popping champagne in the office this morning. Then, Wang held his last all-hands meeting to say goodbye and cried. He didn’t mention what he would be doing at Meta. I expect his new team will be unveiled within the next few weeks after Zuckerberg gets a critical number of members to officially sign on. Tim Cook. Getty Images / The Verge Apple’s AI problem Apple is accustomed to being on top of the tech industry, and for good reason: the company has enjoyed a nearly unrivaled run of dominance. After spending time at Apple HQ this week for WWDC, I’m not sure that its leaders appreciate the meteorite that is heading their way. The hubris they display suggests they don’t understand how AI is fundamentally changing how people use and build software. Heading into the keynote on Monday, everyone knew not to expect the revamped Siri that had been promised the previous year. Apple, to its credit, acknowledged that it dropped the ball there, and it sounds like a large language model rebuild of Siri is very much underway and coming in 2026. The AI industry moves much faster than Apple’s release schedule, though. By the time Siri is perhaps good enough to keep pace, it will have to contend with the lock-in that OpenAI and others are building through their memory features. Apple and OpenAI are currently partners, but both companies want to ultimately control the interface for interacting with AI, which puts them on a collision course. Apple’s decision to let developers use its own, on-device foundational models for free in their apps sounds strategically smart, but unfortunately, the models look far from leading. Apple ran its own benchmarks , which aren’t impressive, and has confirmed a measly context window of 4,096 tokens. It’s also saying that the models will be updated alongside its operating systems — a snail’s pace compared to how quickly AI companies move. I’d be surprised if any serious developers use these Apple models, although I can see them being helpful to indie devs who are just getting started and don’t want to spend on the leading cloud models. I don’t think most people care about the privacy angle that Apple is claiming as a differentiator; they are already sharing their darkest secrets with ChatGPT and other assistants. Some of the new Apple Intelligence features I demoed this week were impressive, such as live language translation for calls. Mostly, I came away with the impression that the company is heavily leaning on its ChatGPT partnership as a stopgap until Apple Intelligence and Siri are both where they need to be. AI probably isn’t a near-term risk to Apple’s business. No one has shipped anything close to the contextually aware Siri that was demoed at last year’s WWDC. People will continue to buy Apple hardware for a long time, even after Sam Altman and Jony Ive announce their first AI device for ChatGPT next year. AR glasses aren’t going mainstream anytime soon either, although we can expect to see more eyewear from Meta, Google, and Snap over the coming year. In aggregate, these AI-powered devices could begin to siphon away engagement from the iPhone, but I don’t see people fully replacing their smartphones for a long time. The bigger question after this week is whether Apple has what it takes to rise to the occasion and culturally reset itself for the AI era. I would have loved to hear Tim Cook address this issue directly, but the only interview he did for WWDC was a cover story in Variety about the company’s new F1 movie. Elsewhere AI agents are coming. I recently caught up with Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi ahead of his company’s annual developer conference this week in San Francisco. Given Databricks’ position, he has a unique, bird’s-eye view of where things are headed for AI. He doesn’t envision a near-term future where AI agents completely automate real-world tasks, but he does predict a wave of startups over the next year that will come close to completing actions in areas such as travel booking. He thinks humans will need (and want) to approve what an agent does before it goes off and completes a task. “We have most of the airplanes flying automated, and we still want pilots in there.” Buyouts are the new normal at Google. That much is clear after this week’s rollout of the “voluntary exit program” in core engineering, the Search organization, and some other divisions. In his internal memo, Search SVP Nick Fox was clear that management thinks buyouts have been successful in other parts of the company that have tried them. In a separate memo I saw, engineering exec Jen Fitzpatrick called the buyouts an “opportunity to create internal mobility and fresh growth opportunities.” Google appears to be attempting a cultural reset, which will be a challenging task for a company of its size. We’ll see if it can pull it off. Evan Spiegel wants help with AR glasses. I doubt that his announcement that consumer glasses are coming next year was solely aimed at AR developers. Telegraphing the plan and announcing that Snap has spent $3 billion on hardware to date feels more aimed at potential partners that want to make a bigger glasses play, such as Google. A strategic investment could help insulate Snap from the pain of the stock market. A full acquisition may not be off the table, either. When he was recently asked if he’d be open to a sale, Spiegel didn’t shut it down like he always has, but instead said he’d “consider anything” that helps the company “create the next computing platform.” Link list More to click on: Joanna Stern’s full interview with Apple’s Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak .

Top executives from Silicon Valley giants Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI are trading their corporate suits for military uniforms as they join a newly formed Army Reserve unit focused on upgrading military technology. The Wall Street Journal reports that in an unprecedented collaboration between the U.S. military and the tech industry, a group of Silicon Valley executives are set to be sworn in as officers in the Army Reserve on Friday. The inaugural cohort of this new innovation corps, dubbed Detachment 201, includes Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir; Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, CTO of Meta Platforms; Kevin Weil, Chief Product Officer at OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, a former OpenAI executive. The tech recruits will serve around 120 hours a year, focusing on projects that leverage their expertise in AI, data analysis, and other cutting-edge technologies to enhance the Army’s capabilities. Their mission is to help the military prepare for future conflicts, which are expected to heavily rely on ground robots, drones, sensor networks, and AI-powered coordination systems. Gen. Randy George, the Army’s chief of staff, emphasized the importance of this collaboration, stating, “We need to go faster, and that’s exactly what we are doing here.” The program marks a significant shift in the relationship between the Pentagon and the tech industry, which was once hesitant to work on defense-related projects. The tech reservists will enjoy some unique accommodations, such as the flexibility to work remotely and asynchronously, and will be exempt from basic training. They will hold the rank of lieutenant colonel due to their private-sector status and will be deployed based on their specialized skills, making it unlikely for them to find themselves in combat situations. Instead, the executives will work on projects that teach soldiers how to use AI-powered systems or utilize health data to improve fitness. They will also advise the service on acquiring more commercial technology and help the Defense Department recruit other high-tech talent. To avoid conflicts of interest, the recruits will not work on projects involving their employers and will be firewalled from sharing information or participating in projects that could provide financial gain to themselves or their companies. The tech executives expressed their eagerness to serve and contribute to the nation’s defense. Palantir’s Shyam Sankar, who fled violence in Nigeria as a child, sees the program as an opportunity to give back to the country that provided his family with safety and opportunity. Kevin Weil, an ultramarathon runner, is undaunted by the physical fitness requirements, although he expects the tech recruits to be “humiliated” by the real soldiers. As the inaugural cohort prepares to be sworn in, the Army’s tech-reservist program is already generating interest from other branches of the armed forces. Brynt Parmeter, the Pentagon’s chief talent management officer, is pushing for other services to follow the Army’s lead in recruiting top tech talent to bolster the military’s technological capabilities.

Title: Job creation in India outpaces other countries , but still lower than last year : Indeed data

iStock Indian job postings rebounded strongly in May, up 8.9%, following eight consecutive monthly declines, according to data from hiring platform Indeed. However, they are 1.8% lower than a year ago and around 16% below their peak. Despite trending downwards recently, Indian job postings are almost 80% above pre-pandemic levels, ranking highly compared with other major markets for the platform, although it isn’t a like-for-like comparison. Several countries, led by the UK, New Zealand and Switzerland, have posted volumes that are currently below pre-pandemic levels. By comparison, India's posting volumes are healthy. “Indian job creation continues to outpace other countries because of the nation’s transition towards more formal economic arrangements,” said Callam Pickering, Indeed’s APAC senior economist. “As the nation transitions, job creation across the formal sector will be much stronger than overall employment growth nationwide, and we have consistently seen that in recent years. Other economies are not going through a transition of this nature.” Job postings in around 80% of occupations in India increased over the past three months. Gains were the largest in childcare (+27%), personal care and home health (+25%), education (+24%), and production and manufacturing (+22%). These gains more than offset some weakness in sectors like dental opportunities, down 10.2% over the past three months, along with agriculture and forestry (-8.6%), community and social service (-6.8%) and software development (-4.2%). Live Events While software development opportunities have declined recently, the sector continues to have the largest volume of job opportunities on Indeed, accounting for around one-in-five Indian job postings. It highlights how prominent the tech sector has been in India’s emerging formal sector, with multinationals trying to tap into India’s large talent pool. Further, the data shows that, as of May 2025, 1.5% of Indian job postings explicitly mentioned generative AI in their job descriptions, more than doubling over the past year. Generative AI opportunities are concentrated in the tech sector but are increasingly widespread. Around 12.5% of data analytics roles mention generative AI, ahead of software development (3.6%) and scientific research (3.1%). It’s also commonly mentioned across a range of office roles, including marketing (1.1% of job postings) and management (0.9%). Regional hubs have emerged for jobs that either use or help develop generative AI. In Karnataka, 2.4% of job postings mention generative AI, just ahead of 2.3% in Telangana. Maharashtra has the second-largest volume of generative AI opportunities and the largest volume of total job opportunities, but it’s mentioned in just 1% of job postings. Job creation across India’s formal sector remains strong and rose sharply during May. This continues to facilitate a shift from lower-productivity to higher-productivity work as workers transition into the sector. While there is no shortage of workers in India, finding the right set of skills continues to be challenging in some cases. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Yongyuan | E+ | Getty Images Asia-Pacific markets fell Friday as Israel conducted a military strike on Iran, targeting its nuclear program, while Iran vowed to retaliate. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 pared earlier losses to end the day 0.89% lower at 37,834.25 while the Topix fell 0.95% to 2,756.47. South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.87% to close at 2,894.62 while the small-cap Kosdaq declined 2.61% to 768.86. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended the day 0.21% lower at 8,547.40. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.59% to 23,892.56 while mainland China's CSI 300 ended the day 0.72% lower at 3,864.18. India's Nifty 50 lost 0.64%, while the BSE Sensex was down 0.79% as of 1.45 p.m. Indian Standard time. Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran early Friday morning local time, targeting locations it said were related to Iran's nuclear program. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said, "Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future. Oil prices jumped as much as 13% during the day in Asia. Global benchmark Brent futures were up 6.16% at $73.52 per barrel as of 4.10 pm Singapore time, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 6.39% at $72.38 per barrel. "The market has largely been shrugging off geopolitical risk for the last year, and these development have been a wakeup call that these risks are more tangible and imminent than many expect," Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Marquee told CNBC via email. "It is possible these attacks could be calibrated to add pressure on U.S. Iran negotiations and the situation subsequently de-escalate," he said. U.S. stock futures slid during Asian hours as tensions in the Middle East worsened. U.S. producer prices in May rose just 0.1% from the previous month, coming in cooler than the 0.2% jump expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The softer reading helped boost major stock indexes, while bond yields declined, improving investor sentiment. This followed a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report earlier in the week. Overnight stateside , all three key benchmarks closed higher. The S&P 500 rose, helped by a rally in Oracle that lifted the big tech sector. The benchmark climbed 0.38% to close at 6,045.26. The broad market S&P 500 now sits less than 2% off its record high. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.24% and ended the day at 19,662.48.

Fri, Jun 13 2025 3:48 AM EDT BoJ likely to stand pat on interest rates in Monday meeting: MFS Investment Management The Bank of Japan is likely to stand pat on its policy rate in its two-day policy meeting starting Monday, MFS Investment Management said. This is due to the country's persistent wage and price increments, as well as the global uncertainty around the impact of the U.S.' bilateral trade negotiations on growth and inflation, Carl Ang, fixed income research analyst at the investment firm, wrote in a Friday note. "Stagflation-like risks have intensified for Japan's economy since Liberation Day, favoring an unchanged policy rate with a neutral tone at this month's BoJ meeting," he added. Ang said that the "earliest appropriate time" for further tightening will be in the January-March quarter next year. Still, he noted there may be a surprise rate hike, given that the Japanese yen is set to appreciate against the greenback from "historically weak levels." This however, "remains very much a remote possibility," Ang added. As of 4.40 p.m. local time, the yen had depreciated 0.17% against the dollar to 143.71. — Amala Balakrishner Fri, Jun 13 2025 3:18 AM EDT Hong Kong tech stocks plunge over 2% Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index plunged 2.21% as of 3.15 p.m. local time.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was lower at $104,154.38. Ether slipped over 7% to $2,503.55. The move comes after Bitcoin recently held above $100,000 for more than 30 days in a row for the first time ever.

Oil markets are now concerned that Iran will retaliate by attacking either Israeli or American targets, leading to a major military escalation and a potential oil supply disruption, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. "Iran knows full well that President Donald Trump is focused on lower energy prices," Lipow told CNBC, adding that actions by Iran affecting Middle Eastern oil supplies and consequently raising gasoline and diesel prices for Americans are politically damaging to the U.S. president. —Lee Ying Shan Thu, Jun 12 2025 4:18 PM EDT Stocks end Thursday higher The major averages closed Thursday's trading on a positive note.

Davina Schonle, founder of AI company Humanvantage, was turned away from London Tech Week because she had her baby in a pram. Facebook / Davina Schonle London Tech Week, a prominent event in the global technology calendar, is facing flak over an incident wherein a woman tech founder, accompanied by her baby, was reportedly denied entry, igniting a serious debate about inclusivity and accessibility within the tech industry's major gatherings. Davina Schonle, the founder of AI company Humanvantage, has urged business events to become more inclusive after being refused entry because she had her baby with her at the event. A Mother's Exclusion: The London Tech Week Incident Davina Schonle had planned to attend London Tech Week with her young daughter, who was in a pram. However, after a three-hour drive to the event, she was disheartened to be denied access due to having her daughter with her. In a LinkedIn post , Schonle explained that she limits how long she's away from her baby, believing she should be able to 'build my company with her by my side.' Her post detailing the experience quickly ignited a discussion about inclusion within the tech industry on the platform. After a three-hour drive, Davina Schonle felt 'humiliated' and 'angry' by the incident, which she shared in a viral LinkedIn post. LinkedIn / Davina Schonle A McKinsey report from 2023 highlighted a clear gender imbalance , revealing that women held approximately 35% of entry-level tech roles but only 14% of senior leadership positions. Meanwhile, research carried out by Prospects in 2024 showed that 29% of IT professionals in the UK identify as female or non-binary. Sparking Debate: Inclusivity in the Tech Sector 'As someone passionate about innovation, tech and the future of work, I was excited to attend, connect, have meetings, and contribute,' Schonle wrote in her LinkedIn post. 'In today's age shouldn't we be more inclusive? This moment was more than inconvenient. It was a clear reminder that as a tech industry, we still have work to do when it comes to inclusion beyond buzzwords,' she added. Schonle highlighted that parents are integral to this ecosystem, noting that caregivers are also innovators, founders, investors, and leaders. Then she posed a crucial question: "If major events like London Tech Week can't make space for us, what message does that send about who belongs in tech?' She said, 'I don't necessarily mean make it a kid-inclusive event in general, or do I? Doesn't our future belong to the kids?' Towards the end of her post, Schonle highlighted the excellent inclusivity efforts of individuals like Shaa Wasmund MBE and Vasily Alekseenko, then asked, 'shouldn't these large events be doing more?' Schonle later told The Times that the incident left her feeling 'absolutely humiliated' and 'angry.' Calls for Change: Challenging Industry Norms Davina's LinkedIn post garnered over 3,800 reactions and 1,000 comments within two days. Many commenters proposed boycotting London Tech Week unless the organisers revise their policies regarding parents attending with children. 'Say WHAT? This is a disgrace.

Firebird, a cloud AI company, and the Armenian government, with support from NVIDIA, have launched an initiative to develop a leading AI infrastructure in the region, according to a Firebird statement via Armenpress. The company plans to launch the project in 2026 using thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, creating a system with over 100 megawatts of power. Firebird outlined a $500 million public–private partnership aimed at advancing AI technologies in Armenia. Officials note that this new AI hub will be a key milestone on Armenia’s path to becoming a tech leader. “We welcome NVIDIA’s partnership and the work with Firebird to construct AI infrastructure in Armenia. This is a significant step in strengthening our tech sector and global partnerships,” said Prime Minister Pashinyan, adding that the government is pleased to support this initiative and open new opportunities for the Armenian people and the region. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that AI factories are the infrastructure of the 21st century. Firebird.ai co‑founder and CEO Razmik Hovagimian stated the goal is to create an innovative launchpad from Armenia to the global stage. “We will invest in cutting‑edge models, robotics and sciences in partnership with world‑leading universities, and build capabilities to incubate the next generation of innovators in Armenia,” Hovagimian said.

London Tech Week is taking place at Olympia this week (Picture: Ray Tang/Anadolu via Getty Images) A CEO has called for business events to be more inclusive after being turned away for having her baby with her. Davina Schonle, founder of AI company Humanvantage, was hoping to attend London Tech Week with her young daughter, who was in a pram. But after a three-hour drive to attend the event, she was disappointed to be refused entry because she had her daughter with her. Davina said she limits how long she is apart from her baby, and believes she should be able to ‘build my company with her by my side’. Her post about the experience on LinkedIn sparked a discussion about inclusion in the tech industry. A 2023 McKinsey report showed women made up around 35% of entry-level tech roles but only 14% of senior leadership positions, demonstrating a clear gender imbalance.

Leadership Leadership Strategies An Old, Yet New, Look At Diversity In The Workplace By Eli Amdur , Former Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Leadership professor, job market journalist-analyst, business advisor. Jun 09, 2025, 05:36pm EDT Jun 10, 2025, 09:55am EDT Share Save Comment Happy multigenerational people having fun sitting on grass in a public park getty Diversity, in the last few years, has been transformed from a prominent social, demographic, and organizational issue into a political football. I believe that’s because we’re not looking at it in its fullest sense. We’re looking at it with too much emphasis on statistics and not enough concern for what the data is telling us. Data, we all know, is left-brain food; it is linear, logical, and can be analyzed by entry-level recent graduates. Now, even these young employees are threatened by AI. On the other hand, to see the big picture, we need to flip over to our creative right brains where we connect dots, recognize patterns, and derive meaning. What is diversity? That must be what Malcolm Forbes did when he concluded long ago that “Diversity is the art of thinking independently together.” He made no mention here of adding up the percentages of people from various groups; rather, in a holistic sense, he taught us to think at a higher level. In the end, isn’t that what we want? Isn’t that the ultimate result we seek? A look at some recent studies supports that hypothesis. Boston Consulting Group Studies strongly support the conclusion that organizations embracing a greater diversity in the workplace outperform the competition as well as market index indicators, while delivering higher profits. They also tend to nurture employee’ roles and careers, and enhance stakeholder value. Research by the Boston Consulting Group in 2024 revealed that “increasing the diversity of leadership teams yielded 19% more revenue from innovation compared to less diverse peers.” Actively constructing a workforce that includes people with a whole range of different characteristics – gender, ethnic background, religion, age, sexual orientation, education level, race, socioeconomic status – in fact, anything that might give that person a different outlook on life, is evidently what Forbes was seeing. The Psychology of Diversity Organizations that look like that were studied by Kurt Lewin (1890-1947), the father of social psychology. The more diverse the makeup of a team, found Lewin, the more likely the members were to experience process gain in perspective, synthesis, and clarity. Indeed, this facilitates changes in values, attitude, and behavior needed to implement good decisions. MORE FOR YOU Process gain includes accessing many points of view, fostering a more creative environment, achieving higher productivity, recruiting and retaining the best staff, and opening up new markets. Diversity in the Tech Sector Among companies in the tech sector that lead in diversity and performance, HP stands out with a board comprised of 46% women and 46% minorities. Additionally, 67% of its new hires in the U.S. are women, minorities, veterans, or people with disabilities. And Cisco has maintained its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). It has implemented initiatives like annual pay parity analyses and flexible work policies, contributing to its recognition as a European Diversity Leader. Research Supporting Diversity-Driven Innovation Evidence emphatically suggests that diversity leads to increased innovation, better employee retention, and improved market responsiveness, all contributing to a competitive edge in the marketplace.

Title: Massive Tech Layoffs May Be the Fault of a 2017 Trump Tax Cut

Article Content:
The good times in Silicon Valley are over—at least as far as the current generation of coders is concerned. The software industry is shrinking and, since 2023, the tech industry has been hemorrhaging jobs at an astounding rate. Workers who would’ve been secure several years ago are now out on their asses . While the reasons for this are diverse (AI is often discussed as a potential culprit and the overall economy has had its ups and downs over the past several years), one potential driver could also be the tax cuts that Trump passed in 2017 . It turns out that a little-known provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 altered a longstanding loophole, known as Section 174, that allowed the tech industry to offload the cost of its research and development operations onto the federal government. Prior to the TCJA, tech companies could deduct 100 percent of the costs of R&D, allowing tech businesses the freedom to commit significant resources towards innovation. Bloomberg reports that, as Congress sought to find a way to offset the cost of giving big tax cuts to billionaires, one place where they discovered fat to trim was the tech industry’s R&D funding. 2017’s bill shifted the deduction from a full write-off to funding that would have to be parsed out over a period of several years. The provision that pared back the funding did not kick in until 2022, however. Not long after it went into effect, the tech industry began shedding jobs like nobody’s business. Indeed, 2023 and 2024 were historically bad years for the tech industry, with major companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google booting workers by the thousands. Quartz took a deeper look at the ties between this policy shift and the tech industry’s troubles and now speculates that there is a positive correlation: …the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Quartz also notes that the policy change would have translated into a loss of income for a variety of positions: The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. The reality of the government’s subsidization of Silicon Valley is particularly ironic given the rabid anti-government sentiment currently circulating in the industry. People like Marc Andreessen would have you believe that tech’s R&D can be funded through private money alone, despite no reputable track record of it happening. Elon Musk’s DOGE, meanwhile, recently attacked the very parts of the government that have been responsible for helping companies like his own (Tesla) flourish. It’s yet another sign that America’s billionaires are so greed-addled that they’re willing to shoot a gift horse in the mouth and call it victory. Not everybody in the tech industry is an idiot, however. There is currently a concerted effort to reestablish the government’s R&D subsidy. The American Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act , which was introduced by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, would restore the full flow of federal dollars for tech’s development needs. Last month, representatives from major tech firms reportedly signaled to the Trump administration that they might pull back from previous pledges of U.S. investment if the full tax subsidy didn’t return.

The more diverse the makeup of a team, found Lewin, the more likely the members were to experience process gain in perspective, synthesis, and clarity. Indeed, this facilitates changes in values, attitude, and behavior needed to implement good decisions. MORE FOR YOU Process gain includes accessing many points of view, fostering a more creative environment, achieving higher productivity, recruiting and retaining the best staff, and opening up new markets. Diversity in the Tech Sector Among companies in the tech sector that lead in diversity and performance, HP stands out with a board comprised of 46% women and 46% minorities. Additionally, 67% of its new hires in the U.S. are women, minorities, veterans, or people with disabilities. And Cisco has maintained its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). It has implemented initiatives like annual pay parity analyses and flexible work policies, contributing to its recognition as a European Diversity Leader. Research Supporting Diversity-Driven Innovation Evidence emphatically suggests that diversity leads to increased innovation, better employee retention, and improved market responsiveness, all contributing to a competitive edge in the marketplace.

Command Line AI Tech Popular AI apps get caught in the crosshairs of Anthropic and OpenAI ﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. ﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. by Alex Heath Jun 7, 2025, 12:38 AM UTC Link Share Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Battlelines are being drawn between the major AI labs and the popular applications that rely on them. This week, both Anthropic and OpenAI took shots at two leading AI apps: Windsurf, one of the most popular vibe coding tools, and Granola, a buzzy AI app for taking meeting notes. ”With less than five days of notice, Anthropic decided to cut off nearly all of our first-party capacity to all Claude 3.x models,” Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan wrote on X this week, noting that “we wanted to pay them for the full capacity.” An additional statement on Windsurf’s website said: “We are concerned that Anthropic’s conduct will harm many in the industry, not just Windsurf.” Here, Mohan’s company is collateral damage in Anthropic’s rivalry with OpenAI, which has reportedly been in talks to acquire Windsurf for about $3 billion. The deal hasn’t been confirmed, but even the spectre of it happening was enough for Anthropic to cut off one of the most popular apps that it powers. After a spokesperson told TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff that Anthropic was “prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships,” co-founder Jared Kaplan put it more bluntly. “We really are just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future,” Kaplan told Zeff . “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Meanwhile, OpenAI sent its own warning shot this week to the budding AI app ecosystem. It announced a “record mode” for ChatGPT — initially only for enterprise accounts — that transcribes calls and generates meeting notes. This is the core use case of Granola, one of my favorite AI tools that recently raised $43 million in additional funding and released a mobile app. Given how quickly Granola has evolved to do more than summarize meetings, I suspect that the company isn’t at risk of extinction. Still, it will be harder to grow when hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users eventually have access to its main functionality. It’s unclear how the tension between the product ambitions of OpenAI and Anthropic and the needs of their API customers will settle out. When I interviewed Anthropic’s chief product officer, Mike Krieger , back in March , the company had just announced its own Claude coding competitor to Windsurf and Cursor, which coincidentally raised $900 million this week. I asked Krieger the obvious question: how does Anthropic think about competing with its API customers? He didn’t really have an answer. “I think this is a really delicate question for all of the labs and one that I’m trying to approach really thoughtfully,” Krieger told me at the time. “Hopefully, we’ll all be able to navigate the occasionally closer adjacencies.” AI investor Zak Kukoff put it well this week: “At some point model providers are going to need to decide if they want to be stable platforms or compete for every vertical.” Ultimately, this week served as a wake-up call for the many startups building businesses on the backs of AI models; if you are successful enough, you run the risk of being copied by your model provider. A lot of companies are thinking through this risk right now, especially as OpenAI builds a new team to help its API customers “translate abstract ideas into production applications.” “You have to wonder if the recent moves by the big AI labs to more directly compete with the app layer will be one giant tailwind for incumbents like Google, Amazon, MSFT, etc.,” Michael Mignano , a Granola board member, wrote this week . “If developers can’t trust the labs, maybe it’s better to trust the big guys like they did for cloud?” A different take on AI and job loss This week, I heard two CEOs contradict the growing fear that AI will destroy jobs en masse, at least when it comes to engineering roles. The first was Sundar Pichai , whom I watched speak at Bloomberg’s tech conference in San Francisco. He downplayed Dario Amodei’s doomerism fear about job loss, correctly pointing out that “we’ve made predictions like that for the last 20 years about technology and automation, and it hasn’t quite played out that way.” He went so far as to say, “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base into next year,” because AI “allows us to do more.” The next day, I walked down the street to the Moscone Center to see Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy , who had just spoken to a room of 4,000 developers with AI pioneer Andrew Ng . I asked Ramaswamy if AI had changed his hiring plans, and he said he agreed with a ranking of hiring desirability for engineers that Ng had just described onstage, with the top being experienced engineers who leverage AI tools, followed by early-career engineers who are all-in on AI. He noted that new graduates who avoid AI tools are at the bottom of the desirability ranking and may struggle to find jobs. If anything, it’s the middle of the workforce — those who are in the middle of their careers and hesitant to adopt AI tools — that is the most in danger of near-term displacement, Ramaswamy argued. “Companies tend to accrete middle management, so there’s very much a push to get more people who are doing . How do we get them as leveraged as possible? Snowflake has historically been a little top-heavy on the engineering side, so we are balancing that out.” Overheard “Oh, man, the girls are fighting, aren’t they?” - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commenting on what was the best day on Twitter in years. “Maybe there’s a world where you have one AI in the sky. Maybe you actually have a bunch of domain-specific agents that require a bunch of specific work to make it happen. I think the evidence has really been shifting towards this menagerie of different models.” - OpenAI’s Greg Brockman speaking at the AI Engineer’s World Fair. “Give it a year. We’ll be doing a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate.” - Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas onstage at Bloomberg’s tech conference . “We were accidentally cash flow positive in Q1, which was cool.” - Substack CEO Chris Best speaking at The Information’s creator economy summit. Personnel log As part of a broader leadership reshuffling , Microsoft’s CEO of LinkedIn, Ryan Roslansky , is now also leading the Office portfolio of products. After a short stint as a distinguished AI engineer at Meta, Rohan Anil is leaving to join Anthropic. Richard Fontaine , CEO of the Center for a New American Security, is also joining the board of Anthropic’s controlling trust. Tesla’s head of Optimus, Milan Kovac , is leaving to spend “time with family,” according to Elon Musk. Christian Szegedy , a co-founder of xAI, is leaving to be the chief scientist of an AI startup called Morph. Gary Briggs will serve as the interim chief marketing officer of OpenAI while Kate Rouch takes medical leave .

Home » These surprising cities saw the biggest increase in millionaires These surprising cities saw the biggest increase in millionaires These cities may not be famous, but they’re attracting and producing millionaires in record time. Here’s the list… By Jenna Solomon 06-06-25 18:45 in Travel 0 Shenzhen saw the biggest growth in dollar millionaires over the last decade. Image via Pixabay. While American cities like New York or the Bay Area still boast the most dollar millionaires in real numbers, a few destinations have emerged as new hubs for the wealthy. These cities have seen the biggest increase in dollar millionaires over the past decade. They’re mostly fast-growing centres of technology and innovation. Meanwhile, a few also offer tax incentives to attract the wealthy. That’s according to the World’s Wealthiest Cities Report 2025, which is published by Henley & Partners, a firm that advises the wealthy on where to move to look after their assets. ADVERTISEMENT 1. Biggest increase in millionaires: Shenzhen, China Between 2014 and 2024, Shenzhen saw a 142% increase in dollar millionaires. The Chinese city is a major technology hub, with companies like Huawei and Tencent based there. Once a rustic fishing village, Shenzhen is now the fastest-growing destination for dollar millionaires . The technology scene continues to attract entrepreneurs and financiers. 2. Scottsdale, USA Most South Africans may not hear much about Scottsdale, but tech entrepreneurs and those with six-figure account balances will know all about it. The American city’s millionaire population grew by 125% over the past decade. Like Shenzhen, Scottsdale’s attraction is its booming tech industry. It also offers a luxurious lifestyle, especially in golf estates, and favourable state tax conditions. 3. Bengaluru: Popular with millionaires in India It could be a surprise, but this Indian city is popular with the very wealthy. Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore, saw a 120% increase in dollar millionaires. That took place in just ten years, between 2014 and 2024. The city’s flourishing tech industry, affordable living costs, and growing infrastructure have made it a hotspot for the wealthy. ADVERTISEMENT 4. West Palm Beach, USA Over the past decade, West Palm Beach gained 112% more dollar millionaires. This American city offers the wealthy a laid-back lifestyle, thanks to its coastal location. Because the state of Florida has low taxes, businesspeople and rich professionals also flock to West Palm Beach. 5. Hangzhou, China 108% more millionaires now live in Hangzhou, compared to ten years ago. That growth coincided with the rise of tech companies in the city, including Alibaba. Hangzhou is a historic city with pretty scenery, making it even more attractive to the affluent. If you were a dollar millionaire, which city would you live in?

Experts weigh in Are IT job layoffs making Bengaluru landlords cautious? Brokers say many landlords are now reconsidering lease renewals for tech tenants Updated on: Jun 07, 2025 9:55 AM IST By Souptik Datta Share via Copy link Bengaluru’s residential real estate market is beginning to feel the impact of ongoing job cuts in the tech industry. Suresh Gowda (name changed), 40, who was employed at a medical entrepreneurship firm in the city, had been planning to buy a home. However, after losing his job, he has put those plans on hold and is now focusing on finding new employment while exploring investments in stocks and other avenues instead. Real estate brokers point out that several landlords in Bengaluru are now uncertain about renewing leases for techie tenants, with many discussing whether to continue or end agreements after the 11-month term. (Representational Image) (ChatGPT ) Real estate brokers say the wave of layoffs has shaken buyer sentiment and dampened market confidence. It’s not just homebuyers and tenants who are concerned; landlords, too, are growing cautious. Several landlords in Bengaluru are reportedly reconsidering lease renewals for tech sector tenants, with many debating whether to extend agreements after the standard 11-month term or let them lapse amid rising uncertainty. This comes as global MNCs have already declared major layoffs in 2025. According to media reports, Microsoft has announced a fresh round of layoffs impacting 305 employees, just weeks after it laid off over 6,000 staff members worldwide. In its official statement, Microsoft said it is making “organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” Will tech layoffs spark lease renewal doubts among Bengaluru landlords? Real estate brokers point out that several landlords in Bengaluru are now uncertain about renewing leases for techie tenants, with many discussing whether to continue or end agreements after the 11-month term. "Today in Bengaluru, landlords are becoming doubtful about tenants, especially from the tech sector. We see a lot of discussions happening around whether landlords should renew agreements with techies or let them go when the 11-month rental term ends," said Kiran Kumar, vice president at Hanu Reddy Realty. In some cases, tenants are struggling; they’re already paying EMIs and can’t manage the rent. These kinds of discussions are common now, especially in areas like Marathahalli and near Manyata Tech Park, he said. Also read: Bengaluru tech layoffs: Is it the right time to invest in real estate? Netizens weigh in Why does Bengaluru real estate rely on layoffs and market movement? According to Vestian Research, the IT-ITeS sector accounted for 40% of all real estate leasing in the city in 2024, highlighting its heavy dependence on the tech industry. With global tech firms continuing to announce layoffs, a decline in hiring and rising job losses could trigger a chain reaction, delaying home buying and rental demand, experts say. They say Bengaluru provides a comprehensive ecosystem for the tech industry, encompassing education, a robust talent pool, and ample opportunities for the real estate sector. "Most real estate buyers in Bengaluru are salaried professionals, with a significant number relying on home loans. The majority are employed in IT companies or in roles that support the tech industry. As apartment prices continue to climb, we are also seeing growing interest from CXOs and business professionals, particularly those linked to the technology sector," Zayd Noaman, president of CREDAI Bengaluru, previously told HT.com. Layoffs and their impact on Bengaluru real estate Experts note that the rising adoption of automation and artificial intelligence is reshaping the tech industry, altering the demand for certain roles and causing shifts in the job market. While growth is slowing in some areas, new opportunities are emerging in advanced tech fields. "With job uncertainty looming, the overall decision-making cycle of homebuyers has gone up. They are taking their time to make a final decision. This shows that they are somewhat cautious," Priyanka Kapoor, senior vice president, Research, ANAROCK Group, told HT.com. "It is always advisable to be cautious while investing in real estate assets. Prospective buyers should meticulously analyse their financials and make informed decisions as real estate investments are long-term commitments," Shrinivas Rao, FRICS, CEO, Vestian, said. Also Read: Bengaluru rentals stay high as landlords capitalize on return-to-office demand, but tenants remain wary Will Bengaluru’s rental market flatten out? Rental rates have remained flat over the past few months compared to the same time last year, said Kumar. “In high-growth areas near tech corridors in the east and north of Bengaluru, there hasn’t been significant rental appreciation. Places like Marathahalli, Electronic City, and Whitefield have seen fewer rental enquiries. While rents in these areas rose by 15–20% last year, this year the increase is much lower, around 7–8%.” Also Read: Bengaluru real estate: One month’s rent for a fresh coat of paint now the norm in the IT Capital’s rental market As the market normalizes following the bull run of the last 3-4 years, “a price correction is expected, particularly in cases where properties are overpriced,” said Raghavendra Rao, AVP of marketing at Indiassetz. Since 2023, popular rental hubs like Koramangala, Sarjapur Road, Whitefield, and Bellandur saw rent increases of up to 20-35% annually. “Now, landlords are becoming more flexible on rent expectations, especially in suburban pockets, where supply has risen and tenants are more cost-conscious due to stagnant salary growth,” Rao noted. Overall, while a short-term correction may affect prices and rents in Bengaluru’s real estate market, experts added that long-term fundamentals remain strong, particularly as the city continues to be a major tech and business hub.

TOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Jun 6, 2025, 10:11 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, advocates for renewed collaboration between Silicon Valley and the US military, highlighting the industry's historical roots in defense. He emphasizes a "return to grace" through partnerships like Meta's with Anduril Industries for AI-powered military gear. Bosworth clarifies that Meta's involvement focuses on supplying components with multi-use potential, not a full shift to defense contracting. Andrew Bosworth, CTO, Meta Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth has issued a stark reminder to Silicon Valley about its foundational relationship with the US military, suggesting that a renewed partnership marks a "return to grace" for the tech industry. Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech Summit, Bosworth emphasised that the tech industry was originally built on military collaboration, and that a “silent majority” in Silicon Valley has always supported defense projects. He emphasised that the region was essentially built on a "three-way investment between the military, academics, and private industry." Meta’s defense tech push Bosworth’s remarks follow Meta’s recent partnership with Anduril Industries , a defense tech firm, to develop AI-powered military gear , including augmented reality helmets. He stated that Silicon Valley’s roots in military innovation had been severed over time, but the industry is now reopening to defense collaborations. "The effort has been funded through private capital, without taxpayer support, and is designed to save the US military billions of dollars by utilizing high-performance components and technology originally built for commercial use," Anduril said in its May statement. Historically, many tech companies avoided military contracts, with employees protesting defense-related projects. However, Bosworth believes the tides have turned, and that patriotism and technological advancement can coexist. Bosworth clarified that Meta’s partnership with Anduril does not signal a shift toward defense contracting. "They have a system within a program, and we’re simply supplying them with components. Everything we’re developing is designed for consumers, with a clear focus on consumer audiences," he stated. He further explained, "A lot of this technology has potential for multi-use applications, and that’s where I see an opportunity to build a partnership." AI Masterclass for Students.

Title: Tech got played by the Musk - Trump bromance , but average Americans will pay the price

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways I admit I’m disappointed that Saturday Night Live’s season is over and we won’t get a cold open on Elon Musk’s public breakup with President Donald Trump, but I am resisting the urge to be amused. I think the somber truth is that the US tech industry, which got played by the bromance, will be hurt by all of this for decades. But the biggest loser will be the average American. Technology has been the key to US prosperity since World War II, and Musk’s bitter split with the White House is symbolic of the dagger being driven through the industry’s future. The cuts to basic research will reverberate for decades. Preventing current and future foreign scientists and technologists from coming here or studying here is a self-inflicted wound that may never heal. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The DOGE argument for slashing research dollars, as it was described to me by sources, was that the money was going to the wrong places, and universities were capturing too much of it before it ever made its way to the lab. It needed to be wiped out and then redistributed. The system was long overdue for serious reform. But if DOGE had a plan as it took a sledgehammer to an essential element of American innovation, we’ll likely never see it now. And even so, the damage has been done. The effects are so widespread that you can’t avoid bumping into them. This week, I met a startup founder trying to cure diseases who has to contend with tariffs on basic lab equipment. I met a college professor whose Chinese research assistants have gone from being would-be patriotic Americans to potentially being sent home to help America’s biggest rival. And I spoke to a venture capitalist who can already see the pipeline of investable academic projects threatened by cuts in research. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Long before some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names leapt onto the Trump train, the seeds of that revolt had been planted. The Biden administration made clear that the Democratic Party was no longer an ally of the tech industry. The Trump administration seems willing to meet the right people in tech and say the right things, but its policies are antithetical to a thriving ecosystem of innovation. The tech industry should now ask: Which political party is willing to do what it takes to maximize American innovation? Which party is willing to set aside petty differences and ego, and work in the interests of American prosperity? And then it should wait to see who can prove it. About Our Ads

Jun 4, 2025 How culture attracts commerce in Utah County Utah County has one of the youngest labor forces in the country — that’s a draw for some employers. The Age of Work by Kai Ryssdal , Maria Hollenhorst and Andie Corban Play Listen Now Save Share Download Ryan Brady, Director of the Utah County office of Foundever, a contact center company, speaks with “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson about the company’s recruiting challenge. Marketplace As part of our ongoing series “The Age of Work” about how demographic shifts — specifically the aging U.S. labor force — are shaking up the global economy, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and ADP chief economist Nela Richardson visited Utah County, which is one of the youngest in America . Yesterday, we explored Utah’s entrepreneurship culture at a startup incubator . Today, we’re looking at the relationship between established employers and Utah County’s labor force. One reason for Utah County’s low median age (25.5 compared to almost 39 nationally), is the number of college students in the area. Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University, with about 80,000 students between them, are both located within the county. Plus, the University of Utah and several community and technical colleges are all within commuting distance of Utah County employers. Julia Anas, chief people officer at Qualtrics, a home-grown Utah County technology company with dual headquarters in Provo, Utah, and Seattle, Washington, said the company recruits heavily from the local universities. “But there are folks we've also relocated here to experience Utah, its beauty and obviously the opportunities it can create for families.” Over the past 10-15 years, northern Utah’s tech industry has exploded. An analysis from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah found that in 2018, Utah’s tech industry supported one in seven jobs in the state and one-sixth of worker earnings. Some of those jobs are from local startups, like Qualtrics. But much of that growth is from well-established companies, including Adobe , Oracle , and Microsoft , opening offices in Utah County. “Utah has made its place on the map,” said Anas. She relocated to Utah from California several years ago for her job at Qualtrics. “I think it's really attractive for those who have younger families.” Another industry that’s found a home in Utah County is contact centers, sometimes called “call centers.” These are companies that allow other companies to outsource their customer relations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Customer Service Representative is the most common job in Utah County. “There are a couple of reasons why Utah is a good place for a contact center,” said Ryan Brady, the operations director of the Utah office of Foundever, a global contact center company headquartered in Luxembourg. “We have had a lot of success with the particular demographic, or the group of people that's here.” Ryssdal and Richardson spoke with Brady about what makes Utah County uniquely suited to the industry.

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 4, 2025 at 6:50 AM PDT | UPDATED: June 5, 2025 at 10:43 AM PDT The Bay Area has lost more than 11,000 tech jobs so far in 2025, a slump in hiring punctuated by disclosures of fresh layoffs in the region by big players such as Google, Walmart and Microsoft. The three major companies disclosed their intentions to eliminate a combined 168 jobs, according to WARN letters the companies sent to the state Employment Development Department. All were described as permanent. Walmart will slash 108 positions on Aug. 22, affecting workers at a San Bruno site where the retailer crafts e-commerce and online services. On July 6, Google will layoff 53 workers in Sunnyvale. In Mountain View and Sunnyvale, Microsoft announced plans for eight staffing reductions on Aug. 1. The former autonomous vehicle company Cruise said one job cut occurred on May 30. The tech industry is no longer a robust engine that helps to power the Bay Area economy. Instead, it has begun to weigh down hiring . The weakness in the Bay Area tech industry so far in 2025 is widespread, according to seasonally adjusted estimates that Beacon Economics derived from the monthly reports released by the state EDD. Of the 11,200 net loss in tech jobs for the Bay Area, the majority occurred in the San Francisco-San Mateo region. The nosedive in tech employment has materialized in the San Francisco metro area despite some optimistic assessments that the artificial intelligence industry was providing a jobs lift to the city. Here is how tech job trends looked in the Bay Area’s three largest urban centers over the first four months of 2025, according to this news organization’s compilation of the Beacon Economics industry estimates: — San Francisco-San Mateo suffered a net loss of 5,400 tech jobs. — The South Bay lost 3,400 tech jobs. — The East Bay shed a net total of 2,100 tech jobs. In the North Bay, Sonoma County lost 200 tech jobs, and Marin County lost 100 positions. Tech job totals were unchanged in Solano County and Napa County over the first four months of this year. The tech industry has entered what appears to be a protracted period of attempting to right-size its operations in the Bay Area after massive hiring sprees during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, companies also have jumped into new fields such as artificial intelligence even as they downsized in sectors that did not appear to be as promising.

2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool June 4, 2025 5 min read SPOT META Key Points Up 44% year to date, this streaming service stock keeps moving higher thanks to its newfound profitability. This social media giant boasts some of the best fundamentals within the tech sector. 10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms › After a very tough start to the year, tech sector stocks are back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dipped as much as 24% from highs set earlier this year. However, in recent weeks, the index has rallied significantly, erasing nearly all of those losses and pulling back to even for 2025. Given this market recovery, those looking to invest in tech stocks are now wondering what stocks are worth considering when the market is trading near all-time highs. There are two tech stocks that I would strongly consider right now. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Spotify Technology First up is Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) . As of this writing, Spotify stock is up 50% year to date, making it one of the top-performing stocks so far in 2025. Indeed, over the last three years, Spotify is up more than 477%. What's behind this excellent performance? And why do I think the stock will continue to beat the market? There are three main reasons for the company's success. First, Spotify boasts a strong competitive moat. By creating personalized playlists and honing its suggestions based on its users' likes and dislikes, Spotify gives its customers what they want when they want it. In addition, with over 675 million monthly average users , Spotify now benefits from a significant network effect, where people can easily connect with others to share new tracks and playlists. Consequently, Spotify users are less likely to leave the platform once they have built out their musical preferences and connected with friends. Second, Spotify's fundamentals have improved greatly. In particular, Spotify is now a consistently profitable company -- something that couldn't be said a few years ago. Indeed, take a look at Spotify's net income by quarter, and it's clear that the company has turned an important corner. After many quarters of struggling to generate any profit at all , the company has now produced several quarters of net income in the $200 million to $300 million range. Over the last 12 months, Spotify's net income stands at $1.3 billion. Spotify's management is the last key piece to the puzzle. CEO Daniel Ek deserves credit for Spotify's performance. In 2022, Ek prioritized profitability by slashing costs while still focusing on growth. He's both the founder and CEO of the company; his capable leadership and solid track record are more reasons investors should have confidence in Spotify . Story Continues 2. Meta Platforms Then there's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . Here, too, t here are three aspects of Meta's stock and its business that I find particularly appealing. First off, Meta is a leader in digital advertising. The company generates a staggering $170 billion in annual revenue, and around 97% of that revenue comes from ad revenue generated by its social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. What's more , the digital advertising sector continues to grow at a strong pace. Statista estimates that by 2030, fully 80% of all advertising will be digital, amounting to around $1.2 trillion worldwide. That would represent an increase in digital ad spending of roughly 50% over the next five years. Second, Meta is a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company , too . It has invested billions in AI infrastructure, which is already generating returns for the company by improving ad strategies and return on investment (ROI) for advertisers on its platforms, which, in turn, drive higher ad rates. As Meta continues to invest in AI, higher platform engagement and additional (perhaps paid) features could help drive higher revenue and profitability for the company. Lastly, because of its prominent place within the digital advertising food chain and its AI initiatives, Meta's fundamentals are some of the best within the tech sector. Over the last 12 months, Meta generated: $170 billion in revenue $67 billion in net income $52 billion in free cash flow On top of those impressive metrics, in its most recently reported quarter, Meta bought back more than $13 billion of its own stock, reducing its overall share count and boosting the price of outstanding shares. To sum up, Meta's business model is firing on all cylinders and its stock boasts excellent fundamentals. Investors looking for a strong tech stock with fantastic prospects should strongly consider Meta. Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

However, “the amount of capital you’d need to replicate that in climate is enormous, so you might need to accept a revised model where you are picking fewer, more concentrated bets.”

Innovation Mental Health In The Tech Industry: A Leadership Mandate By Vivek Singh , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 02, 2025, 07:00am EDT Share Save Vivek Singh, Sr. Vice President of IT & Strategic Planning Palayekar Companies Inc . getty Mental health is no longer a luxury reserved for large corporations—it’s a strategic necessity for any company aiming to retain talent and build sustainable workplaces. As a young tech leader, I didn’t fully grasp the depth of this issue. But in February 2020, I had the privilege of attending a reception at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. The event was organized by the World Youth Group under the theme #IAmWithYou. At this gathering, I started to understand the necessity of bringing awareness to and finding solutions for the global rise in emotional and mental health issues. All business leaders must think more about how to design our modern work environments for human well-being. In the tech industry, we may be among the worst offenders. The Numbers Don’t Lie The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently reported that 76% of U.S. workers have experienced "at least one symptom of a mental health condition," and 84% believe their workplace conditions contributed to it. This issue impacts businesses: 81% said they’ll seek future employers that support mental well-being. Also, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety and depression alone cost the global economy over $1 trillion annually in lost productivity. Despite this, most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still lack structured wellness programs. One of the big challenges for the tech industry, in particular, is the role that physical exercise plays in mental health. The WHO recommends "at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week," a goal that often feels out of reach in sedentary office settings. The first step in addressing this issue for leaders in the tech industry is to recognize our teams in these statistics: long hours, screens everywhere and no real pause to move. A Wake-Up Call For The Tech Industry The #IAmWithYou gathering in 2020 planted the seed for what is now growing into a formal United Nations resolution: International Sports Week. The resolution proposes an annual observance from April 5 to April 9, encouraging governments to invest in sports, physical activity and recreational programs. All tech companies should take part in this week, but we must also think about how to incorporate physical activity into our offices year-round. It’s not rocket science: Physical activity improves how we feel, think and work . Think back to your childhood—the joy of playing outside, the energy, the freedom. That wasn’t just fun—it was emotional clarity, mental release and health in motion. Physical activity is more than fitness; it’s a catalyst for stress relief, connection and sharper thinking. Data from the HHS and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reinforce the same truth: Lower stress leads to higher focus, creativity and long-term performance. To solve this crisis, the tech industry must stop viewing wellness as an HR checkbox and start treating it as part of our infrastructure. To begin, draw inspiration not only from other companies but also—crucially—from non-tech models. For example, the WHO’s SME Wellness Guide offers several actionable tips on how to incorporate physical activity in the workplace. Likewise, college athletics programs can provide excellent examples for improving wellness and mental health in teams. Once you've got a solid plan, every tech leader should embrace these three mantras: • Mental health is a business imperative, not a benefit. • Physical activity is a strategic investment, not extracurricular. • Workplace design must evolve—from screen-bound to human-centered. The next generation of talent isn’t chasing beanbags or Ping-Pong tables. They’re seeking workplaces that genuinely care about their well-being. As leaders, we must lighten the load—not add to it. It’s time to stop treating wellness as an afterthought. Let’s embed it into the way we work, lead and live. Because when movement shapes our culture, we don’t just build better companies—we cultivate healthier, more resilient people.

Tech industry leaders call for fixed tax regime and investor-friendly reforms in FY26 budget The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) has urged the federal government to avoid introducing new taxes on the IT sector in the upcoming national budget. Scheduled for June 10, the budget is seen as critical for Pakistan’s growing tech industry, which currently supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. P@SHA Chairman Sajjad Mustafa Syed stated that out of the $700 million invested in the country’s IT industry, $600 million comes from companies affiliated with the association. He emphasized that consistent and business-friendly policies are essential for continued growth and international investor confidence. Syed called for a fixed tax regime for the next ten years, from 2025 to 2035, to be formally included in the upcoming FY26 budget. He also stressed the importance of maintaining the 0.25% withholding tax rate for PSEB-registered companies even beyond 2026, under this long-term system. Highlighting inequalities within the tax system, he pointed out that remote freelancers only pay a 1% tax, while full-time salaried IT workers may be taxed up to 35%. He urged the government to create fair and uniform tax policies for all employment categories within the sector. Moreover, Syed emphasized the need to simplify the process for transferring foreign earnings, noting that unclear financial rules could scare off potential investors. He warned that if reforms are not made quickly, around 600,000 jobs in Pakistan’s IT sector could be at serious risk. As the budget date approaches, P@SHA’s strong message adds pressure on policymakers to adopt reforms that protect jobs and help position Pakistan as a global technology hub.

On the last day of Web Summit Vancouver, Innovate BC president Peter Cowan announced a renewed $30 million commitment to the provincial Crown agency’s Integrated Marketplace program, designed to help de-risk the adoption of technology services from across BC. The initiative is being funded in collaboration with PacifiCan after a successful three-year pilot. Local entrepreneurs Jessica Yip and Scott Beatty joined Cowan at the announcement, alongside Diana Gibson, BC’s new minister of Jobs, Economic Development, and Innovation (JEDI). Gibson was named to the role in November 2024, taking over from Brenda Bailey. Now six months into her tenure, BetaKit caught up with Minister Gibson after the press conference to talk about upcoming policies, dismantling trade barriers, BC’s slipping venture numbers, and her thoughts on the first-ever Web Summit Vancouver. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. What feedback have you received from the tech ecosystem so far, and how is that shaping your mandate? The data shows our tech sector has been thriving. Its growth has outpaced inflation for the last ten years, and we have over 180,000 people working in that sector now. We’ve heard that the talent pool is rich here and that it is attracting investment and business. We’ve invested to deepen that talent pool and continue to work with our research universities and our tech sector to ensure that ecosystem support is there. We’ve also heard that the richness of the ecosystem, moving from early R&D through to big anchor companies, is starting to [take root]. The diversity of size and scale really puts you on a jumping-off point to grow to the next level. Is there a specific piece of innovation policy you are excited about? Today, the thing I’m most excited about is the Integrated Marketplace program. The program is showing incredible results. First, it delivers for the startup that’s given a reference customer and the opportunity to jump onto the national and world stage. Second, it helps the industry partner that’s looking to solve a problem—whether that’s a port, or an airport, or the health sector delivering in rural and remote communities. And it helps them be at the forefront of innovation, too. They can pick up early tech and innovation and be competitive. And it helps the government problem-solve. The 30 startups we’ve been supporting are showing incredible results. Your predecessor was thanked by CEO Paddy Cosgrave for her help in bringing Web Summit to Vancouver. What policies from her time as JEDI minister are you looking to continue? Minister Bailey leaves really big shoes to fill, and had such ambition. It’s a testament to her legacy that the tech sector is in such a strong and resilient place at this moment, where we are all facing such headwinds. We share a real passion for continuing to see our tech sector on the world stage, growing and thriving. She worked hard to bring Web Summit here, and it is really the moment for Web Summit to be here in Vancouver while we profile the incredible innovation in BC. We are looking to continue to ensure the framework is there with the investments we’ve had in talent and the new talent spaces we’ve invested in. [With the] Innovate BC and InBC Crown corporations that are working to support the ecosystem, whether that’s through investment, or whether that’s through IP mentorship. So, continuing to build out the supports around our tech sector so that it can thrive to continue to grow the legacy Minister Bailey left. Last year, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments offered a combined $14.8 million CAD to bring Web Summit to Vancouver. Has the event been worth the investment so far? Every penny. The relationships I’ve seen built already, the feedback we’ve heard is that the partnerships are here. The energy is here. It’s so important that we’re here in Vancouver showcasing the innovation. The over 12,000 companies here [across BC] that are able to be on the world stage and what our government is doing to be at the table is a real indicator of that priority. A recent CVCA report showed that BC fell behind Alberta in Q1 capital deployment. Is that alarming, and what can BC do to regain ground? We were ahead of the game on VC, and there may be others playing some catch-up there, but I’m not worried. BC continues to invest, to engage, and to partner. Our ecosystem is rich, and thriving, and resilient. We will continue to grow together. Programs like Integrated Marketplace, our Manufacturing Jobs Fund, and our new digital sector tax credit show that our government is at the table to work with our partners across the tech ecosystem to see them supported to thrive and grow. We’ve also seen a dearth of early-stage venture funding across the country. What policy steps are you taking to help venture funds and early-stage startups in BC? I think that’s part of what we are doing with our Integrated Marketplace and with InBC. We are working with InBC to work with our venture capital funds and angel investors to support that gap. We are doing a review of our innovate programs right now so we can identify specific gaps where we can better support the tech ecosystem. We will also be coming out with additional actions later. The new prime minister has committed to eliminating interprovincial trade barriers. Which areas of BC tech will benefit most, and which barriers are you fighting to eliminate? We know it can be challenging, particularly when we are facing headwinds, and our government is looking to ensure it is as easy as possible to do business here in BC. That is why I have an ease of doing business review in my ministry mandate and why we are looking to unlock interprovincial trade barriers and internal trade barriers to doing business.

Command Line AI Tech OpenAI wants ChatGPT to be a ‘super assistant’ for every part of your life An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” by Alex Heath May 30, 2025, 11:18 PM UTC Link Share If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Image: The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Thanks to the legal discovery process, Google’s antitrust trial with the Department of Justice has provided a fascinating glimpse into the future of ChatGPT. An internal OpenAI strategy document titled “ChatGPT: H1 2025 Strategy” describes the company’s aspiration to build an “AI super assistant that deeply understands you and is your interface to the internet.” Although the document is heavily redacted in parts, it reveals that OpenAI aims for ChatGPT to soon develop into much more than a chatbot. “In the first half of next year, we’ll start evolving ChatGPT into a super-assistant: one that knows you, understands what you care about, and helps with any task that a smart, trustworthy, emotionally intelligent person with a computer could do,” reads the document from late 2024. “The timing is right. Models like 02 and 03 are finally smart enough to reliably perform agentic tasks, tools like computer use can boost ChatGPT’s ability to take action, and interaction paradigms like multimodality and generative UI allow both ChatGPT and users to express themselves in the best way for the task.” The document goes on to describe a “super assistant” as “an intelligent entity with T-shaped skills” for both widely applicable and niche tasks. “The broad part is all about making life easier: answering a question, finding a home, contacting a lawyer, joining a gym, planning vacations, buying gifts, managing calendars, keeping track of todos, sending emails.” It mentions coding as an early example of a more niche task. Even when reading around the redactions, it’s clear that OpenAI sees hardware as essential to its future, and that it wants people to think of ChatGPT as not just a tool, but a companion. This tracks with Sam Altman recently saying that young people are using ChatGPT like a “ life advisor.” “Today, ChatGPT is in our lives through existing form factors — our website, phone, and desktop apps,” another part of the strategy document reads. “But our vision for ChatGPT is to help you with all of your life, no matter where you are. At home, it should help answer questions, play music, and suggest recipes. On the go, it should help you get to places, find the best restaurants, or catch up with friends. At work, it should help you take meeting notes, or prepare for the big presentation. And on solo walks, it should help you reflect and wind down.” At the same time, OpenAI finds itself in a wobbly position. Its infrastructure isn’t able to handle ChatGPT’s rising usage, which explains Altman’s focus on building data centers. In a section of the document describing AI chatbot competition, the company writes that “we are leading here, but we can’t rest,” and that “growth and revenue won’t line up forever.” It acknowledges that there are “powerful incumbents who will leverage their distribution to advantage their own products,” and states that OpenAI will advocate for regulation that requires other platforms to allow people to set ChatGPT as the default assistant. (Coincidentally, Apple is rumored to soon let iOS users also select Google’s Gemini for Siri queries. Meta AI just hit one billion users as well, thanks mostly to its many hooks in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.) “We have what we need to win: one of the fastest-growing products of all time, a category-defining brand, a research lead (reasoning, multimodal), a compute lead, a world-class research team, and an increasing number of effective people with agency who are motivated to ship,” the OpenAI document states. “We don’t rely on ads, giving us flexibility on what to build. Our culture values speed, bold moves, and self-disruption. Maintaining these advantages is hard work but, if we do, they will last for a while.” Elsewhere Apple chickens out: For the first time in a decade, Apple won’t have its execs participate in John Gruber’s annual post-WWDC live podcast . Gruber recently wrote the viral “something is rotten in the state of Cupertino” essay, which was widely discussed in Apple circles. Although he hasn’t publicly connected that critical piece to the company backing out of his podcast, it’s easy to see the throughline. It says a lot about the state of Apple when its leaders don’t even want to participate in what has historically been a friendly forum. Elon was high : As Elon Musk attempts to reframe the public’s view of him by doing interviews about SpaceX, The New York Times reports that last year, he was taking so much ketamine that it “was affecting his bladder.” He also reportedly “traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall.” Both Musk and the White House have had multiple opportunities to directly refute this report, and they have not. Now, Musk is at least partially stepping away from DOGE along with key lieutenants like Steve Davis. DOGE may be a failure based on Musk’s own stated hopes for spending cuts, but his closeness to Trump has certainly helped rescue X from financial ruin and grown SpaceX’s business. Now, the more difficult work begins: saving Tesla. Overheard “The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us.” - Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Decoder , explaining why the company’s search results won’t be changed for President Trump or anyone else. “Compared to previous technology changes, I’m a little bit more worried about the labor impact… Yes, people will adapt, but they may not adapt fast enough.” - Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on CNN raising the alarm about the technology he is developing. “Meta is a very different company than it was nine years ago when they fired me.” - Anduril founder Palmer Luckey telling Ashlee Vance why he is linking up with Mark Zuckerberg to make headsets for the military. Personnel log The flattening of Meta’s AI organization has taken effect, with VP Ahmad Al-Dahle no longer overseeing the entire group. Now, he co-leads “AGI Foundations” with Amir Frenkel , VP of engineering, while Connor Hayes runs all AI products. All three men now report to Meta CPO Chris Cox , who has diplomatically framed the changes as a way to “give each org more ownership.” Xbox co-founder J Allard is leading a new ‘breakthrough’ devices group at Amazon called ZeroOne. One of the devices will be smart home-related, according to job listings. C.J. Mahoney , a former Trump administration official, is being promoted to general counsel at Microsoft, which has also hired Lisa Monaco from the last Biden administration to lead global policy. Reed Hastings is joining the board of Anthropic “because I believe in their approach to AI development, and to help humanity progress.” (He’s joining Anthropic’s corporate board, not the supervising board of its public benefit trust that can hire and fire corporate directors.) Sebastian Barrios , previously SVP at Mercado Libre, is joining Roblox as SVP of engineering for several areas, including ads, game discovery, and the company’s virtual currency work. Fidji Simo’s replacement at Instacart will be chief business officer Chris Rogers , who will become the company’s next CEO on August 15th after she officially joins OpenAI.

News Technology Microsoft layoffs linked to AI restructuring, not performance: Satya Nadella explains Microsoft layoffs linked to AI restructuring, not performance: Satya Nadella explains Satya Nadella clarified that the recent layoffs affecting 6,000 employees were due to internal reorganisation driven by the company’s growing focus on AI, not performance issues. Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada addressed misconceptions around coding. Microsoft Image Source : Reuters Written By: Saumya Nigam @snigam04 Published: May 30, 2025 17:35 IST , Updated: May 30, 2025 17:35 IST New Delhi: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has clarified that the recent global layoffs affecting around 6,000 employees (3 per cent of the workforce) were due to restructuring efforts, not employee underperformance. During a company-wide town hall, Nadella said, “This was about reorganisation rather than performance,” pointing to Microsoft’s massive AI expansion and changing business priorities as the key drivers. The company has committed to spending USD 80 billion this fiscal year to build AI infrastructure and speed up the deployment of Copilot AI tools across services. Engineering and product development teams were among the most affected, reflecting how AI is reshaping even core technical roles. CPO: “Coding isn’t dead, it’s evolving” Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada countered growing concerns that AI is making coding skills obsolete. “I fundamentally disagree with the idea that coding is dead,” she said on a recent podcast. While acknowledging that AI now writes up to 30 per cent of internal Microsoft code, she emphasised this marks a shift, not the end of programming. She likened the change to how developers moved from assembly and C to higher-level languages. In the AI era, engineers may become “software operators”, managing and fine-tuning AI-generated code, rather than writing it from scratch. Project managers and coders: Roles will evolve In Washington State alone, 40 per cent of the eliminated roles were software engineers, and 30 per cent were project managers, according to Bloomberg. Despite these cuts, Chennapragada stressed that project managers will play a new role, helping teams navigate AI-generated ideas through editing and prioritisation, rather than being phased out. This restructuring highlights a major shift in the tech industry: AI won’t replace professionals, but it will redefine how they work.

2 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool May 28, 2025 5 min read CRTO HPE ^GSPC Key Points The tech sector has outperformed the broader market in recent years, but some proverbial Silicon Valley stocks remain undervalued. Criteo’s stock price is down, but its free cash flow has hit an all-time high. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a major force in high-performance computing, yet its stock remains cheap. 10 stocks we like better than Criteo › The tech sector has been a market-beating beast in recent years. Tech-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) have delivered annual returns of more than 21% over the last three years. Broad market trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) only gained 15.5% per year over the same period. Yes, that's a fantastic return from a historic perspective, but the tech sector offered even stronger gains. Image source: Getty Images. The technology boom has been driven by artificial intelligence (AI) news, starting with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Many leaders in the AI market have soared sky-high, adding fuel to the tech sector's market performance fires, but also making those market darlings a bit expensive. Fortunately, the market-moving forces left a few top-notch companies behind. I still see several tech stocks with a combination of bright business prospects and modest stock prices. Let's check out a couple of underappreciated bargain-bin tech stocks. This dynamic duo looks ready for a fresh bull run. 1. Criteo Digital advertising has been a troubled sector since the first signs of an inflation crisis in 2021. Paris-based commerce media specialist Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO) provides purchase-inspiring ad services to global brands. This focus placed the Parisian company in the epicenter of the inflation-based slowdown -- why invest in lavish marketing campaigns when consumers are pinching pennies and tightening belts? Criteo's revenues have indeed slumped since then, and so has the stock price. You know what's surging in recent quarters, though? That would be Criteo's free cash flows : CRTO Free Cash Flow data by YCharts The cash profits took a temporary dip, but came back stronger, with trailing cash flows reaching an all-time high in May's Q1 2025 report. But Criteo's stock price is down more than 30% in the last quarter, and the shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 11.3 times earnings and 6.6 times free cash flow. I'm not saying the digital ad market is roaring back to life in the spring of 2025. The political climate may result in another inflation spike, and advertisers are already reducing their ad-spot spending right now. Hence, Criteo's undervalued stock may see more volatility and weakness in the coming months. However, I think the market makers have underestimated Criteo's ability to turn cash profits in a soft market. Story continues The Criteo shares you buy at a discount in this downswing should return to more reasonable valuation ratios someday. At the same time, the company's robust cash generation makes it less vulnerable to short-term financial challenges. You can buy Criteo stock with confidence while it's cheap. This one is poised for great long-term returns, and patience is the greatest Wall Street virtue of them all. 2. Hewlett Packard Enterprise My next recommendation is more of a household name. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) has been around (in some form) since 1939. As the data center and cloud computing operator of the old HP business, HP Enterprise (aka HPE) plays a serious part in the AI boom. Indeed, seven out of the 10 most powerful supercomputers today were built by HP Enterprise. Only Chinese rival Lenovo has more systems in the top 500 than HP Enterprise, and nobody can match the total number-crunching performance of this company's ultra-powerful systems. Any company or organization that needs a top-performance system for their AI training and operations is likely to check out HP Enterprise's catalog first. So I'm talking about an AI powerhouse here. Yet, the stock price has dropped 16% lower year to date while smaller system builders Super Micro Computers (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Dell (NYSE: DELL) are up by 41% and down by just 1%, respectively. Trading at 8.9 times earnings and 14.3 times free cash flow, HP Enterprise looks downright cheap next to these challengers. HP Enterprise's stock could double or triple in price and still be affordable next to Supermicro or Dell. This could be a great value play on the hardware side of the AI boom. Should you invest $1,000 in Criteo right now? Before you buy stock in Criteo, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Criteo wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $653,389 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $830,492 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor ’s total average return is 982% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 171% for the S&P 500.

(Google, City of Mountain View) Middlefield Park, a residential neighborhood in Mountain View located on Ellis Street, East Middlefield Road, West Maude Avenue and Logue Avenue, concept. By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PDT | UPDATED: May 29, 2025 at 4:28 PM PDT MOUNTAIN VIEW — Google is pursuing the sale of 40 acres of its Mountain View properties for possible housing developments as the search giant seeks to operate more efficiently, the company confirmed. Spokesperson Ryan Lamont said the tech company is exploring the sale of its Middlefield Park site , a mixed-use neighborhood Google had secured approval for. “We continue to focus on investing in real estate efficiently to meet the needs of our hybrid workforce and business,” Lamont said. Google said it is considering potential buyers with the expertise and resources to build residential housing , according to Lamont. “A shift to housing at Middlefield Park would be a plus both for the region and for Google,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Campbell-based Creative Strategies, which tracks the tech industry. City officials have already approved 1,900 homes with 2.4 acres of land to be dedicated to the city of Mountain View for the development of up to 380 units of affordable housing. The development plan includes 50,000 square feet of active ground-floor uses such as shops, restaurants and community spaces. Middlefield Park also was expected to produce 1.3 million square feet of office space. Plans for the neighborhood envision the removal of 14 existing industrial, office and research buildings to clear the way for the new village. “Right-sizing is the correct way to look at this,” Bajarin said. “These sales have more to do with Google’s strategic direction. These Mountain View buildings in particular were important at the height of Silicon Valley’s tech boom. But right now these buildings are not as strategic for Google.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the roster of potential buyers for Middlefield Park consists of one company or multiple companies with residential development expertise. It also isn’t certain whether Google would sell all the sites to one buyer or multiple new owners. None of the Middlefield Park sales maneuvers signal a retreat by Google from its home territories. “We remain committed to our long-term presence in Mountain View,” Lamont said. Changing times are nothing new for companies like Google and others in Silicon Valley. “The tech industry is dynamic,” Bajarin said. “It ebbs and flows. The tech industry can carry out layoffs at the same time it’s hiring a lot of people.” The early months of 2025 produced a rough start for the industry in the Bay Area. Companies slashed a net total of 8,700 positions, according to a Beacon Economics estimate. Employers chopped 6,900 jobs in January and another 1,800 in February. “All bets are off for the whole tech industry,” said Russell Hancock, president of San Jose-based think tank Joint Venture Silicon Valley. “Google and other tech companies have become more cautious and incremental.” Following the COVID-19 pandemic, some businesses had to rethink how they would operate and expand. Google was no exception, according to Hancock. “Google is in business to change the world, create cutting-edge profits, make money,” Hancock said. “Google also had a more expansive view of their enterprise. They wanted to build communities, create neighborhoods, build housing and be a company that would integrate all of those things. “The pandemic changed everything. It threw a wrench into everything. It’s a different world on the other side of this. If you are running any company, you look at the world completely differently.” Now, for companies like Google, the rise of artificial intelligence is having an effect on present and future operations. “Artificial intelligence is real, investments are happening, AI profitability is there, and the tech’s efficiency kick is paying off,” Hancock said.

Article Content:
The tech sector has been a market-beating beast in recent years. Tech-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ 0.27% ) have delivered annual returns of more than 21% over the last three years. Broad market trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO +0.23% ) only gained 15.5% per year over the same period. Yes, that's a fantastic return from a historic perspective, but the tech sector offered even stronger gains. Image source: Getty Images. The technology boom has been driven by artificial intelligence (AI) news, starting with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Many leaders in the AI market have soared sky-high, adding fuel to the tech sector's market performance fires, but also making those market darlings a bit expensive. Fortunately, the market-moving forces left a few top-notch companies behind. I still see several tech stocks with a combination of bright business prospects and modest stock prices. Let's check out a couple of underappreciated bargain-bin tech stocks. This dynamic duo looks ready for a fresh bull run. Expand NASDAQ : CRTO Criteo Today's Change ( 1.40 %) $ 0.31 Current Price $ 22.51 Key Data Points Market Cap $1B Day's Range $ 22.22 - $ 22.78 52wk Range $ 19.50 - $ 47.27 Volume 405K Avg Vol 421K Gross Margin 53.81 % Dividend Yield N/A 1. Criteo Digital advertising has been a troubled sector since the first signs of an inflation crisis in 2021. Paris-based commerce media specialist Criteo ( CRTO +1.40% ) provides purchase-inspiring ad services to global brands. This focus placed the Parisian company in the epicenter of the inflation-based slowdown -- why invest in lavish marketing campaigns when consumers are pinching pennies and tightening belts? Criteo's revenues have indeed slumped since then, and so has the stock price. You know what's surging in recent quarters, though? That would be Criteo's free cash flows : CRTO Free Cash Flow data by YCharts The cash profits took a temporary dip, but came back stronger, with trailing cash flows reaching an all-time high in May's Q1 2025 report. But Criteo's stock price is down more than 30% in the last quarter, and the shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 11.3 times earnings and 6.6 times free cash flow. I'm not saying the digital ad market is roaring back to life in the spring of 2025. The political climate may result in another inflation spike, and advertisers are already reducing their ad-spot spending right now. Hence, Criteo's undervalued stock may see more volatility and weakness in the coming months. However, I think the market makers have underestimated Criteo's ability to turn cash profits in a soft market. The Criteo shares you buy at a discount in this downswing should return to more reasonable valuation ratios someday. At the same time, the company's robust cash generation makes it less vulnerable to short-term financial challenges. You can buy Criteo stock with confidence while it's cheap. This one is poised for great long-term returns, and patience is the greatest Wall Street virtue of them all . Expand NYSE : HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise Today's Change ( -4.15 %) $ -0.99 Current Price $ 22.89 Key Data Points Market Cap $32B Day's Range $ 22.77 - $ 23.75 52wk Range $ 11.96 - $ 26.44 Volume 29M Avg Vol 28M Gross Margin 28.65 % Dividend Yield 0.02 % 2. Hewlett Packard Enterprise My next recommendation is more of a household name. Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE 4.15% ) has been around (in some form) since 1939. As the data center and cloud computing operator of the old HP business, HP Enterprise (aka HPE) plays a serious part in the AI boom. Indeed, seven out of the 10 most powerful supercomputers today were built by HP Enterprise. Only Chinese rival Lenovo has more systems in the top 500 than HP Enterprise, and nobody can match the total number-crunching performance of this company's ultra-powerful systems. Any company or organization that needs a top-performance system for their AI training and operations is likely to check out HP Enterprise's catalog first. So I'm talking about an AI powerhouse here. Yet, the stock price has dropped 16% lower year to date while smaller system builders Super Micro Computers ( SMCI 3.46% ) and Dell ( DELL 2.75% ) are up by 41% and down by just 1%, respectively. Trading at 8.9 times earnings and 14.3 times free cash flow, HP Enterprise looks downright cheap next to these challengers. HP Enterprise's stock could double or triple in price and still be affordable next to Supermicro or Dell. This could be a great value play on the hardware side of the AI boom.

Ive, a key player in Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) design history, will now be directing design at OpenAI. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , in his latest weekly "Power On" shared that Apple’s stronghold in the tech industry is being challenged. The tech giant, which has been grappling to make significant progress in artificial intelligence, is seeing an exodus of talent, including high-ranking executives and engineers. This comes at a time when competitors like Google and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are making strides in generative AI. Jony Ive, Apple’s former designer who played a pivotal role in the design of the iPhone and other iconic products, has now joined the ranks of a competitor. OpenAI has acquired Ive’s io startup for a whopping $6.5 billion. Ive will now be in charge of design at OpenAI, which includes the development of new hardware devices. While Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9 will showcase redesigned versions of Apple’s operating systems, no major AI breakthroughs are anticipated. The OpenAI deal is a wake-up call for Apple, which seems to be stuck in a legacy world. Also Read: Apple’s 2027 Vision: Foldable iPhones, Smart Glasses, And AI Innovations Despite these hurdles, Apple’s iOS ecosystem continues to be the most cohesive in the tech world. However, the tech landscape is evolving, and AI is fast becoming as fundamental as the multitouch display was two decades ago. Apple’s past triumphs don’t assure its future, and the company is evidently struggling to adapt. Apple is developing smart glasses for next year, but this device will be an add-on to the iPhone, not a substitute. The pressure is mounting for Apple to pioneer the next computing era, which entails revitalizing the Apple Intelligence platform, launching innovative new hardware, and creating the next iPhone before its competitors. The acquisition of Ive’s startup by OpenAI signals a significant shift in the tech industry. With Apple’s key talent moving to competitors and the company’s struggle to make substantial progress in AI, its dominance is under threat. The tech landscape is evolving rapidly, and companies that fail to adapt risk being left behind. This development underscores the importance of AI in shaping the future of the tech industry.

Billionaire fund manager, skeptical of AI, backs shocking stock Samuel O'Brient May 24, 2025 4 min read AMD NVDA A highly controversial figure in some circles, Ken Griffin remains one of Wall Street’s most prominent and respected hedge fund managers. Since founding Miami-based hedge fund Citadel Securities in 1990, Griffin has amassed a net worth of more than $44 billion. This makes him one of the highest-earning people in his field, second only to Israel Englander of Millennium Management. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵 While Citadel’s aggressive trading strategy has garnered criticism over the years, the fund’s success is undeniable, as evidenced by the fact that it reported its largest trading revenue haul to date in March 2025, with 55% gains for the year. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has minted a new generation of market winners over the past several years, some financiers have embraced this new technology. Griffin has taken a different approach and expressed some skepticism. But some recent filings reveal he sees potential in one AI stock. Hedge fund Citadel, led by billionaire Ken Griffin, made some surprising moves during Q1.Image source: Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Ken Griffin recently doubled down on one AI stock, trimmed his bet on a close rival Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, many companies have focused on tapping into this booming market, from established tech-sector leaders to new, cutting-edge startups. Through it all, both retail and institutional investors have been working hard to identify the next winners before they surge. Related: Billionaire fund manager unloads over $100 million of Tesla stock For many, that meant trying to find the next Nvidia ( NVDA ) . Often considered the industry’s most prominent chipmaker, the tech-sector giant has become synonymous with the AI boom, as its shares surged to new heights and analysts heaped praise on the stock. Despite its track record, Griffin isn’t so bullish on Nvidia’s growth prospects. During the first quarter of 2025, Citadel slashed its NVDA stock position roughly in half, selling 1,555,264 shares. Data shows that this puts it among the fund’s top sells by change in portfolio percentage. Griffin hasn’t embraced AI as much as some of his peers, maintaining a skeptical outlook toward the technology’s overall impact. “Do we use it in our investment business? A little bit, a little bit. I can’t say it’s been game-changing,” he recently stated . “It saves some time. It’s a productivity enhancement tool. It’s nice [but] I don’t think it’s going to revolutionize most of what we do in finance.” He added that generative AI models are limited as investment analysis tools, since they are still unable to produce long-term forecasts. While Citadel trimmed its stake in Nvidia in Q1, it doubled down on one of the chipmaker’s biggest rivals. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) also produces graphics processing units (GPUs) that help companies build and scale large language models (LLMs). Story Continues More Hedge Fund News: Fund manager has shocking Elon Musk and Tesla prediction Veteran fund manager sends surprising message on the weak dollar Billionaire fund manager makes $40 million bet on Dollar Tree While it’s often overshadowed by Nvidia, AMD stock seems to be a favorite of Griffin. Citadel increased its stake in the chipmaker by more than 300%, adding 2,786,115 shares to its position during Q1, a current market value of roughly $326 million. Why does Griffin favor one AI stock over the other? As close rivals, Nvidia and AMD are often compared, despite the fact that Nvidia has consistently outperformed its smaller-cap peer. Wall Street is quite bullish on the two stocks, which maintain 34 and 22 buy ratings, respectively, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus for both. Related: One AI stock makes up 78% of Nvidia's investment portfolio However, when someone like Ken Griffin bets big on one stock while trimming his position in the other, investors are likely to listen. The answer may lie in the zero-sum nature of financial markets, as multiple analysts have illustrated. Jay Goldberg of Seaport Research Partners recently highlighted several potential concerns regarding NVDA stock, including questions from customers regarding the utility of Nvidia’s technology and the “complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems.” He added that many customers are taking steps to design their own chips in-house, in a clear attempt to decrease their reliance on Nvidia’s overpriced GPUs. Meanwhile, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri recently issued a bullish take on AMD, speculating that it could benefit from Nvidia’s problems. “The story in our eyes still hinges on the new family of AI solutions coming next year, but customer traction among US hyperscalers is gaining momentum, and AMD may be able to draft off of NVDA’s ‘growing pains’ in ramping these new system solutions this year,” he stated.

Innovation AI Agents And Trade Policies: The Biggest Impacts On Tech Today By Andreas Bubenzer-Paim , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) May 23, 2025, 09:45am EDT Share Save Andreas Bubenzer-Paim is Head of Technology Banking at BMO . Overseeing the delivery of financial services to U.S. technology companies. getty Whether it’s shifting consumer demand, politics, the economy or social trends, the tech sector is influenced by what’s going on in the world. Right now, however, no issues are having a more immediate impact than the rapid progression of artificial intelligence and recent trade policies. Artificial Intelligence: Even Bigger Than We Think AI has advanced beyond the introductory stage to the implementation period. AI hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google and Meta are set to spend over $320 billion in 2025 on AI-related technologies and infrastructure, up 40% from 2024. Every sector appears to be pushing forward with AI adoption. Retailers use AI for inventory optimization; banks use it for fraud prevention; industrial companies use it to create predictive maintenance tools; and healthcare firms deploy AI for drug discovery and diagnostics. Generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have disrupted the tech sector, and Chinese startup DeepSeek has further shaken things up. In January, the company’s latest model, DeepSeek R1, claimed to outperform the latest OpenAI model at a fraction of the cost . Fears over DeepSeek’s potential disruptive impact caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet—including erasing close to $600 billion from AI chipmaker Nvidia’s market capitalization. Several countries have banned DeepSeek , deeming it a "national security risk." Several U.S. states have also banned the app from government devices, and the Trump administration is reportedly weighing a nationwide ban on government devices, citing concerns over DeepSeek’s handling of user data. While AI has dominated conversations about the future of business, it’s clear we still haven’t fully grasped how quickly things are moving or the true potential impact of this technology. The most immediate impact comes from agentic AI, which can perform multistep tasks with little human intervention. Over the next five to 10 years, AI will likely evolve from AI assistants completing single tasks to AI agents independently perceiving, evaluating and solving more complex tasks—ultimately performing entire job functions. According to market intelligence firm IDC , "generative and agentic AI will completely transform the way enterprise applications are designed, delivered, and engaged with by users." Some financial institutions have made generative AI assistants available to their employees with an eye toward agentic AI, while others are exploring using AI for credit reviews. What would have taken portfolio analysts several days to complete can now be accomplished in a matter of hours. This isn’t something we expect to happen in the next few years; it’s happening now. These AI tools will help reduce turnaround times, costs and new product development cycles, and the speed of innovation will further accelerate in the medium to long term. Tariff And Trade Impacts The Trump administration’s tariffs on a wide range of goods from the U.S.’s biggest trading partners—and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by some of those countries—are creating uncertainty across all industries, and the tech sector is no exception. Technology relies heavily on global supply chains, which makes it particularly susceptible to trade policy disruptions. The current tariff environment mostly affects the hardware side of the industry—semiconductors, communications equipment and the like—in the following ways: Supply Chain Disruption The tech sector relies heavily on integrated global supply chains. New trade policies may compel companies to reassess and restructure these networks, causing operational delays and increased costs. Many of these supply chain setups were already tested and improved on during the U.S.-China trade war that began in 2018 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, many companies have diversified their manufacturing and/or supplier base globally, in some cases reshoring portions back to the U.S. They’ve also become more flexible in product design to adjust to component shortages. In some cases, companies can execute tariff-driven reshoring fairly quickly; in others—like the highly complex semiconductor supply chain—the process could take several years. Increased Production Costs Tariffs on essential components, such as semiconductors, are expected to raise manufacturing expenses for tech companies, potentially leading to higher consumer prices. Investment Uncertainty The unpredictability introduced by fluctuating trade policies can deter investment within the technology sector, as businesses may hesitate to commit resources amid an unstable trade environment. Conclusion In the face of these potential shocks, tech companies may consider going back to pandemic-era strategies like diversifying their supplier base or reshoring manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. Apple, for example, recently announced a $500 billion investment in U.S. facilities over the next four years, which could help it avoid tariffs on goods imported from China. But reshoring is not a short-term fix. It’s a process that will take years before companies—and the U.S. economy—see any benefits. In the meantime, companies can focus on short-term solutions by answering the following: • Do you already have a diversified supplier base to mitigate potential tariff-related impacts? If not, start exploring and talking to potential additional suppliers (in a different geography than your current suppliers). • Can you pass on part or all of the cost from tariffs to your customers? Review your existing contracts and try to renegotiate where appropriate and possible. • Can you replace imported components with ones manufactured in the U.S.? Have your product team explore alternatives to some of the harder-to-get components. The bottom line is that the time to act is now.

Apple, Samsung, and Google are three of the most prominent forces shaping the global technology landscape. While they are often seen as fierce competitors, their relationships extend beyond rivalry into a complex web of interdependence. Each company brings unique strengths to the table, creating a dynamic where competition and collaboration coexist. This intricate balance is a cornerstone of the tech industry, driving innovation and ensuring sustained growth in a rapidly evolving market. The video below from Marques Brownlee gives us a detailed look at why these three tech companies need each other. Watch this video on YouTube . Apple and Samsung: A Complex Partnership Apple and Samsung are well-known adversaries in the smartphone market, yet their relationship is far more nuanced than simple competition. Samsung serves as a critical supplier for Apple, providing OLED displays that are integral to the performance and visual appeal of Apple’s flagship iPhones. This collaboration is mutually beneficial: Samsung earns substantial revenue from supplying these components, while Apple gains access to some of the most advanced display technology available, making sure its devices remain at the forefront of innovation. Despite this collaboration, challenges loom on the horizon. Apple is actively investing in microLED display technology , a move that could reduce its reliance on Samsung. This strategy aligns with Apple’s broader efforts to control its supply chain, as seen in its transition from Intel processors to its proprietary M-series chips. If Apple successfully adopts microLED displays, it could significantly alter its relationship with Samsung, potentially diminishing Samsung’s role in Apple’s product development. Such a shift would not only impact the two companies but could also ripple across the broader tech supply chain. Apple and Google: A Profitable but Controversial Alliance The partnership between Apple and Google is one of the most lucrative in the tech industry, yet it is not without controversy. Google reportedly pays Apple around $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on Safari, using the iPhone’s vast user base to maintain its dominance in mobile search. For Apple, this arrangement provides a steady and substantial revenue stream, while Google secures a critical foothold in the competitive search market. However, this alliance has drawn scrutiny from regulators. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether this agreement violates antitrust laws, raising questions about its future viability. If the courts rule against the partnership, Apple could face several pivotal decisions. It might continue the relationship under stricter regulations, switch to a competing search engine, or even develop its own search platform. Each of these scenarios carries significant implications, not only for Apple and Google but also for the broader tech ecosystem. A disruption in this partnership could reshape how users interact with search technologies on Apple devices, potentially altering the competitive dynamics of the search industry. Google and Samsung: Building an Ecosystem Together The relationship between Google and Samsung underscores the importance of collaboration in the tech industry. Samsung relies on Google’s Android operating system to power its smartphones, while Google benefits from Samsung’s dominant position in the global Android market. This symbiotic relationship ensures that both companies maintain their leadership in the highly competitive smartphone industry. Beyond software, their partnership extends into strategic financial agreements and product integration. Google often debuts new Android features on Samsung devices, showcasing their close alignment. Additionally, Google pays Samsung to pre-install its services, such as the Gemini AI platform , on Samsung smartphones. These arrangements not only strengthen Google’s ecosystem but also reinforce Samsung’s position as a leading Android manufacturer. By working together, the two companies ensure that Android remains a dominant force in the global smartphone market, benefiting both their businesses and the broader Android ecosystem. The Interplay of Competition and Collaboration The relationships between Apple, Samsung, and Google highlight the intricate dynamics of the tech industry, where competition and collaboration are deeply intertwined. These companies rely on one another to sustain innovation, meet consumer demands, and maintain their positions as industry leaders. While challenges such as regulatory scrutiny and technological shifts may disrupt these partnerships, they also underscore the necessity of cooperation in navigating an increasingly interconnected market. Understanding these dynamics offers valuable insight into how the tech industry operates. The interplay of rivalry and mutual dependence among these giants not only drives technological advancements but also shapes the future of the global technology landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, the balance between competition and collaboration will remain a defining feature of its growth and innovation.

Mehr Bajaj, Mehak Sidhu Mehr Bajaj , Mehak Sidhu Published on : 10 Jun 2025, 8:29 am 6 min read Copied Follow Us "Let’s name it ‘Lyft’- like ‘Lift’, but cooler." That, one imagines, was the kind of offbeat eureka that launched one of the world’s most recognisable ride-sharing brands. “Lyft” is now a textbook case of how a subtle deviation in spelling can infuse a brand with distinctiveness, visual appeal, and, crucially, a better shot at trade mark protection. But what happens when this deliberate distortion treads into legally ambiguous territory - descriptive, deceptive, or even distasteful? Lyft As intellectual property practitioners, we frequently navigate this odd and often treacherous corridor where branding creativity meets statutory scrutiny. This article unpacks the curious legal journey of misspelt trade marks in India: when they work, where they falter, and how brands can wield them strategically without stumbling into pitfalls. Why Misspellings Matter: Distinction in a Crowded Market In a saturated consumer economy, misspellings have evolved into deliberate branding tools. From “Krispy Kreme” and “BLVCK Paris” to “Nykd”, these deviations help brands stand out, secure domain names, and appeal to digital-savvy audiences. However, what works in marketing doesn’t always pass muster in the legal theatre of trade mark law, especially in India, where statutory and judicial interpretations lean toward consumer clarity over creative flair. Registrability: A Thin Line between Clever and Common Under Section 9 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, marks that are descriptive or lack distinctiveness are barred from registration. Many misspelt marks originate from generic terms. So the test lies in whether a creative spelling sufficiently departs from the descriptive term, or does it merely disguise it? For instance, “SHOEZZ” for footwear remains phonetically identical to “Shoes." Unless secondary meaning is shown through use, it likely faces rejection. The courts have echoed this sentiment in PhonePe Pvt. Ltd. v. Ezy Services & Anr. CS (COMM) No. 292 of 2019 , the Delhi High Court held that the suffix “Pe” (a stylised “Pay”) was descriptive in the fintech context. PhonePe’s creative spelling didn’t qualify for protection. The Court noted that phonetic similarity to generic terms isn’t shielded by orthographic invention. PhonePe and BharatPe with Delhi High Court By contrast, in ITC Ltd. v. Nestle India Ltd, 2013 (53) PTC 493 (Del) , the Court allowed registration of “Kwality Walls”, holding that secondary meaning through extensive use could overcome descriptiveness. Similarly, Delhivery Pvt. Ltd. v. Treasure Vase Ventures Pvt. Ltd ., 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2634 upheld protection of “DEL H IVERY” for having acquired distinctiveness despite its phonetic similarity to “delivery”. Kwality Walls and Delhivery The Relative Risk of Phonetic Proximity Section 11 bars registration of deceptively similar marks. Courts adopt a consumer-centric approach, factoring in imperfect recollection and overall commercial impression. In Starbucks Corp. v. Sardarbuksh Coffee & Co. CS (COMM) 1007/2018 , the Delhi High Court ruled that the humorous twist in “Sardarbuksh” didn’t shield it from being confusingly similar to “Starbucks”. Creativity does not excuse consumer confusion. Sardar-Ji-Bakhsh Coffee & Co, renamed after the dispute The Naughty Corner: When Misspelling Masks Vulgarity Occasionally, brands flirt with misspellings that edge into moral or cultural sensitivities. The FCUK Phenomenon: French Connection UK’s brand name, designed to shock, resembled a swear word. It stirred regulatory heat globally and faced objections on moral grounds. French Connection United Kingdom In India, Section 9(2)(c) prohibits registration of marks that are obscene or scandalous or hurt religious susceptibilities. Indian authorities have refused registration to stylised variants resembling profanity, even where spelt innocently. For instance, an Indian apparel applicant (Class 25, App. No. 5474905) faced refusal for a mark resembling offensive language, despite the stylised misspelling. Cybersquatting and Digital Deception Misspelt trade marks offer several commercial benefits. They may help evade existing trade marks, secure easier domain name registration, and resonate with younger audiences attuned to text-speak and internet slang. Brands like Zypp Electric (from "Zip") or Froot Loops are examples of this trend. But such marks are prime cybersquatting targets. In Yahoo Inc. v. Akash Arora , 1999 PTC (19) 201 (Del) , the Court found that minor domain name changes still caused confusion and granted relief. Spelling differences are not a defence if public confusion arises. Yahoo Modern Branding vs. Consumer Psychology Recent behavioural research adds another layer. A 2023 study in the Journal of Marketing found that consumers often perceive misspelt names as gimmicky. Consumers showed: - 13.6% preference for “Clear” over “Klear”; - 33.6% higher purchase intent for “Fresh” over “Phresh”; - Decreased trust unless the misspelling was contextually justified. Unusual spellings must align with brand values or purpose; otherwise, they risk undermining credibility. Per the study, unusual spellings are often seen as marketing tactics to appear trendy, which can come across as disingenuous and lead to negative reactions and reduced purchase intent. Typo Tricks: When Misspelling Works Having said that, when done strategically, misspellings can produce strong marks: - Tumblr : Suggestive, tech-savvy, and distinctive. - Flickr : phonetically intuitive but not descriptive. - Google : a twist on “googol”, with no prior meaning. These examples succeed because their distinctiveness is not superficial; it's conceptual and rooted in function as source identifiers. The regulators often note that misspellings only work when they are striking, surprising, or demand mental effort, such as D’LICIOUS instead of “Delicious”. Google BVLGARI: A case study in strategic misspelling BVLGARI, the Italian luxury brand, offers a compelling example of how a deliberate misspelling/ stylised spelling can transform a brand name into a distinctive and legally protected trade mark. It stylises its name with a “V” in place of “U” (Latin orthography) to reflect its Roman roots. This historical styling enhances its uniqueness and global appeal. BVLGARI BVLGARI holds registrations for both “BVLGARI” and “BULGARI”, covering a wide array of goods and services. The brand also registers design elements like SERPENTI, B.ZERO1, and its Hindi transliteration बुल्गरी, showing a comprehensive strategy. Key Takeaways for Brand Owners As a trade mark counsel, we often advise clients that creative spelling is not a legal silver bullet, and the below checklist for navigating this space should be kept handy: 1. Avoid mere phonetic alterations of descriptive terms. If “Bright Kleen” is just “Bright Clean”, it's still descriptive. 2. Secure both original and creative variants for protection and use. 3. Don’t assume humour or edginess equals registrability. Be especially cautious of marks that may offend public decency or cultural sensitivities. 4. Aim for suggestive or fanciful constructions. If it makes people think (rather than just describe), you’re in safer territory. 5. Secure evidence of acquired distinctiveness if the mark has been in long-standing use. 6. Always conduct a thorough availability search, because a clever misspelling may already be taken. The Strategic Sword: Brand Play or Legal Gamble? Consequently, misspelling is not a free pass to registrability or enforceability. The Indian courts consistently hold that distinctiveness must be substantive and not merely orthographic. Enforcement, too, is complicated. Under Section 29, infringement includes unauthorised use of similar marks. But proving deceptive similarity is harder with altered spellings. Courts assess phonetics, structure, trade channels, and consumer impression. In passing off, brands must prove misrepresentation and the likelihood of confusion. With online visibility dominating, the burden of proving bad faith grows heavier. Defendants may claim creativity or coincidence, further muddying enforcement waters. Conclusion: Spellbound, Not Spelt Right Misspelling, when done right, is both art and strategy. It can unlock registrability, attract attention, and convey uniqueness. Whether you’re launching a new start-up or rebranding an existing product, remember: distinctiveness, not just different spelling, is what the law values. So, go ahead, bend the dictionary if you must. But don’t forget to ask your trade mark attorney before you try to “Kreate Kool Kleaning Koncepts” for your business. Because in the world of trade marks, a clever twist today can become a litigation tangle tomorrow. In the grander scheme, the judiciary has been consistent: creativity is welcome, but consumer clarity is paramount.

The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state’s growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal. The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim’s board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee. FILE - A man walks past a storefront inside Mall of the Emirates in in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Thursday, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair, File) In 2022, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim’s founder — also named Majid Al Futtaim — following his death in 2021. Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies. The changes “reflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,” the company said in a statement. “These changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.” Dubai’s government did not respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim’s parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.

Succession battles aren’t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development. But over the years, that economic strategy has caused headaches for authorities, who have intervened when patriarchs die and tensions between disgruntled relatives boil over. Majid Al Futtaim is a mainstay of the local consumer economy. It’s also a giant in the broader Gulf Arab region, owning and operating prominent hotels, entertainment venues and shopping malls. Its portfolio includes the Mall of the Emirates, a major tourist draw in Dubai that houses the Middle East’s first-ever indoor ski slope. It also runs regional franchises for global brands, including Lego. Majid Al Futtaim’s revenues last year topped $9 billion. As crown prince in the 1990s, Sheikh Mohammed mediated a succession dispute between Al Futtaim, the founder, and a cousin. Al Futtaim used the funds from that settlement to start his namesake company.

Title: Down 48 % From Its Peak , Is This Market - Crushing Growth Stock a Buy Now ?

Lululemon athletica ( LULU 0.43% ) might not have the profile of a traditional market-crushing stock, but it's been one of the best-performing consumer-facing stocks of the last 20 years. More than any other company, Lululemon is responsible for making athleisure a massive apparel category, and it's made it one of the most valuable apparel companies in the world. Going back to its 2006 IPO, the stock is up roughly 1,800%, and even over the last decade, the stock has gained more than 300% as it's continued to deliver strong growth. However, more recently the stock has struggled. After peaking in late 2023, shares have fallen on concerns about its valuation, slowing growth, and now the trade war and the broader threat to the global economy. The stock is now down 48% from its peak. Lululemon tumbled in its first-quarter earnings report as comparable sales growth slowed to just 1% with comps down 2% in the Americas. Revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $2.37 billion as the company continues to open new stores, which matched estimates. Further down the income statement, gross margin improved from 57.7% to 58.3%, but operating income rose just 1% to $438.6 million as operating margin fell 110 basis points to 18.5% due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. On the bottom line, earnings per share increased from $2.54 to $2.60, which edged out the consensus of $2.59. Image source: Getty Images. What's ailing Lululemon What really pressured the stock was the company's guidance, due in part to the impact of tariffs as management said price hikes to absorb tariffs would be targeted and limited. For the full year, Lululemon maintained revenue guidance of $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion, or 6% revenue growth at the midpoint. However, it cut its full-year earnings-per-share guidance from $14.95-$15.15 to $14.58-$14.78. Second-quarter guidance also missed the mark. Lululemon's decision to maintain revenue guidance with a growth rate that's steady from the first quarter shows that it doesn't anticipate a significant impact on demand. Rather, the challenges the company is facing are on the cost side, primarily due to tariffs. The company now expects operating margin to fall 160 basis points, weighing on earnings per share. The China opportunity While Lululemon's growth has slowed in its core North American market, the company continues to see a long runway in China, which represents its biggest market for new store growth. In the first quarter, revenue in China increased 21% on 7% comparable sales growth, and China made up 13% of total revenue last year. Like other American consumer brands that have done well in China like Apple , Starbucks , and Nike , Lululemon seems to be benefiting from the same upscale brand reputation that those companies have as well as a culture of conspicuous consumption. Additionally, Lululemon has managed to deliver solid growth in China even as the consumer economy has been weak there. The retailer currently has 154 stores in China, 20% of its total, and it had an initial goal of opening 200 stores, though it now expects to top that. CFO Meghan Frank said, "We still feel we're early in our journey" in China on the earnings call. Expand NASDAQ : LULU Lululemon Athletica Inc. Today's Change ( -0.43 %) $ -0.74 Current Price $ 169.61 Key Data Points Market Cap $20B Day's Range $ 168.92 - $ 172.19 52wk Range $ 159.25 - $ 423.32 Volume 102K Avg Vol 5.2M Gross Margin 59.04 % Dividend Yield N/A Is Lululemon a buy? Lululemon's challenges with tariffs seem to be similar to what we've heard from other retailers in apparel and related sectors, so it shouldn't be a cause for alarm from investors. Meanwhile, the tariff situation is fluid enough that rates could easily change, and it's unclear if the tariffs will still be relevant a few years from now. After cutting its guidance for the year and Friday's sell-off, Lululemon now trades at a forward P/E of 18. For a company with its brand strength, historical growth rate, and a runway to expand in China, that looks like a great price. While investors may have to be patient as the trade war plays out, at the current price, Lululemon looks like a clear buy.

ICE officers faced chaotic scuffles on June 6 from elite-backed activists in New York City’s major courthouse as they picked up migrants for deportation. The opposition to law enforcement is just one part of the elite-backed massive resistance to President Donald Trump’s popular policy of enforcing Congress’s immigration laws. The opposition seeks to minimize deportations by harassing ICE officials and by portraying peaceful, orderly arrests as frightful “ chaos .” There was no chaos when the left-wing activists were absent, allowing ICE deputies to calmly escort illegal migrants out of the building: ICE officials are increasingly arresting migrants at their scheduled court hearings, partly because it minimizes manpower and coordination demands, and also maximizes safety amid the risk of violence from street protests or dangerous migrants. Trump’s enforcement policy is already paying big dividends to the many ordinary Americans who are seeing their wages rise, their housing prices decline , and their local crime rates drop . But the activist groups are so influential in the Democratic Party that top party leaders are joining their courthouse resistance. MSN.com reported on June 5 that the pro-migration City Comptroller , Brad Lander, joined the actions: “The last few weeks have been terrifying for New York City’s immigrant communities, for the city itself, this place that has been the greatest immigrant city the world has ever known with an immigrant tradition going back 400 years, and really for the rule of law itself,” Lander said on June 5. Lander, who is running for mayor [against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams] attended hearings Thursday morning as part of the “Friend of the Court” program—an initiative by immigration coalition Immigrant ARC that designates individuals who can observe proceedings and assist respondents in navigating their immigration processes. He encouraged other New Yorkers to participate in hearings as Friends of the Court in “solidarity” with immigrants undergoing proceedings. “I’ve felt more useful for the last hour than I have felt almost any time since Donald Trump was elected,” Lander said. Immigrant ARC is an elite-led pro-migration group in New York City. For example, the group’s treasurer is Omar Beer , a Harvard graduate and a top manager at Goldman Sachs. Another ARC board member is Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition . That group got one-third of its 2023 budget from foundations or corporations, and its board includes Eddie Taveras , who works for FWD.us, a lobbying group for wealthy West Coast investors in the consumer economy. The FWD.us lobby group’s members gain wealth on the stock market when the government extracts more renters, consumers, and workers from poor countries. Other progressive groups are organizing chaotic resistance to deportations in Nashville, Chicago, and Boston, mimicking some of the elite-backed Black Lives Matter movement that wrecked many communities in 2020.

Stocks Get Another Upgrade on Wall Street as Tariff Fears Fade Colin Laidley June 4, 2025 2 min read ^GSPC ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images Barclays on Wednesday became the latest Wall Street firm to raise its year-end S&P 500 target. Another Wall Street firm turned more bullish on the stock market on Wednesday, as analysts came around to the possibility the worst of this year's tariff shock is in the rearview mirror. "Peak tariff uncertainty is likely passed, which should allow modest valuation expansion from here," wrote Barclays analysts, who raised their year-end S&P 500 forecast to 6,050 from 5,900 on Wednesday. Several other firms have raised their targets for the index in recent weeks, citing easing global trade tensions, continued resilience of the U.S. economy, and the stimulative potential of the tax and spending bill working its way through Congress. Deutsche Bank on Tuesday raised its year-end forecast to 6,550, and UBS last week lifted its target to 6,000. The stock market's outlook may have improved in the last month, but it remains drearier than at the start of the year, when investors were optimistic about President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth, business-friendly agenda. Only two Wall Street firms tracked by CNBC 's Market Strategist Survey have not lowered their expectations for the S&P 500 this year. Barclays analysts left their forecast for S&P 500 full-year earnings per share unchanged at $262, down from $271 at the start of the year. Many of President Trump's tariffs have been delayed or diluted, but those that remain are expected to directly subtract nearly $10 from the index's EPS. Slower international growth and diminished consumer spending are expected to detract an additional $1 and $2.10, respectively. Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and tariff-induced inflation are forecast to offset some of those headwinds. Barclays expects corporate earnings growth to normalize in 2026, when—assuming tariff rates remain unchanged—the direct drag from duties will get lost in year-over-year comparisons. Tariffs are still expected to weigh on consumer spending and slow global growth, but those headwinds should be more than offset by AI-driven growth. The firm expects the S&P 500 to end 2026 around 6,700, about 12% above Tuesday's close. Read the original article on Investopedia View comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info

Japan’s April household spending unexpectedly falls Summarise Share Consumer spending fell 0.1 per cent in April from a year earlier, data from the internal affairs ministry showed on Friday. That was worse than the median market forecast for 1.4 per cent growth and March’s 2.1 per cent increase. PHOTO: AFP Published Fri, Jun 6, 2025 · 08:52 AM — Updated Fri, Jun 6, 2025 · 09:42 AM [TOKYO] Japanese household spending unexpectedly fell in April, as consumers tightened their purse strings in the face of higher prices. Consumer spending fell 0.1 per cent in April from a year earlier, data from the internal affairs ministry showed on Friday. That was worse than the median market forecast for 1.4 per cent growth and March’s 2.1 per cent increase. On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending declined 1.8 per cent, versus an estimated 0.8 per cent fall. Consumption and wage trends are among key factors the Bank of Japan is watching to gauge economic strength and decide how soon to raise interest rates.“Consumer spending appears not to be on track for recovery still,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. Consumption and wage trends are among key factors the Bank of Japan is watching to gauge economic strength and decide how soon to raise interest rates. Hefty pay hikes are seen as essential to counter sharp increases in the cost of living. Major Japanese firms on average agreed to more than 5 per cent pay hikes during annual spring wage talks in March. The monthly wage data released on Thursday showed real wages fell for a fourth consecutive month, eroded by stubborn inflation that has continued to outpace pay hikes, even though base salaries rose at the fastest pace in four months. “It is positive that wages are rising, but prices are eating into those gains, and in April, the negative impact was still stronger,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute. On prices, Takeda said inflation probably peaked out in April as the yen gained strength and crude oil prices dropped.

Article Content:
Many were stunned after the latest inflation and core PCE data confirmed that the experts were once again dead wrong, and instead of the widely expected inflation tsunami, Trump's tariffs have so far sparked only continued disinflation (which will only become more acute as home prices slide). And yet, anyone who read our Beige Book analysis from last month (not to mention our prediction from last June that " The Experts Are All Wrong About Inflation Under A Trump Presidency ") would have known just that: as we laid out, " Beige Book Finds Inflation Mentions Tumble To 3 Year Low " which was the clearest indication that despite the prevailing narrative, rising prices is simply not a thing businesses across the US are worried about. Fast forward to today when the latest, May, Beige Book was released, and it revealed that according to reports across the 12 Fed district, "economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report" with half of the districts reporting slight to moderate declines in activity, three Districts reported no change, and three Districts reported slight growth . And here an interesting divergence appears, because the Beige Book appears to reveal another party-line split. Here are the districts that reported declines in activity: New York Boston Philadelphia San Francisco Minneapolis Kansas City And the districts that reported flat/slowing activity: Cleveland Dallas Richmond Atlanta Chicago St Louis In any case, the Beige Book said that all Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions. Manufacturing activity also declined slightly, while consumer spending reports were mixed, with most Districts reporting slight declines or no change; however, some Districts reported increases in spending on items expected to be affected by tariffs. Elsewhere, residential real estate sales were little changed, and most district reports on new home construction indicate flat or slowing construction activity. Reports on bank loan demand and capital spending plans were mixed. Activity at ports was robust, while reports on transportation and warehouse activity in other areas were mixed. On balance, the outlook remains slightly pessimistic and uncertain, unchanged relative to the previous report. Yet, here too, confusion was the dominant them, with a few District reports indicating the outlook has deteriorated while a few others indicating the outlook has improved. Focusing on labor markets, the Beige book reported the following: Employment has been little changed since the previous report. Most Districts described employment as flat, three Districts reported slight-to-modest increases, and two Districts reported slight declines. Many Districts reported lower employee turnover rates and more applicants for open positions. Comments about uncertainty delaying hiring were widespread: all Districts described lower labor demand, citing declining hours worked and overtime, hiring pauses, and staff reduction plans. Some Districts reported layoffs in certain sectors, but these layoffs were not pervasive. Two Districts noted that, for many of their contacts, hiring plans had not changed since the start of the year. Wages continued to grow at a modest pace , although many Districts reported a general easing in wage pressures. A few Districts indicated that higher costs of living continued to put upward pressure on wages. As for prices, it should come as no surprise by now that the runaway inflation everyone was expecting just isn't there. Here is Beige book confirmation: Prices have increased at a moderate pace since the previous report. There were widespread reports of contacts expecting costs and prices to rise at a faster rate going forward (although expectations don't pay the bills). A few Districts described these expected cost increases as strong, significant, or substantial (once again, it's all expected, nothing is realized ). All District reports indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices (so high that price increases were at most moderate, i.e., in line with history). However, contacts’ responses to these higher costs varied, including increasing prices on affected items, increasing prices on all items, reducing profit margins, and adding temporary fees or surcharges. There was a new section added to this month's Beige Book, one looking at the fate of US energy: Energy industry contacts reported moderate growth across most sectors. Liquefied natural gas production, exports, and overall global demand remained an area of strength. While domestic demand for U.S. crude oil was steady, global demand softened. Utility companies described robust residential power demand, modest growth in commercial, and some slowing in industrial. Although utility sector contacts reported growth opportunities linked to data center development, some noted a slight deceleration in activity, attributed to concerns over potential tariffs increasing the cost of power infrastructure and impeding investment. Offshore wind contacts reported a significant decline in demand, resulting in downsizing. In short, for yet another month, the sky is not falling. Here is a snapshot of highlights by Fed District: Boston: Economic activity decreased slightly overall. Consumer spending at retail stores and restaurants slowed modestly. Employers paused hiring because of heightened uncertainty, with employment declining slightly and wages increasing just barely. Prices increased only slightly, but larger price increases were expected for the summer. Contacts expressed mixed views concerning the outlook. New York: Economic activity in the Second District continued to decline modestly amid heightened uncertainty. Employment held steady, though demand for workers softened and wage growth slowed to a modest pace. Selling price increases remained moderate, but input prices grew strongly with tariff-induced cost increases. Capital spending plans declined, and the outlook was quite pessimistic. Philadelphia: Business activity declined modestly in the current Beige Book period, as it did in the last period. Employment declined slightly, despite an uptick in manufacturing sector jobs. Wages increased slightly, and firm price inflation was up moderately. Existing home sales grew slightly, and new home sales declined moderately. Expectations for future growth rose moderately for manufacturers and slightly for nonmanufacturers. Cleveland: District business activity continued to be flat in recent weeks, and contacts expected activity to remain flat in the months ahead. Retailers noted a pullback in consumer spending, and manufacturers reported softer orders. Many contacts attributed robust cost increases to tariffs and said that their selling prices increased moderately. Richmond: The regional economy continued to grow mildly in recent weeks. Consumer spending and nonfinancial services demand picked up slightly, financial services demand and real estate activity were little changed, and manufacturing activity contracted slightly. Port volumes increased strongly due to a surge in import activity. Employment rose slightly, wage growth was modest, and overall price growth remained moderate. Atlanta: The economy of the Sixth District grew slightly. Employment was steady, and wage pressure decreased. Prices increased moderately. Consumer spending was flat, and travel and tourism declined modestly. Home sales rose slightly. Transportation activity grew at a modest pace. Loan growth slowed. Manufacturing fell, but energy activity rose slowly. Chicago: Economic activity increased slightly. Consumer spending and employment increased modestly; business spending and construction and real estate activity were flat; manufacturing declined slightly; and nonbusiness contacts saw a slight decline in activity. Prices and wages rose modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income increased some. St. Louis: Economic activity has remained unchanged, but the outlook has slightly deteriorated. Employment levels were unchanged, and wage growth has been modest. Contacts expressed elevated uncertainty and concern that tariffs would result in further cost increases. Minneapolis: The District economy contracted slightly overall. Employment was flat and wages grew moderately. Some employers were preparing contingency plans for potential layoffs. Prices increased moderately overall; some contacts were adding or considering tariff surcharges. Manufacturing increased moderately and consumer spending fell. Agricultural conditions remained weak, but crop progress was solid. Kansas City: Overall activity declined moderately, driven by lower retail spending, a decline in the demand for single-family homes, and a slight contraction in manufacturing. Businesses indicated they were increasingly cautious about hiring plans and capital expenditures, but employment levels were steady. Dallas: Economic activity in the Eleventh District economy was little changed over the reporting period. Nonfinancial services activity held steady and growth in the manufacturing sector slowed. Loan volumes grew slightly, and the housing market remained subdued. Employment was flat and price pressures held steady except for the tariff-related increases seen in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks generally deteriorated, and tariff uncertainty was making it hard for businesses to plan for the future. San Francisco: Economic activity slowed slightly. Employment levels were generally stable. Wages rose slightly and prices increased modestly. Retail sales and consumer and business services demand eased. Conditions in manufacturing, agriculture, and real estate markets softened slightly. Activity in the financial services sector was stable. And finally, confirming that contrary to conventional wisdom the economic picture has been largely unch... [truncated]

SOURCE / GT VOICE GT Voice: Being a ‘reliable partner’ can’t be dictated by Washington’s values By Global Times Published: Jun 04, 2025 11:29 PM Illustration: Liu Rui/GT In recent remarks about China, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments have been summarized by some media outlets as suggesting that China has a "choice" on whether or not to be a "reliable partner." This comes at a time when the US has initiated a tariff storm, causing significant disruptions to the global economy, while China continues to expand its high-level openness and actively support multilateralism. Against this backdrop, the question of who qualifies as a reliable partner to the rest of the world - and who should make more effort and has a "choice" toward that end - appears to have an obvious answer. China is in the former category. Over the past eight years, the country has consistently held its position as the world's largest trading nation in terms of goods. Despite the rise of global protectionist sentiment, China has actively pursued greater openness with the international community. The vast and robust Chinese market, serving as a stabilizer for the global consumer market, offers substantial growth opportunities for multinational corporations. The question of who is deemed a reliable partner to the international community should not be dictated by the US alone. When addressing China's economy and real estate issues, Bessent's reported claim that China should "stop over-manufacturing" merely perpetuates the erroneous and outdated narrative of China's "overcapacity." These remarks seem designed to encourage China to reduce its manufacturing exports to the US, aligning with the US strategy of using tariff policies to suppress Chinese manufacturing exports. The US might prefer to increase its exports and reduce its imports, but achieving this goal should be through equal, fair, and mutually beneficial economic cooperation and competition. If China's manufacturing sector thrives and there is a trade surplus with the US, labeling China as "over-manufacturing" would be an overly domineering stance. It raises the question: does being a reliable global partner, in the eyes of the US, mean unconditionally increasing imports of American products and conforming to the economic interests of the US? China, to some extent, has established the "consumer economy" that Bessent considers important. In recent years, China has consistently focused on fueling consumption growth, despite encountering inevitable challenges. In 2024, final consumption contributed 44.5 percent to China's economic growth, surpassing investment and net exports. This development indicates that China is both in the process of transitioning to and has already become a consumption-driven economy. The emphasis on consumption reflects China's strategic adjustment in response to its own economic development needs. As China progresses toward a consumption-driven economy, it maintains a high level of openness to the world. This approach offers extensive development opportunities and stable economic dividends on a global scale. When comparing the economic structures of China and the US, it's undeniable that manufacturing and consumption hold different weights within their respective economies. This difference is determined by the complex trajectories and experiences of each nation's economic development over the past decades. Despite their distinct approaches to economic growth, both nations should engage in mutual respect and equal cooperation. There's no basis for claiming one economic model is superior to the other, nor is it accurate to label China's manufacturing exports as over-manufacturing. The economies of China and the US have potential for collaboration, given their complementary nature. In the era of economic globalization, it's impossible to segregate the global supply and trade chains. According to Fortune, Bessent has pointed out that the US is committed to shifting the American economy toward "more of a manufacturing economy." If the US wishes to establish a stronger manufacturing base, it will require substantial, concrete efforts, including improving the domestic business environment and attracting foreign investments. From this perspective, the US needs to consider what it means to be a "reliable partner" to the rest of the world. At a minimum, this involves acting responsibly, but a higher aspiration would be to share the fruits of development with the global community.

Klarna’s BNPL Debit Card Goes Head-to-Head With Banks Photo via Andre M. Chang/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom Sean Craig June 4, 2025 3 min read MA A debit card that lets you take out a line of credit … isn’t that just a credit card? Not in 2025, apparently. Swedish fintech Klarna is piloting its own Visa debit card in the United States, the company announced Tuesday. Unremarkably, it will allow consumers to pay for purchases with their own funds, just like any other debit card. But they’ll also have the option of choosing a short-term buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan to be paid back in small installments. READ ALSO: Just How Much Data Does the Fed Need to Cut Rates? and Europe Delays Stricter Banking Rules to Keep ‘Level Playing Field’ With US Rivals Debit Where Due Stockholm-based Klarna grew its revenue to $2.8 billion last year from $2.3 billion in 2023 as BNPL adoption widened, powered by younger consumers and others more averse to traditional credit with interest charges. This year, Klarna has continued to boost its profile in the consumer economy. In March, it bested rival Affirm to take exclusive control of BNPL at Walmart, America’s largest retailer. The same month, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski defended a deal to bring Klarna’s lightning-fast access to credit to food delivery service DoorDash after critics joked about the idea of $15 burritos on loan as “ the 2008 housing crisis, but for food ” and “ collateralized DoorDash obligations .” Those jokes were rooted in real concerns, as BNPL loans have come back to bite some consumers. In an April survey by LendingTree, 41% of BNPL users reported making late payments on a loan in the past year, up from 34% in 2023. A quarter of BNPL users reported taking out loans to pay for groceries, up from 14% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Klarna reported its consumer credit losses rising to $136 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year. The company, which saw its number of active customers cross 100 million in April, has pointed to the much less dramatic growth in the percentage of unpaid loans, which rose to 0.54% in the first quarter from 0.51% a year earlier. And now, of course, those loans will be accessible for cardholders far and wide via Visa: Klarna said it plans a wider rollout of the debit card, which already has a 5 million-person waiting list, in the US and Europe later this year. The card will offer one free tier and two paid tiers that include discounts and better cashback rates. Because Klarna is not a licensed bank in the US, the debit card and its associated account will be issued by Utah-based WebBank. Not to be outdone, rival payments firm PayPal announced its own Mastercard on Tuesday, issued by Connecticut bank Synchrony, which can tap into its BNPL offering, PayPal Credit. Story Continues On Hold: In April, Klarna postponed plans for a US initial public offering for the second time after President Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs left markets reeling and consumer sentiment in the doldrums — although both have since rebounded somewhat.

China has a ‘choice’ on whether to be a reliable partner: US Treasury Secretary Bessent Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Mr Scott Bessent said China needs to shift to a more consumption-led economy to help ease global imbalances. PHOTO: REUTERS Follow topic: United States Published Jun 04, 2025, 08:31 AM Updated Jun 04, 2025, 11:01 AM ZURICH – US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing has a choice on whether to be a dependable partner with the rest of the world, reiterating that China needs to shift to a more consumption-led economy to help ease global imbalances. “They either want to be a reliable partner to the rest of the world, or they don’t,” Mr Bessent said via video link to the American Swiss Foundation Leadership Summit in Zurich on June 3. “They are in the midst of a large real estate – I won’t be alarmist and say crisis – but a large real estate over-build and the way for them to stabilise their economy is not to export deflation and excess products to the rest of the world,” he said. “The way to do that is through a level of fiscal stimulus and to stop over-manufacturing, and get on a sound footing for the consumer economy.” Mr Bessent did not comment about a possible call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping , which White House officials have indicated is in the works. The world’s two largest economies are pointing fingers at each other for violating terms of a deal they announced three weeks ago in Geneva, pausing tit-for-tat tariffs until mid-August to give talks time to play out. Mr Trump “wants the US to become more of a manufacturing economy”, Mr Bessent said. The US is trying to remain a destination for foreign and domestic investment with tax cuts, trade rebalancing and deregulation, adding that precision manufacturing is one of the goals of the Trump administration, he said. Mr Bessent also said he sees untapped potential for Switzerland and the US to collaborate more on artificial intelligence and financial services. He said US officials will continue working with their Swiss counterparts to streamline global financial regulations, modernise capital requirements and continue to engage with one another on key macroeconomic issues. July 9 extension Switzerland is among several countries trying to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid an increase of Mr Trump’s reciprocal tariff of 10 per cent to a higher level designated on April 2 – 31 per cent in Switzerland’s case – when a 90-day reprieve expires on July 9. Speaking earlier at the same forum, top Swiss trade official Helene Budliger said Switzerland was assured by the US that tariffs will stay at their current 10 per cent level instead of ratcheting up to 31 per cent, even if negotiations extend past July 9. Switzerland has been told “several times”, both by Mr Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, that the time would be extended, “as long as there is a perception that we’re negotiating in a bona fide way – which is the only way Swiss negotiate”, she told Bloomberg Television. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter had previously said it is “clear” that the deadline would be moved as long as talks continue, but there was no US confirmation on this. Switzerland’s government last week signed off on a negotiation mandate that sketches a compromise around cutting tariffs for agricultural goods the country does not significantly produce. Ms Budliger added that both sides started “a quite detailed conversation on what a UK style deal could look like between the US and Switzerland”. There are “relatively concrete ideas” on the table, she said. She also said that Switzerland is suffering from a global overproduction of steel, along with the US.

Lifestyle Chinese travel more during Dragon Boat holiday but spending lags Cross-border journeys rise 2.7% to 5.9 million, with 231,000 foreign nationals entering the country visa-free during the holiday Spectators watch as participants take part in a dragon boat tug-of-war competition in the waters of Xujiachong harbour to mark the Dragon Boat festival, in Yichang, Hubei province, China May 31, 2025. China Daily via REUTERS Reuters Published : 03 Jun 2025, 10:46 PM Updated : 03 Jun 2025, 10:46 PM Chinese people travelled more over the three-day Dragon Boat holiday this year, but spending remained below pre-pandemic levels, government data showed on Tuesday - indicators that are closely watched as barometers of consumer confidence. Consumption in the world's second-largest economy has suffered amid sputtering growth and a prolonged property crisis, with uncertainty from the US-China trade war also weighing on consumer confidence. The latest data painted a mixed picture for China's consumer economy. Tourists took an estimated 119 million domestic journeys from Friday to Monday, up 5.7 percent from the same holiday period last year, according to the Ministry for Tourism and Culture. Overall spending over the period rose to 42.73 billion yuan ($5.94 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.9 percent, but the average amount spent per traveller was a little under 360 yuan ($50), according to Reuters calculations, remaining stubbornly below 2019 levels of around 410 yuan per trip. The annual festival took place from May 31 to June 2 this year and is celebrated throughout the country with local dragon boat races. Many people take the opportunity to have short holidays, crowding train stations and airports around the country. Overall, more than 653.7 million inter-regional trips across all regions in China, which include tourist trips, were made during the three-day holiday, up 2.5 percent year-on-year, state media Xinhua reported on Tuesday, and road travel was up 2.4 percent from last year with 597.3 million trips recorded. Cross-border journeys rose 2.7 percent to 5.9 million, with 231,000 foreign nationals entering the country visa-free during the holiday. China has been expanding its visa policy, with citizens of 43 countries granted visa-free access, while visa-free transit for up to 240 hours in China is available for 54 countries. Chinese also boosted spending on entertainment over the holiday, with cinema box office revenue reaching 460 million yuan ($63.9 million), surpassing last year’s 384 million yuan, according to data from online ticketing platform Maoyan. Tom Cruise’s latest movie "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning" topped charts, and generated 228 million yuan, half of the total revenue during the holiday period, which was seen as a positive indicator for the upcoming summer season.

Subscribe now The Indian economy experienced some weakness in April compared to the previous month, showed the 16 high-frequency indicators tracked by Mint in its monthly macro tracker. Muted growth in the core sector and deterioration in the trade balance weighed on the economy's overall performance. Seven indicators remained in the green—unchanged from the previous month—while those in the red increased to five in April from three in March. For each indicator, the value in each month is assigned a colour coding (red, amber or green) to denote where it lies relative to the five-year average (red denotes worse, amber denotes in line, and green denotes better).

While import cover remained in the red, the rupee and labour-intensive export growth improved. However, the trade balance moved from amber to red. Meanwhile, the consumer economy is finding some stability, but there hasn’t been much change in the past six months. The producer economy also hasn’t improved, with core sector performance worsening in April, moving from amber to red. The ease-of-living segment—covering retail and core inflation, real rural wage growth, and labour force participation—continued to perform strongly, with all four indicators remaining in the green for the fourth consecutive month.

The tracker has been running since October 2018. Methodology note: While calculating the five-year average, data for some indicators for April-May 2020 and April-May 2021 have been removed to eliminate lockdown-induced skews in the trend. However, the five-year averages may still show high figures due to a sustained base effect in several indicators in 2021 and 2022. Monthly standings will be updated retrospectively as more data comes in. For inflation, the red/green coding is reversed.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Surabhi Updated Jun 2, 2025 1:04 PM IST Very few rural households fully depend on agriculture for income, finds report With more and more agricultural households supplementing their incomes through other sources, a new report has called for rethinking rural development strategies and bring in more reforms in the farm sector to support farmers and farmer households. “PRICE’s ICE 360° surveys support this, revealing that while 42.4% of rural households earn some income from agriculture, only 20.7% are fully dependent on it. This shift underscores the need to rethink rural development strategies,” said the report titled ‘Reimagining Annadata Households and Their Livelihoods Beyond the Farm’ by People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE). Advertisement Related Articles 'Zero tax on Rs 40 cr agriculture revenue, salaried person pays...': Expert highlights inequality in taxation '150% tariff on American alcohol': White House says India 'not helping', levies 100% tariff on agri goods The report found that while many rural households report agriculture as a source of income, a smaller percentage is entirely dependent on farming. According to the PRICE ICE 360° Survey, approximately 42.4% of Indian households or 140 million households in 2024-25 have agriculture and allied activities as a source of income. However, only 20.7% (68.4 million households) are classified as ‘full-time/regular’ agricultural households, meaning their primary source of livelihood is farming. “This stark difference indicates that a significant number of households derive part of their income from non-farm activities, with agriculture playing a supplementary role in their overall economic structure,” it said. The report is authored by Rajesh Shukla, Adite Banerjie and Tanvi Menaria of PRICE. The report also highlights that farming alone is no longer sufficient to sustain rural livelihoods and 33% of the income of agricultural households is in fact derived from non-farming activities. These include non-agricultural self-employment (7.1%), salaries from jobs outside of agriculture (3.4%), and remittances (2.6%), it said, adding that this trend toward non-farm income highlights the increasing importance of economic diversification for the survival and stability of agricultural households. Advertisement The report notes that the average full-time agricultural household in India is projected to earn Rs 7.31 lakh annually by 2024-25, with a substantial portion of their income—67.1%— coming from farming activities. This includes Rs 4.90 lakh earned directly from farming and Rs 54,000 (7.4%) from allied agricultural activities such as dairy, livestock, or other subsidiary agricultural enterprises. “However, farming alone is no longer sufficient to sustain rural livelihoods,” it underlines. It has suggested several reforms in the farm sector to support farmers and farmer households. These include measures like broadening the definition of Annadata households to include tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and landless agricultural workers, which would ensure they are included in welfare schemes such as PM-Kisan and formal financial inclusion initiatives. It has also called for promoting non-farm employment by fostering rural entrepreneurship and skill development to create alternative income opportunities for these households. Expanding agricultural productivity and enhancing financial inclusion are some of the other measures the report has advocated to enable Annadata households to contribute effectively to India’s transformation into a Viksit Bharat.

Perhaps the narrative that’s most concerning for fashion and beauty companies is that of buying less, or nothing at all. Underconsumption has been gaining ground for the past year or so, showcasing a simpler life – streamlining beauty regimes and wearing vintage clothes, for example, are in vogue right now. Brands can respond by focusing on fewer product lines but more meaningful “hero” items, or by embracing vintage in their selections.

Audio By Carbonatix Ghana’s real household spending will grow by an improved 2.5% year-on-year to GH¢129.7 billion in 2025, Fitch Solutions has disclosed. This follows a weaker growth of 1.1% a year ago. According to the UK-based firm, this will be 25.4% above the GH¢103.4 billion recorded in 2019 (pre-pandemic). The major drivers of growth will be cooler inflation and greater cedi stability and strength over 2025, while also allowing for a dovish approach from the Bank of Ghana (BoG). Insights Into Consumer Spending Fitch Solutions' forecast for continued strength in consumer spending growth in Ghana over 2025. This is in line with its Country Risk team, which forecasts real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 4.2% year-on-year. For households in Ghana, it pointed out that there will be key upsides. Accordingly, the slower inflation over 2025 will further fuel spending growth and a greater number of transactions and will also see tailwinds from lower debt servicing costs. 2025 Consumer Activity Starts Slow In February 2025, Fitch Solutions said the volume of mobile money transactions decline to under 700 million transactions, following a record high of 745.0 million transactions over December 2024. Similarly, the value of transactions stood at GH¢316 billion over February 2025, identical to the November 2024 reading, though below the December 2024 and January 2025 levels. The slowdown in consumer activity, it said, came in the wake of the presidential election at the back of 2024 as well as weaker purchasing power following the December festive season. “To the upside, slower inflation over 2025 will further fuel spending growth and a greater number of transactions and will also see tailwinds from lower debt servicing costs”, it added.

The paper, authored by Rajesh Shukla (MD & CEO), Adite Banerjie (journalist and consultant) and Tanvi Menaria (researcher), also highlighted that the share of Annadata households’ income to total households has dipped to 90 per cent from 94 per cent. PRICE defines full-time or regular agricultural households as those that depend fully on farming and allied activities for their livelihood. This is determined by collecting detailed, longitudinal household income data, including income sources, which provide a more reliable estimation of households that depend on agriculture. “According to PRICE’s 2024-25 estimates, of the 330 million (33 crore) households in India, approximately 68.4 million (6.84 crore) can be classified as full-time/regular Annadata households,” said the paper titled, ‘Reimagining Annadata Households and Their Livelihoods Beyond the Farm’. This paper’s timing coincides with the government announcement that MSP (Minimum Support Price) amount paid to farmers has seen a massive increase. Between 2014 and 2025, the amount paid for Kharif crops surged 3.4 times, compared to the previous 10 years at ₹16.35 lakh crore, while for Rabi crops it increased 2.7 times to ₹7.21 lakh crore. The paper noted that with agricultural incomes being volatile and often inadequate, more and more rural households are exploring non-farm income sources. However, several systemic and structural barriers limit the potential for diversification, particularly for small and marginal farmers, who have made farming a precarious and often unsustainable livelihood. It also highlighted the heavy reliance on non-farm-income. A crucial shift According to the PRICE ICE 360° Survey, around 52 per cent of agricultural households now report earning some form of non-farm income. This reflects a crucial shift as rural economies adapt to the limitations of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood. Non-farm income sources include self-employment in non-agricultural enterprises (7.1 per cent), salaried employment (3.4 per cent), agricultural labor (4.4 per cent) and pensions (1.4 per cent). “This diversification into non-farm activities is vital for mitigating the inherent risks of farming, such as fluctuating crop prices, unpredictable weather patterns and market volatility. For many Annadata households, these additional income streams provide a financial buffer, helping them sustain livelihoods despite the volatility in farm income,” the paper said. It also listed land fragmentations, resources limitations and technological gaps as constraints in agriculture particularly severe for small and marginal farmers, who constitute a significant portion of Annadata households. Viksit Bharat Terming Annadata households as the pillars of Viksit Bharat, the paper said Annadata households must continue to thrive, not just as food providers, but as drivers of innovation, economic diversification and rural prosperity. Their transition from primarily agricultural entities to dynamic economic contributors is essential for India’s vision of a developed economy by 2047. “Achieving this requires a collaborative effort from the government, private sector and civil society to create an ecosystem, where these households can succeed in multiple economic areas, ensuring a strong and self-sufficient rural India,” it said.

US consumers pulling back spending; inflation slowing for now Lucia Mutikani May 30, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending increased marginally in April, with households opting to boost savings amid mounting economic uncertainty because of a constantly changing tariff landscape. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday suggested the economy struggled to rebound early in the second quarter after contracting in the January-March quarter for the first time in three years. Gross domestic product could, however, get a lift from a sharp contraction in the goods trade deficit last month as the front-running of imports to beat tariffs faded. Inflation was muted in April, with a measure of underlying price pressures posting its smallest annual increase in four years. But that was unlikely to encourage the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates soon as import duties are expected to raise prices. Economists say the inflationary effects of tariffs have not yet shown as businesses are probably still selling inventory accumulated before President Donald Trump embarked on his aggressive trade policy campaign. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked most of Trump's import duties from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority. They were, however, temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court on Thursday, adding another layer of uncertainty over the economy's outlook. "There is clear evidence that consumers are battening down the hatches," said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. "The Fed will welcome the favorable inflation reading in this report, but they are likely to interpret it as the calm before the storm." Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.7% jump in March, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. That was in line with economists' expectations. Spending was supported by outlays on services, mostly housing and utilities, healthcare as well as restaurants, hotels and motel stays. But goods spending softened amid cutbacks on purchases of motor vehicles and parts, clothing and footwear as well as recreational goods and vehicles. Pre-emptive buying of goods ahead of Trump's sweeping import tariffs helped to push spending higher in the prior month. Most of the tariffs have been implemented, though higher duties on goods have been delayed until July and mid-August. Economists have argued that Trump's aggressive trade policy will sharply slow economic growth this year and boost inflation. Story Continues Minutes of the U.S. central bank's May 6-7 meeting published on Wednesday noted "participants judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases." The Fed has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range since December. Financial markets expect the Fed to resume rate cuts in September. The economy contracted at a 0.2% annualized rate in the first quarter after growing at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter, mostly depressed by a flood of imports. With most of the tariffs in place, imports are collapsing, helping to compress the goods trade deficit by 46.0% to $87.6 billion in April, a separate report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed. Goods imports decreased $68.4 billion to $276.1 billion. Exports of goods increased $6.3 billion to $188.5 billion. The shrinking goods trade deficit, if sustained, suggests trade could provide a major boost to gross domestic product this quarter after slicing off a record 4.90 percentage points in the first quarter. But businesses do not appear to be restocking, with wholesale inventories unchanged last month and stocks at retailers dipping 0.1%. That would offset some of the boost to GDP from trade. "If imports dropped off and inventories did not fall to match, then GDP growth will be stronger," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. "However, we will be surprised if stockpiles of goods do not drop hard before the second quarter is over." Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. SAVING RATE JUMPS The saving rate jumped to a one-year high of 4.9% from 4.3% in March as consumers socked away much of the 0.8% rise in personal income, which reflected Social Security retirement payments to some retirees who draw public pensions - such as former police and firefighters. Wages increased 0.5%. Though inflation was benign in April, consumers' inflation expectations remained elevated. The Fed minutes showed some policymakers assessed that "could make firms more willing to raise prices." The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in March. It was lifted by a 0.1% gain in goods prices, mostly recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment. Goods prices dropped 0.5% in March. The cost of services rose 0.1% after gaining 0.2% in March. Services inflation was last month curbed by a sharp drop in financial services and insurance as well as recreation. But prices for housing and utilities continued to rise while the cost of transportation services rebounded. In the 12 months through April, PCE prices increased 2.1% after advancing 2.3% in March. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.1% last month following an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in March. The so-called core PCE inflation was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. In the 12 months through April, core inflation rose 2.5%. That was the smallest advance since March 2021 and followed a 2.7% increase in March. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. "The increased tariffs have not yet worked their way into the consumer inflation readings, but we anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.

Hit by Trump trade wars, US economy falls 0.2% in first quarter by Naharnet Newsdesk 29 May 2025, 15:53 Comment 0 Tweet The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump's trade wars disrupted business, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its initial estimate. First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes. The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. Imports grew at a 42.6% pace, fastest since third-quarter 2020, and shaved more than 5 percentage points off GDP growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that's mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what's produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Costa Rican coffee — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. The first-quarter import surge likely won't be repeated in the April-June quarter and therefore shouldn't weigh on GDP. Thursday's report was the second of three Commerce Department estimates of first-quarter GDP. The final version comes out June 26.

Reuters Published 30 May 2025, 07:17 PM IST US consumer spending slowed in April, as per latest data ( AFP ) US consumer spending increased marginally in April as a rush to beat higher prices from import duties slowed. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.7% jump in March, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending climbing 0.2%. Pre-emptive buying of goods ahead of President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs helped to push spending higher in the prior month. Most of the tariffs have been implemented though higher duties on goods have been delayed until July. Duties on Chinese imports have been slashed to 30% from 145% until mid-August. Economists have argued that Trump's aggressive trade policy will sharply slow economic growth this year and boost inflation, concerns echoed by Federal Reserve officials.

The economy by all measures contracted at a 0.2% annualized rate in the first quarter after growing at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter. With the exception of trade data, most official economic reports are yet to show the negative effects of tariffs in a significant way, though sentiment surveys have deteriorated. Economists expect the hit could become evident in June data. Inflation was benign in April, with retailers likely still selling inventory accumulated before the tariffs. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.1% last month after being unchanged in March, the BEA said. In the 12 months through April, PCE prices increased 2.1% after advancing 2.3% in March. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.1% last month.

Consumers' one-year inflation expectations have soared. The Fed minutes on Wednesday showed some policymakers assessed that the surge in short-term inflation expectations "could make firms more willing to raise prices." They also saw a risk that longer-term inflation expectations "could drift upward, which could put additional upward pressure on inflation."

Article content The slight upward revision in GDP reflected stronger business investment and a greater accumulation of inventories. Federal government spending wasn’t as much of a drag as originally reported. Article content GDP figures are revised multiple times as more data become available, enabling the government to fine-tune its estimate. The first projection, released in late April, showed the economy contracted for the first time since 2022. The final estimate is due next month. Article content Economic growth was dragged down at the start of the year by a surge in imports as U.S. businesses tried to get ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump ’s tariffs. More moderate consumer spending, as well as a decline in federal government spending, also weighed on the figure. Article content Since then, the White House has walked back or delayed some of the more punitive levies, and most of the tariffs have been blocked by a U.S. trade court. While the pauses have helped calm Americans’ concerns about the economy and prompted many economists to scrap their recession calls, tariff rates are still substantially higher than before Trump took office. Article content Article content Forecasters largely expect GDP to rebound in the second quarter as higher duties discourage imports, and the goods already brought in will accumulate in larger inventories that add to growth. Beyond that, economists and policymakers will be paying close attention to how Trump’s policies — including trade, but also immigration and taxation — will impact consumer and business spending going forward.

GDP Shows Consumer Resilience Under Pressure as CEOs Eye Recession By PYMNTS | May 29, 2025 | Highlights First-quarter GDP shrank, primarily due to a surge in imports, while the key driver, consumer spending, slowed significantly with notable pullbacks in durable goods and services. GDP shrank at an annualized 0.2% pace, a slight revision from 0.3%, reflecting stronger investment offset by a downward revision in consumer spending. CEO confidence experienced its sharpest quarterly drop on record, hitting its lowest level since late 2022. The vast majority of CEOs now hold a pessimistic outlook, with 83% anticipating a recession in the next 12-18 months. Tariffs are in limbo. GDP is shrinking. CEOs are pessimistic. And consumers are caught in the middle of all the uncertainty, buffeted by rising prices and an uncertain employment picture.

Δ On Thursday (May 29), the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its latest estimate of GDP – and noted only a slight revision to the decline in the economy. GDP shrank at an annualized 0.2% pace, a bit better than the 0.3% previously estimated. The revision reflects stronger-than-expected investment, particularly in private inventories, but was partly offset by a downward revision in consumer spending. Imports surged 42.6%, dragging heavily on GDP due to their negative accounting impact as businesses scrambled to get inventory in the face of looming tariffs that launched in April. This was the single largest contributor to the contraction. Consumer spending slowed to +1.2%, with noticeable pullbacks in durable goods (particularly vehicles) and in services like recreation and financial services. embed code: As for inflation, it’s still sticky. The PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index held steady at 3.6%, while the core PCE (excluding food and energy) was revised slightly down to 3.4%. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The Corporate Picture Preliminary estimates show corporate profits fell by $118.1 billion in Q1, reversing the strong $204.7 billion gain in Q4. This downturn reflects pressure from rising input costs and weaker demand, particularly in consumer-facing and export-sensitive industries. With the next GDP release due June 26, more complete data, including industry breakdowns, may offer further clarity. For now, the data suggests a fragile start to the year, shaped by volatile trade flows, cooling consumer momentum and firm inflation dynamics. A wild card still remains, as a federal court handed down a ruling Wednesday (May 28) that blocks Trump’s tariffs . That ruling is under appeal — and where there’s uncertainty, there’s a cloudy employment picture, which has been illustrated by other data released this week. As measured in May, CEO sentiment took a dramatic downturn, as The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence was released Thursday (May 29). The headline number dropped by 26 points to a reading of 34 — its lowest level since late 2022. This steep decline, the sharpest quarter-over-quarter drop in the survey’s nearly 50-year history, signals a marked shift toward pessimism. The current mark is 16 points below the 50-point threshold, which indicates that negative responses outweigh positive ones. All measures declined. The report revealed broad-based pessimism across all components of the confidence measures. CEOs’ assessments of current economic conditions fell the most, with 82% stating that the situation had worsened compared to six months ago, sharply from just 11% in the previous quarter. A Dimming Outlook Looking ahead, expectations also deteriorated significantly. Most CEOs now foresee further economic weakening in the next half-year, both at the macro level and within their own industries. Specifically, 64% anticipate a worsening economic outlook, a sharp rise from 15% in Q1. Recession fears remain high, with 83% of CEOs expecting a downturn in the next 12–18 months. Geopolitical instability emerged as the foremost concern for CEOs this quarter, followed by worries over trade and tariffs. Regulatory uncertainty also ranked high, while concern over cyber threats — previously a dominant issue — fell to fourth place. Hiring plans also reflected caution. While most CEOs (44%) intend to keep their workforce size unchanged, the proportion expecting to expand hiring declined slightly from 32% to 28%. Meanwhile, the share anticipating a reduction in staff ticked up from 27% to 28%. On the compensation front, over half of CEOs (53%) said they plan to raise wages by 3.0–3.9% over the next year. Notably, the share of those considering more modest increases in the 2.0–2.9% range grew from 24% to 34% — and we note that this range would fall below the PCE trends discussed above. Given the headwinds to hiring, an uncertain picture for wage growth and sticky inflation, consumer resilience will be tested in an environment where, as PYMNTS Intelligence has found , a growing percentage of households are finding that proactive planning for their financial futures — and spending plans — are becoming solely reactive to a constantly shifting macro landscape.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com PUBLISHED: May 29, 2025 at 6:23 AM PDT | UPDATED: May 29, 2025 at 8:33 AM PDT By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump’s trade wars disrupted business, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its initial estimate. First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes. The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. Imports grew at a 42.6% pace, fastest since third-quarter 2020, and shaved more than 5 percentage points off GDP growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. And federal government spending fell at a 4.6% annual pace, the biggest drop in three years. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that’s mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what’s produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Costa Rican coffee — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. The first-quarter import surge likely won’t be repeated in the April-June quarter and therefore shouldn’t weigh on GDP. From January through March, business investment surged 24.4%. An increase in inventories — as businesses stocked up ahead of the tariffs — added more than 2.6 percentage points to first-quarter GDP growth. A category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a 2.5% annual rate from January through March, down from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024 but still solid. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Trump’s tariffs have added considerable uncertainty to the economic outlook. He has imposed 10% tariffs on almost every country on earth in addition to levies on steel, aluminum and autos. A federal court on Wednesday blocked the 10% tariffs as well as specific taxes on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports, saying the president had overstepped his authority. Thursday’s report was the second of three Commerce Department estimates of first-quarter GDP. The final version arrives June 26.

Title: America economy performed slightly better in the first quarter than we thought but it still shrank

Shoppers hold bags while waiting to cross Post Street in San Francisco on March 27. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Washington CNN — The US economy shrank slightly less in the beginning of the year than previously reported, new data shows, but it was still the first quarterly decline since 2022, in a sign of how President Donald Trump’s chaotic and aggressive tariff regime is affecting American consumers and businesses. Gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered an annualized rate of -0.2% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s second estimate released Thursday. An initial estimate showed that GDP fell 0.3%. Trump’s tariffs have prompted American companies and consumers to pull forward purchases to get ahead of any sticker shock stemming from the duties, which has sent imports surging. But a federal court’s ruling late Wednesday has thrown Trump’s entire trade policy into question. Still, Trump’s trade war is far from over. His administration appealed Wednesday’s ruling from the three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade in Manhattan. Uncertainty stemming from Trump’s policies is expected to persist, but there are also questions over the underlying health of the US economy. The latest GDP data isn’t quelling those fears: A key gauge of demand in the economy — referred to as real final sales to private domestic purchasers — was revised down by a sizable half percentage-point for the first quarter. Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was also revised lower, factoring in weaker spending on food, cars and financial services. An upward revision to private inventory investment — specifically by nondurable goods manufacturers and companies in the information industry — offset those new weaker figures. Will the economy’s resilience persist? Americans remain uneasy over the chaotic and erratic rollout of Trump’s tariffs, but the jury is still out on whether consumers will continue to spend, or tighten their belt. In recent years, pessimism about the economy hasn’t led to weaker spending, as happened in 2022 and 2023, when consumers fretted over high inflation and a standoff in Congress about the debt ceiling. The latest consumer surveys show that people’s attitudes toward the economy remain in the doldrums. The strength of consumer spending is closely tied to the health of the labor market. Top policymakers at the Federal Reserve fear unemployment could soon pick up , especially if Trump’s trade war spirals out of control. Fed officials “assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months,” according to minutes from the central bank’s policy meeting earlier this month, with some noting that “their contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty.” In an aerial view, a shipping container is lifted off a container ship docked at the Port of Oakland on April 28, 2025 in Oakland, California. Federal Reserve economists revised up their projections for inflation this year and lowered their expectations for economic growth. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Fed expects the job market ‘to weaken substantially’ on Trump’s tariffs So far, there haven’t been any cracks in America’s long-robust labor market , with employers continuing to add jobs at a brisk pace and unemployment remaining relatively low. But if the labor market does deteriorate, that won’t bode well for consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy. And Americans stretching themselves to pull forward purchases to beat Trump’s tariffs means the economy would be in a vulnerable position if the job market ever begins to falter. “If you think appliance and vehicle prices are going to rise, you might accelerate your plans, but if you don’t have the cash for these purchases, relying on credit could be risky during uncertain times,” Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in an analyst note Thursday. “Newly delinquent credit accounts are on the rise, so in addition to anticipating the effects of new economic policies on prices, we’ll want to keep an eye on the potential impact to household debt management,” she said.

Title: Capex stronger than tariffs ?

Capex stronger than tariffs? While tariffs are casting doubt on growth, US business capex is resisting. Could the development of AI provide lasting support for the US economy? Antoine Alves d'Oliveira Published on 05/29/2025 at 08:45 am EDT Share This is the question all investors have been asking since Donald Trump launched his tariff war in early April: will the uncertainty created lead companies to cut their investments? This is a key question because it is often the source of an economic slowdown. A freeze in business investment weakens the labor market, which in turn affects consumption. Capex remains steady At this stage, these concerns have not materialized. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, US companies are continuing to invest. With Q1 results now out, companies have sent a reassuring signal: 71% of companies in the Russell 3000 index have maintained their capital expenditure (Capex) forecasts for 2025. Furthermore, 8.5% have raised them, compared with 18% that have reduced them. Last night's results published by Nvidia show that this investment momentum is well underway. Quarterly revenue rose 69% y-o-y. And for this quarter, Nvidia anticipates 50% revenue growth. All of this is largely supported by investments from major US technology stocks. When it announced its Q1 results, Alphabet confirmed its intention to invest $75bn to develop its AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Meta even raised its Capex forecast from $65bn to $72bn. Is tech stronger than tariffs? So, should we focus on the Capex of the magnificent seven or on Donald Trump's tariffs? What we can say is that the market narrative leaves us with the impression that everything depends on the decisions of one man. And we end up underestimating the strength of the private sector and the ability of US companies to pursue their goals. So, can the AI boom drive US growth for the next few years and render the discussion about the impact of tariffs anecdotal? This is certainly the view of Nouriel Roubini, an economist who became famous for predicting the 2008 crisis. This earned him the nickname "Dr. Doom." His success led him to continually predict disasters - and therefore to be wrong most of the time. But now he is no longer predicting a crash, but rather a boom in US growth, driven by this cycle of investment in new technologies, particularly AI. And this despite poor economic policies. This position is summed up well by the following quote: "Even if Mickey Mouse were president, the US would still be on track for 4% growth, because innovation in the US private sector promises to offset bad policies and erratic governance." According to him, this growth would therefore be twice as fast as the current estimate of US potential growth. This is a very optimistic forecast, and one that should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, Nouriel Roubini can be credited with recognizing that the macro impact of artificial intelligence is beginning to be felt. According to estimates by Apollo Global Management's chief economist, Torsten Slok, investments in data centers contributed 1 percentage point of growth in the first quarter of 2025. Source: Bloomberg, Macrobond, Apollo Global Management While the tech sector is driving growth, it is worth noting that the US economy is still heavily reliant on consumer spending. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending accounted for 68% of GDP in Q1 2025. As such, any potential slowdown in consumer spending could have a significant impact on the overall economy. Therefore, it is essential to monitor consumer sentiment and spending patterns closely to gauge the health of the US economy. © MarketScreener.com - 2025 Share

European companies cut costs, scale back investments in China as its economy slows 1 / 5 China Economy People tour by a projector screen promoting a newly opened outdoor Hutong style shopping mall, in Beijing, Monday, May 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) KEN MORITSUGU May 28, 2025 2 min read BEIJING (AP) — European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices , according to an annual survey released Wednesday. Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the United States over surging exports . “The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,” the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey 2025. The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand. The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets . In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ. The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidized electric vehicle production. “I think there’s a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,” Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week. He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn’t outpace that in demand. The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February. “It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,” he said.

Jim Cramer on GE Aerospace (GE): “I Truly Love GE Aerospace Right Here” Syeda Seirut Javed June 5, 2025 2 min read GE We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on These 12 Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. A caller inquired about GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) during the episode. Cramer replied that he loves the stock here. “GE Aerospace… is about as good as it gets. That guy from June of last year, he knew that GE Aerospace was good. That guy’s so smart. I gotta get him on the show… I truly love GE Aerospace right here.” Jim Cramer on GE Aerospace (GE): “I Truly Love GE Aerospace Right Here” A technician in a power station monitoring the flow of energy generated by a gas turbine. GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) develops and services aircraft engines and related systems for both commercial and defense sectors. The company provides advanced propulsion technologies, maintenance solutions, and components for a wide range of aviation applications. During the Mad Money episode aired on April 22, Cramer had many positive things to say about the company: “Let’s start with the best, GE Aerospace, because that’s the closest thing to a commercial aerospace pure play. It’s got the least defense exposure by far. Not coincidentally, it’s also the only one of these stocks that roared in response to earnings, jumping $10 and 83 cents. That’s more than 6%. Even though GE Aerospace posted a small revenue miss, they gave you a monster 22 cents earnings beat off a dollar 27 basis. Management said the total orders grew 12% in the quarter. That’s really good. Company reiterated its entire full-year forecast. Now, look, in normal environment, merely reiterating your outlook after such a big earnings beat would be, considered to be, let’s say, a big win but nothing that would make you go crazy about it but this time, it is huge. GE explicitly said that their outlook now includes the impact of the administration’s tariff policies, including less air travel.

Kirsty Needham June 1, 2025 at 2:02 PM 25 Copied By Kirsty Needham WASHINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's prime minister said on Monday his government would decide its defence capability needs before announcing defence spending, after U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth asked Australia to lift its defence budget to 3.5% of gross domestic product. "What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters, adding his government had already committed to accelerate A$10 billion in defence spending for the next four years. "We're continuing to lift up," he said, citing a 2.3% goal for 2033 previously set by his government. Hegseth and Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles discussed security issues including accelerating U.S. defence capabilities in Australia and advancing industrial base cooperation during a meeting on Friday, a Pentagon statement said on Sunday. "On defence spending, Secretary Hegseth conveyed that Australia should increase its defence spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP as soon as possible," the statement said. The ministers' meeting on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security forum, is only the second between the security allies since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Albanese, who was re-elected in May and is yet to meet Trump, did not raise defence spending in this year's national budget, saying his government had already announced a A$50 billion boost over a decade. Peter Dean, director of foreign policy and defence at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre, said Albanese was positioning ahead of his first meeting with Trump, where the pair are also expected to discuss tariffs. Albanese would want the decision on a defence boost to be seen as a sovereign one not imposed by Trump, after the election showed standing up for Australia was popular domestically, he said. Australia's defence spending in 1987 was around 3% of GDP or 10% of the national budget, compared to 2% of GDP or 6% of the budget in 2025, he said. "To achieve self-reliance in the modern era, with the threat from China, and within our region, it is going to cost more money," Dean said.

FILE PHOTO: Memorial Day in Arlington, Virginia By Kirsty Needham WASHINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's prime minister said on Monday his government would decide its defence capability needs before announcing defence spending, after U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth asked Australia to lift its defence budget to 3.5% of gross domestic product. "What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters, adding his government had already committed to accelerate A$10 billion in defence spending for the next four years. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement "We're continuing to lift up," he said, citing a 2.3% goal for 2033 previously set by his government. Hegseth and Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles discussed security issues including accelerating U.S. defence capabilities in Australia and advancing industrial base cooperation during a meeting on Friday, a Pentagon statement said on Sunday. "On defence spending, Secretary Hegseth conveyed that Australia should increase its defence spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP as soon as possible," the statement said. The ministers' meeting on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security forum, is only the second between the security allies since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Albanese, who was re-elected in May and is yet to meet Trump, did not raise defence spending in this year's national budget, saying his government had already announced a A$50 billion boost over a decade. Peter Dean, director of foreign policy and defence at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre, said Albanese was positioning ahead of his first meeting with Trump, where the pair are also expected to discuss tariffs. Albanese would want the decision on a defence boost to be seen as a sovereign one not imposed by Trump, after the election showed standing up for Australia was popular domestically, he said. Australia's defence spending in 1987 was around 3% of GDP or 10% of the national budget, compared to 2% of GDP or 6% of the budget in 2025, he said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement "To achieve self-reliance in the modern era, with the threat from China, and within our region, it is going to cost more money," Dean said. The U.S. would spend 3.5% of GDP on defence this year, he added. Australia has comitted to spend A$368 billion over three decades on the AUKUS programme to acquire and build nuclear powered submarines, and is also boosting missile acquisition and manufacture.

The SPP, which formally welcomed the UAE as a member, “will bolster military modernization efforts and enhance cooperation in integrated air and missile defense, cybersecurity, disaster response and operational planning,” the news release said. The Pentagon also announced plans to create a Major Defense Partnership between the U.S. and UAE. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and UAE Minister of State for Defense Affairs Mohammed Mubarak Al Mazrouei signed a letter of intent to establish the comprehensive U.S.-United Arab Emirates Major Defense Partnership. The letter of intent, signed May 16 in a ceremony at the Ministry of Defense in Abu Dhabi, “represents a shared commitment to develop a structured roadmap that will guide enhanced military-to-military cooperation, joint capability development and long-term defense alignment between the two nations,” the news release said. “The two sides will explore a phased framework for advancing bilateral force readiness, interoperability and innovation-driven collaboration.” As part of this partnership, Hegseth announced a new strategic initiative between the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit and the UAE’s Tawazun Council. “This collaboration will deepen ties in defense innovation, facilitate joint research and development and expand industrial and investment partnerships across both defense ecosystems,” the news release said. “The designation of the UAE as a Major Defense Partner reflects a decades-long relationship anchored in mutual trust, shared objectives and a common commitment to regional and global security,” the news release said. “It builds on the longstanding record of both countries working side-by-side to counter threats, stabilize conflict zones and promote security and prosperity in the Middle East and beyond.” Joint Press Statement on U.S.-UAE Major Defense Partnership: https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4189772/joint-press-statement-on-us-uae-major-defense-partnership/ State Partnership Program: https://www.nationalguard.mil/Leadership/Joint-Staff/J-5/International-Affairs-Division/State-Partnership-Program/ http://www.nationalguard.mil https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalGuard https://x.com/USNationalGuard

And even though America’s first space shuttle launched in the 1950s, leading aerospace companies today are still piercing deeper into the cosmos and stand at the forefront of cutting-edge technology that could seem out of this world. Many of these companies also have a reliable stream of revenue coming directly from the pocket of the Department of Defense. In fact, the U.S. Space Force’s top-secret plane made by Boeing recently made its safe return to Earth after spending more than 400 days in orbit, where officials said it had “broken new ground.” We had a problem loading this article.

Get 100% ad-free experience Aerospace Giants Adjust Strategies as Tariffs Disrupt $358 Billion Market By The Tokenist Author Timothy Fries Stock Markets Published 04/22/2025, 03:54 PM Aerospace Giants Adjust Strategies as Tariffs Disrupt $358 Billion Market View all comments (3) 3 The Tokenist Articles ( 1265 ) | My Homepage Follow BA 0.21% GE -0.39% RTX 0.11% The aerospace industry in the United States is bracing for significant financial repercussions due to the trade tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Major players like Rtx Corp (NYSE: RTX ) and GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE ) are forecasting substantial fiscal impacts, with RTX predicting an $850 million hit and GE Aerospace estimating around $500 million. These tariffs, which include a 10% levy on certain imports and additional duties on steel and aluminum, are part of a broader shift in trade policies that affect U.S. manufacturers dependent on international supply chains. In response, GE Aerospace plans to counterbalance these costs through strategic savings and price hikes while maintaining its 2025 earnings outlook. CEO Larry Culp has actively engaged in discussions with Trump to address the aerospace sector’s trade surplus and explore the potential benefits of a tariff-free trading environment. As a traditionally duty-free industry, aerospace companies now face a cloud of uncertainty, with Boeing (NYSE: BA ) among those preparing to release quarterly results in this challenging economic climate. RTX, GE Aerospace Anticiate Substantial Impact from New Tariffs The imposition of new tariffs under former President Donald Trump has sent ripples through the U.S. aerospace industry, with major companies like RTX and GE Aerospace anticipating substantial financial impacts. RTX has projected an $850 million setback, while GE Aerospace estimates a $500 million hit due to these trade policies. These tariffs, which include a 10% levy on specific imports and additional duties on steel and aluminum, represent a significant shift in trade policy affecting U.S. manufacturers with global supply chain dependencies. In response to these challenges, GE Aerospace is implementing cost-saving measures and price increases to mitigate the financial burden, while still aiming to meet its 2025 earnings targets. RTX and GE Stock Brief The stock market has shown varied responses to the trade policy changes, with notable movements in the prices of RTX and GE Aerospace shares. RTX’s stock opened at $114.53 on April 22, 2025, down from the previous close of $126.12, and has fluctuated between a low of $113.97 and a high of $117.19 during the day so far. The company’s market capitalization stands at $156.95 billion, with a dividend yield of 2.0%. Meanwhile, GE Aerospace’s stock opened higher at $186.50 compared to the previous close of $178.35, reaching a high of $188.00 and a low of $182.215. The company’s market capitalization is $201.39 billion, with a dividend yield of 0.81%. Both companies have received positive recommendations from analysts, with RTX rated as a “Buy” and GE Aerospace as a “Strong Buy,” reflecting investor confidence despite the challenging economic environment. *** Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

Defense Third top Defense Department official placed on leave amid leak probe by Filip Timotija - 04/16/25 3:54 PM ET by Filip Timotija - 04/16/25 3:54 PM ET Share ✕ LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email Suspensions at the Defense Department have continued, with a third top Pentagon official being placed on administrative leave amid an ongoing investigation into information leaks at the department. Colin Carroll, chief of staff to deputy secretary of Defense Steve A. Feinberg, was placed on administrative leave on Wednesday, a U.S. defense official told The Hill. The department did not have any more information to share. Carroll’s suspension came just a day after two of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s advisers were suspended and escorted out of the Pentagon . On Tuesday, the Defense Department suspended and escorted out Dan Caldwell, Hegseth’s senior adviser, and Darin Selnick, the department’s deputy chief of staff. Both Caldwell and Selnick previously worked at Concerned Veterans for America, a nonprofit group previously headed by Hegseth. Carroll, a U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer, previously worked at Anduril Industries, a defense contractor that specializes in autonomous systems, according to his LinkedIn. He also worked at Applied Intuition, a software company headquartered in California. Carroll deployed to Afghanistan four times as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy with an aerospace engineering degree and got his master’s degree from Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service. The Defense Department said in March that it kicked off an investigation into “recent unauthorized disclosures of national security information.” “This investigation will commence immediately and culminate in a report to the Secretary of Defense,” Hegseth’s chief of staff Joe Kasper wrote in a March 21 memo. “The report will include a complete record of unauthorized disclosures within the Department of Defense and recommendations to improve such efforts.” Caldwell, a Marine Corps veteran, was a public policy adviser at Defense Priorities, a foreign policy-focused think tank. Selnick, a retired Air Force officer, worked as a senior adviser to the Concerned Veterans for America from 2019 to 2024.

Title: US Ally Boosts Military Spending After Pressure From Trump

Article Content:
... By Ryan Chan China News Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member Japan, a key United States treaty ally, is expected to spend nearly 2 percent of its GDP on defense this year, as it faces pressure from the Trump administration. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment. Why It Matters The U.S. signed a security treaty with Japan , which gives it the right to maintain a military presence there, protecting the ally. Japan also forms part of the First Island Chain , a U.S. containment strategy to restrict Russian and Chinese access to the Pacific Ocean. Last month, President Donald Trump questioned this security relationship, saying the treaty is not reciprocal as Japan does not have to " protect us ." On Wednesday, he announced that he will meet with Japanese officials to negotiate on trade and " the cost of military support ." Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby suggested that Japan, which he called a "vital ally," should boost its defense spending to 3 percent of GDP on defense "as soon as possible," citing threats posed by China and North Korea. What To Know During a press conference on Tuesday, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani announced that the country will spend approximately 9.9 trillion yen ($70 billion) on defense, equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP, for fiscal year 2025, from April 1 to March 31. Japan had spent about 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent of GDP on defense for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, or 6.8 trillion yen ($47 billion) and 7.95 trillion yen ($56 billion). Tokyo aims to boost its defense budget to 2 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2027. However, Nakatani said the latest ratio is based on GDP three years earlier, which would drop to the previous fiscal year level when compared to an estimated GDP for the current fiscal year. ... Japan's Kyodo News reported that increasing defense spending enables Japan to acquire counterstrike capabilities for striking enemy territory directly. This comes as China is modernizing its military power rapidly while North Korea continues its nuclear and missile programs. Before the Japanese government released its national security strategy policy guidelines in 2022, Japan's defense budget was limited to only 1 percent of GDP, or 5 trillion yen ($35 billion), by its constitution, which renounces war and puts the country on a pacifist course. Last week, Trump announced that the Pentagon 's budget would be raised to a record high of $1 trillion to build a strong military. "You've got a lot of bad forces out there now," he said. What People Are Saying Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said at a press conference: "As I have repeatedly stated, what is important about the drastic strengthening of defense capabilities is the content of the defense capabilities, and it is important for Japan to proceed with its own judgment and responsibility." President Donald Trump said: "We have to protect Japan—and, by the way, they make a fortune out of us economically. We have to protect Japan, but under no circumstances do they have to protect us." U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby said: "Japan's strategic shift is critical and most welcome, but it is inadequate. Japan is moving toward spending approximately 2% of GDP on defense by 2027. This is manifestly inadequate." What Happens Next It remains to be seen whether the U.S. will pressure Japan to boost its defense spending further. Tokyo may choose to purchase military hardware from Washington to reduce the pressure.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Bryan Kohberger's defense team is trying to create an "illusion" for future jurors with a new effort to get certain evidence tossed, a former FBI special agent said. Kohberger is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of four students at the University of Idaho, including Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; and Ethan Chapin, 20. The former Washington State University student was also charged with one felony count of burglary. During an April 9 hearing, Judge Steven Hippler issued several rulings on motions filed by the defense. Hippler agreed partially to a motion from defense attorneys that would have blocked prosecutors from using words such as "psychopath" and "sociopath" during the trial. He cautioned, however, that the defense's request is similar to asking for "an order that says the state shall not commit prosecutorial misconduct." Hippler said the word "murderer" could be used during closing arguments, but said terms like "sociopath" and "psycho-" can't be used unless an expert evaluation determines that these words describe Kohberger. WHAT WENT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S WAY — AND WHAT DIDN'T — AT EVIDENCE MOTIONS HEARING Bryan Kohberger enters the courtroom for a hearing Tuesday at the Latah County Courthouse in Moscow, Idaho, U.S. June 27, 2023. (August Frank/Pool via REUTERS) A doctor being used as a witness by the defense also agreed to hand over her findings on Bryan Kohberger's psychological state following a motion to preclude the death penalty based on the former Washington State University student's autism diagnosis. Kohberger's defense team also asked for "inflammatory evidence" to be left out of the trial, such as excessive use of crime scene pictures, but Hippler said he expects the evidence to reflect the "brutal and horrific" nature of the murders. A request from defense attorneys to have Kohberger's 2020 DeSales University essay about crime scene handling excluded from the trial was denied. SIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER During the hearing on April 9, defense attorneys also pushed to have audio from the 911 call made by the victim's roommate excluded from the trial. Hippler said he'd consider only allowing a redacted version of the call to be aired during the trial, but said he'll likely allow the 911 call audio to be played. Hippler said he'd rule on some motions after the hearing. Former FBI special agent Jonathan Gilliam told Fox News Digital that he thinks Kohberger's defense team is focused on creating doubt for future jurors. "It's important to realize that [the defense] are not focused on his guilt or innocence. They're focused on showing or creating the illusion that the prosecution does not have a strong enough case to convict," Gilliam said. "Whether or not these defense attorneys believe that Bryan Kohberger didn't murder these four individuals or not is irrelevant to the defense." IDAHO PROSECUTORS SAY THEY WILL CALL ‘A FEW’ OF BRYAN KOHBERGER’S FAMILY MEMBERS TO TESTIFY AT TRIAL Bryan Kohberger appears in court in Moscow, Idaho on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2023. Kohberger appeared in court in an attempt to overturn his grand jury indictment for the 2022 murders of four college students in their home. (Kai Eiselein/Pool) Anne Taylor, an attorney representing Bryan Kohberger, who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, arrives at a hearing in Latah County District Court, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) "[The defense is] trying to influence the court so that the court ends up creating a barrier or a hurdle for the prosecution," he added. During the April 9 hearing, defense attorney Anne Taylor attempted to argue that the prosecution is intentionally slow-walking discovery, but later admitted that all requests from the defense have been provided. FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X Gilliam said this was another attempt from Taylor to try and delay the process even more. "They have been able to stall it over and over again," Gilliam said of Taylor's courtroom tactics. "And I wonder if they're trying to do that, to put distance enough where they can get a more sympathetic jury, where they hope that some of the evidentiary stuff can be thrown out because maybe it's not as crystal clear as the prosecution wants."

All KU campuses named 2025-2026 top Military Friendly Schools A KU ROTC student stands vigil in front of the Campanile. Credit: KU Marketing Wed, 04/09/2025 author April Blackmon Strange Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE — All University of Kansas campuses have received top rankings among Tier 1 research institutions in the annual “Military Friendly Schools” survey, the longest-running review of college and university investments in serving military-affiliated students. The KU School of Medicine-Wichita campus was named the No. 8 Military Friendly and No. 8 Military Spouse Friendly School, and the KU Lawrence campus was ranked the No. 9 Military Friendly and No. 9 Military Friendly Spouse School. KU Medical Center, the School of Medicine and Nursing-Salina campus and the Edwards Campus in Overland Park all earned Gold designations as Military Friendly Schools and Military Spouse Friendly Schools. Institutions earning the Military Friendly School designation were evaluated using public data sources and survey information. More than 1,800 institutions participated in the 2025-2026 survey, with 830 earning special awards for going above the standard. “I believe this is the first time all schools’ campuses were considered for separate designations,” said April Blackmon Strange, director of the Lt. Gen. William K. Jones Military-Affiliated Student Center. “And to have every KU campus receive high rankings is a testament to the university’s dedication to serving our more than 2,200 veterans, service members, spouses, dependents and ROTC students.” The Military Friendly Schools list is created each year based on extensive research using public data sources from more than 8,800 schools nationwide, input from student veterans and responses to the proprietary, data-driven Military Friendly Schools survey from participating institutions. The survey questions, methodology, criteria and weighting were developed with the assistance of an independent research firm and an advisory council of educators and employers. The survey is administered for free and is open to all postsecondary schools that wish to participate. Rankings and survey criteria are available online and will be published in G.I. Jobs magazine's May and October issues. The Military-Affiliated Student Center at KU — a nearly 3,000 square foot center in Summerfield Hall — serves as a centralized resource for KU’s military-affiliated community. It includes a lounge with 24-7 access, study spaces, headquarters for the KU Student Veterans of America student organization, VA Work Study opportunities, staff to help with GI Bill benefits, military tuition assistance and more. The university is one of just 104 campuses nationwide to have the Department of Veterans Affairs VetSuccess on Campus program with a dedicated VA VSOC counselor. In addition to the center, KU has several scholarships and an emergency fund for military-affiliated students as well as a Veterans Upward Bound program . KU also has a series of National Defense Initiatives facilitating education programming, research development and strategic partnerships. This includes being one of more than 50 universities to have all branches of ROTC and one of eight universities designated as a Department of Defense Language Training Center , which educates hundreds of service members in strategic languages and regional area studies. In 2024, the KU School of Law received a $1.6 million federal grant to establish a free legal aid clinic dedicated to serving veterans – the first of its kind in the state. The clinic is expected to open later this year. The KU Edwards Campus has a Veterans and Student Leadership Lounge. Additional KU academic programs and certificates are available both on Fort Leavenworth and in Leavenworth for military and civilians in the area. KU also has a 4,000-member Veterans Alumni Network .

Article Content:
Integrated, end-to-end airport solution enables a seamless travel experience MADRID , April 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Collins Aerospace, an RTX (NYSE: RTX ) business, has unveiled enhancements to its SelfServ™ platform, an integrated Common Use Self Service (CUSS) solution designed to streamline both the passenger travel experience and airport operations. Integrating both check-in and bag drop, SelfServ empowers passengers to manage their own journey through Collins' new user-friendly kiosks. When combined with the SelfPass™ biometric identity solution, passengers can enroll their biometrics at the kiosk to enable secure and seamless processing at each touchpoint, from check-in and bag drop to security and boarding. As a common use offering, SelfServ enables airlines to share the same infrastructure, thereby reducing costs and improving space utilization within the airport. Carriers can also optimize their staffing by allowing a single agent to oversee multiple kiosks or bag drops, rather than dedicating an agent to each traditional desk. "What sets SelfServ apart from other solutions is its integration within a broader portfolio of self-service and biometric technology solutions, allowing passengers to navigate the airport with ease," said Nicole White, vice president and general manager of Connected Aviation at Collins Aerospace. "These lasted advancements represent a major step forward in our commitment to enhancing the passenger experience and helping airports and airlines meet the growing demand for more efficient operations and cost-effective travel solutions." Currently, more than 100 airlines are certified with the SelfServ platform, benefiting from its robust and scalable capabilities. Additionally, SelfServ is supported by a wide range of managed services offerings from Collins Aerospace, which help airports manage IT resources more effectively and mitigate associated risks. Collins is hosting demonstrations of its integrated self-service solutions and new kiosk at Passenger Terminal Expo in Madrid, Spain .

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Tuesday that it had fired warning shots after North Korean soldiers violated the military demarcation line before returning. "Our military conducted warning broadcasts and warning shots after about 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line (MDL) in the eastern area of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) around 5:00 pm local time," the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text message to reporters. "Our military is closely monitoring the North Korean military's activity and taking necessary measures according to the operational procedures," JCS said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Some of the North Korean soldiers were armed, according to the South Korean military. The crossing, however, may have been by a mistake during reconnaissance activity ahead of planned work in the area, the Yonhap News Agency reported, citing a military official. On Monday, the South's military said about 1,500 North Koreans were working on barbed wire installations and land work in the demilitarised zone, as the North was conducting military exercises. In June 2024, there were at least three incidents of North Korean soldiers crossing the line amid an uptick in activity near the demarcation line. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said on Friday the government would maintain a steadfast readiness posture against North Korea provocations, after the Constitutional Court ousted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

ENGLISH Mitsotakis Unveils Greece’s Defense Overhaul in Parliament, Focuses on Technology and Domestic Industry Credit: Giannis Panagopoulos/EUROKINISSI NEWSROOM IEFIMERIDA.GR 02/04/2025 08:57 Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is presenting the country’s long-term defense strategy and armament program to Parliament today, outlining a military transformation driven by technological advancements and modern warfare. Mr. Mitsotakis will emphasize two main pillars: strengthening national defense through ongoing and planned military procurements, and integrating cutting-edge technology into the armed forces. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ Key upgrades include drones, advanced radar systems, missile and anti-submarine defense, and the "Achilles Shield" anti-drone air defense system, a project involving collaboration with Israel. The second pillar focuses on cyber defense and modern cyber warfare tactics, drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine. The government plans to enhance military capabilities through collaborations with research institutions and Greek defense firms, fostering innovation and developing domestically produced weapons systems. A key principle of the revamped program is the active participation of Greece’s domestic defense industry. Mr. Mitsotakis is expected to declare that "no procurement will take place without Greek-made components or Greek workforce involvement." International defense contractors will be required to partner with local industries, including Hellenic Aerospace Industry, shipyards, and Greek Defense Systems. The government is reviewing a proposal from French defense giant Group Naval to establish a production line in Greece. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ Mr. Mitsotakis will also address internal party concerns following the initial exclusion of security forces from recent military salary increases. He is expected to outline a broader package of measures and explain the timing and rationale behind the pay raises announced by Defense Minister Nikos Dendias. He will stress the importance of defense and stability in Greece’s geopolitical strategy, while acknowledging the need for continued economic growth. While Mr. Mitsotakis will present the broad outlines of the defense program, classified details will be shared in a closed-door briefing for Parliament’s Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Mr. Dendias, in the coming weeks.

We use a lot of energy each and every day to power our modern lives. From the gasoline that fuels our cars to the natural gas that heats our homes to the electricity that runs our devices, we can't function in our modern society without energy. Our need for energy in the country is only growing. According to forecasts by IHS Outlook and McKinsey, U.S. power demand will surge 55% by 2040, fueled by AI data centers, the onshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification of everything, including transportation. This forecast bodes well for energy companies. As a leader in the sector, NextEra Energy ( NEE +1.17% ) is in a strong position to capitalize on the country's growing demand for electricity. That's one of the reasons why I wouldn't hesitate to buy this top energy stock in June. Image source: Getty Images. The quintessential energy stock NextEra Energy is a powerhouse in the energy sector. It operates the largest electric utility in the country -- Florida Power & Light (FPL). It also operates NextEra Energy Resources, a leading North American clean energy company. Together, these businesses make NextEra Energy the world's largest producer of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a global leader in battery storage. The company also operates the largest natural gas-fired fleet in the country and has a leading nuclear energy business. These features make NextEra Energy "the quintessential, 'all-forms-of-energy' company," commented CEO John Ketchum on the company's first-quarter earnings conference call. The company doesn't just operate leading energy businesses; it knows how to grow them. No one has built more renewable energy-generation capacity than NextEra Energy over the past couple of decades. It has also built more gas-fired generation than any other company in the past 20 years. NextEra's investments to grow its business have paid big dividends for shareholders. The company has grown its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at a 9% compound annual rate over the past 20 years. That has helped power a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its dividend during that period. The company's rising income and earnings have helped fuel market-crushing total returns for its shareholders (15.7% annualized versus 10.2% for the S&P 500 ). Expand NYSE : NEE NextEra Energy Today's Change ( 1.17 %) $ 0.99 Current Price $ 85.76 Key Data Points Market Cap $177B Day's Range $ 84.55 - $ 85.83 52wk Range $ 61.72 - $ 87.53 Volume 12M Avg Vol 10M Gross Margin 36.09 % Dividend Yield 0.03 % Powerful growth ahead NextEra Energy's leadership in all forms of energy puts it in a strong position to capture a meaningful share of the growth it sees ahead for power demand. The company estimates that the U.S. will need to add 450 gigawatts (GW) of new power generation capacity to the grid by 2030 to keep up with current demand forecasts. While it will require all forms of energy to meet this demand, renewable energy, especially solar energy , will do most of the heavy lifting because of its lower costs and ability for rapid deployment. That outlook bodes well for NextEra Energy, a leader in solar. FPL has installed over 7.9 GW of solar to capture Florida's abundance of sunshine and help meet the state's power needs. That's the largest utility-owned solar portfolio in the country. FPL plans to deploy more than 17 GW of solar and over 7.6 GW of battery storage in the next 10 years to meet the state's power needs. In addition, NextEra's energy-resources segment has 28 GW of renewable energy projects under development that it expects to bring online over the next few years. The company plans to invest a staggering $120 billion over the next four years into maintaining and expanding America's energy infrastructure. This investment should power adjusted EPS growth at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2027. That should give the company the power to continue growing its dividend (which at an over 3% yield is more than double the S&P 500's -1.5% yield) by around 10% annually through at least next year. Given the expected surge in power demand, the company should have ample opportunities to continue growing at a strong rate well beyond that time frame. Leading the charge NextEra Energy is a leader in the U.S. energy sector. That puts it in a strong position to capitalize on the expected surge in power demand over the nex t couple of decades. The company has an exceptional record of investing money to grow its business in a way that generates strong returns for shareholders. Because of that, I wouldn't hesitate to buy shares of this top energy stock in June.

Title: What Corporate Media Isnt Telling You About Trump Cuts To Decades - Old Energy Efficiency Program

Ireland Owens Reporter May 09, 2025 3:10 PM ET May 09, 2025 3:10 PM ET Ireland Owens Reporter Font Size: As corporate media outlets race to cast the Trump administration’s termination of an energy savings program as a net loss for Americans, experts note that the coverage omits several inconvenient facts. Several news outlets have recently reported that the administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to eliminate the Energy Star program, while seeming to gloss over criticism of the program and the fact it received multiple unsatisfactory reports from federal government audits. While Energy Star has reportedly saved American households and businesses over $500 billion in energy costs since 1992, some experts have warned that the program can negatively impact consumers, such as by pushing them to purchase less effective appliances. “I guess the nicest thing I can say about the Energy Star program is that it’s not as bad as the energy efficiency regulations, because those are mandatory,” Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow who specializes in environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But, the Energy Star label is at least supposedly voluntary, you don’t have to buy the Energy Star model, but that information is there if you want to.” “That being said, I think the program has been misused in a variety of ways,” Lieberman added. “Environmental groups tend to pressure the big retailers to only carry Energy Star products, a lot of the tax credits that the government extends for [home] appliances only apply to the energy efficient or Energy Star models. So, it’s not as voluntary as it is made out to be … There’s also concerns that they’re trying to use the Energy Star program to pursue a climate agenda.” (RELATED: ‘Got To Go’: DOE To Cut Off Billions Of Dollars’ Worth Of Biden-Era Green Energy Projects) “I would not be sad to see the [Energy Star] program go,” Lieberman told the DCNF. The EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE) launched Energy Star in 1992. The program was created to help consumers and businesses “save money and protect the environment through the adoption of energy-efficient products and practices,” according to the DOE’s website. A March 2010 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that Energy Star was “ vulnerable to fraud and abuse.” GAO’s report also found that the Energy Star program’s controls that were in place at the time did not ensure that products actually met efficiency guidelines. “Just the same as we choose many products without a government rating, we can choose our iPhones without a government rating, we can choose our lawnmowers without a government rating,” Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate and Environment, told the DCNF. “Think about all the appliances we buy every day that do not have a government rating … we do not need a government rating to be able to choose lower-energy use appliances if this is what we want.” GAO noted in its report that it created a variety of “bogus” products to covertly test if it could obtain Energy Star certifications for them. GAO reported it was able to acquire Energy Star certifications for 15 of the fake products, including a gas-powered alarm clock, while two of the “bogus” products were rejected by the program and three did not receive a response. “A big part of that that people should understand is if you look at the term ‘energy efficiency,’ the Energy Star program and the DOE’s standards are all about what they said was energy efficiency,” John Kennerly Davis Jr., a senior attorney and former deputy attorney general for the Commonwealth of Virginia, told the DCNF. “If you have to run an energy-efficient dishwasher twice to get the job done, then that’s not efficient.” “By artificially imposing on the market these products that ‘yeah this dishwasher is more efficient but you have to run it twice,’ that’s the fatal conceptual flaw that people need to understand,” Davis Jr. added. “Energy efficiency is not task efficiency, and that’s why getting rid of this whole program is a very good thing for efficiency.” MARIN CITY, CA – MARCH 26: An Energy Star label is displayed on a brand new refrigerator at a Best Buy store March 26, 2010 in Marin City, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Moreover, an October 2009 audit from the DOE’s Office of the Inspector General found that “officials had not … d eveloped a formal quality assurance program” to help ensure that product specifications for Energy Star were adhered to. The audit report stated that the DOE had not “effectively monitored” the use of the Energy Star label to “ensure that only qualifying products were labeled as compliant.” “In our judgment, the delay in the Department’s planned improvements in its management of the ENERGY STAR Program could reduce consumer confidence in the integrity of the ENERGY STAR label,” the report states. “Such loss of credibility could reduce energy savings, increase consumer risk, and diminish the value of the recent infusion of $300 million for ENERGY STAR rebates under the Recovery Act.” An August 2007 report from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General found that there was “little oversight” in using the Energy Star label on products in retail stores. “We found little oversight in using the ENERGY STAR label in retail stores, which is commonly the purchase point for the consumer,” according to the report. “[The] EPA could not provide documentation related to follow-up actions taken, final results for all retail store assessments, or the resolution status of label inconsistencies. We also found that manufacturers may label and sell products as ENERGY STAR qualified prior to submitting test results to the Agency. Using the label on products that do not meet ENERGY STAR requirements may weaken the value of the label and negatively impact the ENERGY STAR program.” Similarly, a separate report from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General published in 2009 found that the “performance results” of Energy Star and non-Energy Star products “call into question the assumptions used to calculate energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions attributed to this program.” Moreover, a 2010 report from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General found that the agency’s implementation of the Energy Star program was “inconsistent with the program’s authorized purpose” of achieving “environmental benefits by identifying and promoting energy-efficient products and practices that meet the highest energy conservation standards.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE — GOP Rep Unveils Bill To Block Future Presidents From Launching An ‘Assault On Domestic Energy’) “We believe the ENERGY STAR program has sought to maximize the number of qualified products available at the expense of identifying products and practices that maximize energy efficiency,” the report states. President Donald Trump has notably prioritized overturning a variety of energy regulations during his second term, as part of his “ unleashing American energy ” agenda. A source familiar with the program told the DCNF that Energy Star “is a non-statutory program the private sector can effectuate without taxpayer resources. The U.S. Department of Energy already regulates many of the sources covered by the EnergyStar program which leads to confusion among consumers. If companies falsely advertise their products, then they can be subject to penalties from other regulators further proving that a ‘government seal of approval’ is unnecessary.” “With respect to all voluntary programs, companies do not need a federal government ribbon at the cost of taxpayers so that they can more easily sell products to consumers,” the source told the DCNF, adding that the cost of the product relative to potential savings over time does not need certification from the federal government.

Energy firms pay out £7million to 34,000 customers after major billing error Energy regulator Ofgem has found more than 34,000 customers were affected between January 2019 and September 2024 Comments Money Levi Winchester Money Editor 08:38, 09 May 2025 Updated 11:50, 09 May 2025 View Image Energy bills went up again last April (Image: Getty Images) Thousands of energy customers have been paid £7million in compensation and refunds after they were accidentally overcharged. ‌ Ofgem has found more than 34,000 customers were affected between January 2019 and September 2024. The issue relates to customers with Restricted Meter Infrastructure, which means they have more than one electricity meter point. ‌ Energy suppliers are allowed to apply multiple standing charges for homes with multiple electricity meters. However, this meant some customers were incorrectly charged more than is allowed under the price cap when combined with unit rates. ‌ A total of ten suppliers have updated their systems and compensated customers as a result of the Ofgem review. This includes £5.6million in refunds and almost £1.4million in goodwill payments. You can see a table of all the firms affected below. Charlotte Friel, director of retail pricing and systems at Ofgem, said: “Our duty is to protect energy consumers, and we set the price cap for that very reason so customers don’t pay a higher amount for their energy than they should. ‌ “We expect all suppliers to have robust processes in place so they can bill their customers accurately. While it’s clear that on this occasion errors were made, thankfully, the issues were promptly resolved, and customers are being refunded. “Today’s outcome serves as a reminder to all energy suppliers that they must implement the price cap properly and do their due diligence. “ It also shows that, where appropriate, Ofgem is prepared to work with suppliers that fail to comply with our rules.” ‌ It comes after the Ofgem price cap rose to £1,849 a year for the average dual fuel household paying by direct debit. Energy analysts at Cornwall Insight are predicting it could fall to £1,683 in July. Ofgem will announce its new energy price cap by May 27. This new rate will come into force from July 1 and will run for three months, until August 31. Despite what its name suggests, the Ofgem price cap does not put a limit on how much you can pay for energy - instead, it sets the maximum unit price you can be charged for gas and electricity, as well as the maximum daily standing charge. ‌ £7million awarded after energy bill failures The table below shows the energy firms that have compensated customers, the number of customers affected, then the total amount paid in refunds and goodwill payments. E.ON Next - 160 customers; £45,195.82 in refunds; £9,330.33 in goodwill payments Ecotricity - 166 customers; £36,633.12 in refunds; £18,904.35 in goodwill payments EDF Energy - 3 customers; £112.29 in refunds; £30 in goodwill payments Octopus Energy - 20,862 customers; £2,636,884 in refunds; £546,278 in goodwill payments Outfox The Market - 570 customers; £6,106.06 in refunds; £4,590 in goodwill payments OVO Energy - 2,372 customers; £602,066.05 in refunds; £280,068.73 in goodwill payments Rebel Energy - 15 customers; £2,339.49 in refunds; £575 in goodwill payments So Energy - 1,558 customers; £266,041.16 in refunds; £58,285.85 in goodwill payments Tru Energy - 70 customers; £7,486.54 in refunds; £11,663 in goodwill payments Utility Warehouse - 8,272 customers; £2,043,098.84 in refunds; £453,960 in goodwill payments Rare deal sees dehumidifier plummet Cosy electric blanket costs 1p to use Nab a free cardigan with special offer Robot vacuum at lowest ever price Article continues below READ MORE : How to bag free Aldi skincare and makeup before it hits the shelves

Photograph: Kara Solar This article is more than 6 months old ‘A future on our terms’: how community energy is lighting up Latin America This article is more than 6 months old Small-scale schemes are replacing dirty diesel with clean electricity in remote areas – and ensuring a just transition W hen the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, Roxana Borda Mamani had to leave Mexico, where she was studying for her degree in rural development and food security, and return to her remote village in the Peruvian Amazon. At the time, the Indigenous community in Alto Mishagua had neither an internet connection nor a reliable energy source. “How am I going to study?” Borda asked. “With energy from the sun,” replied her friend, a fellow member of the Latin American Observatory for Energy Geopolitics at the Brazil-based Federal University of Latin American Integration (Unila). View image in fullscreen Roxana Borda Mamani, who brought solar energy to Alto Mishagua in Peru. Photograph: Mariana Abdalla/350.org Borda began researching the components of an off-grid solar energy system: photovoltaic (PV) panels, a battery, an inverter and a charge controller. Five years later, her community has a 400W solar system powering a 24-hour satellite internet connection and charging points for phones and torches next to a small school that was set up thanks to the new energy source. A second phase, due to be implemented this year, will equip households with PV panels, providing the community’s 50 families with regular electricity access and ending their reliance on expensive and polluting diesel generators. The initiative was developed by Borda and five other students at the Energy Observatory, with the community’s backing, support from the Canadian energy-access charity Light Up the World , and grants. “Our idea was to be independent [and] promote the autonomy and self-management of the energy and communication systems,” says Borda. The project is called Aylluq Q’Anchaynin, which means “the energy of the community” in her native Quechua. More than 16 million people do not have access to electricity in Latin America and the Caribbean – despite often living in the shadow of fossil-fuel extraction projects, as in parts of the Amazon. Community-driven clean energy systems, such as Borda’s, sometimes called “energy communities” , are a way to tackle the region’s energy poverty and insecurity while also contributing to a just energy transition that puts people first.

Photograph: Roxana Borda Mamani Ilan Zugman, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at 350.org , an international environmental organisation, says: “The beauty of these community-based projects is that they truly offer social and economic transformation with a much smaller environmental impact than a fossil fuel or large-scale renewable energy project.” Alejandra Bernal, clean energy transition officer for Latin America at the International Energy Agency (IEA), says the region is well placed for energy communities to grow thanks to laws on self-generation of electricity and decentralised energy being the best solution for connecting isolated areas. Last year, 65% of Latin America and the Caribbean’s electricity was powered by clean energy, of which 17% was wind and solar – above the global average of 41% and 15% respectively, according to the energy thinktank Ember . Although solar-generated distributed energy (produced outside the primary grid) is growing fast, particularly in Brazil , “the majority of this renewable energy being added comes from massive wind and solar farms”, says Zugman.

F rom the Chiloé archipelago in southern Chile to La Guajira on Colombia’s northern coast, via Brazil’s arid north-east, large-scale wind and solar projects have been criticised for failing to consult or benefit local communities while causing harmful social and environmental effects. Zairybeth Velásquez, an Indigenous Wayúu leader from La Guajira, where Colombia’s efforts to develop the renewables sector are focused, says: “ My people have resisted, maintaining our customs despite all the development around us, like coalmining, salt extraction, fossil gas – and now wind and solar.

Photograph: Constance Malleret/350.org According to the IEA’s Bernal, the energy transition cannot be limited to technological change. Community-based power generation “should be one of the solutions … to advance the energy transition”, she says, adding that public policies are required that address how these local systems fit into national energy planning. Zugman says governments and financial institutions should step up to improve these projects’ visibility and capacity for expansion. Colombia has the region’s most advanced framework for empowering communities to adopt decentralised clean energy: the Comunidades Energéticas programme, launched by President Gustavo Petro in 2023 in an effort to create 20,000 energy communities allowing people to generate, use and sell energy from non-conventional renewable sources. In Chocó, Colombia’s poorest department on the Pacific coast, 24 PV panels now power the classrooms and canteen of La Loma agricultural college in Bojayá, benefiting 240 students. “It completely transformed the community, especially the education community,” says Ludys Mena, 52, the college’s director. Mena, who grew up using polluting paraffin lanterns, now wishes this solar system could be expanded beyond the school to the entire community, highlighting the programme’s limitations. Implementation has also been a problem – as of last December, fewer than 150 energy communities were up and running out of 18,000 applications. A campaign led by 350.org in April this year brought together nearly 300 climate activists and community leaders from 70 countries in Brasília to share experiences around energy transition. The NGO is pushing for the just energy transition to be on the agenda at Cop30, the climate summit hosted by Brazil in the Amazonian city of Belém in November.

Bernal says: “Cop30 could be an excellent scenario to discuss greater engagement of communities in energy planning.” Wind resistance: can Colombia overcome opposition to get its green energy plan back on track?

In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Indigenous Achuar people decided they wanted solar power after consulting their elders and communal guayusa tea ceremonies. They have developed solar-powered boats that glide silently down the Capahuari River, learned how to operate and maintain them, and improved local education and their community tourism work thanks to solar panels being set up in 10 different communities. This has also helped strengthen Achuar communities’ resistance to oil drilling on their land, says Nantu Canelos, director of the Kara Solar Foundation . “We’re building a future on our own terms.” Explore more on these topics Renewable energy Southern frontlines: Latin America and the Caribbean Energy Indigenous peoples Amazon rainforest Cop30 Americas Solar power features Share Reuse this content

Labour Party explains how it will cut £300 a year from UK energy bills The Labour Party repeatedly made the pledge during its General Election campaign last year Comments Features Nicholas Dawson 04:00, 08 May 2025 Updated 08:30, 08 May 2025 View 3 Images Labour has pledged to cut energy bills by £300 a year (Image: Getty) Labour has shed more light on its ambitious plan to slash energy bills by £300 annually by 2030. The party repeatedly touted this promise during its General Election campaign last year, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reaffirmed the commitment since taking office. ‌ SNP MP Seamus Logan queried the Government in Parliament about from what level the Government plans to bring down energy bills £300 when the change is achieved. Energy minister Miatta Fahnbulleh responded, saying: "The Government believes that our mission to deliver clean power by 2030 is the best way to break our dependence on global fossil fuel markets and protect billpayers permanently. ‌ "The creation of Great British Energy will help us to harness clean energy and have less reliance on volatile international energy markets and help in our commitment to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030. This, combined with our Warm Homes Plan to upgrade millions of homes to make them warmer and cheaper to run is how we will drive down energy bills and make cold homes a thing of the past." ‌ The Warm Homes Plan includes additional funding for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which offers grants to support the transition from fossil fuel heating systems to heat pumps or biomass boilers. Through this scheme, households can receive £7,500 towards an air source heat pump, £7,500 towards a ground source heat pump, or £5,000 towards a biomass boiler. View 3 Images Energy bills have soared over recent years (Image: Getty) Government figures indicate that switching to a heat pump could save families about £100 annually on energy bills in contrast to using a gas boiler, while insulating a home could result in even greater savings of roughly £200 a year. ‌ Ms Fahnbulleh further explained the Government’s strategy, saying: "We recognise that we need to support households struggling with bills whilst we transition to clean power by 2030. This is why we are delivering the Warm Home Discount to around 3 million eligible low-income households this winter. "On February 25, we published a consultation on the expansion of the Warm Home Discount, giving more eligible households £150 off their energy bills. These proposals would bring around 2.7 million households into the scheme – pushing the total number of households that would receive the discount next winter up to around 6 million. "The consultation has now closed and the Department is evaluating the responses." The Warm Homes Discount offers a one-off £150 deduction from your electricity bill. Those who qualify include people on the Guarantee Credit portion of Pension Credit as well as those on a low income or who are receiving certain means-tested benefits. ‌ View 3 Images Prime Minister Keir Starmer, pictured with Chancellor Rachel Reeves, made the pledge during the election campaign (Image: Getty) Ministers are considering broadening the scope of the discount to include everyone on means-tested benefits. Most of the time, eligible suppliers will automatically deduct the discount from your bill — the funds aren't transferred directly to you.

On Friday, President Donald Trump released his budget proposal , which included targeted cuts to federal clean energy programs and ending funding to what the president calls " the Green New Scam ." The Trump administration is now shifting its focus to energy efficiency programs. CNN reported Tuesday that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to shutter the Energy Star program. First launched under President George H.W. Bush in 1992, Energy Star sets voluntary energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings. Products that meet the program's standards are allowed to display the Energy Star label, which is recognized by 90 percent of American households, according to the program's website. The program also helps homeowners utilize federal energy efficiency tax credits. Energy Star says it has saved consumers more than $500 billion in energy costs since 1992, with $42 billion saved in 2020 alone. The use of Energy Star products has also prevented 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from entering the atmosphere, according to the EPA. The EPA says the estimated annual market value of Energy Star product sales is $100 billion. While the EPA has not confirmed that it will ax Energy Star, industry groups are lobbying the agency to keep the program intact. "Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration's promise to reduce household energy costs," Paula Glover, president of Alliance to Save Energy (a nonprofit that has lobbied to keep Energy Star in the past), told CNN. A coalition of appliance manufacturers and HVAC and boiler companies sent a letter to the EPA saying that eliminating the program "will not serve the American people," reports NOTUS . This is not the first time that Trump has proposed ending the popular program. In 2017, the president floated cutting Energy Star but the plan was halted after more than 1,000 organizations implored Congress to protect the program . Despite having a relatively small budget—the program costs about $50 million per year and represents less than 1 percent of the EPA's spending —and being one of the "most innocuous" government programs, there are reasons to reconsider Energy Star, Nick Loris, vice president of public policy at the free market energy think tank C3 Solutions, tells Reason . "In an age of information and where the cost of getting that information is pretty low, consumers readily have access to the many different attributes they value in the product. And the product manufacturers can still advertise the energy savings from their products" without a federal program, says Loris. A March white paper from the Competitive Enterprise Institute on modernizing the EPA says "green purchasing programs" like Energy Star "assume the federal government needs to meddle in the marketplace by providing its seal of approval on what it deems to be environmentally satisfactory products." The paper continues, arguing, "If consumers demand certain information, then businesses will respond by disseminating this information to them." If a labeling system is needed, "then private certification organizations should play such a role." The Cato Institute, meanwhile, has called Energy Star "a very coarse piece of energy information that may crowd out efforts" to develop more accurate ways to measure energy operating costs. Despite the benefits that Energy Star has provided to consumers and the environment, the program is yet another example of the government doing a job that the private sector could do better. Cutting the program may not substantially reduce federal spending, but it would reduce federal creep in consumer choices.

Our communities know better than most what it means to build, innovate and power our lives in some of the earth’s harshest and most challenging conditions. Energy development in Alaska isn’t just about economics — it‘s about survival, our success and a prosperous future. Right now, decisions are being made in Washington, D.C. that will shape Alaska’s energy future and security for generations to come. Alaska’s energy landscape is unique. We are a young state that is poor in electrical energy infrastructure. We don’t have the luxury of plugging into a national grid or importing cheap energy from neighboring states. We produce what we consume and fully utilize what we develop. In many rural and coastal communities, the most cost-effective path forward is clean, local, renewable energy produced in Alaska. This is a bicameral, bi-partisan, state, federal and local “yes” issue we can all agree on. In Alaska, energy development is a shared common and solid ground combined with a universal commitment to powering our communities, growing our economy, supporting jobs, creating prosperity and securing our future. Maintaining a stable, predictable federal energy policy and credits is essential to keeping our progress and prosperity on track. In our state, energy policy isn’t theoretical. It‘s pragmatic and practical. It‘s the difference between affordable power and energy poverty. It‘s the difference between opportunity and prosperity or stagnation. Across Alaska, federal investments through programs like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have helped our communities pursue innovative energy solutions — from hydropower to geothermal to emerging tidal energy projects. These aren’t distant technologies — they are energy systems already lowering energy costs and creating jobs in some of the most remote parts of the country. However, continuing this progress and working towards a brighter energy future requires diligence. As Congress considers changes to the tax code that could eliminate key energy credits, it is essential that our leaders protect Alaska’s energy and transmission development. These credits have been vital to projects that lower energy costs and expand access to sustainable infrastructure across the state. ADVERTISEMENT Repealing or significantly altering these incentives would create uncertainty for ongoing efforts and could jeopardize critical funding streams that organizations like the Alaska Energy Authority, local utilities and energy developers depend on. Without these resources, progress on affordable, long-term energy solutions for Alaska’s communities is at risk. Sens. Murkowski and Sullivan have long understood this reality and have introduced, passed and secured several pieces of energy legislation to help Alaska. Their leadership has been essential in ensuring that Alaska’s voice is heard and felt in Washington. Rep. Begich has joined this effort and recently supported similar energy legislation, working with our delegation. Gov. Dunleavy and his administration are unwavering in their commitment to lower the cost of energy. Progress is being made. But our work is not finished, and we require an Alaskan brand of tenacity to complete what we have started. Now is the time to unleash Alaska’s energy resources and double down on policies that incentivize energy innovation, support infrastructure and reduce energy costs for our economy to help us achieve energy and national security. Alaska has the resources, the tenacity, the expertise and the sheer will to lead in clean energy development. We need smart, stable federal policy to help Alaska help America make it happen. Preserving and expanding energy tax credits for Alaska’s energy resources will help ensure that both Alaska and America are energy secure.

Opinion - Trump can put geothermal in a position to power America’s future The Trump administration is getting it right when it comes to the importance of American energy dominance and bolstering domestic energy production. And, with its National Energy Emergency executive order, geothermal energy is getting the attention it deserves. That’s why we, as conservatives, are united behind an “all-of-the-above-and-below” energy approach. Utilizing the full range of energy options we have here at home will bolster American energy manufacturing, creating economic boosts in communities across the country and strengthening our national security. Geothermal energy is a small but mighty part of our nation’s energy mix. In 2023, this unique energy source generated only 3.9 gigawatts (GW) of electricity onto America’s electric grid — just 0.4 percent of our total electricity. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This underutilized technology taps into heat stored in the earth to generate electricity or provide heating and cooling for a variety of applications. Geothermal energy is reliable, resilient and affordable nearly 100 percent of the time. Traditionally, these technologies are only useful in areas with easily accessible heat resources, such as those in the American West or in Iceland. However, by adopting innovations from the oil and gas industry — such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling — geothermal hot spots are much more accessible. Some estimates suggest that these innovations could eventually unlock up to 5,000 GW of energy right here in the U.S. That’s more than four times the capacity of all current U.S. power plants combined. Today, geothermal energy’s benefits are already making a difference for many Americans, especially in Texas. Since 2010, almost every school in Denton Independent School District has used geothermal cooling systems to improve air conditioning efficiency, lowering energy costs in the hot Texas summer. That’s making high-quality education more of a reality for students. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The military also sees value in geothermal energy. Last September, the U.S. Air Force signed a deal with Sage Geosystems, a Houston-based startup company, to construct a demonstration project that utilizes geothermal energy for energy storage in Starr County, Texas. If successful, the Air Force may develop a full-scale project at Ellington Field Joint Air Reserve Base in Houston, providing the reliable energy needed for America’s military installations. Although geothermal energy is on the cusp of significant growth, it is not widely known by the public. That makes our mission simple: educating Americans about the untapped potential of this critical resource, promoting policies that unlock American resources and combatting policies that reduce investments into domestic energy research, development and deployment. Last month, CRES Forum and Project Innerspace co-hosted an event on Capitol Hill to do just that. The event, which was open to the public, brought together industry leaders, policymakers, advocates and academics to highlight the opportunity presented by advanced geothermal technologies. During the event, we shared our strong support for geothermal energy and provided a conservative case for the technology. We were also joined by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Rep. August Pfluger (another Texan) and Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), who all voiced strong support as well. But talk is cheap, and securing federal support that incentivizes private investment is not an easy task. That’s why we pledge to work with the president and Congress to enact meaningful policies that lower energy prices, promote domestic energy production and achieve energy dominance. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement And with new, private investments into geothermal projects exceeding $1 billion since September 2022, we have a leg up to advance President Trump’s robust energy agenda. Not to mention, this will benefit Americans nationwide, from our hometowns of Virginia Beach, Va., to Friendswood, Texas, and beyond. Now, with renewed conservative leadership in the White House, American energy dominance isn’t just possible, it’s inevitable. But we must play our cards right. Advancing federal energy policy using an “all-of-the-above-and-below” approach will allow us to bolster domestic energy production, curb our reliance on foreign entities, lower energy costs and create good paying jobs nationwide. And a kicker for those skeptical? We can utilize geothermal with essentially no emissions. Sounds like a win-win.

For years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Energy Star program has helped consumers save a collective $40 billion in annual energy costs. Now, the Trump administration wants to wind it down, according to a report from CNN. The Energy Star program, which has a budget of $32 million, is a public-private partnership that works with appliance and electronics manufacturers to certify energy-efficient products while also helping consumers find rebates to lower the purchase cost. “Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, said in a statement. The program delivers a 350-to-one return on investment, she added. Energy Star was created in 1992 under President George H. W. Bush, and it was reauthorized in 2005 under President George W. Bush, placing oversight for the program under the EPA and the Department of Energy. The program’s signature yellow labels appear on appliances and electronics for sale throughout the U.S., informing consumers of how much they’ll spend on electricity or natural gas throughout a year of typical use. Energy Star saves the average U.S. household about $450 on their energy bills each year.

PHOENIX (AZFamily) — A popular program that helps people save money on their utility bills may be going away. The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate the Energy Star program. The bright yellow cards used when shopping for appliances have played a big part in consumers’ shopping decisions for more than 30 years. Real estate agent Kathy Chance said she likes to know how energy efficient an appliance is and which can save her the most money. “It absolutely matters to me,” said Chance. “I’m looking to save dollars any way I can, so energy efficiency is one those areas I’m very concerned about.” The Energy Star program began in 1992, during the first Bush administration, as a way to help the public find products, incentives and tax credits that would lower their electric bills. According to the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy , Energy Star helps American families save $40 billion in annual energy costs, but that may not be enough to save the program. The Trump administration is set to eliminate Energy Star as part of its push to reduce the size of federal agencies. Alliance to Save Energy president Paula Glover told CNN that “eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs.” Still, not everyone is convinced doing away with Energy Star is a big deal. Rick Biederbeck, CEO of Spencer’s TV and Appliance , told Arizona’s Family that appliances are far more energy efficient than 20 years ago, so there’s not much difference in savings between an Energy Star appliance and a non-Energy Star unit. He explained that even if Energy Star disappears, consumers will still be able to see an appliance’s efficiency information. “They won’t notice very much, because everything in your home, Energy Star versus no Energy Star, you might spend about $4 to $5 a month more to operate a non energy star home vs energy star, there’s very little difference,” said Biederbeck. There has been no announcement about when the Energy Star program would end. See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it .

Article Content:
... By Kate Nalepinski Audience Growth Strategist Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member The Trump administration is poised to eliminate the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star program , a measure that would reverberate through millions of U.S. households and businesses that rely on it for energy efficiency guidance and tax benefits. The Washington Post reported the cuts on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the move. Officials in President Donald Trump 's administration announced during a meeting on Monday at the EPA's Office of Atmospheric Protection that the office would be dissolved and the Energy Star program discontinued. Energy Star, known for its blue label and yellow EnergyGuide sticker found on appliances and homes, certifies products and buildings that meet certain energy-efficiency standards. Since its inception in 1992, the program has helped consumers save energy and money on utility bills, per the Energy Star website . ... Newsweek has contacted the EPA and Energy Star for comment on Tuesday. What Is the Energy Star Program? First launched by the EPA, the Energy Star program identifies and promotes energy-efficient products and practices. Goods from refrigerators to air conditioners, as well as entire buildings and homes, can receive the Energy Star label when they meet energy efficiency benchmarks. According to the Department of Energy , in 2010, Americans saved nearly $18 billion on utility bills by way of the program. Trump first suggested canceling or privatizing Energy Star in his first term. How Does Energy Star Work? First, Energy Star creates guidelines. From there, manufacturers voluntarily submit products for certification to earn the Energy Star label. Products must meet energy performance guidelines established by the EPA, and third-party certification is involved to ensure credibility of the label. According to Energy Star, thousands of manufacturers and retailers have partnered with the EPA to sell these products. How Could Energy Star Affect Tax Credits? Beyond savings on energy bills, the Energy Star program ties directly into federal tax credits, which many homeowners use to offset costs of upgrading to energy-efficient equipment. As it stands now, through 2032, federal income tax credits are available to homeowners that allow up to $3,200 annually, to lower the cost of energy efficient home upgrades by up to 30 percent, according to Energy Star's tax credit page . Through the program, some homeowners can save $2,000 on costs just to upgrade air source heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves and boilers to eco-friendly options. Consumers can also claim credits for other Energy Star-certified systems, including insulation, windows and solar energy systems. These credits were expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 . Paula Glover, president of nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN : "Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration's promise to reduce household energy costs." Glover continued: "For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That's a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested." A portion of the Inflation Reduction Act does reference Energy Star requirements in defining eligible improvements. But it's unclear how federal tax credits under the act would change if the program gets cut. If the program is axed, it's possible that consumers who opted for eco-friendly appliances could be denied tax benefits for which they may have budgeted. If Energy Star is eliminated before the end of the 2025 tax year, homeowners who purchase upgrades in anticipation of tax credits could also face challenges down the line.

Over 70% of businesses plan to increase focus on electrification, emissions, and energy costs over the next three years 66% are concerned about accessing the reliable energy needed to grow 64% of businesses say rising and unstable energy costs are impacting profitability and competitiveness LONDON , May 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A surge in business energy demand is reshaping the global energy landscape — and pushing energy providers to rethink how they support growth and deliver value. According to new EY research, two-thirds of businesses are concerned about accessing the reliable energy needed to grow, while 64% say that rising and unstable energy costs are already impacting their profitability and competitiveness. With energy now seen as a critical enabler of growth — not just an operational cost — this volatility is creating significant uncertainty for businesses across sectors. The findings are part of the latest EY Navigating the Energy Transition research program , which this year surveyed over 2,400 decision-makers at large to mid-sized businesses across eight global markets. The research highlights the urgent need for providers to reinvent the business energy experience, as electricity demand is expected to double by 2050, with businesses expected to drive three-quarters of this growth. Greg Guthridge , EY Global Industrials & Energy Customer Experience Transformation Leader, says: "This isn't just about keeping the lights on. Successfully navigating accelerating business energy growth will drive energy prosperity and fuel the intelligent economies of the future." Businesses want growth and green — not one or the other The research reveals that more than 70% of businesses plan to increase their focus on electrification, emissions reduction, and energy cost management in the next three years. However, outdated technologies, siloed operations, and limited sector-specific expertise have left many frustrated with their providers — and ready to look elsewhere. The pressure to deliver access to sustainable energy is also intensifying. 70% of businesses plan to invest in on-site generation and battery storage, seeking greater self-sufficiency and control. At the same time, sustainability remains a priority — but not at the expense of growth. Businesses are clear: they expect tailored solutions that support both, and if their energy provider can't deliver, they'll find one who can or take matters into their own hands. Serge Colle , EY Global Power & Utilities Leader, says: "Energy is no longer just a commodity, it's a competitive asset — and providers that offer the right mix of expertise, insight, and collaboration will be the ones that help businesses unlock long-term value." Energy strategy is now a business strategy According to the research, 71% of businesses have defined energy strategies, and most are actively looking to build, buy, or partner to strengthen energy capabilities. However, 42% say they want their energy providers to act as energy advocates — not just suppliers. Only a third are currently open to providers taking on more advanced roles such as platform orchestrators or solution providers, pointing to a critical gap in perception and positioning. As demand rises and expectations shift, the message from business is clear: providers must move fast to transform the energy experience. This includes delivering more intelligent, tailored solutions and digital tools — including artificial intelligence, which 71% of businesses want integrated into their energy interactions. Guthridge says: "The stakes are high. But so is the opportunity. Providers that act now — by engaging with business customers in new ways and rethinking their role in the energy ecosystem — will not only unlock new growth, but help shape a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous energy future." EY outlines six actions to turn soaring energy demand into lasting prosperity for providers to consider. Find out more here.

At the same time, sustainability remains a priority - but not at the expense of growth. Businesses are clear: they expect tailored solutions that support both, and if their energy provider can't deliver, they'll find one who can or take matters into their own hands. Serge Colle, EY Global Power & Utilities Leader, says: "Energy is no longer just a commodity, it's a competitive asset - and providers that offer the right mix of expertise, insight, and collaboration will be the ones that help businesses unlock long-term value." Energy strategy is now a business strategy According to the research, 71% of businesses have defined energy strategies, and most are actively looking to build, buy, or partner to strengthen energy capabilities. However, 42% say they want their energy providers to act as energy advocates - not just suppliers. Only a third are currently open to providers taking on more advanced roles such as platform orchestrators or solution providers, pointing to a critical gap in perception and positioning. As demand rises and expectations shift, the message from business is clear: providers must move fast to transform the energy experience. This includes delivering more intelligent, tailored solutions and digital tools - including artificial intelligence, which 71% of businesses want integrated into their energy interactions. Guthridge says: "The stakes are high. But so is the opportunity. Providers that act now - by engaging with business customers in new ways and rethinking their role in the energy ecosystem - will not only unlock new growth, but help shape a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous energy future." EY outlines six actions to turn soaring energy demand into lasting prosperity for providers to consider. Find out more here.

Search HOME CHINA WORLD BUSINESS LIFESTYLE CULTURE TRAVEL VIDEO SPORTS OPINION REGIONAL NEWSPAPER MOBILE Global Edition ASIA 中文 双语 Français HOME CHINA WORLD BUSINESS LIFESTYLE CULTURE TRAVEL VIDEO SPORTS OPINION REGIONAL NEWSPAPER China Daily PDF China Daily E-paper MOBILE Business Macro Companies Industries Technology Motoring China Data Finance Top 10 Home / Business / Industries Home Business Industries Steps to boost private energy economy By ZHENG XIN | China Daily | Updated: 2025-05-06 10:05 Share Share - WeChat CLOSE The National Energy Administration released new measures recently aimed at significantly accelerating private sector investment and participation across the energy sector, including major projects like nuclear power, oil and gas infrastructure. The measures are designed to promote quick development of the private energy economy and guide it to become larger, better, and stronger in advancing the green and low-carbon energy transition and building a new energy system, the NEA said. Under the guidelines, private enterprises will be supported to take stakes in nuclear power projects and invest in major energy projects such as hydropower, oil and gas storage facilities, and oil and gas pipelines. Xu Xin, deputy director of the NEA's department of legal and institutional reform, said the administration will further support private investment in energy infrastructure, including innovative technologies and models such as new energy storage, virtual power plants, charging infrastructure, and smart microgrids. She added that the NEA encourages innovation, supporting deep private sector involvement in major energy technology innovation, collaborative research and results sharing. The measures also back digital and intelligent upgrades for private firms, the development of "AI+"applications, and the cultivation of advanced technologies and business models for energy equipment recycling, Xu said during a news conference in Beijing. This policy underscores Beijing's intent to leverage private sector dynamism and funding to accelerate the energy transition and boost innovation in areas like storage and smart grids, according to industry experts. The move could unlock substantial new investment and introduce greater market efficiency into China's vast energy landscape, said Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University. The State Council approved recently the construction of 10 new reactors with a combined investment exceeding 200 billion yuan ($27.4 billion), including Phase III of the Sanmen Nuclear Power Plant in East China's Zhejiang province, introducing private enterprises with shareholdings exceeding 10 percent. This represents a notable increase from earlier instances of private participation in nuclear projects, such as the Zhejiang San'ao nuclear power projects approved in 2020, where the private enterprise took a 2 percent stake. Nuclear power has historically been dominated by State-owned enterprises due to its strategic importance and high entry barriers and the increase in private sector stakeholding to 10 percent in recently approved projects marks a significant policy shift aimed at attracting private capital and accelerating development in this strategic sector. In China, private companies are already major players in certain energy sub-sectors after years of development. In the charging infrastructure market, for example, private enterprises accounted for over 80 percent of large operators (those managing over 10,000 charging units) by the end of 2024, according to the NEA. Zhu Gongshan, chairman of GCL(Group) Holdings Co Ltd, China's largest private power conglomerate, said the involvement of private firms is expected to spur greater technological advancement and operational efficiency in the energy sector, leading to improved competitiveness and sustainability. "A more market-driven energy sector would enhance the efficiency of resource allocation," he said. He cited China's solar power sector, from silicon production to building power stations, as a prime example of the private economy's growing influence in the country's energy transformation. Building a new energy system is seen as a technology and innovation-driven transformation. Many private enterprises are already deeply involved in national science and technology programs covering areas like smart grids, energy storage, hydrogen, renewable energy, and clean coal utilization, said Xu. Xu said that the new measures are expected to help create new investment growth points in the energy sector and make the private economy an indispensable force in the low-carbon energy transition, energy security and local economic growth.

On the BSE, it started the trade at ₹326.05, up 1.57 per cent from the issue price. On the NSE, it listed at ₹328, a premium of 2.18 per cent. However, the stock erased listing gains and ended 7-9 per cent lower on bourses. IPO subscription: Ather Energy’s ₹2,981-crore IPO was subscribed 1.43 times on its final day, driven by strong interest from qualified institutional buyers (1.70x) and retail investors (1.78x), despite choppy market conditions. Non-institutional investors showed weaker interest with 66% subscription. The offer comprises a fresh issue of ₹2,626 crore and an offer-for-sale worth ₹354.8 crore by existing shareholders. Ather had earlier raised ₹1,340 crore from anchor investors. Price band: The IPO was priced at ₹304–321 per share, valuing the company at ₹11,956 crore at the upper band. This marked the first mainboard IPO of FY26 and the second electric two-wheeler company to go public, after Ola Electric. Use of funds: Ather aims to use the proceeds to fund its Factory 3.0, R&D, marketing, and debt repayment. While the company has shown strong growth, it remains unprofitable, and low EV penetration along with increasing competition suggests investors should remain cautious and look for clarity before investing. May 6, 2025 16:00 This live blog has ended. May 6, 2025 16:00 Ather Energy IPO Post-listing : Expert view Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk Ather Energy made a muted debut on the stock market, opening with a modest 2% gain before slipping 8% intraday to close at approximately ₹303—below its lower issue price of ₹304. The IPO saw a lukewarm response, with the retail portion subscribed just 1.89 times and the HNI segment at a mere 0.69 times. The stock’s weak listing and subsequent dip reflect cautious investor sentiment around its steep valuation. However, continued downward pressure could help realign its valuation, potentially making it more attractive to value-conscious investors.

The stock listed at 328 rupees on the National Stock Exchange of India, higher than its offer price of 321 rupees. The company’s initial public offering of $352 million - the third-largest in India this year - was hauled over the finish line by institutional investors such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Temasek. While some existing investors including GIC and Tiger Global sold shares in the IPO, Ather’s largest shareholder, Hero MotoCorp, did not. Ather, one of the first companies to sell e-scooters in India in 2018, had reduced its IPO size by roughly 15% and cut its targeted valuation by 44%. The company, whose founder refers to their tech-loaded scooters as the “Apple of electric two-wheelers”, is counting on newer models to turn profitable and close the gap with rivals Ola Electric, TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto .

View Market Dashboard Ather Energy IPO listing date today. Here's what GMP, experts signal about debut of shares in stock market today Ather Energy IPO listing date is today, 6 May 2025, and the shares will be listed on both the stock exchanges, BSE and NSE. Latest GMP and analysts signal Ather Energy IPO listing to be at a modest 3-5% premium. Ankit Gohel Published 6 May 2025, 06:17 AM IST Ather Energy IPO listing date is today and the equity shares will be listed on BSE and NSE. ( Photo: Reuters ) Ather Energy IPO Listing: Ather Energy shares are set to make their debut in the Indian stock market today. The initial public offering (IPO) of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Ather Energy Ltd ended with modest demand. Ather Energy IPO listing date is today, May 6. The public issue was open for subscription from April 28 to April 30. The IPO allotment was finalised on May 2. Ather Energy IPO listing date has been fixed as May 6, Tuesday, and Ather Energy shares will be listed on both the stock exchanges, BSE and NSE. “Trading Members of the Exchange are hereby informed that effective from Tuesday, May 6, 2025, the equity shares of Ather Energy Limited shall be listed and admitted to dealings on the Exchange in the list of ‘B’ Group of Securities,” a notice on the BSE said. Also Read | Ather Energy IPO: Will the slow and steady builder outperform Ola on the markets Ather Energy shares will be a part of Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, the notice added, and the stock will be available for trading from 10:00 AM. Ahead of the Ather Energy IPO listing today, investors watch out for the trends in the grey market premium (GMP) to gauge the estimated listing price. Here’s what Ather Energy IPO GMP indicates: Ather Energy IPO GMP Today Ather Energy shares are showing a muted trend in the unlisted market with a modest grey market premium (GMP) today. According to stock market observers, Ather Energy IPO GMP today is ₹ 14 per share. This indicates that in the grey market, Ather Energy shares are trading at ₹ 335 apiece, which is at a premium of 4.36% to its issue price of ₹ 321 per share. Analysts also expect Ather Energy IPO listing to be at a modest 3-5% premium, given the trends in the GMP today. “The final day subscription surge — particularly from Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) — suggests a last-minute effort to support the issue amid fears of under-subscription. This points to a lack of broad-based enthusiasm and raises concerns about the IPO’s inherent demand quality. As a result, we expect a flat to mildly negative listing, likely in the range of ±5% under the best-case scenario,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. Also Read | Ather Energy IPO allotment status declared. What GMP signals ahead of listing According to Tapse, flat Ather Energy IPO listing seems to be justified, as the issue was aggressively priced, especially when benchmarked against peer OLA Electric, whose post-listing performance has been underwhelming. “We believe the electric two-wheeler (EV 2W) segment remains highly competitive and capital-intensive, with most players, including market leaders, struggling to achieve sustainable profitability and raising concern with new investors. Given these facts, we recommend a “HOLD” only for high-risk taking investors, who are comfortable with short- to medium-term volatility while conservative investors may prefer a wait-and-watch approach, allowing the stock to establish a more reasonable valuation post-listing,” Tapse said. Industry being in High Growth – High Competition and High Cash Burning segment, we will see high volatility both in business as well as in the price action, hence investors should be aware of risk in short to medium term investing, he added. Gaurav Goel, Founder & Director at Fynocrat Technologies noted that Ather Energy IPO received a mixed response as overall demand was not very strong, especially among non-institutional investors (NII). Also Read | Wagons Learning IPO: Check price band, subscription, dates, GMP, other details “In the grey market, the premium is currently modest at around ₹ 7 per share, indicating only about a ~3-5% expected gain on listing day. This is much lower compared to more hyped IPOs. We expect Ather Energy stock to list flat to marginally positive, with limited near-term upside unless the company can quickly improve its financials and scale up production after listing,” Goel said. Ather Energy IPO Details Ather Energy IPO opened for subscription on April 28 and closed on April 30. The IPO allotment was finalized on May 2, and Ather Energy IPO listing date is today, May 6. Ather Energy shares will be listed on BSE and NSE. The ₹ 2,981.06-crore worth Ather Energy IPO was a combination of fresh issue of 8.18 crore equity shares amounting to ₹ 2,626.30 crore and offer for sale (OFS) of 1.11 crore equity shares aggregating to ₹ 354.76 crore.

Title: Nigeria leads initiative to provide electricity for 300 million Africans

Article Content:
SHARE The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, on Monday expressed optimism that Nigeria is assuming a continental leadership role in the race to electrify Africa, with a bold target to help provide electricity to 300 million Africans by the year 2030. The Speaker made this statement in Lagos State while declaring open the First Legislative Conference and Expo on Renewable Energy in Nigeria , organised by the House Committee on Renewable Energy in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Speaker Abbas, who noted that Nigeria has no option but to adopt renewable energy as one of the ways to diversify the country’s economy, maintained that “it holds substantial implications for national policy agendas.” He said, “The transition to renewable energy is not just an economic necessity; it holds substantial implications for national policy agendas. Renewable energy has become central to initiatives aimed at fostering inclusive economic growth, climate adaptation, and industrial innovation. Countries that have embraced this change have decreased their vulnerability to global fuel price fluctuations, improved energy access, and positioned themselves as leaders in the low-carbon economy.” The Speaker added that renewable energy “is no longer a niche concern but a cornerstone of global development policy. In 2024, renewable energy additions reached five hundred eighty-five gigawatts, accounting for over ninety-two per cent of new power generation capacity worldwide. “The total installed capacity for renewable energy now exceeds 4,448 Gigawatts, marking a 15 percent year-on-year increase. This expansion, led by solar and wind technologies, underscores their cost-effectiveness and scalability. “Financial flows toward clean energy reinforce this trend. In 2023, of the estimated global energy investment of $2.8 trillion, 1.7 trillion was committed to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and electric mobility. This shift in capital allocation signifies a structural reorientation of the global energy economy, where more sustainable alternatives are increasingly displacing fossil fuels. “For Nigeria, a country that relies heavily on fossil fuel exports for its earnings, this transition presents both challenges and opportunities. As the global market shifts toward cleaner energy, countries like Nigeria will have no choice but to diversify their economy to maintain their financial stability while seeking investments in renewable energy sources to align with global trends.” To make headway, the Speaker added that robust legislation and oversight were vital in supporting any national effort to adopt and promote renewable energy. “For instance, Egypt’s Renewable Energy Law, enacted in 2014, has spurred investments in solar and wind power. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive establishes binding national targets and promotes harmonised planning. In Germany, early legislation like the Renewable Energy Sources Act paved the way for decentralised energy generation and garnered widespread support.” Speaker Abbas reiterated Nigeria’s commitment to global energy reform, as demonstrated in the Legislative Agenda of the 10th House, which prioritises energy reform. “Specifically, Strategic Objective 8.5 of our Agenda aims to promote the transition to renewable energy while enhancing clean energy production and access. To achieve this, we are enacting laws that encourage private investment in renewable energy, including offering tax incentives and targeted financing. “Just a few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed new tax reform bills that eliminate VAT on renewable energy and compressed natural gas (CNG), among other measures. We are also working to provide legal backing for the government’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy adopted in 2015, which seeks to boost the use of renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “We acknowledge the urgent need to provide more access to clean cooking fuels, as this is crucial for public health and the environment. These initiatives are being developed in close collaboration with stakeholders, and the House Committee on Renewable Energy is coordinating legislative priorities in this area.” The Speaker added that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s administration’s policy commitments are notable, with the passage of the Electricity Act of 2023, which devolves power over the electricity sector to sub-national governments and ends the Federal Government’s exclusive control. “As a result, we expect new opportunities for local energy solutions and private sector involvement to emerge. “The administration has also committed significant funding. In December 2024 alone, the President approved a $1 billion financing initiative for the Rural Electrification Agency. Of this amount, $750 million has been allocated to expand solar energy access in underserved areas. As a result, this initiative has led to the deployment of 124 mini-grids and over 25,000 solar home systems, benefiting more than 200,000 people.” In his remarks, Chairman of the House Committee on Renewable Energy, Hon. Victor Afam Ogene, said that renewable energy, as an emerging sector in Nigeria, “has garnered significant attention from the government as a key solution to our electricity power supply issues, and deliberate steps are being taken to harness its potential.” He added that the growing consensus on achieving greater energy security and sustainability requires deliberate action to chart a new pathway in reducing Nigeria’s reliance on fossil fuels as a primary source of energy. “While we still grapple with finding the right balance between both, it is also important to point out that, paradoxically, we are yet to achieve meaningful energy sufficiency, even with our current focus on fossil fuel-based energy.” In a presentation, the UNDP Resident Representative, Elsie Attafuah, highlighted the importance of energy to Nigeria’s future, noting that it has “evolved into national security, economic power, and geopolitical leverage tool and instrument.” She added that, “Energy is the foundation for Nigeria’s economic diversification. Without it, neither industrial transformation nor acceleration is possible,” further noting that Nigeria possesses massive potential for energy transition and global power.

Title: A new chapter for TERNA Energy with Masdar at the helm

Article Content:
Following the acquisition of 100% of the company’s shares by Masdar last month and its delisting from the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX), TERNA Energy’s integration into Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC-Masdar, a company with a leading position in clean energy in the United Arab Emirates, was completed. In this context, led by His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the UAE and Chairman of Masdar and also present by the CEO Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, a delegation of the parent company visited the headquarters of TERNA ENERGY in Athens, where it met with its executives and employees. They held strategic discussions with TERNA ENERGY Executive Chairman Georgios Peristeris, the first since the acquisition, centered on Masdar’s strategy to expand the business and accelerate renewable energy growth in Southeastern and Central Europe. H.E. Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Masdar Chairman, said: “Bringing TERNA ENERGY into the Masdar family strengthens our position in Greece and the wider region, enabling us to expediate the growth of renewable energy solutions and unlock the investment needed to empower nations to achieve their clean energy targets. This acquisition also demonstrates the commitment of both the UAE and Masdar to bringing affordable, secure and sustainable energy to all. ΔΙΑΒΑΣΤΕ ΕΠΙΣΗΣ ΔΥΠΑ: Νέο πρόγραμμα επιδότησης εργασίας – 50.000 θέσεις Through the acquisition, Masdar will simultaneously support Greece’s National Energy and Climate Plan, the EU’s ambition to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and advance its own global target of achieving 100 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy capacity by 2030. TERNA ENERGY is targeting an operational portfolio capacity of 6GW by 2030 and will be supported by Masdar’s long-term capital and global expertise.” Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar CEO, said: “With TERNA ENERGY now delisted from the Athens Stock Exchange, we can maximize and leverage the combined expertise and experience of both workforces to accelerate the implementation of clean energy projects in Greece and across the region. By establishing TERNA ENERGY as our flagship platform for the region, we will both support our own renewable energy objectives and drive energy transformation in Europe.” On his part, Georgios Peristeris, Chairman and CEO of GEK TERNA and Executive Chairman of TERNA ENERGY, said: “The delisting of TERNA ENERGY following its acquisition by Masdar marks the full integration of the two companies, creating a strong platform for accelerated growth based on their shared commitment to clean, affordable, and domestically produced energy. As part of Masdar’s global network, TERNA ENERGY is now ideally positioned to expand its leadership in the renewable energy sector in Greece and the wider region. The delisting from ATHEX follows a productive first quarter for TERNA ENERGY, which has seen the continuation of construction on key projects in Greece and Bulgaria, including the Amphilochia plant, one of largest pumped storage hydropower projects in Europe, and Masdar’s first pumped hydro project in the region. The business has also reached final investment decisions on new solar, wind and battery projects with combined capacity of 250MW. These plants are due to be operational within the next two years.” Share: Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via LinkedIn Share via Email Ακολουθήστε μας στο Messenger και μάθετε πρώτοι όλες τις ειδήσεις!

RCKT Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm SAN FRANCISCO , June 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A securities class action lawsuit styled Ho v. Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 3:25-cv-10049 (D. N.J.) has been filed and seeks to represent investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Pharmaceuticals securities between February 27, 2025 and May 26, 2025 . The lawsuit comes after investors saw the price of their shares in Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ: RCKT ) crash over 60% on May 27, 2025 as a result of the company's announcement that the FDA put a clinical hold on its Phase 2 pivotal trial for RP-A501, an experimental therapy intended to treat patients with a rare gene disorder called Danon disease. Hagens Berman urges Rocket Pharmaceuticals investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now . The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Feb. 27, 2025 – May 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Aug. 11, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor- fraud /rckt Contact the Firm Now: [email protected] 844-916-0895 The Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RCKT) Securities Class Action: The litigation focuses on the propriety of Rocket Pharmaceutical's disclosures about the trial protocol being implemented in the RP-A501 Phase 2 trial. More specifically, the complaint alleges that Rocket Pharmaceuticals made materially false and misleading statements while failing to disclose to investors: (1) the true state of RP-A501's safety and clinical trial protocol; (2) that the company knew Serious Adverse Events ("SAEs"), including patient's deaths, were at risk; and (3) that the company amended the trials protocol to introduce a novel immunomodulatory agent to the pretreatment regimen. Investors learned the truth on May 27, 2025 , when the company revealed that the FDA put a clinical hold on its Phase 2 study after a patient suffered a SAE and ultimately died. During the May 27, 2025 update call, in response to analysts' questions, management revealed that the company amended the trial protocol "several months ago[.]" The analysts were seemingly unaware of the company's amendments before this update call. This news drove the price of Rocket Pharmaceutical's shares crashing $3.94 (-62%) the same day. "We're investigating claims that Rocket Pharmaceuticals may have misled investors about its Phase 2 protocol and whether it secretly amended it without first notifying the FDA and investors," said Reed Kathrein , the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

(CitiusTech) Summary While the US remains its main market, CitiusTech is planning expansions in Europe and Japan as demand for healthcare technology services increases among medtech, healthcare, and life sciences companies.

Subscribe now Bain Capital-backed CitiusTech, a healthcare technology services company, is planning to grow through acquisitions and will evaluate an IPO this year, either in the US or India, chief executive officer (CEO) Rajan Kohli told Mint in an interview. “It is very much in our growth path," Kohli said, referring to the company’s plan to list on the exchanges. “We will evaluate [it] this year if the markets are good," he said, adding that the company will evaluate listing in either India or the US. The firm's primary market is the US, accounting for 95% of its revenues. Its investors are Bain Capital Private Equity and EQT Private Capital Asia (previously Baring Private Equity Asia). Also read: FPI Tracker: Telecom, services, capital goods corner major chunk of inflows; IT, healthcare face heavy selling in May In 2022, Bloomberg reported, citing people in the know, that CitiusTech had filed confidentially for a US IPO. The health tech firm is planning expansions in Europe and Japan, as demand for healthcare technology services increases among medtech, healthcare, and life sciences companies. Kohli said that the firm’s specialised focus on healthcare gives it an edge over large Indian IT service companies that cater to various industries. A few other Indian companies are focused solely on healthcare tech services, like IKS Health, which was listed on the exchanges in December 2024 and posted ₹ 2,664 crore revenue in FY25. Acquisitions drive growth The firm is looking at acquisitions this year to drive growth. “We didn't make any acquisitions for the last two years because the valuation was not great in the market," Kohli said, adding that this year the company is targeting two acquisitions, provided it finds targets that meet its requirements. CitiusTech is exploring acquisition options which would strengthen its foray into Europe as well as enhance its abilities in the healthcare provider market. Also read: Jainik Power and Cables IPO allotment to be out soon: Here are steps to check status online and GMP The company had previously stated a target of $1 billion in revenue by FY28, which it is still aiming for, Kohli said. “On an organic basis, we continue to grow as per plan," he said. The company is expecting mid-teens revenue growth in FY26, after high single-digit revenue growth in FY25, Kohli said. While it hasn’t yet posted its FY25 results, it clocked revenue of ₹ 3,536 crore and a profit of ₹ 350 crore in FY24. GenAI tailwind Kohli sees GenAI as a significant tailwind driving growth, as companies look for cost optimisation solutions. “...today, 25% of our clients give us the opportunity to use GenAI tools. I think in one or two years, 80-100% of our clients will allow GenAI-produced code into their environment," he said. Also read: Aten Papers & Foam IPO Day 1: Check subscription status, GMP, and other details Being a healthcare-focused service provider gives CitiusTech an edge as well, according to Kohli. “It is a huge advantage being just focused on healthcare because a lot of our clients buy us because of our specialised capabilities.

JPMorgan Calls the Selloff Excessive, Trims Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) Price Target Fatima Gulzar June 11, 2025 2 min read REGN Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is one of the 13 Biotech Stocks with Huge Upside Potential . JPMorgan has maintained its Overweight rating on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) after reducing its price objective from $950 to $800. Why Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) Crashed Last Week A pharmacist in a lab coat carefully analyzing a vial of medicine for its quality. Following poor IL-33 data in late May, the company believes that the recent selloff in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares is “very much overdone.” JPMorgan pointed out that IL-33 was never a key component of its model, though. The company stressed that, even without accounting for any pipeline contribution, Dupixent, Eylea, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’ solid cash position alone warrants a valuation far higher than current levels. JPMorgan anticipates several catalysts over the next six months that will help reset its value. Recently, the firm’s valuation was under pressure due to its IL-33 program’s lackluster Phase results. JPMorgan is still optimistic in spite of this, concentrating on important assets like Dupixent and Eylea that support the company’s financial stability. The company’s updated $800 estimate, which reflects confidence in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’s core business and future potential milestones, still suggests significant upside. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) discovers, develops, and commercializes drugs to treat eye disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammation. It is one of the stocks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of REGN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Even Healthcare, a managed care startup, is making a foray into brick-and-mortar hospitals, marking a shift from digital-first care to full-stack healthcare delivery. It aims to open 25 hospitals over the next 36 months, Even Healthcare co-founder and COO Matilde Giglio has told Moneycontrol. The decision follows a $30-million Series-A funding round in October led by global investors, including Khosla Ventures. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad “We’re building the first hospital now, which will be inaugurated on July 15 in Bangalore,” Giglio said. “It’s the first of many. The majority of the capital we raised will go into building hospitals from scratch.” Giglio said the hospitals would not offer tertiary services such as oncology or cardiac care, allowing for a leaner capex model with an average investment of $3.5 million a hospital. The first facility, located on Bengaluru’s Race Course Road, will house 60–65 beds and focus on secondary- care procedures such as maternity, orthopaedics, and minor surgeries.

The company already operates six clinics in Bengaluru and its membership includes unlimited consultations, diagnostics and inpatient coverage through insurance partners. It follows the model of Kaiser Permanente, a non-profit private healthcare organisation in the US, under which it owns and manages the entire value chain — from medical coverage to hospitals to pharmacies. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Kaiser follows managed care model, where the focus is on making a person healthier through preventive consultations, screenings, nutrition and specialist support. A healthier person need lesser hospitalisation where the much of the healthcare costs are incurred. “We want to own the entire healthcare journey,” Giglio said. “Our doctors are salaried and incentivized based on clinical outcomes — not procedure volume. That’s a first in India.” The company’s approach aims to disrupt traditional fee-for-service models, which Giglio argues incentivises “overtreatment”. Instead, Even’s hospitals will prioritise patient outcomes and affordability, with pricing designed to be competitive for India’s middle class. Funding growth Even has raised more than $50 million since inception, with the latest $30 million round earmarked for hospital expansion. The company plans to fund growth through a mix of venture capital and debt, once initial hospitals demonstrate operational success. “We’re not rushing to raise more capital,” Giglio said. “We have a lot of money in the bank but we’re always open to the right partner.” The company’s revenue model is anchored in membership sales, which Giglio said accounts for the majority of income. Even closed FY24 with $30 million in revenue, and serves nearly 300,000 members, primarily in urban centres. Scale up Even plans to expand into Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Pune, with scouting already underway in several cities. Giglio acknowledged the operational challenges of scaling healthcare infrastructure but stressed the importance of standardisation and tech-driven processes. “We’re obsessed with customer experience,” she said. “Every touchpoint is tracked. Our clinics became profitable within four to six months.” The company’s phased rollout will begin with three hospitals in Bengaluru, followed by additional facilities in other cities. Giglio said the team includes seasoned healthcare executives from Columbia Asia and Narayana Health, ensuring clinical and operational rigour.

Experts’ Take on the New Launch Experts typically advise caution when it comes to investing in New Fund Offers (NFOs), unless the scheme offers something genuinely unique—such as access to an untapped investment theme or an enhanced proposition over existing options. Without a historical performance record, investors may find it difficult to make informed decisions. According to one expert, there are already over 10 pharma and healthcare-focused mutual funds available in the market. However, this new fund may adopt a distinct approach in terms of stock selection, portfolio construction, or focus on sub-segments like diagnostics, CDMOs, wellness, or healthcare services—potentially offering a fresh perspective within the broader theme. “As with any new fund, it does not yet have a performance track record. So, while the investment philosophy might be compelling, it’s sensible to monitor how the portfolio evolves and how the fund navigates different market conditions,” said Sagar Shinde, VP of Research at Fisdom, in a note to ETMutualFunds. Also Read | Mutual funds reduces overall cash allocation by Rs 6,200 crore to Rs 2.17 lakh crore in May “There's no pressing need to rush into the NFO . Given the ample choices already available in this category with proven track records, it’s better to wait, watch how this fund shapes up, and then consider it for investment based on merit,” Shinde added. Another expert shares a different opinion on this new fund as she mentions that Baroda BNP Paribas Health and Wellness Fund is not the first of its kind in India as several healthcare and pharma-focused funds are already in the market but what differentiates each fund is its investment approach, stock selection, and how broadly it defines the healthcare ecosystem—some include wellness, diagnostics, hospitals, and even health-tech platforms. “Baroda BNP Paribas fund offers investors another opportunity to tap into India’s growing healthcare story. It’s worth considering for those looking to increase sectoral exposure, especially from a long-term perspective. Like any sectoral fund, it should be evaluated based on investment horizon, portfolio strategy, and alignment with personal financial goals,” Shruti Jain, Chief Strategy Officer, Arihant Capital Markets shared exclusively with ETMutualFunds. The minimum amount for lump sum investment is Rs 1,000 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter. For Systematic Investment Plans with daily, weekly, or monthly frequency, the minimum SIP amount is Rs 500 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter; for quarterly SIPs, the minimum amount is Rs 1,500 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter. The fund will allocate 80–100% in equity and equity-related instruments of companies in the pharma, healthcare, and allied sectors; 0–20% in equity and equity-related instruments of companies other than those in the pharma, healthcare, and allied sectors; 0–20% in debt and money market instruments; 0–10% in units of mutual funds (domestic schemes); and 0–10% in units issued by REITs and InvITs. Time to allocate in this sector? Shinde advises that in pharma, recent corrections have created better entry points, and the long-term structural drivers remain intact. Staggered investments can be considered. On the other hand, Jain mentions that pharma and healthcare remain strong thematic plays, particularly because they offer defensive qualities in uncertain markets. Given India’s demographic trends—rising average age, increasing healthcare awareness, and lifestyle-related health issues—this sector is poised for long-term structural growth. “Investors who do not currently have any exposure to this space may consider allocating around 10% of their total equity portfolio to healthcare and pharma funds. However, this should be done with a minimum 3–5 year investment horizon and as part of a well-diversified portfolio. A staggered investment approach (via SIP or tranches) can also help manage entry-point risk,” Jain advises investors. Apart from Baroda BNP Paribas Health and Wellness Fund, there are 16 funds based on the pharma and healthcare sector, of which 10 have a track record of three years in the market. ICICI Pru Pharma Healthcare & Diagnostics (P.H.D) Fund offered the highest return of around 29.05% in the last three years, followed by SBI Healthcare Opp Fund , which has offered a 28.36% return in the same time period. LIC MF Healthcare Fund gave the lowest return of around 20.77% in the said period. With enough funds based on the sector and having a long performance track record, Shinde mentions that the outlook is neutral to positive overall but very constructive on hospitals and specialty pharma segments. While U.S. pricing pressure remains a concern, domestic demand, growth in chronic therapies, and export diversification are supportive. In the last three years, these funds have offered an average return of 24.72%, and in the last five years, they have delivered an average return of 21.93%, with up to 25.16% return in the last five years. LIC MF Healthcare Fund gave the lowest return in the last five years at around 17.40%. Jain believes that the long-term outlook for India’s pharma and healthcare sector remains robust. Post-COVID, there has been a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour and government focus toward healthcare infrastructure, wellness, and preventive care. India’s role as a global pharmaceutical manufacturing hub and growing domestic demand support the sector’s earnings potential. “While short-term volatility may persist due to regulatory changes or global market sentiment, the structural drivers remain intact. Innovation in biosimilars, rising export demand, growth in diagnostics and hospitals, and increasing insurance penetration further strengthen the investment case. As such, this sector offers a compelling mix of growth and defensiveness, making it a relevant thematic allocation for long-term investors,” she added. One should always invest based on their risk appetite, investment horizon, and goals. ( Disclaimer : Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The group of 76 professionals – including respiratory therapists, social workers, physical therapists, and others – won their election with about 90% support in a vote on Wednesday, June 11 . Healthcare professionals from both the Methuen and Haverhill campuses participated in the election, which was conducted in-person under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The decisive victory by the Holy Family healthcare professionals reflects their unity and determination to advocate for better conditions for their patients and themselves. "We are united in our mission to provide exceptional care to our communities," said Dave Matthews , a Holy Family physical therapist and member of the organizing committee. "Forming our union means we will finally have an equal seat at the table to make decisions that impact the quality of care we provide every day." "We know the best patient outcomes happen when healthcare professionals are empowered to advocate for improved working conditions," said Sandy Mansur , a Holy Family social worker and member of the organizing committee. "By unionizing, we are standing up for our patients, our colleagues, and the future of healthcare at Holy Family Hospital." Holy Family MNA Co-Chair and RN Karen Powers said in support, "We welcome the healthcare professionals to the MNA and support them getting their first contract. They are an extraordinary part of the care community at Holy Family!"

Wednesday, November 12, 2025 Advertise with us News SEARCH NEWS NEWS HOME » BUSINESS Philips Future Health Index 2025: Delayed care and lost clinical time call for accelerated AI adoption in APAC Share Tweet COMMENT | June 12, 2025 11:14:27 AM IST PRNewswire Singapore, June 12: Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today released the Asia Pacific (APAC) findings from its 10th annual Future Health Index (FHI) report, the largest global healthcare survey of its kind. The report draws insights on key concerns from healthcare professionals and patients in 16 countries, including Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea. Findings show that despite strong optimism about artificial intelligence's (AI) potential to ease pressure on APAC's healthcare systems, trust and implementation concerns persist. 66% of patients surveyed in APAC are experiencing delays in seeing specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days. 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions. Building trust among patients and healthcare professionals around AI key to driving wider adoption. "The need for AI has never been greater. Our survey shows that patients are anxiously waiting more than a month for specialist care, while some healthcare professionals are losing about four working weeks of clinical time a year due to incomplete patient data," said Jasper Westerink, Senior Vice President and Representative Director of Philips Japan and Acting Managing Director of Philips APAC. "There is a clear role for AI to help clinicians act faster, make better decisions, and anticipate patient needs earlier as we strive to deliver better care for more people." Worsening patient outcomes because of care delays call for accelerated AI adoption About two in three patients (66%) surveyed in APAC are waiting nearly one and a half months to see a specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days. Generally, one in three patients (33%) in APAC report that their health has deteriorated due to delays in seeing a doctor, with one in four (25%) ultimately going to the hospital as a result of long waiting times. AI has the potential to transform care delivery and significantly improve patient outcomes across APAC. * 81% of healthcare professionals in APAC believe that digital health technologies, including AI and predictive analytics, will lead to a reduction in hospital admissions in the future. * 86% of healthcare professionals anticipate that these technologies will decrease the need for acute or emergency medical procedures and interventions. * 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions. Workforce challenge and data burdens call for AI relief Three in four healthcare professionals (76%) in APAC report losing valuable clinical time due to incomplete or inaccessible patient data, with close to one-third (31%) of these losing over 45 minutes per shift, adding up to 23 full days a year lost by each professional. Similarly, two in five (39%) clinicians say they are now spending less time with patients and more time on administrative tasks than they were five years ago. These exacerbate the workforce challenge experienced by healthcare professionals in APAC, as estimated by the World Health Organization. The shortage of health workers in Southeast Asia alone will be 6.9 million respectively in 2030, nearly 40% of the global shortage burden.[1] About 300 healthcare professionals surveyed shared the following concerns if AI is not implemented: * 45% worry about an expanding patient backlog* 42% cite growing burnout from non-clinical tasks* 40% worry about their inability to provide cutting-edge care Addressing AI concerns from HCPs and patients crucial for widespread adoption A majority of healthcare professionals (81%) in APAC are involved in developing new technology at their organizations. However, 39% believe that the new technologies developed are not catered to their needs. Concerns around accountability persist, with 71% sharing concerns about the legal liability for AI usage, while 66% worry that potential data biases in AI applications could widen disparities in health outcomes. Among patients, a majority (75%) welcome the increased use of technology if it improves access to care and benefits them. Around half are concerned that it could reduce face-to-face time with their doctors (51%) and are worried about data security when new technologies are introduced in healthcare (54%). Trust key to transforming healthcare in APAC For the majority of healthcare professionals surveyed (84%) building trust in AI has to involve support with guidelines, issues and liability. In addition, healthcare professionals cite the development of evidence-based, transparent, and monitored AI solutions (72%), followed by reassurance on data security issues, with 51% of healthcare professionals seeking clarity in this area. For patients, about three in four (74%) welcome the use of more technology in healthcare if it helps make it easier to see a healthcare professional and if it helps improve care for patients like themselves (75%). Healthcare professionals play a key role in building trust between patients and AI. Majority of patients (86%) would feel more comfortable with AI in healthcare if hearing about it from their doctors, indicating that doctors are a trusted source of information about such technologies. "It's essential to foster trust of AI-powered technologies among healthcare professionals and patients," said Jasper. "This will enable widespread adoption and effective implementation. Industry-wide collaboration will help us address trust gaps to unlock AI's full potential, enabling responsible, inclusive integration across APAC's healthcare systems."

66% of patients surveyed in APAC are experiencing delays in seeing specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions Building trust among patients and healthcare professionals around AI key to driving wider adoption SINGAPORE , June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, today released the Asia Pacific (APAC) findings from its 10th annual Future Health Index (FHI) report, the largest global healthcare survey of its kind. The report draws insights on key concerns from healthcare professionals and patients in 16 countries, including Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea. Findings show that despite strong optimism about artificial intelligence's (AI) potential to ease pressure on APAC's healthcare systems, trust and implementation concerns persist. "The need for AI has never been greater. Our survey shows that patients are anxiously waiting more than a month for specialist care, while some healthcare professionals are losing about four working weeks of clinical time a year due to incomplete patient data," said Jasper Westerink, Senior Vice President and Representative Director of Philips Japan and Acting Managing Director of Philips APAC. "There is a clear role for AI to help clinicians act faster, make better decisions, and anticipate patient needs earlier as we strive to deliver better care for more people." Worsening patient outcomes because of care delays call for accelerated AI adoption About two in three patients (66%) surveyed in APAC are waiting nearly one and a half months to see a specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days.

Generally, one in three patients (33%) in APAC report that their health has deteriorated due to delays in seeing a doctor, with one in four (25%) ultimately going to the hospital as a result of long waiting times. AI has the potential to transform care delivery and significantly improve patient outcomes across APAC. Advertisement 81% of healthcare professionals in APAC believe that digital health technologies, including AI and predictive analytics, will lead to a reduction in hospital admissions in the future. 86% of healthcare professionals anticipate that these technologies will decrease the need for acute or emergency medical procedures and interventions. 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions. Workforce challenge and data burdens call for AI relief Three in four healthcare professionals (76%) in APAC report losing valuable clinical time due to incomplete or inaccessible patient data, with close to one-third (31%) of these losing over 45 minutes per shift, adding up to 23 full days a year lost by each professional. Similarly, two in five (39%) clinicians say they are now spending less time with patients and more time on administrative tasks than they were five years ago. These exacerbate the workforce challenge experienced by healthcare professionals in APAC, as estimated by the World Health Organization. The shortage of health workers in Southeast Asia alone will be 6.9 million respectively in 2030, nearly 40% of the global shortage burden. [1] About 300 healthcare professionals surveyed shared the following concerns if AI is not implemented: Advertisement 45% worry about an expanding patient backlog 42% cite growing burnout from non-clinical tasks 40% worry about their inability to provide cutting-edge care Addressing AI concerns from HCPs and patients crucial for widespread adoption A majority of healthcare professionals (81%) in APAC are involved in developing new technology at their organizations. However, 39% believe that the new technologies developed are not catered to their needs. Concerns around accountability persist, with 71% sharing concerns about the legal liability for AI usage, while 66% worry that potential data biases in AI applications could widen disparities in health outcomes. Among patients, a majority (75%) welcome the increased use of technology if it improves access to care and benefits them. Around half are concerned that it could reduce face-to-face time with their doctors (51%) and are worried about data security when new technologies are introduced in healthcare (54%). Trust key to transforming healthcare in APAC Advertisement For the majority of healthcare professionals surveyed (84%) building trust in AI has to involve support with guidelines, issues and liability. In addition, healthcare professionals cite the development of evidence-based, transparent, and monitored AI solutions (72%), followed by reassurance on data security issues, with 51% of healthcare professionals seeking clarity in this area. For patients, about three in four (74%) welcome the use of more technology in healthcare if it helps make it easier to see a healthcare professional and if it helps improve care for patients like themselves (75%). Healthcare professionals play a key role in building trust between patients and AI. Majority of patients (86%) would feel more comfortable with AI in healthcare if hearing about it from their doctors, indicating that doctors are a trusted source of information about such technologies. "It's essential to foster trust of AI-powered technologies among healthcare professionals and patients," said Jasper. "This will enable widespread adoption and effective implementation. Industry-wide collaboration will help us address trust gaps to unlock AI's full potential, enabling responsible, inclusive integration across APAC's healthcare systems."

Following poor IL-33 data in late May, the company believes that the recent selloff in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares is “very much overdone.” JPMorgan pointed out that IL-33 was never a key component of its model, though. The company stressed that, even without accounting for any pipeline contribution, Dupixent, Eylea, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’ solid cash position alone warrants a valuation far higher than current levels. JPMorgan anticipates several catalysts over the next six months that will help reset its value. Recently, the firm’s valuation was under pressure due to its IL-33 program’s lackluster Phase results. JPMorgan is still optimistic in spite of this, concentrating on important assets like Dupixent and Eylea that support the company’s financial stability. The company’s updated $800 estimate, which reflects confidence in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’s core business and future potential milestones, still suggests significant upside.

“The Pitt” star Noah Wyle announced that he will be going in front of Congress to call for greater legislative and financial support for America’s struggling health care workers. In an op-ed published Tuesday by USA Today , the actor, who has become deeply familiar with the health care industry through his roles on “ER” and “The Pitt,” revealed that he plans to travel to Capitol Hill this week with ambassadors of FIGS, an apparel company dedicated to supporting and standing up for health care workers. He will join 18 health care professionals and his mother, a retired nurse, on the trip to Washington. “Since [‘The Pitt’] premiered, I’ve heard from countless health care workers who’ve told me they finally feel seen,” Wyle wrote. “Their stories echo the same themes: exhaustion, compassion and a system that threatens to make their life’s work unsustainable.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In Washington, Wyle and his fellow advocates will ask Congress to act on the lack of mental health support, as well as the administrative burden and financial strain, that health care workers are struggling with right now. Wyle and co. are specifically seeking the reauthorization and renewed funding of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which was enacted with bipartisan support in 2022 but expired in 2024. The act sets aside funding for both federal mental health programs for health care workers and financial grants designed to strengthen peer support, training programs and encourage cultural change at an institutional level. The group will also be calling on Congress to move forward with reforms that are meant to take clinical judgment out of the hands of insurance companies and back into those of health care workers. “Administrative red tape is strangling the system. Physicians and their staff spend nearly two full business days each week dealing with prior authorization – essentially asking insurance companies for permission to treat their patients,” Wyle explained. Finally, Wyle said he plans to address the financial issues plaguing health care workers’ lives. Citing one FIGS ambassador’s experience working 80-hour weeks while barely being able to afford groceries, Wyle announced his intention to champion the Awesome Humans Act, which is a proposed federal tax credit intended to provide health care workers with some much-needed financial relief. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Our message is simple: Without a supported, protected and fairly treated workforce, there is no patient care,” Wyle argued. “These aren’t partisan issues. They’re practical ones. And they’re urgent. Because when our health care professionals are burned out, buried in paperwork or forced to leave the field altogether, we all pay the price.” “I’m not a policymaker. I’m not a clinician. But I’ve spent my career listening to those who are, and I’ve seen the difference they make when it matters most,” the “Pitt” star concluded. “To anyone who’s ever benefited from the knowledge, care and courage of a health care professional, now’s the time to show up for them and take action. They’ve had our backs. It’s time we have theirs.” The post ‘The Pitt’ Star Noah Wyle Calls on Congress to Help Health Care Workers: ‘These Aren’t Partisan Issues’ appeared first on TheWrap .

Article Content:
CHICAGO , June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Global Home Healthcare Market share is projected to be valued at USD 420.79 billion in 2024 and reach USD 666.91 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.96% according to a new report by The Research Insights. The rise of cost-effective alternatives to address increasing healthcare costs has driven this growth. The report runs an in-depth analysis of market trends, key players, and future opportunities. In general, the Home Healthcare Market growth of 7.96% comprises a vast array of Component, Indication and Geography which are expected to register strength during the coming years. For More Information and To Stay Updated on The Latest Developments in The Global Home Healthcare Market Size , Download FREE Sample Pages: https://www.theresearchinsights.com/request_sample?id=1372 Market Overview and Growth Trajectory: Home Healthcare Market Growth: According to an exhaustive report by The Research Insights, the Home Healthcare Market is experiencing significant growth. The global home healthcare market is experiencing robust growth, driven by a confluence of emerging and evolving factors. A major driving force is the global demographic shift toward an aging population, particularly in developed economies, which is significantly increasing the demand for chronic disease management and age-related care within the comfort of patients' homes. Simultaneously, the rising prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory diseases is fueling the need for accessible and cost-effective home-based solutions. Technological advancements—such as AI-enabled remote monitoring, wearable health devices, and smart home integration—are transforming home healthcare delivery by enhancing real-time diagnostics, personalized care, and patient engagement. Additionally, the growing acceptance and adoption of telehealth services, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have normalized virtual care models, making them an integral part of home healthcare ecosystems. Market expansion is further supported by increased healthcare expenditures, shifting consumer preferences toward convenience, and supportive government policies and reimbursement frameworks. Moreover, the emergence of platform-based home healthcare services, supported by big data analytics and cloud computing, is enabling better coordination, scalability, and outcome tracking, positioning home healthcare as a central component of modern, value-based care delivery. The worldwide population is aging while chronic diseases become more common: The aging population across developed regions such as North America , Europe , and parts of the Asia-Pacific area stands as a key driver for the home healthcare market expansion. The United Nations reports that by 2050 the number of people aged 65 years or older will reach over 1.5 billion worldwide as their population doubles. The demographic shift leads to more chronic illness cases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, and respiratory conditions that demand ongoing monitoring and long-term treatment. Home healthcare represents a better option than institutional care for many older patients because it provides high-quality treatment within their own homes where they feel safe and comfortable. The growing need for home healthcare solutions has expanded the market for in-home nursing services alongside physical therapy options and disease management programs and remote patient monitoring tools thereby integrating home healthcare into essential care processes. For Detailed Market Insights, Visit: https://www.theresearchinsights.com/reports/home-healthcare-market-1372 Technological Advancements in Remote Monitoring and Telehealth: Medical technology developments have led to enhanced operational capabilities for home healthcare services. Home administration of complex treatments has become both safe and efficient due to the use of portable oxygen concentrators, mobile dialysis machines, infusion pumps, and wearable health monitors. The rapid expansion of telehealth services and digital health platforms has enabled patients to conduct virtual consultations easily while receiving continuous monitoring and making decisions based on data analysis. The importance of these technologies increased after COVID-19 because they serve to decrease hospital visits and lower exposure risks while preserving excellent care quality. The combined use of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) , and cloud-based data sharing gives clinicians enhanced capabilities to manage patient outcomes proactively. These emerging solutions increase patient satisfaction and clinical success while broadening the scalability and cost-efficiency of home healthcare delivery. Cost-Effectiveness and Healthcare System Strain: Financial and logistical challenges for the global healthcare system are escalating because of increasing chronic disease burden and hospital overcrowding combined with higher treatment expenses. Home healthcare reduces financial burdens by minimizing extended hospitalizations alongside emergency room admissions and institutional facility requirements. Public and private payers experience significant cost reductions through home healthcare while maintaining high patient care standards. Home-based care models have gained support from governments and insurers who are using policy changes and financial incentives to push for their adoption. Middle-class populations in developing countries now find home healthcare services affordable and viable alternatives to pricier hospital treatments while still delivering quality medical attention. Home healthcare benefits from economic viability and practical efficiency because value-based care and patient-centred delivery models support this healthcare setting. Stay Updated on The Latest Home Healthcare Market Trends: https://www.theresearchinsights.com/request_sample?id=1372 Geographical Insights: The North American market held the largest share with 42.60%. North America maintains market dominance due to its significant elderly population along with advanced healthcare systems and high levels of consumer spending power. Future home care solutions led by government initiatives to control healthcare costs should significantly affect the market. The Asia Pacific region expects fast growth because three major factors make at-home care more convenient than hospital settings. Lack of development in healthcare infrastructure along with high hospital facility costs has triggered extensive demand for home healthcare products and services. Global Home Healthcare Market Segmentation and Geographical Insights: Based on Component, the home healthcare market is divided into, Equipment, and Services. The services segment has become a central market aspect by generating 84.21% of the total revenue share in 2023. This segment is further bifurcated into two categories: skilled home healthcare and unskilled home healthcare. Based on Indication, the home healthcare market is divided into, Cardiovascular Disorder & Hypertension, Diabetes & Kidney Disorders, Neurological & Mental Disorders, Respiratory Disease & COPD, Maternal Disorders, Mobility Disorders, Cancer, Wound Care , and Others.

The Hospital Saturday Fund (HSF) marked a significant milestone on June 3 with its first-ever charitable reception in Malta, presenting €30,000 in grants to six health-focused organisations at the Malta Charity Reception held at Casino Maltese in Valletta. The formal charity reception brought together healthcare professionals, charity representatives, and community leaders to celebrate HSF's commitment to improving healthcare accessibility across Malta and Gozo. Each of the six recipient organisations received €5,000 to support their vital work in addressing critical health needs across the islands. The beneficiary organisations included Caritas Malta, Friends of the Sick and Elderly in Gozo, Hospice Malta, Puttinu Cares, Richmond Foundation, and The Malta Trust Foundation – representing a comprehensive range of health services from mental health support to cancer care and elderly assistance. The formal charity reception brought together healthcare professionals, charity representatives, and community leaders. “This marked an important milestone for HSF, as we hosted our first-ever charity reception in Malta. We were proud to support six remarkable charities making a real difference in Malta. The donations made which totalled €30,000, reflected our ongoing commitment to funding medical and health-focused causes and supporting the people of Malta’s health and wellbeing,” said Paul Jackson, Group Chief Executive, The Hospital Saturday Fund. The programme featured opening remarks by Lynn Tomlinson, Chair of HSF Health Plan (Malta) and Trustee of The Hospital Saturday Fund, followed by an introduction of grant recipients by HSF Trustee Mark Davies. Ray Micallef, General Manager for HSF Health Plan (Malta), and Adrian Button, Head of Sales & Marketing for HSF Health Plan (UK & EU), presented insights into HSF Health Plan's mission and operations in the region. Senior HSF representatives, including John Greenwood (Chair), Paul Jackson (Group Chief Executive), and Anna Maria Zammit (Vice Chair, Grant Making Committee), personally presented the grants to each organisation, emphasising HSF's hands-on approach to community support. The Malta Charity Reception represents HSF's expanding commitment to healthcare accessibility beyond its traditional UK base. HSF's unique model demonstrates healthcare with purpose – every employee who benefits from HSF Health Plan cover directly contributes to supporting their wider community's health needs. As a not-for-profit organisation, HSF channels all surplus from its Health Plan into charitable grants like those presented yesterday, creating a meaningful cycle where workplace wellbeing programmes fund vital community health services. The evening concluded with networking opportunities over drinks and a finger buffet, allowing attendees to discuss collaborative approaches to addressing Malta's healthcare challenges and building stronger community partnerships. This inaugural reception underscores HSF's core mission to improve community well-being by making healthcare financially accessible and easy to navigate, values that now extend to supporting Malta's most vulnerable populations through these strategic charitable partnerships. The Hospital Saturday Fund has been providing healthcare benefits and supporting health-related causes for over 150 years, currently serving communities across the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, and now Malta through HSF Health Plan.

Housing as Health Care: What We (Don't) Know About Its Costs Commentary Jun 6, 2025 Calaveras Quarters, a 69-unit permanent supportive housing development that was repurposed from a former 121-room motel in Stockton, California, April 3, 2025 Photo by USA Today via Reuters By Sarah B. Hunter and Ryan K. McBain Housing is increasingly being viewed as an important contributor to health outcomes. As a result, more and more health care systems and managed health care plans are getting into the housing business , but will this pay off for their bottom lines? Probably not right away. The research evidence demonstrates that the best way to serve individuals experiencing homelessness may be to provide them with housing, often through a rental subsidy or voucher, coupled with case management services, also known as permanent supportive housing (PSH). More than two decades of research have shown that such approaches improve housing stability among those experiencing homelessness, and they are widely embraced as an approach to address chronic homelessness in the United States. The reported costs of PSH programs vary depending on factors such as the intensity of case management supportive services and the way housing is provided. The costs are typically borne by different service systems, such as various federal, state, and local programs. Because these programs may offset the costs of the housing subsidy and/or case management services, it can be difficult to monitor the total program implementation costs. This challenge in tracking program costs means that most studies only show part of the picture. A number of studies, for example, only begin to capture program and housing costs once an individual has been placed into PSH. This leaves out significant costs during the “transition period” into PSH, after identification and before PSH placement. These figures range dramatically from $13,400 to $48,000 per person per year (USD, 2025) . When examining potential cost offsets to the health care system, the housing and service provision costs are typically compared to health care service utilization and associated costs prior to and following PSH placement among a treatment and, ideally, a control group. Reviews have found that studies using more rigorous research designs, such as randomized trials, report smaller health care cost offsets. To better document the implementation costs of operating a PSH program from the perspective of a health care provider, we assisted a large managed care plan located in Southern California in assessing its program costs. We also assessed ongoing program costs and examined health care service utilization among members enrolled in their PSH program compared to an observational comparison group to explore potential cost offsets to the health care system. We found that the period after an individual is enrolled in the program, but prior to placement in PSH, was a critical moment in terms of costs. During this period, participants required more intensive health care and housing services as they transitioned from acute care settings to community settings. In prior PSH research studies, this period is typically ignored and therefore excluded from cost estimates, omitting a significant component of PSH program implementation spending. In our study , the transitional housing costs amounted to, on average, $4,147 per member per month (USD, 2025)—and most members spent approximately 3–4 months in this phase for total cost of almost $14,000. Health care spending during this transitional period was over $6,400 per member per month. These costs were reduced once members moved into PSH. Monthly PSH costs reduced to less than $3,500 per member per month, and health care costs decreased to approximately $3,400 per member per month. The period after an individual is enrolled in a permanent supportive housing program, but prior to placement, is a critical moment in terms of costs. When we examined overall program costs and health care service utilization over a 12-month period that included program entry, we observed a dramatic reduction in utilization and a $24,500 decline in the average associated costs annually. However, there was no difference in service utilization between the treatment and comparison groups, and it didn’t result in cost savings—primarily because enrollees in PSH generated program implementation costs. Although the program did not result in dramatic reductions in overall spending, participants were more likely to engage in routine outpatient care once housed. While we were unable to track more general indicators like health functioning or quality of life, members appeared to spend less time receiving emergency or inpatient care after receipt of PSH. These patterns are similar to those observed in other studies ( PDF ) examining the health care service offsets after PSH placement. It is important to note that PSH programs often target the most vulnerable. In our work, the average 12-month health care spending prior to housing was close to $82,000, and many of the members suffered from multiple chronic health conditions. As a result, health care spending is not likely to be reduced to zero after PSH receipt, as ongoing management of those chronic conditions is warranted. However, reductions in crisis care may be achievable. To our knowledge, our study was the first to examine the upfront implementation costs of providing PSH in a managed health care setting. While getting people into PSH soon after identification is the goal of “Housing First” efforts, the reality is that many individuals experiencing homelessness may be placed in transitional housing for some period of time. Our study demonstrates that such programs are not cost-neutral. It is important to note, however, that the reduction in crisis care easily covers the housing and supportive services component of such programs. If the goal is to prevent emergency room visits and long hospital stays while increasing housing stability, PSH programs are a worthwhile health care investment.

Aytu BioPharma to commercialise Exxua for MDD in the US The partnership will expand treatment options for mental health in the US. Credit: Coco Ratta/Shutterstock. · Pharmaceutical Technology · Coco Ratta/Shutterstock. GlobalData June 9, 2025 2 min read AYTU Aytu BioPharma has signed an exclusive agreement with Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals to commercialise Exxua (gepirone) extended-release tablets, a new antidepressant, to the US market for major depressive disorder (MDD). Exxua, developed by Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals, is a selective serotonin 5HT1a receptor agonist that has gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating MDD in adults. Aytu issued an initial payment to Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals upon closure and will make another payment on the first anniversary of Exxua's market release. Aytu is committed to royalty payments based on net sales as stipulated in their definitive agreement, including a product transfer cost. Contingent on reaching specific revenue milestones over the duration of their partnership, Aytu will disburse variable milestone fees to Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals. Aytu CEO Josh Disbrow stated: "We believe that the licensing of EXXUA represents a transformative milestone for Aytu and a significant advancement for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. "More importantly, given the compelling and novel product profile of EXXUA and the unmet needs of MDD patients, we believe EXXUA can become a very important treatment option for the over 21 million Americans affected by MDD. We look forward to launching EXXUA later this year and to our exciting partnership with Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals." Funding for the transaction comes from cash reserves, accompanied by financing from healthcare-focused investors such as Nantahala Capital Management and Stonepine Capital Management, along with contributions from Aytu management and new institutional shareholders. Preparations are underway to introduce Exxua into the US market swiftly, aiming for pharmacy and patient access by late 2025. Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals co-founder and CEO Stephen Kramer stated: "We believe EXXUA will be a very important addition to physicians managing the millions of patients with depression in the US and worldwide." The therapeutic effect of Exxua is attributed to its modulation of serotonin activity through strong binding affinity for 5HT1a receptors — crucial components in mood regulation. "Aytu BioPharma to commercialise Exxua for MDD in the US" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.

Title: How Frugal Health Care Innovation Is Reimagining Accessibility
Date: 20250610T163000Z

Source: borgenproject.org

Article Content:
Reports assessing the relationship between extreme poverty and health care accessibility have and continue to prove a cyclical relationship in which each exacerbates the other. Though the availability of health care across the world increases, out-of-pocket costs often force families and individuals below the poverty line. Meanwhile, populations suffering from untreated illness are unable to participate effectively in the workforce. In short, being sick keeps people from financial earnings, while treatment costs account for most of their spending. Either path hampers the ability to participate in the local economy. In response, frugal health care initiatives have risen in popularity, combating the personal financial aspect of health care accessibility. How Does Frugal Health Care Work? Frugal health care works by using low-cost, low-tech solutions that are adapted to local needs. Many solutions arise by repurposing everyday tools or simplifying existing techniques. One early example is the stethoscope , originally made from a rolled piece of paper to preserve a patient’s modesty. Today, frugal innovations include using hardware drills instead of expensive medical ones and placing premature babies in plastic bags to prevent hypothermia. These practical, outcome-based solutions stand apart from the prevailing model of Western, research-driven progress due to their deep contextualization. While vaccines serve as a universal preventive measure for those with access, innovations like the “ Jaipur Foot ” address specific local needs. Designed for barefoot amputees, the Jaipur Foot is affordable and effective thanks to partnerships with local artisans and readily available materials. Its success, however, is closely tied to local production capacity, making it a powerful but regionally limited solution. The Frugal Biomedical Innovations Program Western University has incorporated research into frugal health care innovation in Canada via its Frugal Biomedical Innovations Program (FBIP). A branch of the Engineering Health Equity (EHE) training program, the institute has partnership sites in Northern Canada, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda. The FBIP is hands-on and follows a conceptualize-create-deploy model. This ensures that abstract ideas become a physical reality and are implemented in the low-resource communities where they are needed. Partnering Universities also lead projects at home with the aid of the Frugal Biomedical Innovations Catalyst Grant program. One example is 3D-printed hands and feet developed by Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, Ethiopia. Another is a low-cost teledentistry system from the University of Nairobi, designed to improve oral health care in rural Kenya. Prototypes are tested in the field with financial support from organizations such as Western University’s Africa Institute and program grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. A Good Enough Future Hi-tech innovation in health care will and should continue to progress. However, the emerging focus on extending medical accessibility to areas lacking the financial and technological resources to implement it is ushering in a revolution of rural health care access. The 2025 World Economic Forum identified the need for decentralized, equitable health care systems. Similarly, the 2024 report on Global Health Care Sector Outlook published by Deloitte University suggests multiagency collaboration and taking opportunities to digitalize care delivery. Decentralization, equity and collaboration are pillars of frugal health care innovation. By prioritizing practical repurposing over novelty, an increasing number of communities will have access to the medical care necessary to facilitate economic growth. – Emily Galán Emily is based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and focuses on Global Health and Politics for The Borgen Project.

Innovation What 2025's Biggest Health IT Events Revealed About The Road Ahead By Fran Rosch , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 10, 2025, 06:00am EDT Share Save Fran Rosch is the CEO of Imprivata, a digital identity company for life- and mission-critical industries. getty After spending the spring at ViVE and HIMSS, two of the healthcare industry's most influential conferences, the industry is clearly standing at a major inflection point. Mobile transformation is no longer a trend on the horizon—it's here, it's accelerating and it's bringing a wave of complexity that the industry isn't fully prepared for. AI, similarly, is moving quickly from hype to implementation, but the road to meaningful adoption is full of friction, and the cyber risks we face today are more sophisticated and business-disrupting than ever before. I left both events not just energized by the innovation but focused on what comes next and how we translate these promising new technologies into real-world improvements for clinicians and patients alike. Here's where I see the biggest opportunities for healthcare organizations—and where the tech industry must step up to meet healthcare's most urgent needs. The Mobile Momentum Conversations about mobile devices, their increasing ubiquity across the industry and their pivotal role in driving operational efficiencies, employee experience and better patient care took center stage at both events. As organizations deploy more mobile devices—and corporate-owned shared devices, in particular—to enhance efficiencies and streamline access to electronic health records, the focus is shifting toward improving clinician experiences, with capabilities like passwordless authentication proving to be instrumental in driving satisfaction. By making access to all workstations and devices frictionless and secure for clinicians, healthcare leaders are effectively enhancing cybersecurity strategies and tools to address the evolving endpoint environment. Data and analytics further amplify these benefits by enabling real-time decision making, improving patient outcomes and protecting sensitive patient information. While the rise of mobile strategies presents clear advantages for healthcare organizations, it also introduces complex challenges. Effective implementation of mobile access management is critical for mobile adoption. Expanding an organization's endpoint environment can quickly strain existing cybersecurity infrastructure. Compromised access can directly affect patient safety. In response, comprehensive mobile access should fit seamlessly into clinician workflows while still ensuring users can only touch the data they need. To truly capitalize on the promise of mobile transformation, the tech industry must shift from a product-centric to partnership-driven approach—prioritizing a deep collaboration with healthcare providers to truly understand clinical workflows, effectively invest in user-centric design and develop robust support for device life cycle management and compliance. Driving AI Advancements And Operational Efficiencies Ambient listening solutions drive much of healthcare's growing adoption of mobile devices and were the focus of many AI conversations across both events. These solutions transform clinical workflows by automating notetaking and updates to electronic health records. Along with a wave of AI-powered innovations, these tools are addressing and improving clinician burnout, patient management, drug discovery and more. It was clear that the focus of AI innovations in healthcare is to improve patient outcomes by enhancing treatments and giving back valuable time, allowing clinicians to focus on delivering effective, customized care. Despite this momentum, the road to widespread adoption has just begun. Some healthcare organizations are still hesitant to fully embrace AI due to upfront costs, integration complexities and cultural resistance among clinicians. Nevertheless, organizations (and, particularly, CIOs) are increasingly strapped for resources and need to do more with less. AI advancements are helping meet this pain point, allowing organizations to keep up with operational demands and expand their services. While so much of the broader AI conversation revolves around fears that AI will replace workers, the reality in healthcare is that many systems are understaffed, and AI can fill gaps. Driving mainstream adoption requires demystifying AI through transparent systems that demonstrate tangible value for providers and integrate with existing systems and workflows. Looking ahead, healthcare organizations will need scalable infrastructure, tailored training and strong governance frameworks to drive effective AI implementation. The Evolving Role Of Cybersecurity While innovations in AI and cloud technology, as seen across events, improve workflows and greatly enhance threat monitoring and remediation, they also introduce new cybersecurity risks. As digital infrastructures expand, they require advanced approaches to protect sensitive health data. Leaders at ViVE reflected on the Change Healthcare attack , which broke during the 2024 conference. These leaders emphasized the growing concern over advanced persistent threats, the need for comprehensive cyber resilience strategies and the importance of better managing all users across ecosystems—especially outside vendors, which are an increasing concern across the industry. The healthcare sector remains one of the most targeted industries for cybercriminals, and attacks are growing more sophisticated. Ransomware continues to be the most disruptive threat, often crippling clinical operations and putting patient safety at risk. Not only do organizations have to worry about internal users, but they also need to worry about their third-party vendors. An October 2024 survey we commissioned The Ponemon Institute to conduct found that 44% of healthcare organizations had suffered a cyberattack from third-party access in the previous 12 months. To counter these threats, healthcare organizations must prioritize a proactive security strategy that leverages zero trust, real-time threat monitoring, privileged access management and automated remediation. If the rest of 2025 is anything like the outlook that ViVE and HIMSS painted, we can expect further mobile transformation, a surge in AI and cloud adoption and the continuing need to implement robust security strategies and solutions effectively. Data analytics and machine learning capabilities underpin this evolution, driving smarter clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes. While these innovations promise to improve patient outcomes, organizations will have more devices to secure. Luckily, cybersecurity and digital innovations will make it possible to do more with less. The future of healthcare is promising, but we must remain vigilant about safeguarding against the cybersecurity risks that come with these technological advancements.

ENGLISH US Tourist Praises Free Healthcare in Greece, Draws Minister's Attention US Tourist Praises Free Healthcare in Greece, Draws Minister's Attention ANTHEE CARASSAVA 10/06/2025 07:54 Greece's Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis has highlighted praise for the country’s public healthcare system by sharing a viral video posted by an American tourist who received medical care on the island of Mykonos. The incident sparked a fresh online debate comparing healthcare accessibility between Europe and the United States. In a TikTok video reposted by Mr. Georgiadis on platform X, the tourist expressed surprise and appreciation for receiving treatment free of charge. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ "I just left the hospital here in Mykonos. They gave me an IV and a whole bag of medicine — and you know how much it cost? Zero dollars. Zero," the tourist says in the clip. "In the U.S., that would have cost me $400 to $500." The tourist went on to criticize the American healthcare system, labeling it "a scam." Mr. Georgiadis responded to the video, commenting: "Let’s also point out the good things. See what an American tourist posted about our healthcare system." The minister's post comes amid ongoing efforts by the Greek government to modernize its National Health System (ESY). The system has faced pressure in recent years from staffing shortages and underinvestment, but it continues to provide low-cost or free care to citizens and visitors, particularly in emergencies. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ The video, which quickly gained traction online, contributes to a broader discussion about healthcare accessibility in Europe compared to the United States, where millions remain uninsured or underinsured despite high overall healthcare spending.

Local News 'We just want to feel safe at work' | Indiana health care workers talk about increase in violence against hospital staff An American Hospital Association report estimates health care providers spent close to $15 billion in 2023 responding to workplace violence in their facilities. To stream 13 WTHR on your phone, you need the 13 WTHR app. Download the 13 WTHR app More Videos Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video INDIANAPOLIS — With a health care worker shortage still being felt across the country and even the world, incidents like the one Lauren Fogt experienced recently at Kindred Hospital near downtown Indianapolis , where she's the director of quality management, have her worried about holding on to staff. "We had a new tech a few weeks ago that was bitten by a patient and it was like her second week," Fogt recounted. "My first thought was, 'I really hope she doesn't quit, because she's really really good.' She's an amazing CNA." Fogt said the new staff member didn't leave, though the incident was a difficult one. "There was six of us in the room with one patient and it took six of us to try to calm him down and he still wasn't calm," Fogt said. The experience underscored a problem in health care facilities in Indiana and across the country. The American Hospital Association recently released a report that estimates health care providers spent close to $15 billion in 2023 responding to workplace violence in health care facilities across the country. Credit: WTHR Here in Indiana, a 2023 survey of 14,000 Hoosier health care workers showed 34% said their unit had a problem with patients or visitors being physically aggressive towards staff. "Bottom line, we just want to feel safe at work," said Fogt, who's a registered nurse and has a doctorate in nursing. Even though Fogt has 25 years invested in the health care profession, she still thinks about one of her early days on the job when she said a patient's dad attacked her. "Struck me, threw me against a brick wall and I was so young, I thought, 'Well this is part of the job,'" Fogt said she thought at the time. Only it's not supposed to be, she said, but statistics suggest it's becoming more of a regular occurrence. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care workers are five times more likely to be injured from workplace violence than workers in other industries. "We can't normalize this violence at work," Fogt said. Credit: WTHR She recounted her experience to Indiana lawmakers this year, testifying in favor of a bill to expand protections for health care professionals against attacks from patients and visitors. The bill didn't get across the finish line. "You can't assault an airline worker, a police officer, a fireman, but there's really not those same protections in place for health care workers," Fogt explained. Current Indiana law provides for harsher penalties for attacking certain licensed health care professionals and emergency department staff. At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced the Save Health Care Workers Act that would extend protections for everyone working in health care, no matter the position. "We have so many people that make up the team in a hospital that are not protected right now and we really have to get protection for the entire team," Fogt said. "What we found over the last four or five years, there's been a steady increase in the violence in our hospitals," said Jon Barefoot, vice president of security, safety and disaster preparedness at IU Health. Credit: WTHR Barefoot can't say what's contributing to the increase in attacks on hospital staff, but said last year, IU Health began tracking incidents with the same criteria at all of its hospitals. He said so far this year, there have been 300 incidents at IU facilities, but says the problem is not unique to IU Health or Indiana. "All of my colleagues across the country are experiencing the same things and we're struggling to wrap our heads around why the change," Barefoot said, explaining that IU Health has both both sworn police officers and public safety officers on staff. According to Barefoot, if those officers don't witness an incident themselves, the options to act are limited. "We can ask that person to leave, and then we can work with the prosecutor to file charges, but we lose that ability to remove them from the environment immediately," Barefoot explained. That why he believes the push for further legislation is important. "It's not necessarily about punishing people, it's about making sure we've got the tools that we need to do, to keep our facilities safe," Barefoot said. For Fogt, it's also about having laws in place that act as a deterrent. "People are upset. Society is upset for a lot of different reasons and that's spilled over in the hospital. It's been going on a long time," said Fogt. Close Ad

SHARE The Federal Government has distributed 10,000 professional kits to midwives across the Southeast region as part of efforts to boost maternal and child healthcare delivery in Nigeria. Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Iziaq Adekunle Salako, announced the distribution on Monday during a flag-off event held at the International Conference Centre in Enugu. The initiative, under the Renewed Hope Agenda, is designed to empower frontline health workers and strengthen healthcare services, especially in underserved areas. Dr. Salako expressed appreciation to Senator Oluremi Tinubu, wife of the President, for her unwavering commitment to health initiatives, particularly in tackling tuberculosis, cervical cancer, and HIV/AIDS. He described her support as pivotal to the ongoing reforms in the nation’s healthcare system. According to the minister, the distribution of the midwifery kits will directly benefit 60,000 midwives, covering about 40% of the country’s registered midwives. “Each item in the kit you are being given today represents a commitment to life, to health, and to the dignity of our women and children,” he remarked. The kits, he said, are expected to significantly improve the ability of midwives to deliver quality care, particularly in rural communities where access to healthcare remains limited. The move is part of broader government efforts to curb Nigeria’s high maternal and under-five mortality rates. ALSO READ: Senator Basiru denies criticising Tinubu over Gov Adeleke, family’s visit The event drew attendance from several dignitaries, including the wife of the Vice President, Hajia Nana Shettima, and wives of state governors, who lauded the government’s commitment to improving the welfare of healthcare professionals and reducing health disparities across regions. Dr. Salako also highlighted recent achievements under the Renewed Hope Initiative, such as the establishment of new federal tertiary hospitals, recruitment of healthcare personnel, and execution of critical infrastructure projects in hospitals nationwide. The midwifery kit distribution marks another step in the Federal Government’s strategy to enhance primary healthcare delivery and build a resilient health system for all Nigerians.

TIL Creatives Mumbai: India's market for single-speciality hospitals is set to more than double to $31 billion in three-four years from the current $15 billion, amid their private equity-led expansion into small towns and hinterlands where demand for quality healthcare services is growing rapidly, according to a report. The market share of single-speciality hospitals, catering to segments like eyecare, dental care, orthopaedics, oncology, fertility treatments and mother & child care, is expected to rise to 40% of the total healthcare market by 2028 from the current 30%, said the report from investment bank Avendus. Of this, the total organised single-specialty healthcare - which includes scaled chains - accounts for $4 billion, which is seen rising to $9 billion, said the report. "The share of single speciality will become larger in the next four years and the organised players will more than double," said Anshul Gupta, managing director and head of healthcare investment banking at Avendus Capital. The single-speciality format, where a hospital typically would have 40-50 beds, presents the opportunity for greater geographical depth compared to multispeciality hospitals where the average size is 250-300 beds. These formats offer an ideal blend of low capital intensity, high specificity of care, and replicable business models that are increasingly appealing to institutional investors and founders. Live Events Strong returns A combination of factors is driving faster consolidation in the sector, including their demand for capital expenditure and better return on investments. "Some of the scaled players are very aggressively rolling up. Be it the large eyecare chains like Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital , Maxivision and others, each of them has private equity backers and they have been doing M&As of anywhere between eight and 10 acquisitions every year," said Gupta. Doctors running small chains are mostly interested in clinical work and for them admin work is a hassle, he said. "By being part of a larger (investment) platform allows them the flexibility to focus on clinical work." Besides, such chains find it harder to invest in capex in tech and infrastructure development on their own, but when they are part of a larger platform the cost gets spread, said Gupta. India's total private and trust healthcare market is $50 billion and expected to grow to $79 billion by 2028, according to Avendus estimate. Total private equity investments in the single-specialty sector crossed $3.7 billion, accounting for over 35% of total hospital investments in the last 10 years. About 70% of these investments have gone to established specialties such as IVF, eyecare, mother & childcare, dialysis and oncology. In the last two-three years, leading players in specialties such as dental care, urology / nephrology, skin and hair care have started to attract investor interest due to significant whitespaces in the demand-supply in these specialties, according to the report. "A trifecta of factors is helping accelerate investor interest in the single-specialty healthcare chains ... significant growth opportunity in tier 2/3 cities, clearly visible unit economics and viability with best in class ROIs," Vishal Bali, executive chairman of Asia Healthcare Holdings, an healthcare investment platform that focus on single specialities like oncology, women and child care, fertility, urology and nephrology, told ET in a recent interaction. Top PE transactions in single-specialty healthcare in the last two years include Indira IVF-BPEA EQT, NephroPlus-Quadria Capital and TPG Growth and Temasek in Dr Agarwal Healthcare.

Title: Health professionals say Trump Administration cuts will endanger public health

News Political Commentary and Analysis 06/09/2025 More than 6,000 doctors, nurses, and scientists warn that proposed healthcare cuts will lead to preventable deaths. The Trump administration is accused of gutting Medicaid, public health programs, and medical research. Health professionals urge major medical institutions to break their silence and defend public health infrastructure. More than 6,000 frontline health professionals — including doctors, nurses, researchers, and public health experts — have signed an open letter condemning the Trump administration’s actions to dismantle key components of the U.S. healthcare system. The signatories say that the proposed policies pose a direct threat to American lives. The letter, released publicly today, criticizes the administration for deep cuts to Medicaid, slashing support for scientific research, and weakening the federal health workforce — moves that, according to the authors, "will cost lives." “The administration claims to want to ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but these actions will do the opposite,” the letter states. “We are certain this will cost lives.” "Cuts target vulnerable Americans" Among the most alarming proposals cited is a drastic reduction in Medicaid funding, which the letter says would devastate healthcare access for tens of millions of Americans. Medicaid currently: Covers 40% of children in the U.S. Supports 60% of nursing home residents If enacted, the proposed cuts would "threaten the well-being of the most vulnerable in our society," the health professionals argue. They also warn that front-line workers cannot compensate for the void left by such massive funding and staffing shortfalls. An Attack on Science and Public Health In addition to healthcare access, the letter denounces the administration’s efforts to dismantle public health infrastructure by: Reducing funding for scientific research and data access Limiting medical training programs Undermining federal agencies that protect medical care and public health “These reckless and deep cuts are tearing apart crucial systems for protecting and promoting Americans’ health,” the letter reads. Dr. Robert Steinbrook, Director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, issued a statement in support of the message: “We must continue to sound the alarm about the Trump Administration’s attacks and threats against our healthcare system,” he said. “It’s time for leading medical institutions and individual professionals to end their silence.” A Call to Action for the Medical Community While acknowledging that federal healthcare policy needs improvement, the letter emphasizes that any reform must be thoughtful and evidence-based, not a wholesale abandonment of effective programs. “There is plenty to fix… but we need intelligent redesign, not shutting down programs and abandoning the public,” the letter concludes. The signatories are urging professional societies, medical schools, hospital networks, and healthcare leaders to take a public stand and defend the systems that keep Americans healthy. As debate over the future of the U.S. healthcare system intensifies, this unified front from healthcare workers sends a clear message: reckless cuts to critical health programs will not go unnoticed — and will not go unchallenged.

The report, based on a Q2 2025 survey of 122 hospital and physician practice administrators in Greece conducted ahead of HIMSS25 Europe, reflects the perspectives of stakeholders on the state of healthcare IT adoption and readiness in the country. While the findings point to significant challenges in Electronic Health Records (EHR), interoperability, and cybersecurity, they also highlight a unique opportunity for Greek-oriented and regional digital health vendors to accelerate transformation. With dissatisfaction running high among providers and patients, local innovation and targeted vendor partnerships could reshape the national health IT landscape. EHR Adoption and Vendor Opportunity Only 14% of Greek providers surveyed reported access to integrated, functional digital health records in routine care. A significant 98% expressed dissatisfaction with current systems, citing fragmented platforms, inefficient workflows, and lack of real-time clinical data access. These gaps open the door for localized EHR vendors to design solutions aligned with national healthcare workflows and policy environments, offering custom platforms that overcome the limitations of foreign, one-size-fits-all technologies. Interoperability as a Catalyst for Growth Just 7% of Greek health IT leaders stated their systems are capable of supporting interoperable data exchange across care settings. The lack of HL7 FHIR-standardized integration highlights the pressing need for Greek vendors and regional integration firms to develop scalable, standards-based health data exchange platforms. Opportunities exist for companies positioned to bridge public-private sector silos, modernize legacy systems, and create unified health information networks. Population Health and Analytics Market Gaps Only 3% of respondents reported using real-time data analytics or risk stratification tools to support population health initiatives. Vendors focusing on chronic disease management, preventive care, and regional analytics platforms can play a key role in helping Greek healthcare organizations harness data-driven care models that are still in early stages of development. Cybersecurity Innovation Needs With 95% of surveyed IT leaders citing significant gaps in cybersecurity, there is growing demand for security-as-a-service, cloud-based protections, and affordable infrastructure assessments tailored to smaller Greek hospitals and clinics. This represents a prime opportunity for cybersecurity firms with healthcare specialization to support compliance, resilience, and trust. Patient Experience Solutions In a companion survey, 97% of Greek patients reported never accessing their health records online, and 100% lacked confidence in their provider's digital tools. This signals a strong market opening for vendors offering secure patient portals, mobile health access, and education tools that empower individuals and improve engagement. Key HIMSS25 Europe Vendors Supporting Greece's Digital Health Needs Several vendors exhibiting and sponsoring at HIMSS25 Europe in Paris next week stand out as especially well-positioned to support Greece's digital transformation goals. These companies offer technologies directly aligned with the challenges facing Greek healthcare and are prepared to demonstrate scalable solutions that address EHR adoption, interoperability, analytics, and patient engagement. InterSystems will showcase their advanced data integration and interoperability platforms, which leverage HL7 FHIR to enable seamless data sharing which is an urgent need for fragmented Greek health systems. Dedalus , a vendor with deep roots in European healthcare, is offering regionally aligned EHR and population health management solutions that address local workflow gaps and regulatory complexities in Greece. Hyland is exhibiting its Content Innovation Cloud, designed to enhance document-based interoperability, support clinical content access, and reduce administrative burden, an important area for Greek hospitals with legacy infrastructure. Oracle Health and Epic Systems will also present end-to-end EHR platforms and AI-powered analytics tools that offer Greek providers the opportunity to benchmark against high-functioning, digitally mature health systems, should they be capable of encompassing the needs of the Greek healthcare systems, its providers and patients at a cost the Greek government and providers can afford. T-Systems , with its cybersecurity and managed IT offerings, will demonstrate solutions ideal for smaller hospitals in Greece needing affordable and scalable security frameworks. Greek CIOs and provider executives attending HIMSS25 Europe are encouraged to engage with these vendors, explore real-time demos, and evaluate how proven digital technologies can be adapted to Greece's local challenges and accelerate national interoperability progress. "This report reflects the voices of healthcare professionals and patients in Greece-not an opinion or judgment by our firm," said Douglas Brown, founder of Black Book Research. "With the right collaborations, local vendors and regional innovators have a real opportunity to drive digital transformation and close persistent technology gaps." "For Greek CIOs and healthcare leaders attending HIMSS25 Europe, this is a pivotal moment to explore firsthand the technologies reshaping connected care across the continent," Brown added. "Vendor demonstrations at the exhibition offer strategic insights into scalable interoperability frameworks, AI-driven analytics, secure cloud infrastructures, and patient engagement platforms-all critical components for modernizing Greek healthcare. The opportunity to benchmark with leading systems and meet innovators building regionalized EHR and data exchange solutions should not be missed." Furthermore, the 2025 World Index of Healthcare Innovation ranked Greece 26th out of 32 European countries in health digitization, possibly falling to last at 32 in 2026. The report highlighted that Greece is one of the least digitally connected countries in the index, limiting its ability to take full advantage of electronic health records and other digital health technologies. The 2025 Black Book of Global Healthcare Information Technology provides independent performance evaluations of healthcare IT systems and infrastructure in 44 countries. The Greece-specific findings are intended to guide policymakers, health institutions, and vendors toward high-impact modernization strategies.

Conducted ahead of the HIMSS25 European Health Conference & Exhibition in Paris (June 10-12), the survey identifies four major workforce challenges driving strategic shifts toward AI, virtual care, and automation. 1. Acute Nursing and Clinical Staff Shortages: Germany: 90% of healthcare executives reported critical nursing shortages, accelerating investments in AI-powered scheduling and remote patient monitoring. Spain: 73% emphasized significant shortages in nursing staff, prompting substantial adoption of automation technologies and digital scheduling. Switzerland: 60% cited critical gaps in frontline clinical roles, driving expansions in telemedicine and remote healthcare solutions. 2. Specialist and Technician Deficits: Italy: 75% highlighted severe specialist shortages, increasing deployment of virtual consultations and telemedicine. Netherlands: 78% prioritized remote patient monitoring due to persistent clinical technician shortages. Finland: 74% invested in remote diagnostic technologies to counteract widespread specialist shortages. 3. Staff Burnout and Operational Overload: France: 82% identified staff burnout as their primary challenge, significantly increasing adoption of virtual nursing assistants and automated administrative tools. Norway: 77% prioritized AI-driven administrative automation to alleviate clinician burnout and operational strain. Belgium: 72% focused investments on AI-powered scheduling systems to effectively manage staffing demands and reduce burnout. 4. Administrative Burden and Efficiency Pressures: United Kingdom: 78% actively evaluated AI-driven clinical decision support to reduce administrative workloads and enhance clinical efficiency. Ireland: 72% urgently adopted digital triage and virtual care platforms to manage escalating demands on emergency departments. Sweden: 69% accelerated digital transformation initiatives, especially telehealth platforms, to address rural clinician shortages. Denmark: 68% increased digital health budgets aimed at virtual care to mitigate staffing challenges in chronic disease management. "Europe's healthcare workforce crisis is compelling hospitals to quickly implement technological solutions," said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. "At HIMSS25 Europe, attendees will explore innovative digital strategies specifically designed to address critical staffing issues and strengthen healthcare delivery systems." At HIMSS25 Europe several confirmed sponsors and partners are poised to address the pressing healthcare workforce challenges identified in the recent Black Book Research survey.

Approximately 23% of the population in the surveyed 28 countries have opened digital bank accounts, spurring financial institutions to accelerate their digital initiatives and securely share data with third-party providers, thereby enhancing Open Banking adoption. The open banking market report highlights that regions like Asia-Pacific and the Middle East are leading in digitalization efforts, prompting increased investment in open banking solutions.

Open Banking Market Trend Transformation in Banking Onboarding - The onboarding process in banking is undergoing a significant transformation with the rise of open banking. Financial institutions are leveraging this trend to simplify the onboarding journey, reducing customer stress by allowing seamless access to user data and automating information retrieval. This not only enhances efficiency and user-friendliness but also prepares the way for a greater adoption of open banking solutions, ultimately contributing to substantial growth in the market as more consumers embrace these improvements. 2.) Factor Affecting Open Banking Market Growth The The surge in digital transformation has significantly increased online financial transactions, enhancing the convenience of banking services. However, this growth comes with heightened data security threats. Financial institutions are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing sensitive financial information through APIs, driven by fears of potential financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties linked to security breaches. This heightened sense of caution is impeding the widespread adoption of open banking practices. As a result, the market's potential for growth is being constrained, as institutions grapple with balancing innovation and robust security measures in an evolving digital landscape. 3.) Open Banking Market Driver In an increasingly globalized world, governments recognize the importance of fostering connections between financial institutions and consumers, both domestically and internationally. Countries such as the UK, Mexico, and the US are actively promoting the adoption of open banking services, which simplify cross-border financial transactions and enhance global trade relationships. Over the past decade, North American and European nations have also proactively worked to democratize access to financial products and services. A significant milestone in this effort was the European Banking Authority's introduction of the Payment Services Directive Two (PSD2) in 2015, which officially marked the beginning of the open banking era. Following this, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) implemented guidelines requiring banks to adopt open banking practices by 2018. These regulatory mandates have compelled banks to share their previously restricted financial data with third-party providers, encouraging more entities to enter the market and significantly driving the growth of the Global Open Banking Market. 4.) Global Open Banking Market Opportunity The Impact of CBDCs on the Financial Landscape - The emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is significantly transforming the financial landscape, with many countries exploring or implementing these digital versions of national currencies. Driven by the need to modernize financial systems and enhance monetary policy, over 10 nations have launched CBDCs, while over 100 others are exploring their possibilities, according to the Atlantic Council. China's digital yuan, a leading CBDC initiative, aims for expansion after its pilot began in 2014. As digital currencies gain traction, banks must adapt their systems to support these assets. This presents a unique opportunity for open banking solution providers to facilitate the integration of CBDCs into existing banking infrastructures, paving the way for growth in the Open Banking Market.

The commission would amend rules to close the door to nonconsensual mergers and acquisitions to ensure market stability, it said in a statement. In the future, acquiring financial firms must get a board resolution from the target company indicating no objection, or show that they can secure a majority of shares or board seats to complete the acquisition, the commission said. The name and logo of the Financial Supervisory Commission are pictured in New Taipei City on April 25. Photo: Kelson Wang, Taipei Times The changes aim to establish an environment for mergers and acquisitions in the financial sector while maintaining market stability, it said, adding that the proposed amendment would be open to public feedback for 60 days. Last year, the commission rejected CTBC Financial Holding Co’s (中信金控) takeover bid for smaller rival Shin Kong Financial Holding Co (新光金控), citing reasons including potential disputes over management rights. While Shin Kong Financial then pursued a separate, agreed merger, many analysts have said that Taiwan has too many financial groups for a country of about 23 million people. The proposed amendments would also demand that public takeovers be paid in cash, to avoid volatility in share prices. The commission also wants to increase the minimum initial investment by those seeking to take over a financial company, to 25 percent from 10 percent.

Huang, who arrived in Taiwan yesterday ahead of meetings with longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電), took the opportunity to clarify recent comments about the US-China AI race. The Nvidia head caused a stir in an interview this week with the Financial Times, in which he was quoted as saying “China will win” the AI race.

The acquisition is led by a special purchase company managed by KJR Management Ltd, a Japanese real-estate unit of private equity giant KKR & Co, people familiar with the matter said. KJR said it would act as asset manager together with Mizuho Real Estate Management Co.

In recent weeks, Chinese regulatory authorities have ordered such data centers that are less than 30 percent complete to remove all installed foreign chips, or cancel plans to purchase them, while projects in a more advanced stage would be decided on a case-by-case basis, the sources said.

RELATED TOPICS EGYPT FINTECH PHOTO Egypt - Sixteen companies have obtained financial technology (FinTech) licences from Egypt’s Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) and are spearheading digital transformation efforts in the non-banking sector, its chairperson Mohamed Farid said on Monday. Four companies currently offer outsourcing services and are registered with the authority, with new entrants anticipated, Farid stated. Speaking at the fourth edition of Caisec25, an information security and cybersecurity conference and exhibition in Cairo, Farid said that approximately 110 institutions and entities currently comply with the FRA’s cybersecurity requirements. He noted, however, that the total number of companies and institutions under the FRA’s supervision across various activities and markets exceeds 3,500. Farid added that four companies currently provide outsourcing services, with significant potential for this number to grow into the dozens. “These companies are listed in a special FRA registry and conduct electronic identification, verification, and authentication; electronic customer identification; electronic contracting for non-banking financial products; and electronic registration, storage, and retrieval from digital records,” he detailed. In his conference address, Farid outlined the FRA’s ongoing efforts to foster a secure and stable environment that strengthens the non-banking financial sector’s contribution to the national economy. This is part of its continuous endeavour to implement all necessary measures and policies to protect customer data and ensure market stability. “The Authority, as the regulator of the non-banking financial sector—which encompasses the capital market, insurance activities, and non-banking financing activities—places significant importance on cybersecurity,” Farid stated. “This involves developing policies and systems to protect customer data, thereby ensuring market stability, a key role for any financial sector regulator.” He emphasised that the FRA is working to create a secure data environment and stable markets for non-banking financial institutions, aiming to bolster the non-banking financial sector’s role in the national economy. Farid added that the regulatory framework established by the FRA primarily recognises that “cyberattacks and database breaches have become the new battleground.” Therefore, enhancing cybersecurity measures is crucial, “especially given the accelerating pace of digital transformation across all sectors, which, while creating new opportunities, also generates increased cyber threats,” he said. He explained that this “necessitates swift action to develop policies and operational systems that strengthen FinTech governance and ensure non-banking financial institutions utilise these technologies in a manner that promotes market stability.” The FRA chairperson noted the “rapid and revolutionary pace of development in artificial intelligence (AI),” stressing the importance of enhancing the recovery capabilities of institutions and markets, particularly as development inherently involves risks. He advocated for increased preparedness to ensure “a resilient non-banking financial sector capable of leveraging technological advancements and managing associated risks more efficiently and effectively.” Farid also highlighted that “technological capability development must go hand-in-hand with enhancing human resource efficiency to achieve desired objectives and bridge information gaps.” He explained that “the human element remains paramount in corporate business models,” and consequently, “specialists in electronic and cybersecurity technologies and innovations must focus on providing extensive, varied, and continuous training for personnel.” The FRA chairperson affirmed that such training has become essential following the recent acceleration in the digitisation of non-banking financial transactions. This acceleration was spurred by the FRA’s issuance of a package of executive decisions to implement Law No. 5 of 2022, which provides the regulatory and legislative framework for organising and promoting the use of technology in non-banking financial activities and services. He continued: “The Financial Regulatory Authority issued Decision No. 139 of 2023 concerning the technological equipment, infrastructure, information systems, and protection and security measures necessary for using FinTech to conduct non-banking financial activities. This was followed by Decision No. 140 of 2023, regarding digital identity, digital contracts, digital registries, and the scope of FinTech use in non-banking financial activities, along with compliance requirements. This latter decision is considered the first regulatory directive from financial sector supervisory bodies to detail requirements for electronic customer identification. Furthermore, Decision No. 141 of 2023 pertains to the outsourcing registry for FinTech in non-banking financial activities, specifying companies authorised to provide electronic customer identification and contract record services to financial firms in the sector.” © 2024 Daily News Egypt.

News / National SECZim seeks to bolster financial sector integrity by Staff reporter 08 May 2025 at 16:39hrs | 109 Views The Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe (SECZim) recently held a two-day workshop in Mutare focused on Anti-Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism, and Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/CPF) best practices, as part of its ongoing commitment to strengthening regulatory compliance and preserving the integrity of Zimbabwe's financial sector. The workshop was designed to equip financial sector players with the necessary tools and knowledge to ensure full compliance with AML/CFT/CPF regulations, reinforcing SECZim's determination to combat illicit financial activities in Zimbabwe's financial markets. In a statement, SECZim noted that the training was aimed at covering the comprehensive spectrum of AML/CFT/CPF compliance, preparing all involved to execute their obligations effectively. This initiative comes as the commission prepares for the third round of Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) mutual evaluations. "This training was structured to provide participants with the necessary skills to understand and implement AML/CFT/CPF regulations," read part of the statement. "The programme included SECZim presentations, a peer review exercise, a case study, and a multiple-choice assessment to further enhance the learning experience." SECZim's operations director, Mr. Norman Maferefa, emphasized the commission's commitment to enhancing AML/CFT/CPF awareness and compliance across Zimbabwe's financial sector. He also announced that further capacity-building opportunities are planned for 2025, focusing on both AML/CFT/CPF and prudential regulations. "The involvement of members from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Asset Forfeiture Unit during the training was essential, especially in light of the collaborative efforts conducted in partnership with the CID Training Centre," Maferefa said. Participants commended the workshop for its depth and practical insights, with one stating: "The training was thorough and informative. It helped me understand more about Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) in the context of AML, with a focus on empowering compliance officers and managers." Another participant added, "This training was invaluable, providing us with deeper insights into AML activities that stockbrokers need to understand to contribute to the economy's growth." The AML/CFT/CPF compliance training covered a broad range of topics, from foundational concepts to more advanced subjects, including governance, enterprise-wide risk assessment, key elements of AML/CFT/CPF policy, customer due diligence (CDD), Know Your Customer (KYC) principles, and customer risk assessments.

Home Business From glass ceilings to corner offices By collaborating with governments, businesses, and regulators, ACCA ensures that financial inclusion is a reality Sponsored Content May 01, 2025 SPONSORED 4 min read facebook twitter whatsup linkded email Association of Chartered Certified Accountants Press Release Throughout history, the financial sector has predominantly been shaped by male leadership. However, as time has progressed, the landscape has transformed, with an increasing number of women breaking barriers and stepping into influential roles. This shift not only brings diverse perspectives but also reshapes the industries for the better. Ayla Majid, the first South Asian to lead the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) stands as a testament to this evolution. In her role as the President of ACCA and a leader in corporate governance, energy, decarbonisation, and finance, she illustrates how talent from our region is stepping into global leadership roles across corporate, academic, and public sectors. Women’s progress in finance: A Global perspective Throughout the world, women’s leadership role in finance has been increasing with them fostering innovation and showing resilience. Within the FTSE 350 companies, women now hold 43.4% of board positions. Yet, the financial sector still has a long way to go in achieving true inclusivity as their representation in executive roles has only seen a slight increase of 5% over the past three years. According to ACCA’s Leading Inclusion: Simple Steps and Significant Leaps report, gender diversity in finance helps improve decision-making, strengthens governance, and leads to more sustainable business practices. Inclusive organisations have consistently outperformed others by bringing in diverse perspectives and innovative approaches. Along with serving as the President of ACCA, Ms Majid has successfully held board positions including chairing boards across various industries - energy, banking, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. Over the past 15 years, she has seen significant progress in enhancing diversity and inclusion in leadership, but much more remains to be done. While women have come a long way, their participation in the Pakistani workforce has been consistently low with a labour force participation of approximately 22.74% as of 2023 significantly below the global average of 52.6% . The disparity is further reflected in the corporate sector in 2023, where women held only 3% of CEO roles among listed companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange which further emphasises on the persistent gender gap in executive roles and employment within the corporate landscape of Pakistan. The economic imperative of financial inclusivity When women lead, economies thrive; hence it is an economic imperative!! A financial times research highlights that an increase in women’s participation in the workforce helps to boost global GDP significantly while simultaneously helping in stronger risk management and innovation in the financial sector. How so? Research by McKinsey indicates that companies with the highest proportion of women on executive committees earn 47% higher returns on equity than those with no women executives over a 10-year period, indicating that inclusiveness needs to be strengthened further. Cultural normals and institutional challenges are one the major barrier women face which restrict stheir access to leadership roles and limits their operationally to excel in the financial sector. Regardless of progress being made, a pressing need for structured intervention is still important to promote and support the professional growth of women. Skill development and mentorship opportunities along with introducing flexible policies such as remote work options and equal parental leave are crucial to support career advancement and support work life balance. It is also imperative for progress to be driven by creating spaces and platforms that enable women to connect, share and support each other, which leads to more inclusive workplace cultures. Initiatives like ACCA’s Women in Finance provide mentorship, guidance, and advocacy to help women advance in their careers wherewomen have the opportunity to lead, innovate, and drive meaningful change. The role of professional bodies in advancing inclusion Professional bodies play a significant role in progressing financial inclusion by setting up industry standards and driving policy changes to create a more diverse culture. ACCA has successfully been at the forefront of this effort by promoting gender diversity within the profession where approximately 50% of our global membership comprises of women Through research, advocacy, and collaboration with governments, businesses and regulators, ACCA continues to work to ensure that financial inclusion is not just a goal, but a measurable reality. As well as promoting and measuring inclusivity in finance, ACCA's Leading Inclusion report highlights the importance of data-driven approaches. Research also indicates that teams perform better when organisations have a diverse leadership team, with a McKinsey study finding that companies with a high gender diversity rate outperform their peers by 25% . Therefore, such evidence based strategies and data driven insights will help to break systematic barriers which will lead to a financial sector where opportunity and talent are accessible to all. Looking ahead: The path towards sustainable change The journey to create a more inclusive financial sector is on going which requires unwavering support and commitment from policy makers, organisations and industry players to create environments where women can thrive The future of finance now depends on the ability to accept and drive talent. Prioritising inclusivity and removing the barriers women face will help to create a profession which is more resilient and equitable which may ultimately reflect the world we live in – one that is enhanced by innovation and diverse perspectives. facebook twitter whatsup linkded email COMMENTS Replying to X Saved !

RELATED TOPICS UAE RELATED COMPANIES EMIRATES NEWS PHOTO Dubai, UAE, The Ministry of Finance is all set to host the second edition of the “Financial Media Forum” on 1 May under the theme “Shaping the Future of Financial sector: The Balance Between Influence and Responsibility”. Held in collaboration with the media and educational insinuations across the UAE, the event aims to promote transparency and financial literacy. Building on the success of its first edition, the forum will bring together subject-matter experts and decision-makers to explore current trends in the financial sector and the evolving role of the media in shaping public financial awareness. Also taking part in the event are government officials, along with representatives from over 40 financial, media, and academic institutions, in addition to more than 100 participants, including journalists, university students specialising in finance and economics, and representatives from public and private sector institutions. The gathering will be inaugurated by His Excellency Younis Haji AlKhoori, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance.

We want to promote financial literacy and improve economic transparency, in line with the government’s vision for achieving sustainability and long-term economic growth. Today, financial media is more important than ever. It plays a fundamental role in delivering accurate information and interpreting economic trends—contributing to the development of a society that is not only informed but also capable of adapting to changes, whether at the level of government, businesses, or individuals, he further said. Forum Agenda The forum, taking place in Dubai, aims to explore the future of the UAE’s financial sector through a series of panel discussions. Key topics on the agenda include the future of the financial landscape, public-private partnerships, sustainability and the future of government spending, the role of media in enhancing financial literacy, and a dedicated session on financial awareness and social welfare.

However, growth may rebound in the medium term with key reforms. The World Bank urges bold action in financial sector reform, trade facilitation, and revenue mobilisation to strengthen resilience. A significant decrease in export growth and low investment have contributed to economic slowdown in Bangladesh in fiscal 2024 (FY24), however, growth is expected to rebound in the medium term, said the World Bank in its twice-yearly update. The latest Bangladesh Development Update highlights the recent economic developments and outlook for the medium term, with a special focus on financial sector stability. After a fall in real GDP growth to 4.2 per cent in FY24 from 5.8 per cent in FY23, economic activity slowed further in FY25. The economy continues to face significant challenges, including investment moderation, elevated inflation and vulnerabilities within the financial sector. However, external sector pressures have apparently eased, with robust growth in remittance inflows and exports bolstering the current account balance in FY25. Real GDP growth is projected to further moderate to 3.3 per cent in FY25 due to declining private and public investment. Political uncertainty and rising costs associated with borrowing and inputs are expected to constrain private investment growth and keep industrial growth subdued. Public investment will decline as the government reduces capital expenditure in FY25. The fiscal deficit is expected to remain under 5 per cent of GDP in the medium term, with capital expenditure increasing only gradually. Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the near term. Bangladesh's GDP growth slowed to 4.2 per cent in FY24 and is projected to decline to 3.3 per cent in FY25 due to low investment, inflation, and financial sector vulnerabilities. However, growth may rebound in the medium term with key reforms. The World Bank urges bold action in financial sector reform, trade facilitation, and revenue mobilisation to strengthen resilience. “Multiple shocks over the past decade have left South Asian countries with limited buffers to withstand an increasingly challenging global environment,” said Martin Raiser, World Bank vice president for South Asia . “The region needs targeted reforms to strengthen economic resilience and unlock faster growth and job creation. Now is the time to open to trade, modernise agricultural sectors, and boost private sector dynamism.” “Bangladesh will need bold and urgent reforms to bolster the financial sector, facilitate trade, and enhance domestic revenue mobilisation,” Gayle Martin, World Bank interim country director for Bangladesh, said in a press release. Real GDP is expected to rise gradually in the medium term, if backed by critical reforms. Inflation is expected to gradually subside in the medium term on the back of tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation and easing import restrictions on key food commodities. Rising trade uncertainties are expected to put pressure on the external sector. “The risks to the outlook are on the downside as uncertainties related to trade, persistent inflationary pressure, weak demand in Bangladesh's major export markets, and intensifying financial sector vulnerabilities could weigh on growth,” said Dhruv Sharma, World Bank senior economist and co-author of the report .

Mr Julapun was speaking at the Lotte Hotel Seoul during the 2025 Ignite Thailand–Korea Business Forum, held to promote business relations between Thailand and South Korea. The two-day forum, which ended on Wednesday, was co-hosted by the Royal Thai Embassy in South Korea, The Korea Herald, the Thailand Industrial Estate Authority, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), the Asean-Korea Centre, and the Korean-Thai Chamber of Commerce. Mr Julapun said the initiatives are built on four foundations. These include a commitment to providing transparent and globally competitive incentives, such as a clear tax framework, a streamlined company registration process, and an expedited pathway for foreign professionals and investors. Another key area is the establishment of world-class regulatory standards, spearheaded by the Supervisory and Promotion of Financial Hub Business. He also highlighted the prioritisation of human capital development, aimed at helping the workforce achieve technological expertise, digital proficiency, and cross-cultural competence. Lastly, the initiatives include a clear strategy for market participation, focusing on cross-border regional financial transactions while encouraging partnerships between international financial players and domestic firms where mutually beneficial. He added that he would like to encourage South Korean financial institutions, investors, and businesses to invest in these initiatives and in Thailand’s financial sector. He said Thailand’s strategic location offers South Korean investors an efficient gateway to the emerging Southeast Asian market, while providing cost-effective solutions that complement — rather than compete with — established financial hubs like Seoul. “It will create targeted opportunities for Korean businesses, offering a reliable gateway to Southeast Asia’s vibrant economies, supported by favourable incentives and adaptable solutions,” he told the forum. Furthermore, Thailand is strongly committed to sustainable finance and responsible digital innovation, especially in this time of climate urgency. The country also offers regulatory clarity around digital assets, blockchain, and fintech — paving the way for revolutionary financial services while upholding international standards. Such collaboration would significantly upskill Thai professionals, Mr Julapun said. KEYWORDS Financial hub Thailand South Korea Do you like the content of this article? COMMENT (1)

The AI features will be integrated into 10x's modern, cloud-native meta core banking platform. Unveiled in July last year, the meta core is a new next-generation category of core that solves the challenges of legacy cores and avoids the complex set-up and scale challenges of neo cores, providing a de-risked, accelerated path to full cloud-native transformation. Research commissioned by 10x Banking, surveying over 200 senior IT decision-makers in banking and Financial Services, reveals that only 32% of banks are currently using AI at the core. Almost half (41%) cite AI integration with third-party platforms as their top challenge. For the first time financial institutions and banks will be able to leverage AI in the core in a meaningful way to speed up innovation, offer real-time personalised products and reduce their cost to serve. The new AI capabilities mean banks can automate the mapping of legacy banking data to accelerate core migration, create and launch new financial products to market in days rather than months and be able to access granular real-time insights, instead of relying on IT teams for outdated batch reports. With the 10x Banking Platform, banks can deliver market-leading scale to their corporate customers in real time and achieve flexibility and security in product and deployment. Importantly, the 10x Banking Platform provides corporate banks with a core solution, capable of meeting the scale of their operations in real time, supporting over 100,000 transactions per second per bank and up to 2,000 transactions per individual customer account approximately 80x faster than legacy batch transactions. Antony Jenkins, Founder and CEO of 10x Banking said, " To get the full benefits of AI, you've got to have real-time data at scale. That's where 10x's meta core really stands out, delivering real-time insights at massive scale combined with a suite of AI capabilities that can work with bank's existing systems The 10x Banking AI product suite will comprise of three cutting-edge AI-powered solutions purpose-built to address industry-wide challenges and unlock the tremendous opportunity of AI-driven banking. AI Migrate AI-powered legacy data mapping, automating the complex migration process to reduce risk, cut costs, and accelerate transformation. AI Build GenAI-driven product customisation, enabling banks to create and test new innovative products in minutes without engineering bottlenecks AI View Instant AI-driven data insights, providing instant access to key banking metrics without manual reporting or IT dependencies. Antony Jenkins, Founder and CEO of 10x Banking continued, " Legacy platforms slow down innovation and decision-making migrating to more modern cloud-native cores has historically been costly, complex, and time-consuming. We created 10x to help build better banks and that means putting the customer at the centre of all they do. In today's world, that means harnessing real-time data and AI but only 32% of banks have achieved this in any meaningful way. These new capabilities mean banks can finally move at the speed of AI to better serve their customers 10x Banking's CPO Okan Ozaltin will present at Money2020 Asia (22 nd April 14.00 ICT).

Addressing entrepreneurs, financial leaders, and government officials, President Mahama touched on rebuilding Ghana’s economy through a strong, inclusive financial sector. Here are six key initiatives President Mahama outlined in his speech to help transform Ghana's economy. Role of financial sector in empowering businesses President Mahama emphasised the need for the financial sector to drive economic growth for all businesses. “The financial sector is the bloodstream of any economy. Without it, businesses cannot grow, jobs cannot be created, and innovation cannot thrive,” he stated. He reiterated the need for the financial system to support a broad range of businesses, from roadside vendors to large manufacturers, to build a resilient economy. Launch of a National Venture Capital Fund As part of efforts to support youth-and women-led businesses, President Mahama announced plans to launch a national venture capital fund. “We will launch a national venture capital fund to support youth- and women-led businesses and introduce regulatory reforms that encourage banks and financial institutions to lend to productive sectors of the economy. "Financial inclusion will be at the heart of this agenda. No economy can grow if its people remain excluded from formal financial systems. We will work with banks, fintechs, and mobile money operators to expand access to financial services, particularly in rural and underserved communities", he noted. The 24-Hour Economy Addressing his vision for the 24-Hour Economy, President Mahama emphasised that the initiative also aims to create an environment where businesses can operate seamlessly around the clock. “The future of business in Ghana must be digital, green, and inclusive. We are entering an era where digital infrastructure is just as important as roads and bridges. As part of our 24-Hour Economy strategy, we will establish the necessary conditions, through reliable electricity, efficient logistics, and enhanced public safety, for businesses to operate continuously. “This will boost productivity, create jobs, and expand opportunities across the country,” he said. Jobs and Skills compact to align education with industry He further announced the introduction of a “Jobs and Skills Compact” to align education and training skills with industry demands "We will provide incentives to companies that create sustainable, decent jobs, and support youth entrepreneurship to unlock the creativity of our young people. "Our vision is a Ghana where no young person needs to leave their hometown in search of opportunity. Where communities like Mpraeso, Nkawkaw, and Abetifi become hubs of innovation, enterprise, and decent work", he stated. Economic recovery with focus on transformation President Mahama acknowledged the challenges facing the country, including inflation, a weakened cedi, and rising debt, but expressed optimism about Ghana’s path to recovery. “There are early signs of macroeconomic stabilization: inflation is gradually easing, and with disciplined management, we are restoring a measure of confidence in our economy,” he stated. Restoration of investor confidence President Mahama talked about steps to build investor confidence, such as being more transparent and making sure investments follow clear and fair rules. "We are pursuing a targeted program to restore investor confidence by enhancing transparency, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and promoting a rules-based investment climate. "We are prioritising sectors that can absorb labour and grow our economy sustainably agro-processing, ICT, manufacturing, tourism, renewable energy, and the green economy. But our focus is not only on attracting foreign investment. We are equally committed to empowering Ghanaians to become owners and drivers of enterprise", he noted.

E-mail lunthesis@163.com Phone 0551-65179860-203 Home Page Photos Hui Culture Travel Guide Audio & Video Sci-tech Service Publications China improves cross-border flow of financial data Pub Date: 2025-04-18 09:51 Source: Xinhua BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a guideline to facilitate and regulate cross-border flow of financial data amid efforts to boost high-standard opening up of the financial sector, the central bank said Thursday. The guideline, released by six departments, including the People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, aims to improve efficiency and compliance of cross-border flow of financial data. It further clarifies the conditions for data export and specifies the list of data items permitted for cross-border transfer to facilitate smoother data flow. Regarding areas such as cross-border payments, remittances, account openings, and shopping, the guideline specifies scenarios where data export is exempt from security assessments for outbound data transfers, where personal information export standard contracts can be signed, or where data export is permitted through personal information protection certification. For cases where data cross-border compliance obligations cannot be exempted but practical needs require data export, the guideline has categorized over 60 common financial business scenarios. Financial institutions should adopt effective data security protection efforts and technical measures to safeguard data security, according to the guideline. Industry experts believe that providing financial institutions with clear regulatory guidance will facilitate safer, more orderly, and efficient cross-border data flow in the financial sector. This will help create a more business-friendly and inclusive environment, further enhancing international competitiveness, as well as influence in rule-making.■ Editor:Zheng Chen Related News - Column: Cambodia-China ties -- A partnership built on mut... 2025-04-18 09:51 - Official: Domestic demand contributes to 80% of China's e... 2025-04-17 19:37 - GLOBALink | Chinese-invested expressway benefits liveliho... 2025-04-17 16:39 - Across China: China rides new wave of inbound cruise tour... 2025-04-17 16:39 photo >> Wuhu, Anhui: 100,000 mu of canola flowers blossoming Guest countries of honor attract visitors at 6th CIIE Video >> Anhui Perfectly Integrates Culture and Technology into Its Development Global Influencers at iFLYTEK 1024 Global Developer Festival: Why Chinese AI Shocks the World？ People >> Hebei rolls out red carpet for talent Transnational couple revives ancient dwelling in east China Travel >> 出发 世界屋脊 八廓街 City Walk Contact Us Copyright ©2000-2021 anhuinews.com All rights reserved.

Key Points Consent managers enhance personal data protection Financial sector demonstrates advanced digital governance DPDPA introduces progressive data handling regulations New Delhi, April 12 The Indian financial sector is highly digitized, with established consent-based data sharing and governance structures in place, experts said on Saturday and noted that rules concerning the Digital Personal Data Protection Act provide a framework towards a more accountable digital ecosystem while also presenting some challenges. "The financial sector in India is not only most digitized or matured ecosystem, it's also deeply regulated. - Saranya Gopinath, Razorpay" Speaking at the 9th Carnegie Global Tech Summit on Saturday during the session 'India's approach to data governance', they said that consent managers could help manage personal information and age-gating mechanisms are geared towards restricting children's access to harmful content. Saranya Gopinath, director, government affairs and policy, Razorpay, said it is a matter of great comfort for people that India's financial sector is properly regulated and governed. "The financial sector in India is not only most digitized or matured ecosystem, it's also deeply regulated. As citizens, we can all take a lot of comfort in the fact that it is deeply governed," she said. Asked about the changes the financial sector will face due to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), she noted that the financial sector is already familiar with concepts like consent and data sharing, and has advanced data structures in place. Gopinath said substantial thought has been given towards individual rights in the financial sector. She said banks undergo regular audits and there are protocols for data handling. "Consent is not an alien term in the financial sector. It is an understood concept," she said. Bhuvnesh Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, spoke about the provisions of DPDP Act including "right to be forgotten". He laid thrust on the significance of rules regarding the legislation. Aman Jain, Director of Public Policy at Amazon, said global companies can face challenges in implementing the provisions of DPDPA regarding data storage and deletion. Jain highlighted the challenge of identifying the data principal in cases where a single device is used by multiple individuals, such as a household. In such cases, it is difficult to determine who the data principal is and how their rights should be protected. "When the Act came out, a lot of us in the industry said, Look, this is progressive. This is different. You know, when the details came out and the rules came out, suddenly, the government announced that there'll be a committee that will decide on what data subjects can be or topics can be under data localization," he said. He said the draft rules require e-commerce companies to automatically delete data of user after three years after it is not required. "Let's say you've gone on Amazon, you bought something today, and come 2027 we are required to delete your data if you've been inactive in that period. Now, practically, what ends up happening is we have enough use cases of folks coming back because they want to see if the warranty still exists for a TV they bought five years back, right? Or they just want to know the model you don't remember it you bought something," he said. "I had a thing very recently, where I wanted to check what book I bought in 2015? And I need to be able to go back. And it doesn't mean that I need to, you know, we'd love you to shop every single day. But if you were inactive for a little while and then you were going back, then you it just creates for bad experience, right? So, so that's, I think, one so practical example," he added. Sunil Abraham, Public Policy Director for Data Economy and Emerging Tech at Meta India, said the decision to leave the regulations technologically neutral and future-proof is a step in the right direction. - ANI India's Data Protection Act Reshapes Digital Financial Ecosystem The Carnegie Global Tech Summit highlighted India's progressive stance on digital data protection and governance in the financial sector. Experts discussed the nuanced approach of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, emphasizing consent-based frameworks and robust regulatory mechanisms. Industry leaders like Saranya Gopinath and Aman Jain shared insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by the new legislation.

This is such an important discussion! India's digital infrastructure is truly world-class. The consent-based approach makes me feel much safer about online transactions. 👏 R Rahul K. While I appreciate the protections, the 3-year data deletion rule seems impractical. Like the Amazon example shows, we often need access to older purchase records. Maybe there should be an opt-in system for data retention? A Anjali P. The 'right to be forgotten' provision is interesting but how will it work in practice? If I delete my UPI history, will banks still have access for regulatory purposes? More clarity needed. S Sanjay D. Great to see India leading in digital governance! The financial sector's maturity gives me confidence in digital payments. Though I wonder how small businesses will adapt to these new regulations. N Neha T. Age-gating mechanisms for children are long overdue! As a parent, I'm relieved to see this being discussed. The internet can be dangerous for kids without proper safeguards. V Vikram S.

Title: AI In FinTech : Revolution Or Threat ?

Innovation AI In FinTech: Revolution Or Threat? By Andrew Riabchuk , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Apr 09, 2025, 07:00am EDT Share Save Andrew Riabchuk is the Founder and CTO of Akurateco , a white-label payment gateway platform driving innovation in fintech. getty Artificial intelligence (AI), no longer a mere trend, is emerging as a powerful tool in the transformation of the financial sector. Its versatility and speed offer advantages from optimizing processes and reducing costs to enhancing security. However, beneath these opportunities lie hidden risks and ethical challenges that the industry is only beginning to confront. The question arises: Is AI a true revolution in financial technology, or does it introduce threats that need to be carefully managed? AI In Financial Technologies: What Lies Behind The Term? Today, much of the conversation centers on large language models (LLMs), which have proven effective in areas like text generation and image creation. Yet, AI encompasses a much broader range of technologies and approaches. Algorithms capable of identifying patterns in data offer solutions even when data isn’t directly comparable. Machine learning and the use of LLMs—powering systems like ChatGPT, Le Chat and DeepSeek—open significant opportunities, particularly in the fight against fraud within the financial sector. AI models are being used to filter traffic and detect anomalies, enabling the timely identification of fraudulent transactions. The Positive Impact Of AI On Financial Technologies AI holds the potential to replace the human factor in certain aspects of the financial sector, eliminating errors and improving service quality. However, such a statement requires nuance. While AI can drive greater efficiency, its implementation is not without risks. A study published in Artificial Intelligence and Law in 2024 highlighted how algorithms can be biased, leading to unfair decisions. This concern is especially pertinent in financial services. In this context, questions about accountability arise, particularly when it comes to safeguarding sensitive data. Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI systems is critical. Cybersecurity risks also play a significant role. The U.S. Department of the Treasury outlined unique threats AI presents in the financial sector in a 2024 report . These risks call for the adoption of best practices for data protection and anomaly monitoring to mitigate potential cyberattacks. However, AI doesn’t replace an architectural approach; instead, it helps analyze large amounts of data, identify anomalies and automate security processes. Its strength lies in processing logs, predicting threats and optimizing responses. Machine Learning In Fraud Prevention And Payment Process Optimization Machine learning has long been a valuable asset in combating fraud. By analyzing data within financial transactions and identifying anomalies, AI can pinpoint suspicious activity, reducing the chances of financial loss. Additionally, AI helps optimize payment processes by streamlining transaction routes, improving conversion rates and lowering costs. For payment solution providers relying on multiple financial partners, such optimizations are key to selecting the most effective path for each transaction. AI In Payment System Automation And Software Development AI plays an essential role in automating payment processes, from creating integrations to updating systems. By speeding up integration creation, AI reduces labor costs and enhances user experience. However, it’s important to acknowledge that AI models can occasionally produce incorrect or suboptimal solutions, necessitating additional verification before implementation. The Future Of AI In The Financial Sector The potential for AI to optimize and improve processes in the financial sector is vast. However, successful implementation requires careful attention to ethical considerations, cybersecurity and algorithmic transparency. Data quality is foundational for AI model accuracy, and ongoing auditing for bias or errors is necessary to improve reliability and minimize risks. Establishing clear ethical standards for AI is essential to avoid unintended consequences like discrimination or data leakage. These standards will safeguard the ethical and responsible use of this technology. Equally important is cybersecurity. Protecting AI systems from attacks and maintaining constant anomaly detection is critical for their reliable operation. AI is not a superintelligence but a powerful tool for rapid data search and analysis. It should not replace human thinking but only help implement ideas. Ethical questions arise when AI is perceived as an independent entity rather than a tool requiring responsible use and independent audit. While AI presents numerous opportunities, its integration into the financial sector must be approached cautiously. Ultimately, a strong focus on security and risk management will ensure its safe and effective use.

New Delhi, April 5 : India's financial system has become more resilient and diverse, driven by rapid economic growth, and regulatory framework in securities markets has been enhanced in line with international practice to manage and prevent emerging risks, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said on Saturday, citing a latest IMF-Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report. New Delhi, April 5 (IANS) Indiaâ€™s financial system has become more resilient and diverse, driven by rapid economic growth, and regulatory framework in securities markets has been enhanced in line with international practice to manage and prevent emerging risks, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said on Saturday, citing a latest IMF-Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report. The markets regulator said, in a statement, that the financial sector in India has shown recovery from various distress episodes of the 2010s and withstood the pandemic well. "In terms of evolution of the financial sector landscape, the Non-Banking Financial Intermediaries (NBFI) sector has become diverse but more interconnected. Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have sufficient aggregate capital to support moderate lending even in severe macro-financial scenarios," the SEBI said, citing the IMF report findings. On regulation and supervision of NBFCs, the IMF acknowledged Indiaâ€™s systematic approach for prudential requirements of NBFCs with scale based regulatory framework. The IMF also appreciated Indiaâ€™s approach on introduction of bank-like Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for large NBFCs. For supervision of banks, the IMF suggested strengthening credit risk management through "IFSR 9 adoption and upgrading supervision over individual loans, collateral valuation, connected borrower groups, large exposure limits, and related-party transactions". The report further stated that notable improvements include establishing the Corporate Debt Market Development Fund (CDMDF), introducing swing pricing, and liquidity requirements for bond mutual funds. The regulatory scope has also been expanded over emerging areas such as sustainability and investor protection measures for fast-growing equity derivatives products, according to the IMF-FSSA report. According to the SEBI, the "FSSA report acknowledges that Indiaâ€™s insurance sector is strong and growing, with a significant presence in both life and general insurance. The sector has remained stable, supported by better regulations and digital innovations". The report noted Indiaâ€™s progress in improving oversight, risk management and governance and suggests further steps toward risk-based solvency/supervision frameworks and stronger group supervision. It acknowledged transition plans towards a risk-based approach in the insurance sector. "This reflects Indiaâ€™s commitment to global best practices and a resilient insurance sector," said the capital markets regulator. The Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP), a joint programme of the IMF and the World Bank (WB), undertakes a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a countryâ€™s financial sector.
