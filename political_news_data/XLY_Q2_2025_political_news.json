Mehr Bajaj, Mehak Sidhu Mehr Bajaj , Mehak Sidhu Published on : 10 Jun 2025, 8:29 am 6 min read Copied Follow Us \"Let’s name it ‘Lyft’- like ‘Lift’, but cooler.\" That, one imagines, was the kind of offbeat eureka that launched one of the world’s most recognisable ride-sharing brands. “Lyft” is now a textbook case of how a subtle deviation in spelling can infuse a brand with distinctiveness, visual appeal, and, crucially, a better shot at trade mark protection. But what happens when this deliberate distortion treads into legally ambiguous territory - descriptive, deceptive, or even distasteful? Lyft As intellectual property practitioners, we frequently navigate this odd and often treacherous corridor where branding creativity meets statutory scrutiny. This article unpacks the curious legal journey of misspelt trade marks in India: when they work, where they falter, and how brands can wield them strategically without stumbling into pitfalls. Why Misspellings Matter: Distinction in a Crowded Market In a saturated consumer economy, misspellings have evolved into deliberate branding tools. From “Krispy Kreme” and “BLVCK Paris” to “Nykd”, these deviations help brands stand out, secure domain names, and appeal to digital-savvy audiences. However, what works in marketing doesn’t always pass muster in the legal theatre of trade mark law, especially in India, where statutory and judicial interpretations lean toward consumer clarity over creative flair. Registrability: A Thin Line between Clever and Common Under Section 9 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, marks that are descriptive or lack distinctiveness are barred from registration. Many misspelt marks originate from generic terms. So the test lies in whether a creative spelling sufficiently departs from the descriptive term, or does it merely disguise it? For instance, “SHOEZZ” for footwear remains phonetically identical to “Shoes.\" Unless secondary meaning is shown through use, it likely faces rejection. The courts have echoed this sentiment in PhonePe Pvt. Ltd. v. Ezy Services & Anr. CS (COMM) No. 292 of 2019 , the Delhi High Court held that the suffix “Pe” (a stylised “Pay”) was descriptive in the fintech context. PhonePe’s creative spelling didn’t qualify for protection. The Court noted that phonetic similarity to generic terms isn’t shielded by orthographic invention. PhonePe and BharatPe with Delhi High Court By contrast, in ITC Ltd. v. Nestle India Ltd, 2013 (53) PTC 493 (Del) , the Court allowed registration of “Kwality Walls”, holding that secondary meaning through extensive use could overcome descriptiveness. Similarly, Delhivery Pvt. Ltd. v. Treasure Vase Ventures Pvt. Ltd ., 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2634 upheld protection of “DEL H IVERY” for having acquired distinctiveness despite its phonetic similarity to “delivery”. Kwality Walls and Delhivery The Relative Risk of Phonetic Proximity Section 11 bars registration of deceptively similar marks. Courts adopt a consumer-centric approach, factoring in imperfect recollection and overall commercial impression. In Starbucks Corp. v. Sardarbuksh Coffee & Co. CS (COMM) 1007/2018 , the Delhi High Court ruled that the humorous twist in “Sardarbuksh” didn’t shield it from being confusingly similar to “Starbucks”. Creativity does not excuse consumer confusion. Sardar-Ji-Bakhsh Coffee & Co, renamed after the dispute The Naughty Corner: When Misspelling Masks Vulgarity Occasionally, brands flirt with misspellings that edge into moral or cultural sensitivities. The FCUK Phenomenon: French Connection UK’s brand name, designed to shock, resembled a swear word. It stirred regulatory heat globally and faced objections on moral grounds. French Connection United Kingdom In India, Section 9(2)(c) prohibits registration of marks that are obscene or scandalous or hurt religious susceptibilities. Indian authorities have refused registration to stylised variants resembling profanity, even where spelt innocently. For instance, an Indian apparel applicant (Class 25, App. No. 5474905) faced refusal for a mark resembling offensive language, despite the stylised misspelling. Cybersquatting and Digital Deception Misspelt trade marks offer several commercial benefits. They may help evade existing trade marks, secure easier domain name registration, and resonate with younger audiences attuned to text-speak and internet slang. Brands like Zypp Electric (from \"Zip\") or Froot Loops are examples of this trend. But such marks are prime cybersquatting targets. In Yahoo Inc. v. Akash Arora , 1999 PTC (19) 201 (Del) , the Court found that minor domain name changes still caused confusion and granted relief. Spelling differences are not a defence if public confusion arises. Yahoo Modern Branding vs. Consumer Psychology Recent behavioural research adds another layer. A 2023 study in the Journal of Marketing found that consumers often perceive misspelt names as gimmicky. Consumers showed: - 13.6% preference for “Clear” over “Klear”; - 33.6% higher purchase intent for “Fresh” over “Phresh”; - Decreased trust unless the misspelling was contextually justified. Unusual spellings must align with brand values or purpose; otherwise, they risk undermining credibility. Per the study, unusual spellings are often seen as marketing tactics to appear trendy, which can come across as disingenuous and lead to negative reactions and reduced purchase intent. Typo Tricks: When Misspelling Works Having said that, when done strategically, misspellings can produce strong marks: - Tumblr : Suggestive, tech-savvy, and distinctive. - Flickr : phonetically intuitive but not descriptive. - Google : a twist on “googol”, with no prior meaning. These examples succeed because their distinctiveness is not superficial; it's conceptual and rooted in function as source identifiers. The regulators often note that misspellings only work when they are striking, surprising, or demand mental effort, such as D’LICIOUS instead of “Delicious”. Google BVLGARI: A case study in strategic misspelling BVLGARI, the Italian luxury brand, offers a compelling example of how a deliberate misspelling/ stylised spelling can transform a brand name into a distinctive and legally protected trade mark. It stylises its name with a “V” in place of “U” (Latin orthography) to reflect its Roman roots. This historical styling enhances its uniqueness and global appeal. BVLGARI BVLGARI holds registrations for both “BVLGARI” and “BULGARI”, covering a wide array of goods and services. The brand also registers design elements like SERPENTI, B.ZERO1, and its Hindi transliteration बुल्गरी, showing a comprehensive strategy. Key Takeaways for Brand Owners As a trade mark counsel, we often advise clients that creative spelling is not a legal silver bullet, and the below checklist for navigating this space should be kept handy: 1. Avoid mere phonetic alterations of descriptive terms. If “Bright Kleen” is just “Bright Clean”, it's still descriptive. 2. Secure both original and creative variants for protection and use. 3. Don’t assume humour or edginess equals registrability. Be especially cautious of marks that may offend public decency or cultural sensitivities. 4. Aim for suggestive or fanciful constructions. If it makes people think (rather than just describe), you’re in safer territory. 5. Secure evidence of acquired distinctiveness if the mark has been in long-standing use. 6. Always conduct a thorough availability search, because a clever misspelling may already be taken. The Strategic Sword: Brand Play or Legal Gamble? Consequently, misspelling is not a free pass to registrability or enforceability. The Indian courts consistently hold that distinctiveness must be substantive and not merely orthographic. Enforcement, too, is complicated. Under Section 29, infringement includes unauthorised use of similar marks. But proving deceptive similarity is harder with altered spellings. Courts assess phonetics, structure, trade channels, and consumer impression. In passing off, brands must prove misrepresentation and the likelihood of confusion. With online visibility dominating, the burden of proving bad faith grows heavier. Defendants may claim creativity or coincidence, further muddying enforcement waters. Conclusion: Spellbound, Not Spelt Right Misspelling, when done right, is both art and strategy. It can unlock registrability, attract attention, and convey uniqueness. Whether you’re launching a new start-up or rebranding an existing product, remember: distinctiveness, not just different spelling, is what the law values. So, go ahead, bend the dictionary if you must. But don’t forget to ask your trade mark attorney before you try to “Kreate Kool Kleaning Koncepts” for your business. Because in the world of trade marks, a clever twist today can become a litigation tangle tomorrow. In the grander scheme, the judiciary has been consistent: creativity is welcome, but consumer clarity is paramount.

The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state’s growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal. The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim’s board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee. FILE - A man walks past a storefront inside Mall of the Emirates in in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Thursday, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Fatima Shbair, File) In 2022, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim’s founder — also named Majid Al Futtaim — following his death in 2021. Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies. The changes “reflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,” the company said in a statement. “These changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.” Dubai’s government did not respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim’s parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.

Succession battles aren’t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development. But over the years, that economic strategy has caused headaches for authorities, who have intervened when patriarchs die and tensions between disgruntled relatives boil over. Majid Al Futtaim is a mainstay of the local consumer economy. It’s also a giant in the broader Gulf Arab region, owning and operating prominent hotels, entertainment venues and shopping malls. Its portfolio includes the Mall of the Emirates, a major tourist draw in Dubai that houses the Middle East’s first-ever indoor ski slope. It also runs regional franchises for global brands, including Lego. Majid Al Futtaim’s revenues last year topped $9 billion. As crown prince in the 1990s, Sheikh Mohammed mediated a succession dispute between Al Futtaim, the founder, and a cousin. Al Futtaim used the funds from that settlement to start his namesake company.

    "article_text": "Lululemon athletica ( LULU 0.43% ) might not have the profile of a traditional market-crushing stock, but it's been one of the best-performing consumer-facing stocks of the last 20 years. More than any other company, Lululemon is responsible for making athleisure a massive apparel category, and it's made it one of the most valuable apparel companies in the world. Going back to its 2006 IPO, the stock is up roughly 1,800%, and even over the last decade, the stock has gained more than 300% as it's continued to deliver strong growth. However, more recently the stock has struggled. After peaking in late 2023, shares have fallen on concerns about its valuation, slowing growth, and now the trade war and the broader threat to the global economy. The stock is now down 48% from its peak. Lululemon tumbled in its first-quarter earnings report as comparable sales growth slowed to just 1% with comps down 2% in the Americas. Revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $2.37 billion as the company continues to open new stores, which matched estimates. Further down the income statement, gross margin improved from 57.7% to 58.3%, but operating income rose just 1% to $438.6 million as operating margin fell 110 basis points to 18.5% due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. On the bottom line, earnings per share increased from $2.54 to $2.60, which edged out the consensus of $2.59. Image source: Getty Images. What's ailing Lululemon What really pressured the stock was the company's guidance, due in part to the impact of tariffs as management said price hikes to absorb tariffs would be targeted and limited. For the full year, Lululemon maintained revenue guidance of $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion, or 6% revenue growth at the midpoint. However, it cut its full-year earnings-per-share guidance from $14.95-$15.15 to $14.58-$14.78. Second-quarter guidance also missed the mark. Lululemon's decision to maintain revenue guidance with a growth rate that's steady from the first quarter shows that it doesn't anticipate a significant impact on demand. Rather, the challenges the company is facing are on the cost side, primarily due to tariffs. The company now expects operating margin to fall 160 basis points, weighing on earnings per share. The China opportunity While Lululemon's growth has slowed in its core North American market, the company continues to see a long runway in China, which represents its biggest market for new store growth. In the first quarter, revenue in China increased 21% on 7% comparable sales growth, and China made up 13% of total revenue last year. Like other American consumer brands that have done well in China like Apple , Starbucks , and Nike , Lululemon seems to be benefiting from the same upscale brand reputation that those companies have as well as a culture of conspicuous consumption. Additionally, Lululemon has managed to deliver solid growth in China even as the consumer economy has been weak there. The retailer currently has 154 stores in China, 20% of its total, and it had an initial goal of opening 200 stores, though it now expects to top that. CFO Meghan Frank said, \"We still feel we're early in our journey\" in China on the earnings call. Expand NASDAQ : LULU Lululemon Athletica Inc. Today's Change ( -0.43 %) $ -0.74 Current Price $ 169.61 Key Data Points Market Cap $20B Day's Range $ 168.92 - $ 172.19 52wk Range $ 159.25 - $ 423.32 Volume 102K Avg Vol 5.2M Gross Margin 59.04 % Dividend Yield N/A Is Lululemon a buy? Lululemon's challenges with tariffs seem to be similar to what we've heard from other retailers in apparel and related sectors, so it shouldn't be a cause for alarm from investors. Meanwhile, the tariff situation is fluid enough that rates could easily change, and it's unclear if the tariffs will still be relevant a few years from now. After cutting its guidance for the year and Friday's sell-off, Lululemon now trades at a forward P/E of 18. For a company with its brand strength, historical growth rate, and a runway to expand in China, that looks like a great price. While investors may have to be patient as the trade war plays out, at the current price, Lululemon looks like a clear buy."

The opposition to law enforcement is just one part of the elite-backed massive resistance to President Donald Trump’s popular policy of enforcing Congress’s immigration laws. The opposition seeks to minimize deportations by harassing ICE officials and by portraying peaceful, orderly arrests as frightful “ chaos .” There was no chaos when the left-wing activists were absent, allowing ICE deputies to calmly escort illegal migrants out of the building: ICE officials are increasingly arresting migrants at their scheduled court hearings, partly because it minimizes manpower and coordination demands, and also maximizes safety amid the risk of violence from street protests or dangerous migrants. Trump’s enforcement policy is already paying big dividends to the many ordinary Americans who are seeing their wages rise, their housing prices decline , and their local crime rates drop . But the activist groups are so influential in the Democratic Party that top party leaders are joining their courthouse resistance. MSN.com reported on June 5 that the pro-migration City Comptroller , Brad Lander, joined the actions: “The last few weeks have been terrifying for New York City’s immigrant communities, for the city itself, this place that has been the greatest immigrant city the world has ever known with an immigrant tradition going back 400 years, and really for the rule of law itself,” Lander said on June 5. Lander, who is running for mayor [against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams] attended hearings Thursday morning as part of the “Friend of the Court” program—an initiative by immigration coalition Immigrant ARC that designates individuals who can observe proceedings and assist respondents in navigating their immigration processes. He encouraged other New Yorkers to participate in hearings as Friends of the Court in “solidarity” with immigrants undergoing proceedings. “I’ve felt more useful for the last hour than I have felt almost any time since Donald Trump was elected,” Lander said. Immigrant ARC is an elite-led pro-migration group in New York City. For example, the group’s treasurer is Omar Beer , a Harvard graduate and a top manager at Goldman Sachs. Another ARC board member is Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition . That group got one-third of its 2023 budget from foundations or corporations, and its board includes Eddie Taveras , who works for FWD.us, a lobbying group for wealthy West Coast investors in the consumer economy. The FWD.us lobby group’s members gain wealth on the stock market when the government extracts more renters, consumers, and workers from poor countries. Other progressive groups are organizing chaotic resistance to deportations in Nashville, Chicago, and Boston, mimicking some of the elite-backed Black Lives Matter movement that wrecked many communities in 2020."

    "article_text": "Stocks Get Another Upgrade on Wall Street as Tariff Fears Fade Colin Laidley June 4, 2025 2 min read ^GSPC ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images Barclays on Wednesday became the latest Wall Street firm to raise its year-end S&P 500 target. Another Wall Street firm turned more bullish on the stock market on Wednesday, as analysts came around to the possibility the worst of this year's tariff shock is in the rearview mirror. \"Peak tariff uncertainty is likely passed, which should allow modest valuation expansion from here,\" wrote Barclays analysts, who raised their year-end S&P 500 forecast to 6,050 from 5,900 on Wednesday. Several other firms have raised their targets for the index in recent weeks, citing easing global trade tensions, continued resilience of the U.S. economy, and the stimulative potential of the tax and spending bill working its way through Congress. Deutsche Bank on Tuesday raised its year-end forecast to 6,550, and UBS last week lifted its target to 6,000. The stock market's outlook may have improved in the last month, but it remains drearier than at the start of the year, when investors were optimistic about President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth, business-friendly agenda. Only two Wall Street firms tracked by CNBC 's Market Strategist Survey have not lowered their expectations for the S&P 500 this year. Barclays analysts left their forecast for S&P 500 full-year earnings per share unchanged at $262, down from $271 at the start of the year. Many of President Trump's tariffs have been delayed or diluted, but those that remain are expected to directly subtract nearly $10 from the index's EPS. Slower international growth and diminished consumer spending are expected to detract an additional $1 and $2.10, respectively. Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and tariff-induced inflation are forecast to offset some of those headwinds. Barclays expects corporate earnings growth to normalize in 2026, when—assuming tariff rates remain unchanged—the direct drag from duties will get lost in year-over-year comparisons. Tariffs are still expected to weigh on consumer spending and slow global growth, but those headwinds should be more than offset by AI-driven growth. The firm expects the S&P 500 to end 2026 around 6,700, about 12% above Tuesday's close. Read the original article on Investopedia View comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

That was worse than the median market forecast for 1.4 per cent growth and March’s 2.1 per cent increase. PHOTO: AFP Published Fri, Jun 6, 2025 · 08:52 AM — Updated Fri, Jun 6, 2025 · 09:42 AM [TOKYO] Japanese household spending unexpectedly fell in April, as consumers tightened their purse strings in the face of higher prices. Consumer spending fell 0.1 per cent in April from a year earlier, data from the internal affairs ministry showed on Friday. That was worse than the median market forecast for 1.4 per cent growth and March’s 2.1 per cent increase. On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending declined 1.8 per cent, versus an estimated 0.8 per cent fall. Consumption and wage trends are among key factors the Bank of Japan is watching to gauge economic strength and decide how soon to raise interest rates.“Consumer spending appears not to be on track for recovery still,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. Consumption and wage trends are among key factors the Bank of Japan is watching to gauge economic strength and decide how soon to raise interest rates. Hefty pay hikes are seen as essential to counter sharp increases in the cost of living. Major Japanese firms on average agreed to more than 5 per cent pay hikes during annual spring wage talks in March. The monthly wage data released on Thursday showed real wages fell for a fourth consecutive month, eroded by stubborn inflation that has continued to outpace pay hikes, even though base salaries rose at the fastest pace in four months. “It is positive that wages are rising, but prices are eating into those gains, and in April, the negative impact was still stronger,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute. On prices, Takeda said inflation probably peaked out in April as the yen gained strength and crude oil prices dropped.

    "article_text": "Many were stunned after the latest inflation and core PCE data confirmed that the experts were once again dead wrong, and instead of the widely expected inflation tsunami, Trump's tariffs have so far sparked only continued disinflation (which will only become more acute as home prices slide). And yet, anyone who read our Beige Book analysis from last month (not to mention our prediction from last June that \" The Experts Are All Wrong About Inflation Under A Trump Presidency \") would have known just that: as we laid out, \" Beige Book Finds Inflation Mentions Tumble To 3 Year Low \" which was the clearest indication that despite the prevailing narrative, rising prices is simply not a thing businesses across the US are worried about. Fast forward to today when the latest, May, Beige Book was released, and it revealed that according to reports across the 12 Fed district, \"economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report\" with half of the districts reporting slight to moderate declines in activity, three Districts reported no change, and three Districts reported slight growth . And here an interesting divergence appears, because the Beige Book appears to reveal another party-line split. Here are the districts that reported declines in activity: New York Boston Philadelphia San Francisco Minneapolis Kansas City And the districts that reported flat/slowing activity: Cleveland Dallas Richmond Atlanta Chicago St Louis In any case, the Beige Book said that all Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions. Manufacturing activity also declined slightly, while consumer spending reports were mixed, with most Districts reporting slight declines or no change; however, some Districts reported increases in spending on items expected to be affected by tariffs. Elsewhere, residential real estate sales were little changed, and most district reports on new home construction indicate flat or slowing construction activity. Reports on bank loan demand and capital spending plans were mixed. Activity at ports was robust, while reports on transportation and warehouse activity in other areas were mixed. On balance, the outlook remains slightly pessimistic and uncertain, unchanged relative to the previous report. Yet, here too, confusion was the dominant them, with a few District reports indicating the outlook has deteriorated while a few others indicating the outlook has improved. Focusing on labor markets, the Beige book reported the following: Employment has been little changed since the previous report. Most Districts described employment as flat, three Districts reported slight-to-modest increases, and two Districts reported slight declines. Many Districts reported lower employee turnover rates and more applicants for open positions. Comments about uncertainty delaying hiring were widespread: all Districts described lower labor demand, citing declining hours worked and overtime, hiring pauses, and staff reduction plans. Some Districts reported layoffs in certain sectors, but these layoffs were not pervasive. Two Districts noted that, for many of their contacts, hiring plans had not changed since the start of the year. Wages continued to grow at a modest pace , although many Districts reported a general easing in wage pressures. A few Districts indicated that higher costs of living continued to put upward pressure on wages. As for prices, it should come as no surprise by now that the runaway inflation everyone was expecting just isn't there. Here is Beige book confirmation: Prices have increased at a moderate pace since the previous report. There were widespread reports of contacts expecting costs and prices to rise at a faster rate going forward (although expectations don't pay the bills). A few Districts described these expected cost increases as strong, significant, or substantial (once again, it's all expected, nothing is realized ). All District reports indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices (so high that price increases were at most moderate, i.e., in line with history). However, contacts’ responses to these higher costs varied, including increasing prices on affected items, increasing prices on all items, reducing profit margins, and adding temporary fees or surcharges. There was a new section added to this month's Beige Book, one looking at the fate of US energy: Energy industry contacts reported moderate growth across most sectors. Liquefied natural gas production, exports, and overall global demand remained an area of strength. While domestic demand for U.S. crude oil was steady, global demand softened. Utility companies described robust residential power demand, modest growth in commercial, and some slowing in industrial. Although utility sector contacts reported growth opportunities linked to data center development, some noted a slight deceleration in activity, attributed to concerns over potential tariffs increasing the cost of power infrastructure and impeding investment. Offshore wind contacts reported a significant decline in demand, resulting in downsizing. In short, for yet another month, the sky is not falling. Here is a snapshot of highlights by Fed District: Boston: Economic activity decreased slightly overall. Consumer spending at retail stores and restaurants slowed modestly. Employers paused hiring because of heightened uncertainty, with employment declining slightly and wages increasing just barely. Prices increased only slightly, but larger price increases were expected for the summer. Contacts expressed mixed views concerning the outlook. New York: Economic activity in the Second District continued to decline modestly amid heightened uncertainty. Employment held steady, though demand for workers softened and wage growth slowed to a modest pace. Selling price increases remained moderate, but input prices grew strongly with tariff-induced cost increases. Capital spending plans declined, and the outlook was quite pessimistic. Philadelphia: Business activity declined modestly in the current Beige Book period, as it did in the last period. Employment declined slightly, despite an uptick in manufacturing sector jobs. Wages increased slightly, and firm price inflation was up moderately. Existing home sales grew slightly, and new home sales declined moderately. Expectations for future growth rose moderately for manufacturers and slightly for nonmanufacturers. Cleveland: District business activity continued to be flat in recent weeks, and contacts expected activity to remain flat in the months ahead. Retailers noted a pullback in consumer spending, and manufacturers reported softer orders. Many contacts attributed robust cost increases to tariffs and said that their selling prices increased moderately. Richmond: The regional economy continued to grow mildly in recent weeks. Consumer spending and nonfinancial services demand picked up slightly, financial services demand and real estate activity were little changed, and manufacturing activity contracted slightly. Port volumes increased strongly due to a surge in import activity. Employment rose slightly, wage growth was modest, and overall price growth remained moderate. Atlanta: The economy of the Sixth District grew slightly. Employment was steady, and wage pressure decreased. Prices increased moderately. Consumer spending was flat, and travel and tourism declined modestly. Home sales rose slightly. Transportation activity grew at a modest pace. Loan growth slowed. Manufacturing fell, but energy activity rose slowly. Chicago: Economic activity increased slightly. Consumer spending and employment increased modestly; business spending and construction and real estate activity were flat; manufacturing declined slightly; and nonbusiness contacts saw a slight decline in activity. Prices and wages rose modestly, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2025 farm income increased some. St. Louis: Economic activity has remained unchanged, but the outlook has slightly deteriorated. Employment levels were unchanged, and wage growth has been modest. Contacts expressed elevated uncertainty and concern that tariffs would result in further cost increases. Minneapolis: The District economy contracted slightly overall. Employment was flat and wages grew moderately. Some employers were preparing contingency plans for potential layoffs. Prices increased moderately overall; some contacts were adding or considering tariff surcharges. Manufacturing increased moderately and consumer spending fell. Agricultural conditions remained weak, but crop progress was solid. Kansas City: Overall activity declined moderately, driven by lower retail spending, a decline in the demand for single-family homes, and a slight contraction in manufacturing. Businesses indicated they were increasingly cautious about hiring plans and capital expenditures, but employment levels were steady. Dallas: Economic activity in the Eleventh District economy was little changed over the reporting period. Nonfinancial services activity held steady and growth in the manufacturing sector slowed. Loan volumes grew slightly, and the housing market remained subdued. Employment was flat and price pressures held steady except for the tariff-related increases seen in the manufacturing sector. Outlooks generally deteriorated, and tariff uncertainty was making it hard for businesses to plan for the future. San Francisco: Economic activity slowed slightly. Employment levels were generally stable. Wages rose slightly and prices increased modestly. Retail sales and consumer and business services demand eased. Conditions in manufacturing, agriculture, and real estate markets softened slightly. Activity in the financial services sector was stable. And finally, confirming that contrary to conventional wisdom the economic picture has been largely unchanged since April, the latest February Beige Book saw just 1 mention of recessions, the lowest this year, and down sharply from 6 three months prior. Where there was some concern is that mentions of \"slow\" rose from from 50 in April (which was down to 53, the biggest highlight for another month is that contrary to prevailing media narratives, mentions of inflation actually rose ever so modestly from a three-year low of 8 to 10, the second lowest going back to the start of 2022. All of which suggests that the US economy - while hardly on fire as it was during the hyperinflationary period of Biden's admin - continues to chug along and is hardly collapsing as so many Trump foes would like to see; and it certainly is not seeing prices explode higher.

    "article_text": "SOURCE / GT VOICE GT Voice: Being a ‘reliable partner’ can’t be dictated by Washington’s values By Global Times Published: Jun 04, 2025 11:29 PM Illustration: Liu Rui/GT In recent remarks about China, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments have been summarized by some media outlets as suggesting that China has a \"choice\" on whether or not to be a \"reliable partner.\" This comes at a time when the US has initiated a tariff storm, causing significant disruptions to the global economy, while China continues to expand its high-level openness and actively support multilateralism. Against this backdrop, the question of who qualifies as a reliable partner to the rest of the world - and who should make more effort and has a \"choice\" toward that end - appears to have an obvious answer. China is in the former category. Over the past eight years, the country has consistently held its position as the world's largest trading nation in terms of goods. Despite the rise of global protectionist sentiment, China has actively pursued greater openness with the international community. The vast and robust Chinese market, serving as a stabilizer for the global consumer market, offers substantial growth opportunities for multinational corporations. The question of who is deemed a reliable partner to the international community should not be dictated by the US alone. When addressing China's economy and real estate issues, Bessent's reported claim that China should \"stop over-manufacturing\" merely perpetuates the erroneous and outdated narrative of China's \"overcapacity.\" These remarks seem designed to encourage China to reduce its manufacturing exports to the US, aligning with the US strategy of using tariff policies to suppress Chinese manufacturing exports. The US might prefer to increase its exports and reduce its imports, but achieving this goal should be through equal, fair, and mutually beneficial economic cooperation and competition. If China's manufacturing sector thrives and there is a trade surplus with the US, labeling China as \"over-manufacturing\" would be an overly domineering stance. It raises the question: does being a reliable global partner, in the eyes of the US, mean unconditionally increasing imports of American products and conforming to the economic interests of the US? China, to some extent, has established the \"consumer economy\" that Bessent considers important. In recent years, China has consistently focused on fueling consumption growth, despite encountering inevitable challenges. In 2024, final consumption contributed 44.5 percent to China's economic growth, surpassing investment and net exports. This development indicates that China is both in the process of transitioning to and has already become a consumption-driven economy. The emphasis on consumption reflects China's strategic adjustment in response to its own economic development needs. As China progresses toward a consumption-driven economy, it maintains a high level of openness to the world. This approach offers extensive development opportunities and stable economic dividends on a global scale. When comparing the economic structures of China and the US, it's undeniable that manufacturing and consumption hold different weights within their respective economies. This difference is determined by the complex trajectories and experiences of each nation's economic development over the past decades. Despite their distinct approaches to economic growth, both nations should engage in mutual respect and equal cooperation. There's no basis for claiming one economic model is superior to the other, nor is it accurate to label China's manufacturing exports as over-manufacturing. The economies of China and the US have potential for collaboration, given their complementary nature. In the era of economic globalization, it's impossible to segregate the global supply and trade chains. According to Fortune, Bessent has pointed out that the US is committed to shifting the American economy toward \"more of a manufacturing economy.\" If the US wishes to establish a stronger manufacturing base, it will require substantial, concrete efforts, including improving the domestic business environment and attracting foreign investments. From this perspective, the US needs to consider what it means to be a \"reliable partner\" to the rest of the world. At a minimum, this involves acting responsibly, but a higher aspiration would be to share the fruits of development with the global community.

    "article_text": "Klarna’s BNPL Debit Card Goes Head-to-Head With Banks Photo via Andre M. Chang/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom Sean Craig June 4, 2025 3 min read MA A debit card that lets you take out a line of credit … isn’t that just a credit card? Not in 2025, apparently. Swedish fintech Klarna is piloting its own Visa debit card in the United States, the company announced Tuesday. Unremarkably, it will allow consumers to pay for purchases with their own funds, just like any other debit card. But they’ll also have the option of choosing a short-term buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan to be paid back in small installments. READ ALSO: Just How Much Data Does the Fed Need to Cut Rates? and Europe Delays Stricter Banking Rules to Keep ‘Level Playing Field’ With US Rivals Debit Where Due Stockholm-based Klarna grew its revenue to $2.8 billion last year from $2.3 billion in 2023 as BNPL adoption widened, powered by younger consumers and others more averse to traditional credit with interest charges. This year, Klarna has continued to boost its profile in the consumer economy. In March, it bested rival Affirm to take exclusive control of BNPL at Walmart, America’s largest retailer. The same month, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski defended a deal to bring Klarna’s lightning-fast access to credit to food delivery service DoorDash after critics joked about the idea of $15 burritos on loan as “ the 2008 housing crisis, but for food ” and “ collateralized DoorDash obligations .” Those jokes were rooted in real concerns, as BNPL loans have come back to bite some consumers. In an April survey by LendingTree, 41% of BNPL users reported making late payments on a loan in the past year, up from 34% in 2023. A quarter of BNPL users reported taking out loans to pay for groceries, up from 14% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Klarna reported its consumer credit losses rising to $136 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year. The company, which saw its number of active customers cross 100 million in April, has pointed to the much less dramatic growth in the percentage of unpaid loans, which rose to 0.54% in the first quarter from 0.51% a year earlier. And now, of course, those loans will be accessible for cardholders far and wide via Visa: Klarna said it plans a wider rollout of the debit card, which already has a 5 million-person waiting list, in the US and Europe later this year. The card will offer one free tier and two paid tiers that include discounts and better cashback rates. Because Klarna is not a licensed bank in the US, the debit card and its associated account will be issued by Utah-based WebBank. Not to be outdone, rival payments firm PayPal announced its own Mastercard on Tuesday, issued by Connecticut bank Synchrony, which can tap into its BNPL offering, PayPal Credit. Story Continues On Hold: In April, Klarna postponed plans for a US initial public offering for the second time after President Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs left markets reeling and consumer sentiment in the doldrums — although both have since rebounded somewhat.

PHOTO: REUTERS Follow topic: United States Published Jun 04, 2025, 08:31 AM Updated Jun 04, 2025, 11:01 AM ZURICH – US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing has a choice on whether to be a dependable partner with the rest of the world, reiterating that China needs to shift to a more consumption-led economy to help ease global imbalances. “They either want to be a reliable partner to the rest of the world, or they don’t,” Mr Bessent said via video link to the American Swiss Foundation Leadership Summit in Zurich on June 3. “They are in the midst of a large real estate – I won’t be alarmist and say crisis – but a large real estate over-build and the way for them to stabilise their economy is not to export deflation and excess products to the rest of the world,” he said. “The way to do that is through a level of fiscal stimulus and to stop over-manufacturing, and get on a sound footing for the consumer economy.” Mr Bessent did not comment about a possible call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping , which White House officials have indicated is in the works. The world’s two largest economies are pointing fingers at each other for violating terms of a deal they announced three weeks ago in Geneva, pausing tit-for-tat tariffs until mid-August to give talks time to play out. Mr Trump “wants the US to become more of a manufacturing economy”, Mr Bessent said. The US is trying to remain a destination for foreign and domestic investment with tax cuts, trade rebalancing and deregulation, adding that precision manufacturing is one of the goals of the Trump administration, he said. Mr Bessent also said he sees untapped potential for Switzerland and the US to collaborate more on artificial intelligence and financial services. He said US officials will continue working with their Swiss counterparts to streamline global financial regulations, modernise capital requirements and continue to engage with one another on key macroeconomic issues. July 9 extension Switzerland is among several countries trying to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the US to avoid an increase of Mr Trump’s reciprocal tariff of 10 per cent to a higher level designated on April 2 – 31 per cent in Switzerland’s case – when a 90-day reprieve expires on July 9. Speaking earlier at the same forum, top Swiss trade official Helene Budliger said Switzerland was assured by the US that tariffs will stay at their current 10 per cent level instead of ratcheting up to 31 per cent, even if negotiations extend past July 9. Switzerland has been told “several times”, both by Mr Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, that the time would be extended, “as long as there is a perception that we’re negotiating in a bona fide way – which is the only way Swiss negotiate”, she told Bloomberg Television. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter had previously said it is “clear” that the deadline would be moved as long as talks continue, but there was no US confirmation on this. Switzerland’s government last week signed off on a negotiation mandate that sketches a compromise around cutting tariffs for agricultural goods the country does not significantly produce. Ms Budliger added that both sides started “a quite detailed conversation on what a UK style deal could look like between the US and Switzerland”. There are “relatively concrete ideas” on the table, she said. She also said that Switzerland is suffering from a global overproduction of steel, along with the US.

China Daily via REUTERS Reuters Published : 03 Jun 2025, 10:46 PM Updated : 03 Jun 2025, 10:46 PM Chinese people travelled more over the three-day Dragon Boat holiday this year, but spending remained below pre-pandemic levels, government data showed on Tuesday - indicators that are closely watched as barometers of consumer confidence. Consumption in the world's second-largest economy has suffered amid sputtering growth and a prolonged property crisis, with uncertainty from the US-China trade war also weighing on consumer confidence. The latest data painted a mixed picture for China's consumer economy. Tourists took an estimated 119 million domestic journeys from Friday to Monday, up 5.7 percent from the same holiday period last year, according to the Ministry for Tourism and Culture. Overall spending over the period rose to 42.73 billion yuan ($5.94 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.9 percent, but the average amount spent per traveller was a little under 360 yuan ($50), according to Reuters calculations, remaining stubbornly below 2019 levels of around 410 yuan per trip. The annual festival took place from May 31 to June 2 this year and is celebrated throughout the country with local dragon boat races. Many people take the opportunity to have short holidays, crowding train stations and airports around the country. Overall, more than 653.7 million inter-regional trips across all regions in China, which include tourist trips, were made during the three-day holiday, up 2.5 percent year-on-year, state media Xinhua reported on Tuesday, and road travel was up 2.4 percent from last year with 597.3 million trips recorded. Cross-border journeys rose 2.7 percent to 5.9 million, with 231,000 foreign nationals entering the country visa-free during the holiday. China has been expanding its visa policy, with citizens of 43 countries granted visa-free access, while visa-free transit for up to 240 hours in China is available for 54 countries. Chinese also boosted spending on entertainment over the holiday, with cinema box office revenue reaching 460 million yuan ($63.9 million), surpassing last year’s 384 million yuan, according to data from online ticketing platform Maoyan. Tom Cruise’s latest movie \"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" topped charts, and generated 228 million yuan, half of the total revenue during the holiday period, which was seen as a positive indicator for the upcoming summer season.

Subscribe now The Indian economy experienced some weakness in April compared to the previous month, showed the 16 high-frequency indicators tracked by Mint in its monthly macro tracker. Muted growth in the core sector and deterioration in the trade balance weighed on the economy's overall performance. Seven indicators remained in the green—unchanged from the previous month—while those in the red increased to five in April from three in March. For each indicator, the value in each month is assigned a colour coding (red, amber or green) to denote where it lies relative to the five-year average (red denotes worse, amber denotes in line, and green denotes better). Also read | The safe-haven shake-up: Euro steps up, crypto moves in Sector-wise performance The external sector, which was weighing on the economy's overall performance, showed some improvement in April. While import cover remained in the red, the rupee and labour-intensive export growth improved. However, the trade balance moved from amber to red. Meanwhile, the consumer economy is finding some stability, but there hasn’t been much change in the past six months. The producer economy also hasn’t improved, with core sector performance worsening in April, moving from amber to red. The ease-of-living segment—covering retail and core inflation, real rural wage growth, and labour force participation—continued to perform strongly, with all four indicators remaining in the green for the fourth consecutive month.

The tracker has been running since October 2018. Methodology note: While calculating the five-year average, data for some indicators for April-May 2020 and April-May 2021 have been removed to eliminate lockdown-induced skews in the trend. However, the five-year averages may still show high figures due to a sustained base effect in several indicators in 2021 and 2022. Monthly standings will be updated retrospectively as more data comes in. For inflation, the red/green coding is reversed.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size As the latest deadline for TikTok to be sold or banned in the US approaches, we’ll find out next month whether the app will continue to be a fixture on American phones or not. A decline in fashion fads conceived by TikTok creators (think “cowboy core”, “office siren” and “ coastal grandma ”) means consumers and retailers won’t be as affected as they would have been a year or so ago, when such viral “aesthetics” peaked on the video-sharing platform. But brands have their work cut out in responding to what’s taken over since: lifestyle trends amplifying political, social and economic influences. After all, it’s much harder to monetise “recession core”, the “MAGA woman” look and “underconsumption”. The “mob wife” trend – big sunglasses, big fur, big attitude – was easier to monetise than “recession core”. Credit: Getty Images Super-speedy TikTok trends are best exemplified by the viral “mob wife” look from early last year, characterised by big fur coats and equally voluminous hair. Retailers responded by stocking more animal print and bold lipstick. This was one of many fleeting fashions that emerged in the wake of the pandemic when TikTok really took off, and dressing for short videos replaced IRL outfits. It’s not easy keeping up with so many flash-in-the-pan fads, from “tomato girl” to “pilates princess”, particularly as the economy darkens. Fatigue has set in and consumers are now prioritising their personal style over every new “core” and trend. That’s trickier for brands to be part of, but they are tapping in – for example, through bag charms, which fashion and luxury has embraced, and Labubu dolls, playing into the need to express one’s identity through customisation. We haven’t really had a fashion narrative that’s broken into the mainstream since mob wife. Loading TikTok and Pinterest, the photo-pinning app, are also making valiant attempts to continue to shape fashion. “Castlecore” and “medievalcore” are among the few aesthetics to break through recently, though they reflect the broader “pop girl” phenomenon in culture as they’re inspired by singer Chappell Roan’s adoption of chain-mail and headwear. (They also demonstrate, as Kayla Marci, who writes the Haute Garbage Substack, told me, that Gen Z’s nostalgia has cycled through recent decades and is reaching ever further back.) Yet of the more than 100 micro-trends tracked by market-intelligence company Trendalytics across social media, online search and e-commerce, 60 per cent are declining while only 20 per cent are gaining traction. Even though US users still spend more time per day on TikTok than Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, according to Sensor Tower, the moment when the platform became the epicentre of trend forecasting, with users naming new aesthetics at a frenetic pace, has passed. We haven’t really had a fashion narrative that’s broken into the mainstream since mob wife. Advertisement There is one notable exception: the “recession core” trend, which includes making your own beauty products and finding hairstyles that need little maintenance. TikTok posts featuring “recession core” are increasing by more than 3000 per cent week on week, and average views of tagged videos are up about 1000 per cent week on week, according to Trendalytics. This reflects the current obsession across society and finance with spotting recession indicators, from sardine-themed fashion (because the fish are cheap and filling) to longer hemlines (said to fall in tough times). The “MAGA woman” trend on TikTok. Credit: Tiktok/@angelialayton1 There are few, if any, actual products referencing the trend, underlining the challenges for brands of such online conversations coalescing around broader cultural, economic and political themes. These are far more difficult for retailers to navigate than having the right width of jean leg or latest fruit-print dress. Take “ Boom Boom ”, at the other extreme from “recession core”, which emphasises 1980s-inspired excess, perhaps reflecting the Trump era’s embrace of money and power. The catwalks for the northern-hemisphere autumn featured fur, big shoulders and, at Prada’s Miu Miu, even exaggerated bras. While the minimalism of the past couple of years has been good for some luxury houses, such as Brunello Cucinelli, Prada and LVMH’s Loro Piana, for others, such as Kering’s Gucci, it has been a disaster. Many companies would love to see a return to logos and more ostentatious dressing. But whether they would fully embrace conspicuous consumption – against the current backdrop of tariff-driven anxiety – is another matter. Boom Boom emphasises 1980s excess: Hilary Swank wears a Miu Miu outfit at the Paris fashion show for spring/summer 2025. Credit: AP Even more daunting are politically driven movements, beginning with “trad wife” , which espoused traditionally female roles, and morphing into the more overt “MAGA woman” look, characterised by sheath dresses, high heels, flowing tresses and plumped-up lips. Creator Suzanne Lambert took this even further, parodying so-called “Republican Beauty” for too-pale concealer and clumpy mascara, racking up 6.4 million TikTok views in the process. Few brands have weighed in despite the potential to sell products. The “Mar-a-Lago face” has probably peaked, but given the fracturing of society it may not be the last divisive trend to emerge. That presents a dilemma for companies. Yet Cassandra Napoli, head of marketing and events at trend forecaster WGSN, told me that consumers are increasingly prioritising “ethics over aesthetics”, voting with their wallets and spending their time with businesses that reflect their values. “Not getting political will not be an option,” she said, even if it was a double-edged sword. Perhaps the narrative that’s most concerning for fashion and beauty companies is that of buying less, or nothing at all. Underconsumption has been gaining ground for the past year or so, showcasing a simpler life – streamlining beauty regimes and wearing vintage clothes, for example, are in vogue right now. Brands can respond by focusing on fewer product lines but more meaningful “hero” items, or by embracing vintage in their selections. Loading That’s a hard pill to swallow if you believe the whole raison d’etre of the consumer economy is to sell. Making sure stores had enough leopard print and chunky gold jewellery to meet mob wife’s gaudy tastes feels almost quaint now.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Surabhi Updated Jun 2, 2025 1:04 PM IST Very few rural households fully depend on agriculture for income, finds report With more and more agricultural households supplementing their incomes through other sources, a new report has called for rethinking rural development strategies and bring in more reforms in the farm sector to support farmers and farmer households. “PRICE’s ICE 360° surveys support this, revealing that while 42.4% of rural households earn some income from agriculture, only 20.7% are fully dependent on it. This shift underscores the need to rethink rural development strategies,” said the report titled ‘Reimagining Annadata Households and Their Livelihoods Beyond the Farm’ by People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE). Advertisement Related Articles 'Zero tax on Rs 40 cr agriculture revenue, salaried person pays...': Expert highlights inequality in taxation '150% tariff on American alcohol': White House says India 'not helping', levies 100% tariff on agri goods The report found that while many rural households report agriculture as a source of income, a smaller percentage is entirely dependent on farming. According to the PRICE ICE 360° Survey, approximately 42.4% of Indian households or 140 million households in 2024-25 have agriculture and allied activities as a source of income. However, only 20.7% (68.4 million households) are classified as ‘full-time/regular’ agricultural households, meaning their primary source of livelihood is farming. “This stark difference indicates that a significant number of households derive part of their income from non-farm activities, with agriculture playing a supplementary role in their overall economic structure,” it said. The report is authored by Rajesh Shukla, Adite Banerjie and Tanvi Menaria of PRICE. The report also highlights that farming alone is no longer sufficient to sustain rural livelihoods and 33% of the income of agricultural households is in fact derived from non-farming activities. These include non-agricultural self-employment (7.1%), salaries from jobs outside of agriculture (3.4%), and remittances (2.6%), it said, adding that this trend toward non-farm income highlights the increasing importance of economic diversification for the survival and stability of agricultural households. Advertisement The report notes that the average full-time agricultural household in India is projected to earn Rs 7.31 lakh annually by 2024-25, with a substantial portion of their income—67.1%— coming from farming activities. This includes Rs 4.90 lakh earned directly from farming and Rs 54,000 (7.4%) from allied agricultural activities such as dairy, livestock, or other subsidiary agricultural enterprises. “However, farming alone is no longer sufficient to sustain rural livelihoods,” it underlines. It has suggested several reforms in the farm sector to support farmers and farmer households. These include measures like broadening the definition of Annadata households to include tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and landless agricultural workers, which would ensure they are included in welfare schemes such as PM-Kisan and formal financial inclusion initiatives. It has also called for promoting non-farm employment by fostering rural entrepreneurship and skill development to create alternative income opportunities for these households. Expanding agricultural productivity and enhancing financial inclusion are some of the other measures the report has advocated to enable Annadata households to contribute effectively to India’s transformation into a Viksit Bharat.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size As the latest deadline for TikTok to be sold or banned in the US approaches, we’ll find out next month whether the app will continue to be a fixture on American phones or not. A decline in fashion fads conceived by TikTok creators (think “cowboy core”, “office siren” and “ coastal grandma ”) means consumers and retailers won’t be as affected as they would have been a year or so ago, when such viral “aesthetics” peaked on the video-sharing platform. But brands have their work cut out in responding to what’s taken over since: lifestyle trends amplifying political, social and economic influences. After all, it’s much harder to monetise “recession core”, the “MAGA woman” look and “underconsumption”. The “mob wife” trend – big sunglasses, big fur, big attitude – was easier to monetise than “recession core”. Credit: Getty Images Super-speedy TikTok trends are best exemplified by the viral “mob wife” look from early last year, characterised by big fur coats and equally voluminous hair. Retailers responded by stocking more animal print and bold lipstick. This was one of many fleeting fashions that emerged in the wake of the pandemic when TikTok really took off, and dressing for short videos replaced IRL outfits. It’s not easy keeping up with so many flash-in-the-pan fads, from “tomato girl” to “pilates princess”, particularly as the economy darkens. Fatigue has set in and consumers are now prioritising their personal style over every new “core” and trend. That’s trickier for brands to be part of, but they are tapping in – for example, through bag charms, which fashion and luxury has embraced, and Labubu dolls, playing into the need to express one’s identity through customisation. We haven’t really had a fashion narrative that’s broken into the mainstream since mob wife. Loading TikTok and Pinterest, the photo-pinning app, are also making valiant attempts to continue to shape fashion. “Castlecore” and “medievalcore” are among the few aesthetics to break through recently, though they reflect the broader “pop girl” phenomenon in culture as they’re inspired by singer Chappell Roan’s adoption of chain-mail and headwear. (They also demonstrate, as Kayla Marci, who writes the Haute Garbage Substack, told me, that Gen Z’s nostalgia has cycled through recent decades and is reaching ever further back.) Yet of the more than 100 micro-trends tracked by market-intelligence company Trendalytics across social media, online search and e-commerce, 60 per cent are declining while only 20 per cent are gaining traction. Even though US users still spend more time per day on TikTok than Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, according to Sensor Tower, the moment when the platform became the epicentre of trend forecasting, with users naming new aesthetics at a frenetic pace, has passed. We haven’t really had a fashion narrative that’s broken into the mainstream since mob wife. Advertisement There is one notable exception: the “recession core” trend, which includes making your own beauty products and finding hairstyles that need little maintenance. TikTok posts featuring “recession core” are increasing by more than 3000 per cent week on week, and average views of tagged videos are up about 1000 per cent week on week, according to Trendalytics. This reflects the current obsession across society and finance with spotting recession indicators, from sardine-themed fashion (because the fish are cheap and filling) to longer hemlines (said to fall in tough times). The “MAGA woman” trend on TikTok. Credit: Tiktok/@angelialayton1 There are few, if any, actual products referencing the trend, underlining the challenges for brands of such online conversations coalescing around broader cultural, economic and political themes. These are far more difficult for retailers to navigate than having the right width of jean leg or latest fruit-print dress. Take “ Boom Boom ”, at the other extreme from “recession core”, which emphasises 1980s-inspired excess, perhaps reflecting the Trump era’s embrace of money and power. The catwalks for the northern-hemisphere autumn featured fur, big shoulders and, at Prada’s Miu Miu, even exaggerated bras. While the minimalism of the past couple of years has been good for some luxury houses, such as Brunello Cucinelli, Prada and LVMH’s Loro Piana, for others, such as Kering’s Gucci, it has been a disaster. Many companies would love to see a return to logos and more ostentatious dressing.

    "article_text": "Audio By Carbonatix Ghana’s real household spending will grow by an improved 2.5% year-on-year to GH¢129.7 billion in 2025, Fitch Solutions has disclosed. This follows a weaker growth of 1.1% a year ago. According to the UK-based firm, this will be 25.4% above the GH¢103.4 billion recorded in 2019 (pre-pandemic). The major drivers of growth will be cooler inflation and greater cedi stability and strength over 2025, while also allowing for a dovish approach from the Bank of Ghana (BoG). Insights Into Consumer Spending Fitch Solutions' forecast for continued strength in consumer spending growth in Ghana over 2025. This is in line with its Country Risk team, which forecasts real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 4.2% year-on-year. For households in Ghana, it pointed out that there will be key upsides. Accordingly, the slower inflation over 2025 will further fuel spending growth and a greater number of transactions and will also see tailwinds from lower debt servicing costs. 2025 Consumer Activity Starts Slow In February 2025, Fitch Solutions said the volume of mobile money transactions decline to under 700 million transactions, following a record high of 745.0 million transactions over December 2024. Similarly, the value of transactions stood at GH¢316 billion over February 2025, identical to the November 2024 reading, though below the December 2024 and January 2025 levels. The slowdown in consumer activity, it said, came in the wake of the presidential election at the back of 2024 as well as weaker purchasing power following the December festive season. “To the upside, slower inflation over 2025 will further fuel spending growth and a greater number of transactions and will also see tailwinds from lower debt servicing costs”, it added.

Annadata households’ income rose 20% between FY21 and FY25 The share of Annadata households’ income to total households has dipped to 90 per cent from 94 per cent By Shishir Sinha Updated - June 01, 2025 at 09:46 PM. | New Delhi × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/annadata-households-income-rose-20-between-fy21-and-fy25/article69644875.ece Copy A farmer cultivates paddy at Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu | Photo Credit: SHAIKMOHIDEEN A The average annual income of Annadata households, where at least one member derives income from farming or related agricultural activities, has seen a growth of around 20 per cent against over 25 per cent for all households between 2020-21 and 2024-25, a working paper by People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE) has revealed. The paper, authored by Rajesh Shukla (MD & CEO), Adite Banerjie (journalist and consultant) and Tanvi Menaria (researcher), also highlighted that the share of Annadata households’ income to total households has dipped to 90 per cent from 94 per cent. PRICE defines full-time or regular agricultural households as those that depend fully on farming and allied activities for their livelihood. This is determined by collecting detailed, longitudinal household income data, including income sources, which provide a more reliable estimation of households that depend on agriculture. “According to PRICE’s 2024-25 estimates, of the 330 million (33 crore) households in India, approximately 68.4 million (6.84 crore) can be classified as full-time/regular Annadata households,” said the paper titled, ‘Reimagining Annadata Households and Their Livelihoods Beyond the Farm’. This paper’s timing coincides with the government announcement that MSP (Minimum Support Price) amount paid to farmers has seen a massive increase. Between 2014 and 2025, the amount paid for Kharif crops surged 3.4 times, compared to the previous 10 years at ₹16.35 lakh crore, while for Rabi crops it increased 2.7 times to ₹7.21 lakh crore. The paper noted that with agricultural incomes being volatile and often inadequate, more and more rural households are exploring non-farm income sources. However, several systemic and structural barriers limit the potential for diversification, particularly for small and marginal farmers, who have made farming a precarious and often unsustainable livelihood. It also highlighted the heavy reliance on non-farm-income. A crucial shift According to the PRICE ICE 360° Survey, around 52 per cent of agricultural households now report earning some form of non-farm income. This reflects a crucial shift as rural economies adapt to the limitations of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood. Non-farm income sources include self-employment in non-agricultural enterprises (7.1 per cent), salaried employment (3.4 per cent), agricultural labor (4.4 per cent) and pensions (1.4 per cent). “This diversification into non-farm activities is vital for mitigating the inherent risks of farming, such as fluctuating crop prices, unpredictable weather patterns and market volatility. For many Annadata households, these additional income streams provide a financial buffer, helping them sustain livelihoods despite the volatility in farm income,” the paper said. It also listed land fragmentations, resources limitations and technological gaps as constraints in agriculture particularly severe for small and marginal farmers, who constitute a significant portion of Annadata households. Viksit Bharat Terming Annadata households as the pillars of Viksit Bharat, the paper said Annadata households must continue to thrive, not just as food providers, but as drivers of innovation, economic diversification and rural prosperity. Their transition from primarily agricultural entities to dynamic economic contributors is essential for India’s vision of a developed economy by 2047. “Achieving this requires a collaborative effort from the government, private sector and civil society to create an ecosystem, where these households can succeed in multiple economic areas, ensuring a strong and self-sufficient rural India,” it said.

    "article_text": "US consumers pulling back spending; inflation slowing for now Lucia Mutikani May 30, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending increased marginally in April, with households opting to boost savings amid mounting economic uncertainty because of a constantly changing tariff landscape. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday suggested the economy struggled to rebound early in the second quarter after contracting in the January-March quarter for the first time in three years. Gross domestic product could, however, get a lift from a sharp contraction in the goods trade deficit last month as the front-running of imports to beat tariffs faded. Inflation was muted in April, with a measure of underlying price pressures posting its smallest annual increase in four years. But that was unlikely to encourage the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates soon as import duties are expected to raise prices. Economists say the inflationary effects of tariffs have not yet shown as businesses are probably still selling inventory accumulated before President Donald Trump embarked on his aggressive trade policy campaign. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked most of Trump's import duties from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority. They were, however, temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court on Thursday, adding another layer of uncertainty over the economy's outlook. \"There is clear evidence that consumers are battening down the hatches,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings. \"The Fed will welcome the favorable inflation reading in this report, but they are likely to interpret it as the calm before the storm.\" Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.7% jump in March, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. That was in line with economists' expectations. Spending was supported by outlays on services, mostly housing and utilities, healthcare as well as restaurants, hotels and motel stays. But goods spending softened amid cutbacks on purchases of motor vehicles and parts, clothing and footwear as well as recreational goods and vehicles. Pre-emptive buying of goods ahead of Trump's sweeping import tariffs helped to push spending higher in the prior month. Most of the tariffs have been implemented, though higher duties on goods have been delayed until July and mid-August. Economists have argued that Trump's aggressive trade policy will sharply slow economic growth this year and boost inflation. Story Continues Minutes of the U.S. central bank's May 6-7 meeting published on Wednesday noted \"participants judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases.\" The Fed has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range since December. Financial markets expect the Fed to resume rate cuts in September. The economy contracted at a 0.2% annualized rate in the first quarter after growing at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter, mostly depressed by a flood of imports. With most of the tariffs in place, imports are collapsing, helping to compress the goods trade deficit by 46.0% to $87.6 billion in April, a separate report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed. Goods imports decreased $68.4 billion to $276.1 billion. Exports of goods increased $6.3 billion to $188.5 billion. The shrinking goods trade deficit, if sustained, suggests trade could provide a major boost to gross domestic product this quarter after slicing off a record 4.90 percentage points in the first quarter. But businesses do not appear to be restocking, with wholesale inventories unchanged last month and stocks at retailers dipping 0.1%. That would offset some of the boost to GDP from trade. \"If imports dropped off and inventories did not fall to match, then GDP growth will be stronger,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"However, we will be surprised if stockpiles of goods do not drop hard before the second quarter is over.\" Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. SAVING RATE JUMPS The saving rate jumped to a one-year high of 4.9% from 4.3% in March as consumers socked away much of the 0.8% rise in personal income, which reflected Social Security retirement payments to some retirees who draw public pensions - such as former police and firefighters. Wages increased 0.5%. Though inflation was benign in April, consumers' inflation expectations remained elevated. The Fed minutes showed some policymakers assessed that \"could make firms more willing to raise prices.\" The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in March. It was lifted by a 0.1% gain in goods prices, mostly recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment. Goods prices dropped 0.5% in March. The cost of services rose 0.1% after gaining 0.2% in March. Services inflation was last month curbed by a sharp drop in financial services and insurance as well as recreation. But prices for housing and utilities continued to rise while the cost of transportation services rebounded. In the 12 months through April, PCE prices increased 2.1% after advancing 2.3% in March. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.1% last month following an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in March. The so-called core PCE inflation was previously reported to have been unchanged in March. In the 12 months through April, core inflation rose 2.5%. That was the smallest advance since March 2021 and followed a 2.7% increase in March. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. \"The increased tariffs have not yet worked their way into the consumer inflation readings, but we anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.

    "article_text": "Hit by Trump trade wars, US economy falls 0.2% in first quarter by Naharnet Newsdesk 29 May 2025, 15:53 Comment 0 Tweet The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump's trade wars disrupted business, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its initial estimate. First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes. The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. Imports grew at a 42.6% pace, fastest since third-quarter 2020, and shaved more than 5 percentage points off GDP growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that's mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what's produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Costa Rican coffee — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. The first-quarter import surge likely won't be repeated in the April-June quarter and therefore shouldn't weigh on GDP. Thursday's report was the second of three Commerce Department estimates of first-quarter GDP. The final version comes out June 26.

Reuters Published 30 May 2025, 07:17 PM IST US consumer spending slowed in April, as per latest data ( AFP ) US consumer spending increased marginally in April as a rush to beat higher prices from import duties slowed.

The report from the Commerce Department on Friday suggested the economy struggled to rebound early in the second quarter after contracting in the January-March quarter for the first time in three years. Gross domestic product could, however, get a lift from a sharp contraction in the goods trade deficit last month as the front-running of imports to beat tariffs faded. Inflation was muted in April, with a measure of underlying price pressures posting its smallest annual increase in four years. But that was unlikely to encourage the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates soon as import duties are expected to raise prices. Economists say the inflationary effects of tariffs have not yet shown as businesses are probably still selling inventory accumulated before President Donald Trump embarked on his aggressive trade policy campaign.

Article content The slight upward revision in GDP reflected stronger business investment and a greater accumulation of inventories. Federal government spending wasn’t as much of a drag as originally reported. Article content GDP figures are revised multiple times as more data become available, enabling the government to fine-tune its estimate. The first projection, released in late April, showed the economy contracted for the first time since 2022. The final estimate is due next month. Article content Economic growth was dragged down at the start of the year by a surge in imports as U.S. businesses tried to get ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump ’s tariffs. More moderate consumer spending, as well as a decline in federal government spending, also weighed on the figure. Article content Since then, the White House has walked back or delayed some of the more punitive levies, and most of the tariffs have been blocked by a U.S. trade court. While the pauses have helped calm Americans’ concerns about the economy and prompted many economists to scrap their recession calls, tariff rates are still substantially higher than before Trump took office. Article content Article content Forecasters largely expect GDP to rebound in the second quarter as higher duties discourage imports, and the goods already brought in will accumulate in larger inventories that add to growth. Beyond that, economists and policymakers will be paying close attention to how Trump’s policies — including trade, but also immigration and taxation — will impact consumer and business spending going forward.

    "article_text": "GDP Shows Consumer Resilience Under Pressure as CEOs Eye Recession By PYMNTS | May 29, 2025 | Highlights First-quarter GDP shrank, primarily due to a surge in imports, while the key driver, consumer spending, slowed significantly with notable pullbacks in durable goods and services. GDP shrank at an annualized 0.2% pace, a slight revision from 0.3%, reflecting stronger investment offset by a downward revision in consumer spending. CEO confidence experienced its sharpest quarterly drop on record, hitting its lowest level since late 2022. The vast majority of CEOs now hold a pessimistic outlook, with 83% anticipating a recession in the next 12-18 months. Tariffs are in limbo. GDP is shrinking. CEOs are pessimistic. And consumers are caught in the middle of all the uncertainty, buffeted by rising prices and an uncertain employment picture.

Δ On Thursday (May 29), the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its latest estimate of GDP – and noted only a slight revision to the decline in the economy. GDP shrank at an annualized 0.2% pace, a bit better than the 0.3% previously estimated. The revision reflects stronger-than-expected investment, particularly in private inventories, but was partly offset by a downward revision in consumer spending. Imports surged 42.6%, dragging heavily on GDP due to their negative accounting impact as businesses scrambled to get inventory in the face of looming tariffs that launched in April. This was the single largest contributor to the contraction. Consumer spending slowed to +1.2%, with noticeable pullbacks in durable goods (particularly vehicles) and in services like recreation and financial services. embed code: As for inflation, it’s still sticky. The PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index held steady at 3.6%, while the core PCE (excluding food and energy) was revised slightly down to 3.4%. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The Corporate Picture Preliminary estimates show corporate profits fell by $118.1 billion in Q1, reversing the strong $204.7 billion gain in Q4. This downturn reflects pressure from rising input costs and weaker demand, particularly in consumer-facing and export-sensitive industries. With the next GDP release due June 26, more complete data, including industry breakdowns, may offer further clarity. For now, the data suggests a fragile start to the year, shaped by volatile trade flows, cooling consumer momentum and firm inflation dynamics. A wild card still remains, as a federal court handed down a ruling Wednesday (May 28) that blocks Trump’s tariffs . That ruling is under appeal — and where there’s uncertainty, there’s a cloudy employment picture, which has been illustrated by other data released this week. As measured in May, CEO sentiment took a dramatic downturn, as The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence was released Thursday (May 29). The headline number dropped by 26 points to a reading of 34 — its lowest level since late 2022. This steep decline, the sharpest quarter-over-quarter drop in the survey’s nearly 50-year history, signals a marked shift toward pessimism. The current mark is 16 points below the 50-point threshold, which indicates that negative responses outweigh positive ones. All measures declined. The report revealed broad-based pessimism across all components of the confidence measures. CEOs’ assessments of current economic conditions fell the most, with 82% stating that the situation had worsened compared to six months ago, sharply from just 11% in the previous quarter. A Dimming Outlook Looking ahead, expectations also deteriorated significantly. Most CEOs now foresee further economic weakening in the next half-year, both at the macro level and within their own industries. Specifically, 64% anticipate a worsening economic outlook, a sharp rise from 15% in Q1. Recession fears remain high, with 83% of CEOs expecting a downturn in the next 12–18 months. Geopolitical instability emerged as the foremost concern for CEOs this quarter, followed by worries over trade and tariffs. Regulatory uncertainty also ranked high, while concern over cyber threats — previously a dominant issue — fell to fourth place. Hiring plans also reflected caution. While most CEOs (44%) intend to keep their workforce size unchanged, the proportion expecting to expand hiring declined slightly from 32% to 28%. Meanwhile, the share anticipating a reduction in staff ticked up from 27% to 28%. On the compensation front, over half of CEOs (53%) said they plan to raise wages by 3.0–3.9% over the next year. Notably, the share of those considering more modest increases in the 2.0–2.9% range grew from 24% to 34% — and we note that this range would fall below the PCE trends discussed above. Given the headwinds to hiring, an uncertain picture for wage growth and sticky inflation, consumer resilience will be tested in an environment where, as PYMNTS Intelligence has found , a growing percentage of households are finding that proactive planning for their financial futures — and spending plans — are becoming solely reactive to a constantly shifting macro landscape.

First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes.

    "article_text": "Shoppers hold bags while waiting to cross Post Street in San Francisco on March 27. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images Washington CNN — The US economy shrank slightly less in the beginning of the year than previously reported, new data shows, but it was still the first quarterly decline since 2022, in a sign of how President Donald Trump’s chaotic and aggressive tariff regime is affecting American consumers and businesses. Gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered an annualized rate of -0.2% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s second estimate released Thursday. An initial estimate showed that GDP fell 0.3%. Trump’s tariffs have prompted American companies and consumers to pull forward purchases to get ahead of any sticker shock stemming from the duties, which has sent imports surging. But a federal court’s ruling late Wednesday has thrown Trump’s entire trade policy into question. Still, Trump’s trade war is far from over. His administration appealed Wednesday’s ruling from the three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade in Manhattan. Uncertainty stemming from Trump’s policies is expected to persist, but there are also questions over the underlying health of the US economy. The latest GDP data isn’t quelling those fears: A key gauge of demand in the economy — referred to as real final sales to private domestic purchasers — was revised down by a sizable half percentage-point for the first quarter. Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was also revised lower, factoring in weaker spending on food, cars and financial services. An upward revision to private inventory investment — specifically by nondurable goods manufacturers and companies in the information industry — offset those new weaker figures. Will the economy’s resilience persist? Americans remain uneasy over the chaotic and erratic rollout of Trump’s tariffs, but the jury is still out on whether consumers will continue to spend, or tighten their belt. In recent years, pessimism about the economy hasn’t led to weaker spending, as happened in 2022 and 2023, when consumers fretted over high inflation and a standoff in Congress about the debt ceiling. The latest consumer surveys show that people’s attitudes toward the economy remain in the doldrums. The strength of consumer spending is closely tied to the health of the labor market. Top policymakers at the Federal Reserve fear unemployment could soon pick up , especially if Trump’s trade war spirals out of control. Fed officials “assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months,” according to minutes from the central bank’s policy meeting earlier this month, with some noting that “their contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty.” In an aerial view, a shipping container is lifted off a container ship docked at the Port of Oakland on April 28, 2025 in Oakland, California. Federal Reserve economists revised up their projections for inflation this year and lowered their expectations for economic growth. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Fed expects the job market ‘to weaken substantially’ on Trump’s tariffs So far, there haven’t been any cracks in America’s long-robust labor market , with employers continuing to add jobs at a brisk pace and unemployment remaining relatively low. But if the labor market does deteriorate, that won’t bode well for consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy. And Americans stretching themselves to pull forward purchases to beat Trump’s tariffs means the economy would be in a vulnerable position if the job market ever begins to falter. “If you think appliance and vehicle prices are going to rise, you might accelerate your plans, but if you don’t have the cash for these purchases, relying on credit could be risky during uncertain times,” Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in an analyst note Thursday. “Newly delinquent credit accounts are on the rise, so in addition to anticipating the effects of new economic policies on prices, we’ll want to keep an eye on the potential impact to household debt management,” she said."

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: May 29, 2025 at 9:23 AM EDT | UPDATED: May 29, 2025 at 11:33 AM EDT By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump’s trade wars disrupted business, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its initial estimate. First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes. The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. Imports grew at a 42.6% pace, fastest since third-quarter 2020, and shaved more than 5 percentage points off GDP growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply. And federal government spending fell at a 4.6% annual pace, the biggest drop in three years. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that’s mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what’s produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Costa Rican coffee — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. The first-quarter import surge likely won’t be repeated in the April-June quarter and therefore shouldn’t weigh on GDP. From January through March, business investment surged 24.4%. An increase in inventories — as businesses stocked up ahead of the tariffs — added more than 2.6 percentage points to first-quarter GDP growth. A category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a 2.5% annual rate from January through March, down from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024 but still solid. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Trump’s tariffs have added considerable uncertainty to the economic outlook. He has imposed 10% tariffs on almost every country on earth in addition to levies on steel, aluminum and autos. A federal court on Wednesday blocked the 10% tariffs as well as specific taxes on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports, saying the president had overstepped his authority. Thursday’s report was the second of three Commerce Department estimates of first-quarter GDP. The final version arrives June 26.

    "article_text": "Capex stronger than tariffs? While tariffs are casting doubt on growth, US business capex is resisting. Could the development of AI provide lasting support for the US economy? Antoine Alves d'Oliveira Published on 05/29/2025 at 08:45 am EDT Share This is the question all investors have been asking since Donald Trump launched his tariff war in early April: will the uncertainty created lead companies to cut their investments? This is a key question because it is often the source of an economic slowdown. A freeze in business investment weakens the labor market, which in turn affects consumption. Capex remains steady At this stage, these concerns have not materialized. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, US companies are continuing to invest. With Q1 results now out, companies have sent a reassuring signal: 71% of companies in the Russell 3000 index have maintained their capital expenditure (Capex) forecasts for 2025. Furthermore, 8.5% have raised them, compared with 18% that have reduced them. Last night's results published by Nvidia show that this investment momentum is well underway. Quarterly revenue rose 69% y-o-y. And for this quarter, Nvidia anticipates 50% revenue growth. All of this is largely supported by investments from major US technology stocks. When it announced its Q1 results, Alphabet confirmed its intention to invest $75bn to develop its AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Meta even raised its Capex forecast from $65bn to $72bn. Is tech stronger than tariffs? So, should we focus on the Capex of the magnificent seven or on Donald Trump's tariffs? What we can say is that the market narrative leaves us with the impression that everything depends on the decisions of one man. And we end up underestimating the strength of the private sector and the ability of US companies to pursue their goals. So, can the AI boom drive US growth for the next few years and render the discussion about the impact of tariffs anecdotal? This is certainly the view of Nouriel Roubini, an economist who became famous for predicting the 2008 crisis. This earned him the nickname \"Dr. Doom.\" His success led him to continually predict disasters - and therefore to be wrong most of the time. But now he is no longer predicting a crash, but rather a boom in US growth, driven by this cycle of investment in new technologies, particularly AI. And this despite poor economic policies. This position is summed up well by the following quote: \"Even if Mickey Mouse were president, the US would still be on track for 4% growth, because innovation in the US private sector promises to offset bad policies and erratic governance.\" According to him, this growth would therefore be twice as fast as the current estimate of US potential growth. This is a very optimistic forecast, and one that should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, Nouriel Roubini can be credited with recognizing that the macro impact of artificial intelligence is beginning to be felt. According to estimates by Apollo Global Management's chief economist, Torsten Slok, investments in data centers contributed 1 percentage point of growth in the first quarter of 2025. Source: Bloomberg, Macrobond, Apollo Global Management While the tech sector is driving growth, it is worth noting that the US economy is still heavily reliant on consumer spending. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending accounted for 68% of GDP in Q1 2025. As such, any potential slowdown in consumer spending could have a significant impact on the overall economy. Therefore, it is essential to monitor consumer sentiment and spending patterns closely to gauge the health of the US economy. © MarketScreener.com - 2025 Share"

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) KEN MORITSUGU May 28, 2025 2 min read BEIJING (AP) — European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices , according to an annual survey released Wednesday. Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the United States over surging exports . “The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,” the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey 2025. The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand. The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets . In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ. The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidized electric vehicle production. “I think there’s a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,” Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week. He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn’t outpace that in demand. The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February. “It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,” he said.

Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value and cost of college, with most saying they feel the U.S. higher education system is headed in the âwrong direction,â according to a new poll. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Comment on this story 0 Comment Share story Share topics: Student loans Credit scores Borrowers Payments Delinquency Economy Inflation Recession WASHINGTON (TNND) — Millions of Americans are seeing dramatic declines in their credit scores from falling behind on student loan payments , making it more expensive and challenging for them to borrow money at a time when interest rates are already elevated and concerns about the economy wobbling into a recession remain abundant. Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million borrowers and another 1 million saw their scores fall by 150 points or more in the first quarter of the year, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis . It is a stark drop-off in personal credit ratings that is like declaring bankruptcy and more than half of the people would have had scores to qualify for loans on a home, car or opening a new credit card before they were reported. Hits to millions of Americans’ credit scores comes after the Department of Education announced last month it would send borrowers to collections for falling behind on payments after several years of paused payments and attempts to remake the student loan system during the Biden administration. Some 5 million borrowers were expected to have accounts sent to collections on the May 5 deadline with another 4 million in late-stage delinquency, meaning even more borrowers could face similar consequences in the coming months. Accounts in default face garnished wages, tax refunds and other federal benefits, which was common practice prior to the pandemic but is a major shake-up for recent graduates and others who went through years without being required to make payments. Payments on federal student loans were paused in March of 2020 as the pandemic brought a freeze over the global economy. Borrowers were brought back into repayment in 2023 but were still given a one-year grace period to give people more time to adjust back into repayment or prepare to make them for the first time. It comes at a time of tremendous economic uncertainty for consumers and broader economy with lingering inflation and whiplash from tariffs that have economists concerned about increased chances of a recession. Borrowing costs are also elevated with higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve that has shown little appetite for cuts during recent meetings and speeches from officials. The youngest borrowers have the highest amount of debt but are also least likely to be delinquent on payments, according to the New York Fed’s analysis. For every age group over 40, at least 25% of student loan borrowers was more than 90 days past due on their payments in the first three months of the year, a signal that adults more likely to have families and homes are struggling to keep up with their debt. “This whole thing has been kind of a car crash unfolding in slow motion,” said Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman. “A lot of what's happened here is people got used to not paying these student loans. Their costs for everything else went up because of inflation and high interest rates, and a lot of people are having trouble squeezing these payments into the budget right now.” Poor credit scores make it harder and more expensive to secure loans for major purchases but also trickle down into other regular necessities that make it harder for people already feeling the squeeze to afford to get by. Credit scores increase cost of living by raising other common costs like cellphone and insurance bills and limit the amount of money consumers can borrow. In addition to having a harder time accessing credit, many borrowers could now be faced with a choice of what bills to pay or be forced to cut back on spending altogether. Consumer spending makes up about 70% of total U.S. economic activity, meaning the health of the consumer is an important factor in the success of the American economy. It’s unclear how much of a drag the end of the student loan grace period and delinquencies will have on the overall economy but it adds another risk to a shaky environment. Consumers have mostly maintained spending levels so far in 2025, but economists are skeptical that momentum will continue without a turnaround from the White House on trade policy and two gauges of sentiment have fallen through the first quarter of the year. “I don't foresee tremendous effects on the overall economy, just because consumer spending has been remarkably resilient the past few years,” Rossman said. “I see it more as a household kind of issue, more of a pockets of trouble kind of thing, as opposed to something that's going to derail overall consumer spending because consumer spending has been remarkably robust.” Forecasters are also expecting costs to rise as a result of wide-ranging tariffs put in place on all of America’s biggest trading partners that could further squeeze consumers that are still hurting from the effects of inflation that remains over 2%.

Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real-estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the US over surging exports. “The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,” the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey. EU Chamber of Commerce in China president Jens Eskelund gives a presentation during a press conference in Beijing yesterday. Photo: EPA-EFE The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) that factory capacity far outpaces demand. The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets. In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ. The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidized electric vehicle production. “I think there’s a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,” EU Chamber of Commerce in China president Jens Eskelund told reporters earlier this week. He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending, but said Beijing must also take steps to ensure that supply growth does not outpace that in demand. The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February. “It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,” he said.

Huang, who arrived in Taiwan yesterday ahead of meetings with longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電), took the opportunity to clarify recent comments about the US-China AI race.

    "article_text": "The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.21% ) has rebounded 18% since hitting bottom in early April after President Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The index rocketed higher on Tuesday, May 27, as trade tensions eased between the European Union and the United States. But the stock market still faces several hurdles this week. Specifically, Nvidia ( NVDA 3.06% ) will announce its first-quarter financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, May 28, and the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes from its May meeting earlier that same day. Then the Commerce Department will release PCE inflation and consumer spending data for April on Friday, May 30. Here's what investors should know. Nvidia will announce first-quarter financial results on May 28 Nvidia will report its earnings results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Wednesday, May 28. The company guided for 65% sales growth and 49% non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income growth. But many analysts have downwardly revised their estimates during the last three months due to concerns about chip export restrictions and tariffs. The Wall Street consensus currently implies earnings will increase 44% to $0.88 per diluted share. Investors should pay close attention to gross margin . Nvidia's gross margin narrowed three percentage points to 73.5% in the fourth quarter, and company guidance says that number will contract further to 71% in the first quarter. Gross margin can be a proxy for pricing power, and Nvidia's has been slipping due to the costly ramp-up of its Blackwell GPU . CFO Colette Kress says gross margin should return to the mid-70% range \"late this fiscal year.\" Importantly, options traders are currently pricing in a good amount of volatility post-earnings. The market expects Nvidia stock to move about 6% after the report, which implies a closing share price between $123 and $140 on the next day. An earnings beat is no guarantee Nvidia shares will move higher. If management gives a gloomy outlook concerning export restrictions or tariffs, the stock could drop. And that downward momentum could spread to other semiconductor stocks and technology stocks . Image source: Getty Images. The Federal Reserve will publish the minutes from its recent meeting on May 28 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) , the policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve , concluded its latest two-day meeting on May 7. Officials left the benchmark interest rate unchanged, but the minutes from the meeting will be published on Wednesday, May 28. Importantly, the minutes from the March meeting detailed concerns about tariffs imposed by President Trump , saying: \"Participants assessed that the uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased, with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside.\" Those conditions -- rising prices in combination with higher unemployment and slower economic growth -- are symptoms of stagflation . Numerous economists have warned tariffs will lead to stagflation, and the market is especially worried about that outcome because it would be a no-win situation for the Federal Reserve. Policymakers could cut interest rates to support the labor market and prevent a recession, but lower rates would make inflation worse. Alternatively, policymakers could raise interest rates to curb inflation, but higher rates would further suppress economic growth and lead to greater unemployment. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have not yet had a material impact on the economy, but investors will undoubtedly scrutinize the minutes from the FOMC's May meeting for insight into what Fed officials expect in the coming months. Any bad news could send stocks lower, but reassuring news could give the market a boost. The Commerce Department will release updated PCE inflation and consumer spending data on May 30 The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. Unlike the Consumer Price Index (CPI) , which measures inflation based on urban consumers' out-of-pocket spending, the PCE price index includes urban and rural consumers, as well as spending done on consumers' behalf. For instance, health insurance paid by an employer on behalf of employees would only show up in PCE inflation. The Commerce Department will release updated PCE figures at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, May 30. The consensus estimate says PCE prices rose 2.2% year over year in April 2025. If accurate, that would be the lowest number since 2.1% in September 2024. Stocks could swing lower if the actual reading is materially higher than the consensus because it would suggest tariffs are causing price increases across the economy. The Commerce Department will also release consumer spending data at the same time. The consensus estimate says consumer spending rose 0.2% month over month in April 2025. If accurate, that would be the lowest number since 0% in January 2025. Stocks could swing lower if the actual reading is materially lower because it would suggest tariffs are causing consumers to spend less, and consumer spending is the largest driver of economic growth ."

(AP Photo/Andy Wong) The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand. The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets. In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ. The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidized electric vehicle production. “I think there’s a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,” Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week. He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn’t outpace that in demand.

The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February. “It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,” he said.

    "article_text": "Shares of American Express ( AXP +0.62% ) jumped on Tuesday. The company's stock rose 3% by the time the market closed. The move up comes as the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.21% ) jumped 2% and the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC 0.25% ) jumped 2.5%. Shares of the credit card giant jumped after May's consumer confidence report showed consumers' attitudes were much rosier than expected. Expand NYSE : AXP American Express Today's Change ( 0.62 %) $ 2.28 Current Price $ 370.16 Key Data Points Market Cap $253B Day's Range $ 366.26 - $ 373.08 52wk Range $ 220.43 - $ 373.08 Volume 2.1M Avg Vol 2.5M Gross Margin 61.04 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % A positive report Released today, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for May showed sentiment has reversed course. The 98 rating was up from April's 85.7 and is the first time the index ticked up in months after President Trump hit pause on a global trade war. Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, Global Indicators at The Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence improved in May after five consecutive months of decline. The rebound was already visible before the May 12 U.S.-China trade deal, but gained momentum afterwards. The monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index -- business conditions, employment prospects, and future income -- rose from their April lows. Image source: Getty Images. Amex is inflation-resistant The news that consumer confidence was up helped boost American Express stock, as the company is heavily dependent on consumer spending habits. The company, a longtime favorite of Warren Buffett, is a solid pick among the competition . As both a bank and a payment network, its vertical integration provides it certain advantages, and unlike the companies actually producing or selling products to consumers, its margins aren't pressured by inflation. Of course, the real threat is a major slowdown of consumer spending, but if that happens, there are few companies that would be untouched."

    "article_text": "Blog World Trade The Consumer Economy The Consumer Economy Posted May 27, 2025 by Martin Armstrong | Spread the love The US represents only 5% of the global population, and yet, Americans are responsible for 25% of all global consumption. Americans consume around 25% of the world’s oil, 27% of global aluminum, 23% of all coal, and 19% of copper. Nations are still standing in line to offload their goods to Americans. There are more people on the continent of Europe than in America, but they spend significantly less per capita. Total consumer spending for the entire 27-bloc European Union reached $9.589 trillion in 2023, and with a population of around 450 million, this came out to around $21,300 per person. This figure went down to €18,768 in 2024. Per capita consumer spending in the US hit $51,500 last year, as the average American spends twice as much as the average European. China’s middle class is growing and will one day surpass America. At the moment, the average Chinese person spends 28,227 yuan or $4,800 . Their population size rivals Europe and America, but the money is simply not there. Spending rose 5.3% in China from 2023 to 2024, when you account for inflation, it rose around 5.1%. Even if one adjusts for purchasing power parity (PPP), the US spending per capita is 7X greater than China’s. Private consumption averaged 55.2% of Europe’s GDP from 1995 to 2024. Spending remains the single largest factor in the European economy. Economic uncertainty and inflation are causing consumers to spend less and this will severely harm Europe’s economy. Even small changes in consumer spending can offset the European economy. Nations always go to war when they need funding. Russia is the wealthiest nation in terms of natural resources. This conquest is the same as when Japan went into Manchuria; it is why Europe wants to go into Russia.

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size On May 21, US Vice President J.D. Vance described the development of artificial intelligence as an “arms race” with China. If America paused out of concerns over AI safety, he said, it might find itself “enslaved to PRC-mediated AI”. The idea of a superpower showdown that will culminate in a moment of triumph or defeat circulates relentlessly in Washington, DC, and beyond. Chinese President Xi Jinping has his eyes on the AI crown. Credit: AP This month, the bosses of OpenAI, AMD, CoreWeave and Microsoft lobbied for lighter regulation, casting AI as central to America’s remaining the global hegemon. On May 15, US President Donald Trump brokered an AI deal with the United Arab Emirates he said would ensure American “dominance in AI”. America plans to spend more than $US1 trillion ($1.6 trillion) by 2030 on data centres for AI models. The “DeepSeek moment” in January, when the Chinese firm unveiled a large-language model (LLM) matching the capabilities of an OpenAI model, confirmed that China is snapping at the heels of the United States. Yet, a recent meeting of the Communist Party’s leadership suggests it is preparing for a different kind of strategic race. “American firms focus on the model, but Chinese players emphasise practically applying AI,” says Tsinghua University’s Zhang Yaqin, a former boss of tech giant Baidu. This focus on practical applications – in factories and for consumers – is how China stole a lead in e-commerce and e-payments. On May 19, Jensen Huang, the boss of Nvidia, a chip firm, warned the US could be left behind again. If American firms did not compete in China as it built a “rich ecosystem”, Chinese technology and leadership “will diffuse all around the world”, he told the newsletter, Stratechery . Loading America’s view of AI is often abstract and hyperbolic. LLMs are expected to match humans’ cognitive abilities, with boosters believing this rubicon of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be crossed in a couple of years. OpenAI chief Sam Altman reckons the next step could be superintelligent systems that actually surpass human abilities in cognitive tasks. Being the first to develop a model that can recursively improve itself (some call this “take-off”) may create a decisive advantage comparable to being the first to develop a nuclear bomb. Barath Harithas, of think tank CSIS, notes that American planners think “the first country to secure the AGI laurel will usher in the 100-year dynasty”. America’s export controls on semiconductors are there to ensure China comes second. Advertisement It is true some Chinese entrepreneurs are also believers in the arms race. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng has made developing AGI his firm’s mission and also believes it may arrive as soon as in two years. Less noticed is that the government is betting on a different approach. Liang’s exploits won him a meeting with China’s Premier, Li Qiang, in January. But days later, a vice-premier in charge of China’s science effort seemed to rebuke the American approach, stating: “China will not blindly follow trends or engage in unrestrained international competition.” Last month, Qiushi , the most authoritative Communist Party journal, described AGI as a tool “to promote human understanding and transformation of the world”. In China, the term for AGI, “tongyong rengong zhineng”, typically refers to a “general-purpose AI” that is applied and has multiple uses, rather than to the Western concept of a superhuman, or self-improving system. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has warned America could be left behind again. Credit: AP In April, the Politburo met for its second-ever study session on AI (the first was in 2018). At the meeting, Xi told his lieutenants that China should focus on how it could be applied to everyday uses: more like electricity than nuclear weapons. At least a dozen prominent researchers and government officials have aired scepticism over the reasoning ability of LLMs. Wu Zhaohui, a former minister of science and the current vice-president of a state think tank, suggests China needs to explore different paths to AGI. Chinese experts generally expect AGI to take longer to arrive than do their American counterparts, notes Zhang of Tsinghua. “While American tech leaders often frame AI with utopian aspirations, China’s government appears more focused on using it to solve concrete problems like economic growth and industrial upgrading,” says Karson Elmgren of think tank RAND. The government’s annual work report in March mentions a new campaign called “AI+”, which prioritises firms adopting AI in their existing operations, including physical facilities using automated robots. This mimics the “Internet+” campaign a decade ago to create a more sophisticated digital consumer economy than the West. ‘If we merely follow the well-worn American path — computing power, algorithms, deployment — we will always remain followers.’ Zhu Songchun, head of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence This application-oriented approach reflects a shortage of AI talent and chips, or “basic theory and key core technologies,” Xi said in April. “We must face up to the gap.” Liu Zhiyuan, of Tsinghua University, compared China’s approach to an argument in “On Protracted War”, a series of lectures by Mao Zedong in 1938: a weak opponent can tire out a strong one, and outlast them. On May 8, Qiushi published an article by Tang Jie, also of Tsinghua University, advocating China be a fast follower of American innovation, focusing on being cheaper and quicker to create applications. China’s emerging AI strategy seems to have two parts. One is to undercut the monopoly America has over advanced AI, by replicating Western innovations and releasing the model weights for free, or “open source”, as DeepSeek has done. The idea is that the value AI generates will accrue to those who apply it, not to the model-makers themselves. By the time AGI arrives, China will be better placed than America, with “robust social applications, search engines, agents, and hardware in place”, according to Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent Beijing-based entrepreneur. He argues that by amassing users and data early, Chinese applications can build a moat that Western competitors will struggle to cross, just as the video app, TikTok, has done. Alongside the push to deploy AI faster and more cheaply, there is an effort to create moonshots that bypass America’s trillion-dollar bet on LLMs. “If we merely follow the well-worn American path — computing power, algorithms, deployment — we will always remain followers,” Zhu Songchun, head of the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, a state-run laboratory dedicated to advanced AI, said in a speech last month. Loading In April, the Shanghai government offered funding for researchers advancing towards AGI using new kinds of architectures, such as models that interact with the real world through imagery, others that can control computers with the mind, or as-yet theoretical algorithms to emulate the human brain. Will China’s approach work? A new IMF study concludes AI could boost America’s economy by 5.6 per cent in 10 years, compared with 3.5 per cent for China, largely because China’s relatively small services sector means that even if AI diffuses fast in manufacturing, the productivity gains are capped. Yet, what is clear is that China is accelerating down a different track. One sign of this is Apple: In order to reverse a decline in its revenue in China, it desperately needs a local partner to provide AI services which customers now expect. But recent reports suggest the American government may block it from doing so. Without local AI applications, American tech products, such as the iPhone, risk becoming also-rans in China, and perhaps, in time, elsewhere.

    "article_text": "Share Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN )’s CEO Andy Jassy said Wednesday that consumer spending shows no signs of slowing, despite sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Jassy confirmed demand remains stable and average selling prices have not risen significantly, despite tariff exposure on goods sourced from China. To counter supply chain risks, AMZN executed early inventory buys, aiming to shield shoppers from cost hikes. In contrast, Walmart and Target signaled looming price increases, while Home Depot plans to hold prices steady. Trump criticized Walmart’s response, demanding it “EAT THE TARIFFS.” christian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash Jassy noted that third-party sellers, who drive about 60% of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s retail volume, have taken mixed pricing approaches. Still, he emphasized that the marketplace’s scale helps maintain competitive selection and pricing. Separately, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) faced pressure on ESG fronts. Shareholders voted down all eight external proposals, including those targeting carbon transparency, workplace safety, and data center sustainability, each opposed by company leadership. Final vote counts will be disclosed shortly. The meeting capped off a turbulent period: layoffs in AMZN’s devices group, a robotaxi recall from Zoox, and Jeff Bezos’s plan to unload $4.8 billion in stock. Still, Amazon signals confidence in its ability to manage policy headwinds without compromising customer value.

    "article_text": "Agencies EMIs, Inflation, No Savings: The Indian Middle Class Is Bleeding Quietly, Says Bengaluru CEO A searing LinkedIn post by PeepalCo CEO Ashish Singhal has ignited fierce debate over what he calls the \"biggest scam no one talks about\"—the financial pressure facing India’s middle class. “Over the past 10 years: The group earning under ₹5L saw a 4% CAGR. ₹5L–₹1Cr income group has seen just 0.4% CAGR. Food prices? Up nearly 80%. Purchasing power? Cut almost in half. But spending? Up, funded by credit,” Singhal wrote. His words hit a nerve. The middle class, he argues, is absorbing economic shocks silently—without complaints, without support. Indian middle class salary is ‘well-dressed decline’ hidden in plain sight Despite rising costs of living and almost static wage growth , middle-class Indians continue to live what looks like a stable life. They still take holidays, upgrade their smartphones, and pay their EMIs. But beneath the surface, Singhal claims, the reality is bleak. “This isn’t a collapse. It’s a well-dressed decline. You’re still flying once a year. Still buying a phone. Still paying EMIs. But you’re also skipping the savings. Delaying the doctor visit. Doing the mental math in every Zomato checkout,” he observed. Live Events Behind this illusion of progress lies a heavy reliance on credit. As salaries stagnate, credit cards and loans are filling the gap. Financial stress is rising—but it remains largely invisible. India's middle class gets no bailouts, no support. Just quiet pressure. Singhal’s post has gained traction because it names a widely felt but rarely discussed issue. Middle-income earners—those in the ₹5 lakh to ₹1 crore bracket—have seen wage growth crawl at just 0.4% annually. Meanwhile, essential expenses—food, education, fuel, healthcare—have soared. He warns that while the poor benefit from welfare and the rich expand through investments, the middle class is left to shoulder the load. “The poor are being supported. The rich are scaling. The middle class is just expected to absorb the shock, in silence. No complaints. No bailouts. Just inflation, EMIs, and quiet pressure,” he wrote. Online Reactions: Agreement, frustration, and some pushback The post struck a chord online. Many LinkedIn users echoed Singhal’s sentiment. One founder commented, “The middle class is quietly getting squeezed from both sides. But it’s also its own fault for choosing to stay quiet and naively hoping that just staying the course of 9 to 9 jobs, home loans and car loans will improve the situation.” Another CEO asked Singhal to reflect on his own pay practices: “Good one. But, as CEO, what was the pay rise you gave to your employees vis-a-vis yours? That should be interesting to know.” Some users felt nothing would change. “Crying on any platform won’t make any difference. India was moving on like this and will continue like this,” one commenter wrote. Another added, “Salary alone can't make anyone wealthy anywhere in the world.” Yet others offered a more optimistic view. One LinkedIn user shared that his income had grown and his living standards had improved. Still, the overwhelming response reflected unease. This isn’t the first time someone has flagged the growing stress on the Indian middle class. Last month, investment banker Kanishk Kar shared a similar warning on LinkedIn. “Incomes haven’t kept up with inflation… The cost of basics — food, rent, fuel, school fees — is rising faster than wages. Every month, that ‘buffer’ money is getting thinner,” Kar wrote. He added, “The Indian middle class is not lazy. Not entitled. Not unambitious. They’re just running on a treadmill that’s speeding up while their shoes are wearing out. If we want a stronger India, we need to stop treating them like they’re fine. Because they’re not.” A shrinking middle-class: Big numbers, small gaiins India’s middle class, which made up 31% of the population in 2021, is expected to rise to 38% by 2031 and 60% by 2047. But despite this growth in numbers, the class’s financial well-being is eroding. Households are managing lifestyle expenses—but often at the cost of savings, insurance, and health. Aspirational living is funded not by rising income, but by rising debt. Behind the numbers lies a sobering truth: India’s middle class—the backbone of its consumer economy—is under stress, silently slipping into a less secure future Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

The Minneapolis-based company reported fiscal first-quarter results that missed estimates on the top and bottom lines, while also slashing its full-year financial guidance. Target CEO Brian Cornell mentioned declining consumer confidence and uncertainty around tariffs as some of the issues facing the Minneapolis-based retail chain during the quarter that ended on May 3. TGT 1D mountain Shares of Target fell Wednesday after the retailer's earnings came in short of expectations. While it is difficult to break out the impact of strained consumers versus Target's other issues, the latest earnings report could serve as an early sign that Americans are starting to pull back on spending, which accounts for a bit more than two thirds of the U.S. economy. Some recent data supports that theory. JPMorgan analyst Richard Shane said Wednesday in a note to clients that Chase data has shown a slowdown in spending in recent weeks. \"In the most recent 30 days, there were 5 days where spending was more than 15 [basis points] above the [year to date] average and 15 days where spending was at least 15bps below the YTD average,\" Shane said. The JPMorgan data is through May 13. And while Target's stock is down more than 31% this year, the market at large doesn't appear to be pricing in a serious slowdown in consumer spending. \"We still have questions about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and whether the market has overshot pricing out the risks from recent tariff reversals,\" Sean Simonds of UBS said in a note to clients. \"Our models suggest more consumer discretionary downside momentum and relative outperformance coming from communication services and utilities.\" To be sure, some of Target's issues seem company specific. Wells Fargo analyst Edward Kelly wrote \"there has been consumer pressure, but TGT looks to have underperformed.\" And some of the slowdown in consumer spending could also be a function falling gas prices. But when one of the country's largest brick and mortar retailers reports a year-over-year sales decline, it may be a sign that investors should take soft data like consumer sentiment more seriously. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

    "article_text": "SAO PAULO, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On May 20th, 2025, the first \"China-Brazil Economic and Finance Conference\" organized and hosted by China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), was successfully held in São Paulo, Brazil. Hundreds of government officials, representatives from leading enterprises and investment institutions across China and Brazil attended the conference. At the event, Xu Yicheng, CICC’s Member of Management Committee, represented the company. In his opening remarks, Xu emphasized that Chinese enterprises possess extensive experience in development, application, and operation across both traditional sectors such as equipment manufacturing and infrastructure, and emerging industries such as high technology and new energy. These strengths align well with Brazil’s new \"Growth Acceleration Program\" and its \"re-industrialization\" transformation needs. Looking ahead, he noted the broad prospects and abundant opportunities for cooperation between the two countries in areas such as trade and investment, industrial complementarity, green transition, and technological innovation. Xu also introduced CICC’s business advantages, its commitment to internationalization, and the company’s recent progress in Brazil. Notably, CICC has successfully assisted with the split and divestiture of Oi’s broadband business, facilitated Goldwind’s smooth acquisition of GE’s wind equipment manufacturing plant in Brazil, and ensured a seamless transition for Daimler’s sale of its Brazilian passenger car plant to Great Wall Motors. The conference featured over twenty prominent speakers from governments, financial institutions, and leading enterprises in both countries, engaging in discussions on macroeconomics, cross-border investment trends, industry and financial market developments. Key topics included \"Economic, Trade and Investment Perspectives between China and Brazil,\" \"Clean Energy Frontier: Advancing China-Brazil Cooperation in Sustainable Energy,\" and \"Deepening China-Brazil Economic Ties: Consumer Economy Driving New Cross-border Investment Trends.\" Representatives from organizations included the Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), Eletrobras, the Brazil-China Business Council, and the Brazilian Stock Exchange B3. This event marks CICC’s first high-level conference in Latin America. In the future, CICC will continue leveraging its integrated strengths in \"investment + investment banking + research\" to promote investment and cross-border capital flows between China and Brazil. CICC’s future plans include facilitating further investment by leading Chinese enterprises in Brazil, mainly in clean energy, mining, agriculture, advanced manufacturing, e-commerce, and infrastructure, while supporting Brazilian companies’ investments and capital market activities in China, such as issuing RMB-denominated bonds (Panda Bonds) and listings in Hong Kong. By expanding its business activities in Latin America and deepening engagement with local public sectors, enterprises, financial institutions, and research organizations, CICC will seek to further advance China-Brazil investment cooperation further and inject new momentum into cross-border economic and trade development. About CICC China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC, 601995.SH, 3908.HK) was established in 1995.

In a survey released Monday, 51 percent of respondents said they believe the economy is “strong,” the Daily Caller reported, citing a Harvard University Center for American Political Studies (CAPS)/Harris poll. The poll also found that 63 percent support cutting the size of the government and 55 percent believe the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been “very effective” at cutting government spending. “The Harvard CAPS/Harris survey was conducted online within the U.S. on May 14 to 15, among 1,903 registered voters by The Harris Poll and HarrisX,” the Caller article said.

    "article_text": "Klarna’s consumer credit losses rose 17% in the first quarter, though the company said that doesn’t reveal much about consumers’ finances. Gabby Jones / Bloomberg via Getty Images May 20, 2025, 11:40 AM EDT By J.J. McCorvey Klarna’s customers are having a harder time paying back the installment loans they take out with the popular \"buy now, pay later\" service. The Swedish company’s net losses doubled in the first quarter even as its user base and revenue grew, Klarna reported Monday , weeks after pausing its plans to go public over concerns about tariffs and economic uncertainty. Klarna’s consumer credit losses swelled 17% in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier, hitting $136 million. Industrywide, BNPL borrowers are increasingly falling behind on their loan payments. In a survey conducted by the credit platform LendingTree last month, 41% of users said they paid late within the last year, up from 34% the previous year. At least a quarter of BNPL users took out loans to pay for groceries, the survey found, up from 14%. The debt strain among BNPL customers coincides with broader signs of stretched household finances. U.S. consumer debt rose by $167 billion to hit a record $18.2 trillion in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week. Credit card balances fell, as they typically do in the months after the holidays, along with auto loan debt. But student loan delinquencies surged from less than 1% to almost 8% as the Trump administration cracks down on federal student loan borrowers. It’s against this backdrop that BNPL services continue to extend their reach throughout the consumer economy. Klarna recently deposed rival Affirm to become Walmart’s exclusive BNPL provider . And in March, it joined forces with food delivery service DoorDash , adding to industrywide efforts that have made near-instant access to credit increasingly ubiquitous for even small-dollar, routine purchases . A Klarna spokesperson said the 17% jump in consumer credit losses “doesn’t tell you much about the U.S. consumer” and pointed instead to the company’s credit losses as a share of the total sum it loaned out, or “gross merchandise value.” This metric rose from 0.51% to 0.54%, the spokesperson said, “so a very slight increase but still very low.” Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been walking back efforts to tighten regulation of BNPL services even as they become a growing source of financial difficulties for consumers. Earlier this month, the sharply curtailed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it would no longer enforce a Biden-era rule treating BNPL providers as credit card lenders, which had required stricter protections around disclosures, customer disputes and refund processing. The rule had been issued as “guidance,” a practice that had become more common under then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who was fired in February . Some consumer finance experts say that has made it easier for the agency’s current leadership to roll back recent policies. Many consumers are trimming their spending as prices for many purchases continue to rise . Household spending rose 4.5% in April from a year earlier, down somewhat from the 4.6% annual uptick as of December, according to a New York Fed survey released this month. Much of that was driven by a pullback among households making less than $100,000 a year, the researchers said, as shoppers become more cautious about big-ticket purchases. Even so, average household spending growth remains far hotter than before the pandemic, they found. J.J. McCorvey J.J. McCorvey is a business and economy reporter for NBC News."

    "article_text": "Investors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to preserve a President Joe Biden migration program because it benefits employers and the economy with 530,000 new workers, consumers, and renters. The “policy brief” by FWD.us, a lobby group for investors, is intended for the U.S. Supreme Court, which is reviewing Biden’s parole pipeline for Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) migrants. In April, a Massachusetts judge blocked President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to end the program. The May 19 claim by the investor group said the four-country CHNV program met the legal test of providing a “significant public benefit”: The CHNV Parole Processes have been a tremendous benefit to the American economy … FWD.us estimates that as of September 30, 2024, there were 240,000 adult CHNV recipients active in the labor force, including: 40,000 in manufacturing; 30,000 in construction; 30,000 in leisure and hospitality; and 30,000 recipients in health service. But the report downplays the wealth transfer to the investors caused by Biden’s invitation to millions of foreign workers, consumers, and renters. For example, the report claims the policy was “curbing inflation.” Left unsaid is that the migration policy helped curb wage inflation by reducing American employees’ ability to earn higher wages in an economy flooded with migrant workers. The FWD.us report also admits that the program imported 100,000 children into the K-12 classes. But the diverted educational resources are needed by American children, especially as the lower wages and higher housing costs crippled Americans’ ability to have as many children as they prefer. A May 15 legal brief by mostly Democrat-run cities and states said : “immigrant families, including CHNV participants, have added to the rich fabric of our communities by enrolling their children in our schools, engaging in and strengthening our communities, and working across our diverse economies.” The report also hides the rising rents caused by the huge inflow, saying that “U.S. sponsors who would provide housing [would] reduce burdens on receiving communities.” In reality, the additional migrants helped push up the cost of housing for Americans, including for the millions of unemployed working-age Americans who have been pushed out of the labor market in recent years. But the report happily touts economic gains by employers: In the CHNV Parole Processes, the U.S. government made an implicit promise—to CHNV recipients, their U.S. sponsors, and the employers who hired them—and it has paid off … Thousands more employers, from local mom-and-pop shops to multinational corporations, have hired and trained CHNV recipients to fill crucial roles in their companies, delivering the products and services on which Americans rely. … Dismantling the CHNV Parole Processes midstream would hurt our economy, undermine the investments of employers who hired CHNV recipients in reliance on the government’s implicit promises … On the basis of these promises … countless employers have hired and trained workers. The FWD.us investors gain additional profits and stock values as migrants force down wages and push up costs. There is vast evidence that the government’s delivery of hard-working young migrants drives down wages and productivity , and also pushes up housing costs for ordinary Americans. Even the FWD.us investors admitted the link in a November 2024 report, which said, “as immigration decreased before and during the pandemic, these jobs remained largely unfilled, leading to extreme labor shortages and rising wages.” That economic loss is especially felt by working-class Americans who cannot afford decent family-friendly housing close to major cities because available housing is rented by rent-sharing groups of migrants, many of whom are rationally sending wages back to their home-country families. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently reported that lower-income workers in the leisure and hospitality industry gained the most pay gains in the brief period between Trump’s immigration curbs and President Joe Biden’s engineered migrant flood: The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes for business across all industries, though the effects were unequal. As lockdown restrictions aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19 were relaxed, nominal wage growth rose sharply in leisure and hospitality and in trade and transportation, the two industries with the highest concentration of low-wage workers. In fact, wage growth was most pronounced for workers in the bottom 50 percent of the wage distribution who changed jobs into one of these industries. The left-wing Economic Policy Institute reported similar findings in March 2024: In stark contrast to prior decades, low-wage workers experienced dramatically fast real wage growth between 2019 and 2023, but many workers continue to suffer from grossly inadequate wages and middle-wage workers face significant gaps across demographic groups. The migration programs do huge damage to poor countries by extracting human resources for use by U.S. investors. FWD.us has been the primary driver of migration policy in the Democratic Party since Trump’s 2016 win. Mark Zuckerberg and a founding corps of West Coast consumer-economy investors created FWD.us to support the “Gang of Eight” migration expansion bill. Those investors also included Bill Gates, Ron Conway, Reid Hoffman, and Chamath Palihapitiya, who now claims to support Donald Trump. In 2020, Zuckerberg and his policy adviser, David Plouffe, helped Biden defeat Trump. That helped ensure FWD.us got the pro-migration border chief it wanted, Alejandro Mayorkas. FWD.us worked closely with Mayorkas to expand southern migration under a new narrative of “humane, orderly and safe immigration” via supposedly “legal pathways.” After 22021, Mayorkas imported roughly nine million inadmissible migrants to serve as consumers, renters, and workers for the U.S. consumer economy. In March 2021, Kamala Harris deferred to Mayorkas’s FWD.us-approved policies when she rejected Biden’s request that she become the “border czar” above Mayorkas. In 2024, David Plouffe became the campaign manager for the Harris campaign. Also, FWD.us’ top lobbyist, Andrea Flores, joined the Kamala campaign team, according to Vox.com. FWD’s leaders — and their West Coast business partners — provided a huge share of Harris’s funding. FWD.us — and like-minded progressive foundations — also funded many of the progressive groups in the Democratic Party’s base, ensuring far greater support for migration than in 2012. Since the election, FWD.us has been pushing the claim that the public will accept more wealth-shifting migration if the border is kept calm. But Mayorkas gambled the party on that PR strategy in 2023 and 2024 and eventually admitted , “I don’t think we prevailed in communicating to the American people successfully the challenges of [invited] migration at a historic level since World War II.”"

Reuters Published 18 May 2025, 11:59 AM IST Indian cosmetics brand Colorbar eyes IPO in early 2027: Report Upcoming IPO : India's Colorbar Cosmetics is planning to go public in early 2027, after doubling its revenue this financial year by upgrading its designs, launching new products and opening more stores, the makeup and skincare brand's top boss told Reuters. Brands catering to wealthier Indians have weathered a high cost-of-living-led slowdown in consumer spending, as the affluent continue to splurge on comforts and luxuries. Also Read | Upcoming IPOs: 5 new issues, 2 listings scheduled for next week; check full list Colorbar expects to double revenue to over 10 billion rupees ($117 million) in the financial year starting April 1, including by introducing new packaging and store upgrades, its founder and managing director Samir Modi said. Modi said Colorbar, valued at 25 billion to 35 billion rupees, would go public in early 2027 and use the proceeds to strengthen its skincare and fragrance lines and pursue acquisitions, including overseas brands. Stocks of beauty brands including Nykaa and Honasa Consumer have taken a beating since listing as brokerages have raised concerns about profit margins due to heightened competition. Colorbar, which roughly broke even last year, faces competition too, not just from privately owned Indian brands including Sugar Cosmetics and MyGlamm but also from global majors such as Estee Lauder's Bobbi Brown and MAC. Founded two decades ago, Colorbar sells a variety of beauty products, including makeup essentials like lipsticks and foundations as well as skin care items such as serums and moisturizers. Also Read | Q4 results, FIIs, India-US trade deal, IPOs to guide markets this week Colorbar, which has more than 100 outlets and sells through over 1,200 multi-brand stores including Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle, also plans to open 15–20 stores this financial year. Modi also said Colorbar, which brings in the bulk of its revenue from India, expects up to a quarter of its revenue from exports in the next five years by expanding in the United States and the Middle East.

    "article_text": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s quarterly revenue grew a disappointing 7 percent, reflecting a persistent Chinese consumer malaise that may dog the online commerce leader’s big pivot toward AI. The company reported sales of 236.5 billion yuan ($32.8 billion) for the March quarter, versus an average estimate of 237.9 billion yuan. Net income almost quadrupled, though that was partly because of gains from equity investments. Its shares fell more than 6 percent in pre-market trading. Alibaba, a barometer of the Chinese consumer economy because of its sprawl, posted better-than-expected growth in domestic retail after Beijing issued a plethora of incentives to counter US tariffs. But the overall miss stood out after rivals Tencent Holdings Ltd. and JD.com Inc. both reported their fastest top-line expansions in years, stoking hopes of a Chinese tech sector revival after years of stagnation. Alibaba itself had been counting on a bounceback in its online commerce business to support an ambitious post-DeepSeek bet on artificial intelligence. ADVERTISEMENT Chief executive officer Eddie Wu and chairman Joseph Tsai — two of co-founder Jack Ma’s most trusted lieutenants — took the helm in 2023 and are orchestrating Alibaba’s comeback from years of government scrutiny. They’ve refocussed spending on building AI and e-commerce, while accelerating the unloading of non-core assets to bankroll AI investments and an international expansion. The company has pledged more than 380 billion yuan toward AI infrastructure such as data centres over the next three years. Wu declared in February the company’s primary objective is now attaining artificial general intelligence — putting it on par with the likes of OpenAI. Alibaba has been releasing AI products at a frenetic pace since DeepSeek’s emergence on the global stage this year. Alibaba said its Qwen 3 flagship model, unveiled just last month, rivals DeepSeek’s performance on several fronts. On Wednesday, the company updated its video-generating model for the second time in a month. But it’s facing intense competition from Chinese AI rivals including Baidu Inc. and Tencent. Globally, Tsai has warned of an AI bubble, cautioning that data centres are being built in the US without clear customers in mind. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says The continued uplift from narrower local services losses and jump in cloud earnings should have more than offset international digital commerce’s shortfalls for a second straight quarter. Profit from Taobao-Tmall group (TTG) probably also rose year-over-year as the firm’s push for higher gross merchandise value through the joint utilisation of tools within its ecosystem spurred higher customer management revenue. Yet cost hikes could have surpassed revenue gains to lower TTG’s 4Q adjusted Ebita margin from a year earlier. - Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts The e-commerce business is also facing growing competition from ByteDance Ltd. and PDD Holdings Inc. In an effort to fend off JD.com and PDD, Alibaba said last week it will partner with the Instagram-like Xiaohongshu for Taobao and Tmall merchants to embed product links on the popular influencer platform. Beyond China, Alibaba’s international commerce division grew revenue 22 percent — but that slowed from the previous quarter and also missed analysts’ projections. ADVERTISEMENT For now, Beijing is helping keep the industry afloat, with incentives to buy everything from appliances to smartphones and cars. In May, policymakers announced a slew of stimulus measures including monetary policy easing. By Claire Che and Luz Ding Learn more: Chinese E-Commerce Giants’ Discounting Spree Hits Consumer Brands Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com have faced increasing competition in recent years from low-cost platforms, such as PDD Holding’s Pinduoduo and ByteDance-owned Douyin."

PHOTO: AFP Published Thu, May 15, 2025 · 08:52 PM [WASHINGTON] US retail sales growth slowed in April as the boost from households front-loading motor vehicle purchases ahead of tariffs faded and households pulled back on other spending against the backdrop of an uncertain economic outlook. Retail sales edged up 0.1 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 1.7 per cent surge in March, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Thursday (May 15). Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, unchanged after a previously reported 1.5 per cent jump in March. Estimates ranged from a 0.6 per cent decline to a 0.4 per cent gain. Retail sales have see-sawed this year amid President Donald Trump’s chaotic tariffs policy. A 25 per cent global car and truck duty went into effect in April, unleashing a wave of pre-emptive buying by households eager to avoid higher motor vehicle prices. Levies on Chinese imports were hiked to 145 per cent and a 10 per cent blanket duty was imposed on almost all imports into the United States, also encouraging consumers to engage in tariff front-running and supporting sales in April. Though Washington and Beijing struck a 90-day truce in their trade war over the weekend, slashing tariffs on imports, uncertainty remained over what happens thereafter. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services fell 0.2 per cent in April after an upwardly revised 0.5 per cent gain in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales climbing 0.3 per cent after a previously reported 0.4 per cent advance in March. Consumer spending ended the January-March quarter on a strong note, putting consumption on a higher growth trajectory heading into the second quarter. SEE ALSO Eurozone GDP growth downgraded in first quarter but employment holding up UK economy grew more quickly than forecast in early 2025 Economists expect a modest rebound after the economy contracted at a 0.3 per cent rate pace last quarter amid a flood of imports, triggered by businesses trying to beat tariffs. While consumer spending remains supported by solid wage gains from a resilient labour market, households are pulling back on discretionary spending on services like airline tickets and hotel stays because of the economic uncertainty and the recent stock market selloff. Bank of America Institute viewed most households as being financially sound, with more consumers paying off their credit card balances every month, based on an analysis of the bank’s credit card data. But it noted that “we see some increase in the share of households making only the minimum payment on their credit cards, suggesting building pressures for some households.” REUTERS Decoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

    "article_text": "US reports lackluster retail sales as tariffs start to dampen demand Lucia Mutikani May 15, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales growth slowed sharply in April as the boost from households front-loading motor vehicle purchases ahead of tariffs faded and consumers pulled back on spending elsewhere against the backdrop of an uncertain economic outlook. The apprehension over the economy's prospects, sparked by President Donald Trump 's on-again, off-again tariffs policy, was underscored by retail giant Walmart, which on Thursday joined the list of companies, ranging from airlines to auto manufacturers, that have either withdrawn or refrained from giving financial guidance. Wholesale prices for services like airline tickets and hotel rooms fell last month, other data showed, also flagging softening demand, which does not bode well for an anticipated rebound in growth this quarter after the economy contracted in the January-March period for the first time in three years. Producer prices for goods excluding the volatile food and energy components increased by the most in more than two years while retail and wholesale margins declined, which economists warned could lead to reduced business spending and hiring. \"We are now witnessing the first-order effects of tariffs on the economy through reduced spending,\" said Tuan Nguyen, a U.S. economist at RSM US. \"While a recession is no longer our base case over the next 12 months due to the recent reduction in tariffs, the likelihood has increased that the U.S. economy will experience several quarters of sluggish growth.\" Retail sales edged up 0.1% last month after an upwardly revised 1.7% surge in March, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, would be unchanged after a previously reported 1.5% jump in March. Sales increased 5.2% on a year-over-year basis in April. Retail sales have see-sawed this year amid Trump's announcements of import duties. Though Washington and Beijing struck a 90-day truce in their trade war last weekend, slashing tariffs on imports, uncertainty remains over what happens thereafter. Sales at auto dealerships dipped 0.1% after accelerating by 5.5% in March. Receipts at sporting goods, hobby and musical instrument stores slumped 2.5%. Sales at miscellaneous store retailers tumbled 2.1%. Online retail store sales rose 0.2%. Receipts at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 1.2% after rebounding by 3.0% in March. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. An analysis of Bank of America credit card data suggested most households remained financially sound, thanks to a resilient labor market characterized by low layoffs. Story Continues Bank of America Institute, however, noted \"we see some increase in the share of households making only the minimum payment on their credit cards, suggesting building pressures for some households.\" Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields declined. WEAK UNDERLYING SALES Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services fell 0.2% after gaining 0.5% in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending ended the first quarter on a strong note, putting consumption on a higher growth trajectory heading into the second quarter. Nonetheless, the core retail sales drop in April posed a downside risk to economists' expectations for a rebound in economic growth this quarter. GDP contracted at a 0.3% annualized rate in the first quarter. A separate report from the Labor Department showed the Producer Price Index for final demand dropped 0.5% in April as the cost of services declined by the most since 2009, pulled down by ebbing demand for air travel and hotel accommodation. The PPI was unchanged in March. Economists had forecast that it would rise 0.2%. In the 12 months through April, the PPI increased 2.4% after climbing 3.4% in March. In addition to his protectionist trade policy, Trump has cracked down on immigration and repeatedly expressed his desire to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and acquire Greenland. Those actions have been followed by a sharp drop in tourism, with lower airline ticket sales and hotel and motel bookings. Wholesale services prices decreased 0.7%, the largest decline since the government started tracking the series in December 2009, after rising 0.4% in March. Prices for hotel and motel rooms dropped 3.1% after easing 0.5% in March. Portfolio management fees plunged 6.9%, while airline fares fell 1.5%. Core goods prices rose 0.4%, the largest gain since January 2023, indicating goods producers were passing on the tariffs. But margins received by wholesalers and retailers fell 1.6%. \"While a decline in margins might be positive for the near-term pass-through of tariffs into inflation, it is not positive for the overall economic outlook,\" said Michael Hanson, an economist at J.P. Morgan. \"A reduction in margins will weigh on business spending on capital investments and possibly hiring.\" Based on the PPI data and tame consumer price readings in April, economists estimated the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in March. The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% target. It was forecast to have increased 2.5% on a year-over-year basis in April after rising 2.6% in March. But with retailers like Walmart and automakers including Ford Motor raising prices in response to tariffs, any moderation in inflation is likely to be temporary. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned on Thursday that \"we may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks - a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.\" Economists expected the U.S. central bank would resume cutting interest rates either in September or December. The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.24%-4.50% range earlier this month. \"The slowdown in inflation in April provides little comfort as the impact from tariffs is yet to come,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"Despite the de-escalation with China, the trade story isn't over, and it's still going to take time for tariffs to make themselves felt in economic data.\" (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Nick Zieminski and Paul Simao) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

    "article_text": "Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching for signs of consumers pulling back in the face of high uncertainty. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images CNN — In a sign that consumer demand may be fraying around the edges, spending at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March as shoppers rushed to beat President Donald Trump’s stiff tariffs. The April data was worse than the 0.2% monthly rise economists polled by FactSet predicted. Among the biggest monthly declines was motor vehicle and part sales, which declined to -0.1% in April from 5.5% in March. Consumer spending is the backbone of the economy, accounting for two-thirds of gross domestic product. The steep drop in retail sales could lead to another quarter of disappointing GDP after the contraction seen last quarter. Simply put, EY economists said in a Thursday morning note, the “pre-tariff shopping spree is over.” The Trump administration’s haphazard tariff blitz in recent months has prompted consumer sentiment to deteriorate, according to various surveys. Now, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching for signs of consumers pulling back in the face of high uncertainty. Customers enter a Walmart store on April 9, 2025, in San Leandro, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Related article Walmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs Thursday’s report shows that consumer spending has clearly downshifted from the brisk pace of late last year, and that Americans’ buying sprints to get ahead of tariffs may already be over. “Whatever strength we saw in the economy in the first quarter, I think it’s a bit of a mirage,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. “Sales were brought forward to try and avoid higher prices that are surely just around the corner from this trade war with the world.” The biggest bright spot of the report was spending at bars and restaurants, which increased by 1.2% from March. Spending at grocery stores was unchanged from March. That’s potentially a positive sign for the US economy, Jefferies economists said in a note on Thursday. “Spending less at restaurants and more on groceries would be a logical expression of weaker consumer confidence and greater concern over employment prospects. Currently, we are seeing the opposite, in contrast to the confidence data.” At the same time, spending on health and personal care as well as apparel and sporting goods all declined in April. Despite the steep drop in spending across the board from March, Morgan Stanley economists said in a note to clients on Thursday, “This report does not change our view that the consumer is at a solid starting point, but we expect a slowdown.” At the same time, they noted that the weakness in spending came sooner than they anticipated and they “continue to expect a significant slowdown in consumption in the back half of the year as price increases from tariffs weigh on purchasing power.” CNN’s Alicia Wallace contributed reporting."

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) gained more than 0.6%, or about 250 points. The Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell 0.2%, breaking a six-day win streak for the tech-heavy index. Markets are on watch for the next catalyst now that US-China trade-truce euphoria has faded. On Thursday, in the latest development, President Trump said India has offered to \"literally charge us no tariffs\" on US goods to help clinch a trade deal. But corporate statements and economic data continued painting a slightly different reality: In its quarterly results, Walmart said its prices will rise as it can't avoid passing on the high costs of tariffs to customers. Walmart shares fell less than 1% on the day. Read more: The latest on Trump's tariffs Meanwhile, retail sales slowed sharply in April, barely rising in a sharp reversal from American consumers' pre-tariff spending burst in March. But wholesale inflation unexpectedly slowed last month, even as many of Trump's tariffs began coming into effect. The Producer Price Index fell 0.5% in April and rose at a 2.4% annual clip. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) update this week showed inflation pressures easing to four-year lows. Federal Reserve policymakers have stressed that they are watching for incoming data to provide a clearer picture of the state of the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday again warned of broad economic \"uncertainty,\" saying the US economy may be entering a period with more frequent \"supply shocks\" and volatile inflation. Meanwhile, oil tumbled after Trump said the US is \"close to maybe doing a deal\" with Iran over its nuclear program.

Instead, a defensive slant helped the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) finish in the green. Utilities and Consumer Staples led the sector action within the benchmark index, both rising over 2%. On a single stock basis, Dollar General ( DG ) popped more than 6%, while Deere & Company ( DE ) stock rose almost 4%.

The Journal reported that \"Company engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its 'Behemoth' large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.\" Thu, May 15, 2025 at 7:30 PM UTC Laura Bratton Amazon stock sinks after latest job cuts, leads Mag 7 lower Amazon ( AMZN ) stock sank as much as 3.6% following news Wednesday that the tech giant cut jobs in its devices and services division. Shares pared losses later in the trading session and were down 2.4% Thursday afternoon. Amazon cut 100 jobs in the division, which includes its Alexa voice assistant, according to Reuters . The company has laid off 27,000 employees since the start of 2022 , according to CNBC. Shares of Amazon are down more than 6% in 2025 as Trump's back-and-forth trade policies and greater scrutiny of Big Tech's AI spending have put pressure on the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Amazon shares had led its tech peers higher Monday after the US and China announced a temporary trade truce. The stock surged another 1.3% on Tuesday as Amazon unveiled a $5 billion deal with Saudi Arabia's AI venture Humain to expand Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the country. Other Magnificent Seven stocks also fell Thursday after gains earlier in the week. Tesla ( TSLA ) stock fell 1.6% on Thursday afternoon, while Google ( GOOG ) and Meta ( META ) fell around 1%. Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Apple ( AAPL ) dropped fractionally. Thu, May 15, 2025 at 6:45 PM UTC Josh Schafer Most manufacturers say price increases are coming Thursday brought another cooler-than-expected reading of inflation. Both the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed prices increased less than expected in April. But while the data isn't showing yet, surveys continue to flash warning signs that price hikes are coming. In the Institute for Supply Management's latest forecast 87% of manufacturers said they plan to pass at least some of the price increases they're expecting to buyers. This report came just hours after Walmart ( WMT ) CFO John David Rainey told our Brian Sozzi that the department will be increasing prices on some products by double digits. It's unclear when all of this could filter into higher national inflation readings. But Rainey told Yahoo Finance that those Walmart price hikes will be hitting consumer wallets later this month.

Thu, May 15, 2025 at 4:00 PM UTC Ines Ferré Despite deals, US tariffs still 'significantly higher' than at start of year, Wall Street warns Investors cheered President Trump's tariff reductions and deals with trading partners China and the UK, but Wall Street points out that the tariff rates are still relatively high. \"The US effective tariff rate remains significantly higher than it was at the start of the year,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a client note on Thursday. Marcelli pointed out the US effective tariff rate — at around 15% — is now six times higher than the 2.5% rate that prevailed in January before President Trump returned to the White House. That assumes that the rolled-back tariffs during the 90-day pause announced last month can be maintained beyond the deadline. \"As the Trump administration has indicated that the 10% baseline tariff is unlikely to be negotiated lower, these higher tariffs could slow the US economy and push up prices,\" Marcelli warned. This morning's commentary from retail giant Walmart ( WMT ) CEO Doug McMillon highlights this risk. \"We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible, but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,\" McMillon said in the company's earnings release. He added on the earnings call that tariffs have already led to price increases in April and May. The tariff impact could seep back into the stock market. \"While we continue to expect a range of trade agreements to be reached to sustain the tariff rate at roughly the level during the pause period, ongoing uncertainty could trigger further bouts of market volatility,\" Marcelli said. Thu, May 15, 2025 at 3:24 PM UTC Ines Ferré Deere stock hits all-time high after better-than-expected profit Shares of Deere & Company ( DE ) jumped 5% on Thursday, hitting all-time highs after the tractor and lawn mower maker topped earnings expectations, despite a profit decline of 22% compared to the same period last year. Investors breathed a sigh of relief as the results came in better than feared. Wall Street has been pointing to signs that the agriculture sector has bottomed after trending lower over the past two years. Deere cut its net income outlook for the year, citing a \"dynamic environment\" and \"heightened uncertainty.\" As of Thursday, the stock was up roughly 23% year to date.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the health insurer is facing a DOJ criminal investigation over possible Medicare fraud — a report that UnitedHealth called \"deeply irresponsible\". Foot Locker ( FL ): The footwear chain's stock rocketed up over 80% on news of a $2.4 billion buyout by Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS ). Shares in Dick's sank 15% as worries about tariff risks to retailers still in play. Walmart ( WMT ): Shares in America's biggest retailer reversed a premarket gain to trade 3% lower early on Thursday as investors digested its first quarter results. A beat on sales was overshadowed by Walmart's warning that it will have to pass the high costs of tariffs on to customers in the form of price rises. Alibaba ( BABA ): In another sign of retail sector pressure, Alibaba's US-listed stock dropped over 8% after its quarterly revenue missed estimates . The Chinese e-commerce leader faces a price war at home even as it grapples with tariff uncertainty. Thu, May 15, 2025 at 2:23 PM UTC Ines Ferré Oil tumbles as Trump hints US-Iran nuclear deal is close Oil prices slid as much as 3% on Thursday after President Trump indicated the US was getting close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, a move which would boost oil supply. West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ) futures dropped to hover just above $61 per barrel. Brent crude ( BZ=F ), the international benchmark, also tumbled to trade near $64. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump said in Doha, Qatar, during his Middle East visit on Thursday. “But we’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace. And if we do that, it’ll be fantastic.” Iran, a key player of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), produces more than 3 million barrels of oil per day. Thu, May 15, 2025 at 1:34 PM UTC Ines Ferré S&P 500 on pace to snap 3-day rally Stocks fell on Thursday as investors assessed retail sales data and commentary from consumer-facing giant Walmart ( WMT ). The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dropped roughly 0.4%, on pace to snap a three-day win streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) slid 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) dropped about 0.6%. Energy-related stocks were the biggest decliners after President Trump hinted that a nuclear deal with oil producer Iran was near, which would likely boost the supply of crude. Retailer Walmart reported mixed earnings and said it would hike prices to navigate President Trump's tariffs . Meanwhile, retail sales slowed in April as Trump's tariffs weighed on US consumers.

Headline retail sales rose 0.1% in April, slightly above economists expectations for sales to be flat month-on-month, and well below the 1.7% increase seen in March, according to Census Bureau data . The control group in Thursday's release, which excludes several volatile categories and factors into the gross domestic product (GDP) reading for the quarter, fell 0.2%; control group sales had risen 0.5% in March. Economists expected a 0.3% increase. March sales excluding auto and gas rose 0.2%, below consensus estimates for a 0.3% increase and a move lower from the 1.1% increase seen the month prior.

America's largest retailer has been seen as well-positioned to weather tariffs, as around 60% of its sales are in groceries, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reported. Its size also means it has leverage to negotiate with suppliers to keep prices low. However, Walmart announced it would raise some of its prices due to tariffs. \"We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in the release. \"But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\" Walmart's US same-store sales beat expectations with a 4.5% increase in the first quarter, led by strength in health and wellness and groceries.

    "article_text": "By Contributing Writer | PUBLISHED: May 14, 2025 at 7:00 AM PDT By Manfred Keil and Mark Schniepp | Inland Empire Economic Partnership A host of important economic statistics recently became available to give us insights into the current state of the U.S. economy. There was negative (annualized) quarterly growth of real GDP, with output shrinking by 0.3%. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2% but job numbers showed a better than expected increase of 177,000. Finally the yearly inflation rate fell slightly toward the Fed’s target judging by both the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure and the headline-making consumer price index (2.3% and 2.4% respectively). This does not yield a clear answer of where we are heading. Certainly these statistics alone do not justify forecasts of a downturn later in the year. It is the uncertainty that has raised the prospect of recession in 2025. The so-called soft-landing (reduction in inflation without causing a recession) is still a possibility, and the dreaded stagflation scenario (stagnating output coinciding with inflation) has not materialized, yet. Some have pointed to the fact that the negative growth in GDP was related to households and firms hoarding imported goods to beat tariff-related price increases. Imports rose by over 41% (annualized) from the last quarter, which is of an order of magnitude only seen twice over the half century. Unfortunately, this is wrong, since GDP only measures domestic production or aggregate demand for domestic goods (the imported consumption and investment goods are subtracted out by national income accountants resulting in a net effect of zero). GDP is neutral to imports, unless there are measurement errors. Two quarters of negative GDP growth are commonly perceived as the start of a recession. This suggests that if we observe negative real GDP growth in 2025 Q2, then the recession started in the current quarter. This definition of a recession is false. Instead, it is the dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, that determines the start and end of recessions, and it does so by month. The Great Recession of December 2007 to July 2009 would not have been labeled such if you went by the “two quarter” definition: there was positive economic growth during the second quarter of 2008. Unfortunately, the NBER typically publishes the start of a recession with a considerable delay: it took the committee 12 months (December 2008), to date the peak of the previous economic expansion. This does not make it useful to pursue alternative policies or to prepare for a downturn. One of the earliest signs that we are in a recession will come from the so-called Sahm measure. The statistic, named after former Federal Reserve Principle Economist Claudia Sahm, compares the most recent three-month average unemployment rate with the minimum three-month average over the previous year. If the difference is greater than 0.5, then a recession has started. There are almost no false positives using the Sahm measure for the post World War II period. The statistic currently sits at close to 0.3 and would require monthly unemployment rate increases of 0.1 percentage points until September 2025 to reach the threshold. Relatively large monthly increases of 0.2 percentage points would be needed to move the starting point of a recession to July 2025. The bottom line: We are currently not in a recession and even another quarter of negative growth is unlikely to generate one. There are other “sensors” that, similar to a volcano outbreak, predict disaster. The Conference Board summarizes these in a so-called Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The series is a weighted average of such variables as the stock market, housing starts, consumer sentiment index, new orders, etc., and, as a rule of thumb, rings alarm bells of a subsequent recession if it turns south three months in a row. This statistic has remained above the “recession threshold.” Finally, 45% of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal have forecasted a recession within a year. However, this same bunch felt that a downturn was imminent (63% at the time). This became known as the “Godot Recession:” in Samuel Becket’s play “Waiting for Godot,” the messenger repeatedly arrives to announce that Mr. Godot could not make it today but surely would come tomorrow. Consumers are clearly on edge as consumer confidence and sentiment have fallen to recession territory levels. Given current fundamentals, it is difficult to forecast a reversal in confidence. However, movements in consumer sentiment, even large ones like those seen recently, do not necessarily generate similar moves in real consumer spending. If there were such a correlation, we would undoubtedly be in a recession by now. The case for a recession in 2025 stems from ongoing uncertainty, which is delaying domestic investment decisions (and therefore domestic business spending), and less government spending by the administration to directly address corruption, fraud, and waste. However, domestic consumption — the largest component of GDP and the main driver of growth — is less likely to weaken. This is because consumer spending remained resilient in the first quarter and a near fully employed labor market continues to support household incomes, enabling consumer spending through the year. The resilience of consumer spending, amid contractions in domestic investment because of prolonged uncertainty and government spending from overdue government downsizing, could result in more quarters of negative GDP growth this year, potentially prompting the NBER to declare a recession. But since consumer spending remains stable, the most likely scenario based on the current evidence is a recession that would be shallow and brief, with its duration limited by the eventual resolution of uncertainty. More likely, the Trump administration’s economic policies will diminish the U.S. economy, but not derail it. We also feel the president will pivot on his policies when it becomes clear that without a course correction, stock prices will decline further, consumers would become so fearful they stop spending, and the economy would suffer a bona fide downturn.

This does not yield a clear answer of where we are heading. Certainly these statistics alone do not justify forecasts of a downturn later in the year. It is the uncertainty that has raised the prospect of recession in 2025. The so-called soft-landing (reduction in inflation without causing a recession) is still a possibility, and the dreaded stagflation scenario (stagnating output coinciding with inflation) has not materialized, yet. Some have pointed to the fact that the negative growth in GDP was related to households and firms hoarding imported goods to beat tariff-related price increases. Imports rose by over 41% (annualized) from the last quarter, which is of an order of magnitude only seen twice over the half century. Unfortunately, this is wrong, since GDP only measures domestic production or aggregate demand for domestic goods (the imported consumption and investment goods are subtracted out by national income accountants resulting in a net effect of zero). GDP is neutral to imports, unless there are measurement errors. Two quarters of negative GDP growth are commonly perceived as the start of a recession. This suggests that if we observe negative real GDP growth in 2025 Q2, then the recession started in the current quarter. This definition of a recession is false. Instead, it is the dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, that determines the start and end of recessions, and it does so by month. The Great Recession of December 2007 to July 2009 would not have been labeled such if you went by the “two quarter” definition: there was positive economic growth during the second quarter of 2008. Unfortunately, the NBER typically publishes the start of a recession with a considerable delay: it took the committee 12 months (December 2008), to date the peak of the previous economic expansion. This does not make it useful to pursue alternative policies or to prepare for a downturn. One of the earliest signs that we are in a recession will come from the so-called Sahm measure. The statistic, named after former Federal Reserve Principle Economist Claudia Sahm, compares the most recent three-month average unemployment rate with the minimum three-month average over the previous year. If the difference is greater than 0.5, then a recession has started. There are almost no false positives using the Sahm measure for the post World War II period. The statistic currently sits at close to 0.3 and would require monthly unemployment rate increases of 0.1 percentage points until September 2025 to reach the threshold. Relatively large monthly increases of 0.2 percentage points would be needed to move the starting point of a recession to July 2025. The bottom line: We are currently not in a recession and even another quarter of negative growth is unlikely to generate one. There are other “sensors” that, similar to a volcano outbreak, predict disaster. The Conference Board summarizes these in a so-called Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The series is a weighted average of such variables as the stock market, housing starts, consumer sentiment index, new orders, etc., and, as a rule of thumb, rings alarm bells of a subsequent recession if it turns south three months in a row. This statistic has remained above the “recession threshold.” Finally, 45% of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal have forecasted a recession within a year. However, this same bunch felt that a downturn was imminent (63% at the time). This became known as the “Godot Recession:” in Samuel Becket’s play “Waiting for Godot,” the messenger repeatedly arrives to announce that Mr. Godot could not make it today but surely would come tomorrow. Consumers are clearly on edge as consumer confidence and sentiment have fallen to recession territory levels. Given current fundamentals, it is difficult to forecast a reversal in confidence. However, movements in consumer sentiment, even large ones like those seen recently, do not necessarily generate similar moves in real consumer spending. If there were such a correlation, we would undoubtedly be in a recession by now. The case for a recession in 2025 stems from ongoing uncertainty, which is delaying domestic investment decisions (and therefore domestic business spending), and less government spending by the administration to directly address corruption, fraud, and waste. However, domestic consumption — the largest component of GDP and the main driver of growth — is less likely to weaken. This is because consumer spending remained resilient in the first quarter and a near fully employed labor market continues to support household incomes, enabling consumer spending through the year. The resilience of consumer spending, amid contractions in domestic investment because of prolonged uncertainty and government spending from overdue government downsizing, could result in more quarters of negative GDP growth this year, potentially prompting the NBER to declare a recession. But since consumer spending remains stable, the most likely scenario based on the current evidence is a recession that would be shallow and brief, with its duration limited by the eventual resolution of uncertainty. More likely, the Trump administration’s economic policies will diminish the U.S. economy, but not derail it. We also feel the president will pivot on his policies when it becomes clear that without a course correction, stock prices will decline further, consumers would become so fearful they stop spending, and the economy would suffer a bona fide downturn.

Kalyan Parbat ET Bureau Updated On May 14, 2025 at 07:33 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Kolkata: Consumer spending on mobile services in India rose sequentially in the third quarter of FY25, on the back of the July 2024 headline rate hikes, which was reflected in higher revenues for telcos from the prepaid/postpaid services businesses, an assessment of latest data collated by the telecom regulator showed. User spending on mobile services (post-GST) increased 5.5% sequentially to about ₹65,080 crore in Q3FY25 as per latest sector performance data issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ). Consumer spends data issued by the regulator showed that net telecom sector revenue growth in the third quarter was almost 19% higher at ₹62,800 crore as inter-company settlements between telcos was around 7% lower, year-on-year. Inter-company settlements, typically, include payments towards roaming charges and international interconnect usage charges (global IUC) that are settled among operators, partner global carriers. An inter-company settlement is the difference between gross revenue (GR) and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) from mobile services. Advt \"In Q3FY25, consumer spends on mobile services (post-GST) rose 5.5% QoQ/17.8% YoY, aided by tariff hikes. The average revenue per user (ARPU), based on consumer spends, was up 6.4% QoQ/18%YoY at ₹188 from the tariff hikes,\" ICICI Securities said, analysing Trai data. The brokerage added that higher consumer spends on mobile services boosted telcos' prepaid and postpaid net revenues by 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively, in the third quarter. Overall consumer spending on data services in Q3FY25 rose 4.2% sequentially to ₹56,067.3 crore, driven by rising 5G data consumption. But overall growth in data spends was well below the 10% on-quarter growth reported in Q2FY25. This, analysts, said was caused primarily by the fall in 4G and 2G data usage. Reduced consumer spending on mobile broadband services in Q3FY25 translated in Jio's combined 4G/5G data subscribers market share remaining virtually unchanged at 52.5% while Airtel 's rose marginally to 30.5%. Vodafone Idea (Vi), which had not launched 5G services in the fiscal third quarter, reported stagnant 4G data subscribers market share at 14.2%. Trai data, though, indicated that the rise in Jio and Airtel 's customer upgrades to 5G services continued in the third quarter. For instance, the 5G segment contributed 26.5% of total data usage in Q3FY25 (versus 22.7% in Q2FY25). By contrast, the contribution of 4G services fell to 73% (from almost 77% in Q2FY25). The 2G and 3G user segments, in turn, continued to account for a paltry 0.1% and 0.4% of overall data usage levels, respectively, in Q3FY25.

    "article_text": "While Dutch Bros ( BROS 1.18% ) has rallied off its 2025 lows, the stock is still well off its highs for the year, since there continues to be some worry about the state of the consumer economy. However, the drive-thru coffee chain's recent quarterly earnings report showed why a potential slowdown shouldn't scare investors away from the stock. My prediction is that the company's long-term prospects will outweigh any near-term slowdown in consumer spending. The long-term story is intact There have been clear signs that the consumer has been under some pressure, especially in the restaurant space. This could be seen at various points of the income spectrum in the first quarter, with McDonald's and the higher-end Chipotle both seeing their quarterly sales decline as they called out the state of the economy. However, Dutch Bros was able to overcome weakness among consumers in the first quarter, growing its same-store sales (comps) by 4.7%, with transactions increasing 1.3%. Company-owned stores performed even better, with comps jumping 6.9% with a 3.7% rise in transactions. Comps are one of the most important metrics in the restaurant space because they show how existing locations are performing. A big part of the reason for Dutch Bros' strong comps growth in a difficult macroenvironment is that it is still in the early days of mobile ordering. The company said this accounted for about 11% of its transactions in its quarter, up from 8% in the fourth quarter. This is also helping feed into its loyalty program, which made up 72% of system transactions in the quarter. This, in turn, is letting the company introduce new products and send personalized advertising to its rewards members. And even in this weaker macroenvironment, the company has another big potential initiative that could drive comps: food. Management is currently testing a pilot program to add more food items to its menu at a few select locations. Thus far, the pilot has been a success, and the company is expanding it from eight stores to 32. It plans to offer eight food items in total, with four hot items. The company believes this will help drive sales and guest frequency in the morning. It expects a broader rollout in 2026. The strong comps helped lead to a 29.1% surge in revenue to $355.2 million, while the company continues to add new shops. And it is Dutch Bros' expansion opportunity that is one of the biggest reasons to be excited about the stock. In the quarter, it opened 30 new shops in 11 states, with 25 of the added shops company-owned. It expects to maintain this pace in the second quarter and then accelerate it in the second half of the year. At quarter end, its total shop count was 1,012, of which 695 were company owned. Overall, it is looking to open at least 160 more shops this year, representing 16% growth. Its goal is to expand its base to 2,029 locations by 2029, and management believes its total addressable market is 7,000 shops. It said it has a robust long-term real estate development pipeline that, along with strong new-store economics, should support multiple years of new locations in the mid-teens annual percentages. The company says that the productivity of its new shops continues to improve, which it attributed to its choice of locations and advertising initiatives to drive brand awareness. It said systemwide annual unit volumes (AUV) are now $2 million per store. Looking at some other important metrics, gross margins in company-owned stores were flat at 21.9%. With tariffs putting pressure on coffee prices, the company has locked in its prices for the rest of the year. It said that with tariffs, this will pressure gross margins by 110 basis points on the year. Gross margins are important because they impact profitability. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) climbed 20% year over year to $62.9 million, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 56% from $0.09 to $0.14. Looking ahead, the company maintained its guidance for the full year. It expects around 22% revenue growth for the year, with revenue of between $1.555 billion and $1.575 billion. The forecast for comps growth is in a range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $265 million and $275 million. Image source: Getty Images A long-term winner Even with the consumer feeling pressure, Dutch Bros finds itself in a great spot over the long term. The company should continue to see solid comps growth in the coming years from increased mobile ordering and its introduction of food items, which now represent only 2% of its sales, compared to 19% last quarter for rival Starbucks . As such, food should be a sales driver in the coming years. Between its menu expansions and that total addressable market of 7,000 shops, this is a stock to own for the long term."

Speaking at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Al-Jadaan said private investment as a percentage of gross domestic product could take decades, but Saudi Arabia was boasting growth in the private sector from 16 to 23 percent. He added: “Saudi Arabia currently has the lowest unemployment rate in the country’s history with about 3.5 percent, and among the nationals the Kingdom achieved its target for Vision 2030 with the rate being 7 percent.” Al-Jadaan also said there had been major structural changes regarding women’s empowerment. He said: “Bringing half of your society to the productive part of the economy is significant and that drives a serious change. Moving from 17 percent of women participating in the workforce to 36 percent is a serious structural change.” Meanwhile, the minister said the Kingdom’s target of 100 million tourists by 2030 had been achieved two years ago, and added: “When you have a leadership that sets a clear vision and mobilizes the nation behind it, the people of Saudi Arabia then own it and see that this is their vision, their country and their transformation.” US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said the US prioritized its relationship with Saudi Arabia. He added: “President Trump’s economic agenda focuses on three parts: trade, tax bills and deregulation.” Bessent said the US was working to rebalance its economy with the focus on manufacturing, and hoped China would shift to a consumer economy. Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Investment Khalid Al-Falih welcomed attendees at the event and thanked the Kingdom’s leadership for hosting the event. “We are here to realize the intentions of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to broaden Saudi Arabia’s investment and trade in the amount of $600 billion,” he said.

The environmental picture is bigger than that. Plastics are just the tip of the iceberg of the American (and developed world) consumer-driven economy that is driving the human-induced portion of climate dynamics. But we keep on buying more stuff than we need, often shipping it halfway across the globe. Bigger homes, low-density development requiring cars and our religious conversion to the sacred big-box store all drive emissions, as well as the production of natural resources needed for more and more stuff. As far as energy, barring massive reductions in worldwide energy needs that are extremely unlikely (short of a worldwide depression or worse), we need more than renewables and conservation. MIT’s world-class climatologist Kerry Emanuel, along with colleagues James Hansen (Columbia), Ken Caldiera (Stanford) and Tom Wigley (Adelaide), have written that nuclear power is an indispensable component of any plan to rapidly wean humanity, most importantly the developing world, off of fossil energy. To many environmental organizations, nuclear energy is the third rail of discussion for political reasons and this limits their credibility in finding workable solutions. As far as nuclear safety, as Emanuel said in an interview with the Pulitzer Center discussing the four scientists’ position, “When the four of us give talks, we often cite statistics that show that, over the lifetime of nuclear power in the world, in terms of mortality per kilowatt-hour, existing nuclear is far and away the safest energy source we’ve ever had.” If we really care about Mother Earth, not to mention our own species’ long-term survival, it is time we all considered not only how we will power our lives without wreaking havoc on our environment, but how much power and natural resources we really need to live comfortably, but not excessively dependent on more and bigger stuff, whether it is plastics or something else. With 8 billion humans and counting, we need to think outside the comfort zone on how to live within our planet’s means.

    "article_text": "Stock Market Rebounds, but Sector Performance Says Risk Appetite Is Still Missing By James Picerno ETFs Published 05/09/2025, 12:19 PM Stock Market Rebounds, but Sector Performance Says Risk Appetite Is Still Missing View all comments (0) 0 James Picerno Articles ( 4141 ) | My Homepage Follow SPY 0.23% XLY 0.25% XLP 1.31% XLU 0.06% President Trump announced a US-UK trade deal yesterday, which may be an early sign of a thaw in the global trade war. Talks between China and the US scheduled for this weekend could bring more good news. However, with tariffs still in place, sentiment in the US equity market remains cautious, based on a review of equity sectors via a set of ETFs through yesterday’s close (May 8). Although the broad US stock market has rebounded sharply in recent weeks, the recovery has yet to reverse a wide lead for defensive equities. Utilities ( XLU ) are the top sector performer year to date, posting a 6.6% increase. American shares overall ( SPY ) are still down so far this year, shedding 3.3%. That’s dramatically better than the 15% loss in early April, but there’s still a long way to go for the market to regain its world-beating momentum that was on display as recently as January. It’s telling that the worst-performing sector this year is consumer discretionary stocks ( XLY ), which are down 10%. By contrast, consumer staples ( XLP ) are up 4.1% so far in 2025. A key reason for the gap: expectations that consumer spending will take a hit, or at least be redirected away from non-essential purchases as tariffs lift prices in the months ahead. A new survey by the Federal Reserve finds that companies are planning to pass cost increases from tariffs on to consumers. “The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,” predicts Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok. Meanwhile, recent consumer survey data points to elevated anxiety about higher prices, which implies that headwinds for consumer spending may be brewing. “Having both firms and consumers saying prices are going to go up is not a good combination for the Fed,” said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG. “It’s yet another thing keeping them from doing anything with interest rates until they get more clarity on what the actual impacts are.” Anticipating higher prices, consumers appear to be frontrunning purchases to avoid tariff-related hikes. A survey published this week from the National Retail Federation shows that retail sales grew in April. “Spending rose again in April, driven largely by consumers continuing to pull purchases forward to stay ahead of tariffs that will inevitably lead to higher prices,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. “Despite declines in confidence caused by the economic uncertainty that has come with tariffs, consumer fundamentals remain intact, supported by low unemployment, slower-but-steady income growth and solid household finances. Consumers maintain their ability to spend and have strong reasons to spend now before tariffs can drive up prices or cause shortages on store shelves.” To be fair, there’s a lot of uncertainty about how tariffs will affect the economy, including consumer spending. These are still early days and so debate rages about how events will evolve in the months ahead. What is clear is that the stock market is still pricing in higher risk for consumer discretionary stocks (XLY) while redirecting investment flows into consumer staples and other defensive equity sectors. Animal spirits may be laying the groundwork for a comeback, but it’ll take stronger news than yesterday’s US-UK trade deal to persuade the crowd that tariff risk is fading in a big way. Perhaps this weekend’s US-China talks will help move the needle.

    "article_text": "Market recession indicators: dissecting the signal from the noise Illustration shows U.S. dollar banknote · Reuters Dhara Ranasinghe and Stefano Rebaudo May 8, 2025 5 min read By Dhara Ranasinghe and Stefano Rebaudo LONDON (Reuters) - Global recession risks have shot back up markets' worry list, but the readout from economic data and key financial indicators is not as clear cut as it first appears. A 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump in April has eased investors' worst fears, but the damage to business and consumer confidence is expected to hurt. \"Recession risks have risen markedly even if there are some deals struck on tariffs,\" said Guy Miller, chief markets strategist at Zurich Insurance Group. \"The risk of a U.S. recession is 50-50, it's that close.\" Here's a look at what some closely-watched indicators say about global recession risks. 1/ HARD VS SOFT A disconnect between so-called soft economic numbers such as sentiment indicators and hard data, for instance jobs figures, makes it hard to decipher recession risks. Latest U.S. jobs numbers point to a resilient economy, while a first quarter economic contraction in the United States and an expansion in the euro zone have both been explained away by pre-positioning by companies ahead of the reciprocal tariffs. Business and consumer confidence indicators meanwhile have deteriorated, a sign for some that weaker growth will materialise soon. U.S. consumer confidence slumped to a nearly five-year low in April. Consumer spending is key because it accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. A euro zone investor morale index has rebounded after nose-diving in April but remains in negative territory. \"We assume that any contraction in the euro area would be short lived and relatively mild,\" said MUFG senior economist Henry Cook. Zurich's Miller said he was watching initial weekly jobless claims as the most timely indicator of what's happening in the U.S. economy. 2/ CHANGE YOUR MIND There's no getting away from slashed growth forecasts. Economists polled by Reuters indicate high risks of a recession this year, having forecast strong growth just three months ago. Barclays reckons the picture is one of a meaningful global slowdown, combined with mild U.S. and euro area recessions. Yet a recession is not a done deal, economists say. If the U.S. can arrange trade deals soon or deliver on tax cuts, the risks would fall, while the euro zone economy will likely be buffered by lower rates and fiscal stimulus. \"A recovery of consumer spending due to higher wages and a more dovish than expected central bank, at least in the euro area, are the main factors helping to avoid a deep recession,\" said BofA economist Ruben Segura-Cayuela. Story Continues 3/ WHERE'S THE DEMAND?The signal from commodity markets points to a sharp growth slowdown. Oil prices are down around 16% so far this year to around $60 a barrel. If that's sustained, 2025 would mark the worst year for crude since 2020's COVID crisis. For sure, they also reflect expectations for more supply from OPEC, but the price falls fit into the broader picture of weaker demand as global growth slows, analysts say. Copper, dubbed \"Dr Copper\" for its track record as a boom-bust indicator, has recovered from roughly one-year lows hit in early April but remains below a March peak. Citi is bearish over the next three to six months as physical copper consumption and manufacturing activity slow due to U.S. tariffs, especially the 145% levy on manufacturing hub China. 4/ TRUST MR BOND? Government bond markets reflect concern about a U.S. tariff-induced slowdown, but no heightened recession risk, as markets assume central banks will respond swiftly with rate cuts. China on Wednesday cut rates to help soften the blow of a trade war and traders have increased European Central Bank rate cut bets since March. They anticipate 60 basis points of further ECB easing by December. Traders expect roughly 80 bps of U.S. Federal Reserve cuts by December and 115 bps by mid-2026, after paring back more aggressive expectations since the tariff pause. The Fed on Wednesday left rates steady and said the risks of higher inflation and unemployment had risen. \"In recent years they (Fed funds futures) have consistently overestimated how dovish the Fed would be,\" said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Henry Allen. Also watch yield curves, although their reliance as a recession indicator has been called into question recently. The gap between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields has been positive since last year. While yield curve inversion has historically been seen as a recession predictor, the curve tends to revert back to normal as recession nears. \"In recent cycles, the recession didn’t begin when curves were inverted, but when they un-inverted as central banks rapidly cut rates leading short-dated yields to fall more quickly than the long-dated ones,\" said Allen. 5/ STOCKS, TOO UPBEAT A rebound in stocks suggests recession fears have faded. German shares are near record highs, New York and Tokyo have jumped more than 15% each from lows hit last month. But pay attention to company earnings. Sweden's Electrolux slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo abandoned their targets due to uncertainty. General Motors pulled its forecast for the year even as it reported strong results. \"Q1 was perhaps the last of the unaffected earnings quarters, with tariffs a factor from Q2 onwards,\" said Zurich's Miller. \"Given the uncertainty, I would have thought valuations should reflect at least some of this. So far, they do not.\" (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe in London and Stefano Rebaudo in Milan; Editing by Yoruk Bahceli, Kirsten Donovan and Chizu Nomiyama) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

Δ The latest edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations , released Thursday (May 8), showed that households had lowered their expectations for both wage growth and finding employment. “Households also expect lower income growth over the next year, and their perceptions about both their current financial situation and their outlook for their financial situation one year from now deteriorated sharply,” the bank said in a news release . The survey was fielded during April, the same month that the White House imposed sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, leading to downturns in consumer spending. According to the survey, Americans’ median inflation expectations remained unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon at 3.6% and rose by 0.2 percentage point at the three-year-ahead horizon to 3.2%, the highest reading since July 2022. By contrast, median inflation expectations fell by 0.2 percentage point at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.7%. Median inflation uncertainty — the uncertainty about future inflation outcomes — climbed at the one, three and five-year marks. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Meanwhile, the median expected growth in household income dropped to 2.6%, a 0.2 percentage point dip, and the lowest reading in four years. However, consumer perceptions about credit access improved compared to a year ago, with the net share of households who say it is easier to get credit increasing. The findings come weeks after The Conference Board released its Consumer Confidence Index survey, showing consumer confidence falling for the fifth consecutive month in April, with consumers expressing rising concerns about tariffs’ effects on prices and the economy. The board noted that mentions of tariffs in consumers’ write-in responses were at a record high. Additional research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “ Navigating the Shifting Sands of Consumer Spending Amid Rising Prices and New Tariffs ,” shows that more than 50 million consumers would shift their spending or freeze spending on certain categories, if price tags increase by 10% or more. “The pressures are widespread , given the fact that the data show that 65% of U.S. adults live paycheck to paycheck,” PYMNTS wrote recently. “A significant 22% of consumers find it a struggle to meet their monthly obligations, which means that even keeping the fridge full or the pantry stocked is no easy task.” Recommended Stablecoin Issuers Race for Bank Charters as Fed Weighs Access Tariff Tally: Global Losses Eclipse $35 Billion Going Into Q3 Earnings Visa and Proof Team to Bolster Digital ID Verification Alibaba Unveils AI Chatbot and Prices AI Glasses at $659 See More In: consumer confidence , consumer insights , Consumer Spending , economy , federal reserve , Federal Reserve Bank of New York , inflation , News , PYMNTS News , Survey of Consumer Expectations , tariffs , trade war , What's Hot"

    "article_text": "Spooked by US tariffs, retailers look for growth in Europe People shop at Macy’s department store in Manhattan in New York City · Reuters Helen Reid May 6, 2025 3 min read By Helen Reid LONDON (Reuters) -Growing numbers of retailers and consumer brands are shifting their focus to Europe and other markets from the United States, as they expect U.S. tariffs to spark price hikes that will drive American consumer demand down. European online fashion retailer Zalando, which sells logistics and software services to other retailers, said on Tuesday it was in talks with prospective new clients looking to expand in the European market. \"We see brands and retailers really having a larger focus on Europe as a way to also generate additional demand if it gets more difficult to do this in the U.S.,\" Zalando co-CEO David Schroeder said. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has slapped a blanket 10% tariff on all imports into the country, and 145% tariffs on goods made in China. German clothing brand Hugo Boss has rerouted China-manufactured products to other markets instead of the U.S., and said there was a \"notable deterioration\" in U.S. consumer spending in the first quarter due to growing uncertainty over the economy. \"We are currently taking a rather cautious stance regarding consumer behavior in the U.S.,\" its CEO Daniel Grieder said on Tuesday as the company reported lower revenues compared to last year. The reaction highlights the impact of Trump's tariffs on the flow of consumer products around the globe, forcing companies to shake up long-established patterns of manufacturing and sales. Key will be how U.S. consumers react to price increases as a result of tariffs. Barbie maker Mattel on Monday pulled its annual guidance, saying there was too much uncertainty over consumer spending, and that tariffs would force it to raise prices in the U.S. For its card game UNO, Mattel said it was shipping more China-manufactured games internationally to avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, while increasing production of UNO in India to serve U.S. customers. The CEO of Italian fashion group OTB, which owns brands including Diesel, Jil Sander and Maison Margiela, said on Monday it would have to increase its prices in the U.S. by 8-9% to offset the impact of tariffs. While European brands previously proudly advertised their sales to U.S. consumers, world leaders in spending on clothes and shoes, they have pivoted to trying to reassure investors they are not overly exposed. The U.S. accounts for around 20% of German sportswear brand Adidas' business, CEO Bjorn Gulden said last week in a results call, adding that \"for 80% of our business these tariffs have no impact\". Story Continues \"We believe we can currently gain more momentum in the other markets,\" said Gulden. \"We can kind of finance the losses... on margin in the U.S. by overachieving in the other markets.\" More focus on Europe will however increase competition among retailers, and may make it harder for brands to win over new customers. The tariffs have also triggered concerns in the region that low-value goods could be dumped on the market. Cut-price online retailers Shein and Temu, whose main market is the U.S., have increased their advertising spend in Europe as they seek to mitigate the impact of the U.S. hiking tariffs on Chinese goods and removing a duty-free exemption for low-value e-commerce packages from China.

    "article_text": "Business News Disney's blowout quarter proves it can still turn stories into empires. The stock soars 10% Theme parks are growing full throttle and Moana racked up billions on land and stream By Catherine Baab Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Reddit Share to Email Share to Link Disney’s ( DIS ) latest earnings report delivered a bit of old-school magic. Revenue rose 7% to $23.6 billion, up from $22.1 billion last year. EPS rose to $1.45 from last year’s $1.21. Suggested Reading The 7 best cities in America to celebrate Thanksgiving What's more expensive on your Thanksgiving menu this year? The 5 best cities in America for veterans — and the 5 worst As the company works to steady its streaming ship, it’s the theme parks that continue to do the heavy lifting, with higher prices, fuller cruise ships, and longer guest stays all contributing to that rising bottom line. Related Content Americans hoping for $2,000 checks from Trump's tariffs could be disappointed Flight cuts are causing widespread pain. Here's what you need to know Disney stock rose 10.4% in Wednesday morning trading. The shares are still down about 8% so far this year. Standout performance in parks Revenue in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment jumped 10% year over year to $8.4 billion, while operating income from domestic parks climbed 12% to $1.9 billion. Disney Cruise Line added the Disney Treasure to its fleet and expanded its itineraries. Guest spending also rose, thanks to add-ons like Genie+ and Lightning Lane. Defying some analysts’ fears that the trade war is weighing on American brands overseas, Disney’s international parks turned in a strong quarter, with operating income up 7%. Hong Kong Disneyland even turned a profit—something that hasn’t happened in years. CEO Bob Iger called the parks “a cornerstone of our business,” and with $60 billion earmarked for further buildouts over the next decade, the company is clearly betting that physical experiences will keep driving real-world dollars. So far, the bet is working. Even amid a softening consumer economy, guests aren’t balking at the price hikes. Disney’s storytelling machine is humming again, too. Mufasa: The Lion King has now quietly pulled in over $720 million globally since its holiday release, and as Iger pointed out in his comments, Marvel’s Thunderbolts is the top film in the world. The rest of the 2025 lineup reads like a greatest-hits remix: Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2, Elio, Avatar: Fire and Ash, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps are all examples of the franchise extensions Disney is well known for. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Moana universe “knows the way.” Moana 2 became one of the top three films of 2024, earning $1 billion at the box office, and has clocked 139 million streaming hours on Disney+ since March. The original remains the most-streamed film on the platform with an eye-watering 1.4 billion viewing hours — and like other Disney IP goes on minting cash by fueling attractions, stage shows, and character meet-and-greets across parks and cruise ships. It’s less a virtuous cycle than a virtuous voyage. Content powers streaming to modest growth All this momentum is translating into modest growth for Disney+. The service added 1.4 million subscribers in Q2 to reach 126 million overall, driven by both domestic and international gains. Executives credited the strong content bank — especially Moana 2, Mufasa, and Daredevil: Born Again — for the bump in subscriptions and streaming revenue. Iger emphasized the “multiplier effect” of hit films, which creates lasting long-tail value across all of Disney’s divisions. Stories become ecosystems, ecosystems mint cash, and then they mint even more of it. 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of the Battle Creek, Michigan-based company fell nearly 11% after it missed first-quarter sales and profit expectations. Customers are bracing for another inflationary market burdened by price increases as companies try to navigate higher input costs brought on by U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic tariff implementation. WK Kellogg has already witnessed pushback from consumers after it ramped up prices over the last several quarters to counter input costs, pushing cost-conscious shoppers away. Its product pricing rose 3%, while volumes slumped 8.6% in the reported quarter. Kraft Heinz and Kellanova have also reported bleak quarterly results, given subdued consumer spending in the United States. The U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, hit by a flood of imports as businesses raced to avoid higher costs from tariffs, as well as softening consumer spending. WK Kellogg expects full-year organic net sales to now decrease between 2% and 3%, compared with a prior expectation of a 1% fall. It expects full-year net adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, between $270 million and $275 million, compared with a previous expectation of between $286 million and $292 million. The Froot Loops maker said its 2025 forecast includes a modest impact from tariffs, primarily related to sourcing raw materials outside North America. This impact would be between $2 million and $4 million, based on the tariffs currently in place, CFO David McKinstray said. WK Kellogg's quarterly net sales fell 6.2% to $663 million, compared with analysts' average expectation of $679.5 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. It reported earnings of 20 cents per share, missing analysts' estimate of 40 cents per share.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Tue, May 6, 2025 · 04:01 PM [BERLIN] German fashion group Hugo Boss reported a better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday (May 6) and maintained its full-year forecast amid increased macroeconomic uncertainties. The company posted first-quarter revenue of 999 million euros (S$1.46 billion), slightly below the 1.01 billion euros a year earlier, but above analysts’ forecast of 974 million euros, a company-provided poll showed. It also expects 2025 group sales to remain broadly in line with the prior year, ranging between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros. The premium fashion retailer said subdued global consumer sentiment continues to weigh on the sector due to uncertainty over US tariffs. “Benefiting from a well-diversified sourcing structure, the company is carefully evaluating potential measures based on currently available information and remains prepared to respond with agility to any potential further changes in trade policy.” US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and uncertainty over his trade policies have sent global markets into a tailspin and significantly dampened investor optimism. SEE ALSO Hugo Boss sees sluggish US, China demand at start of year “Following a strong finish to 2024, our performance in the first quarter was affected by the rising macroeconomic uncertainty, which impacted global consumer sentiment and our industry. Against this backdrop, we continued to place strong emphasis on what we have in our control,” CEO Daniel Grieder said. Luxury groups have struggled with tighter consumer spending due to slowing demand for fashion and accessories, particularly in the US and China.

    "article_text": "Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Consumer sentiment is in the doldrums as shoppers worry tariffs will increase prices. Many economists have raised concerns that poor sentiment could slow consumer spending, hindering economic growth. However, the last time consumers felt this bad about the economy, their appetite for spending helped keep the economy out of recession, mainly due to a strong labor market. Consumers may have doubts about the economy's future, but that hasn't stopped them from spending so far—a habit that could prevent a recession. Consumer sentiment fell for the fourth consecutive month in April . The declines reflect uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and whether they will drive up prices across the economy. Some forecasters are worried that the sour mood could translate to a sustained slowdown in spending and send the economy into a recession . “How consumers act in these next couple of months will be telling,” wrote Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein. “Consumer optimism has slid amid tariff-related pricing concerns, but one of the lessons of the pandemic was that what consumers say is seldom the best barometer for actual spending.” What Does History Tell Us About Consumer Spending Amid a Dour Outlook? Consumer sentiment was at a historically low reading of 50 in June 2022, when inflation was at more than 9% and gas prices approached $5 amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, despite the poor sentiment over elevated inflation, retail sales grew that month, including higher restaurant spending. This was part of a longer trend of strong consumer spending that helped keep the economy from slipping into recession during that period. A good job market kept consumers spending during that period of bad vibes, which economists said could help keep the economy moving during the current period of low sentiment. \"We actually saw spending be very solid, if not strong, over that period,\" said Nationwide's senior economist Ben Ayers. \"The sentiment readings were not looking so great, but the job numbers were very strong, and that gave people the income and the confidence that they could go out and spend money and that they would still have income coming in.\" To that end, economists saw good news in the April jobs report released on Friday, which showed better-than-expected job growth . However, there could be weakness ahead, as the weekly jobless claims reached their highest levels since February, said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"Although consumers have been shifting how they spend their money, they’re still spending, and that can keep powering the U.S. economy forward,\" Kenwell said. \"However, that engine could stall if the labor market deteriorates.\" Spending Remains Solid But Weaknesses Are Emerging Spending remains strong, at least for the time being. Retail sales, often used as an indicator of spending, came in better than economists projected in March, as Trump ramped up his tariff talk. Some attributed the jump to shoppers rushing to buy items before tariff costs hit, especially on cars, but other economists said consumer trends weren't so clear. \"What's difficult with looking at that data is trying to decide how much of that was just people buying things in advance of tariff price increases,\" Ayers said. Economists pointed out that restaurants and bars saw a 1.8% increase in sales in March, a spending category that isn't closely associated with imports. “We're not aware of a way you can front-run tariffs with a nice night out,” the Wells Fargo economists wrote, noting that March’s restaurant spending data was “a key signal that while spending may be slowing, consumers have not gone into hiding when it comes to discretionary spending.” However, there could be a slowdown in discretionary spending on the horizon. For example, several major airlines have pulled their guidance for upcoming earnings amid weakening demand for domestic flights . Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams said that is bad news in a consumer spending category that is often a bellwether. “This is a sign that flight bookings show consumers are not only talking down the economy like they did in 2022 and 2023, they’re acting on their bad vibes, too,” Adams said.

In affirming that criticism rooted in scientific evidence does not amount to defamation — even when it names brands — the Court has not only protected an individual’s right to free speech but also clarified that in the age of information saturation, evidence-based critique is a constitutional necessity, not a reputational threat. For far too long, corporations have used the spectre of defamation, disparagement, and trademark infringement to intimidate critics and sidestep public scrutiny (AFP) For far too long, corporations have used the spectre of defamation, disparagement, and trademark infringement to intimidate critics and sidestep public scrutiny. By drawing a clear boundary between good-faith critique and malice, the court has laid down an early contour of defamation jurisprudence concerning the digital medium. The recognition that satire, hyperbole, and exaggeration — if anchored in truth, especially with data-backed evidence — constitute protected speech is a doctrinal advancement that aligns Indian law more closely with global standards. The implications go beyond this single case. The judgment demands that we reconceptualise defamation in the context of digital virality. Traditional defamation law was forged in an era where speech was slow-moving, intermediated, and ephemeral. Today, a single video can reach millions within hours and remain perpetually accessible. The legal system must now grapple not just with the content of speech, but its amplification, persistence, and algorithmic life cycle. For the influencer ecosystem, the judgment is simultaneously liberating and sobering. It protects those who act with diligence. But influencers who peddle innuendo without evidence, or who fail to disclose financial entanglements, will find little comfort in this judgment. When an individual conducts independent testing, commissions third-party lab analyses, and provides disclaimers to the public, they cross into the domain of citizen accountability. Such speech deserves judicial protection. Equally, this ruling is a rebuke to corporations seeking to use the courts as instruments of suppression rather than introspection. The accountability for a label lies with the brand, not its supply chain. This judgment implicitly signals that the era of shifting blame downward is over. Consumers deserve more than opaque and buried disclaimers — they deserve clarity, and, when necessary, time-bound redress. The judgment does more than reaffirm their right to know — it formally enshrines their role in shaping market standards. In a hyperconnected economy, the power of the consumer lies not only in purchase choices but in collective scrutiny, public validation, and the courage to question marketed claims. This case illustrates that in the absence of swift and trusted State intervention, digital actors — whether influencers, whistleblowers, or independent reviewers — are stepping into quasi-regulatory roles. The Court’s framing of influencer speech as falling within the broader canopy of public interest also nudges the conversation toward regulatory evolution. For regulators, this is a reminder to build real-time, intelligent systems that can algorithmically and systematically pick up social media cues as early warning signals in grievance redressal and consumer protection frameworks. Relying solely on formal complaints or retrospective investigations will leave the state perennially behind the curve. Further, the role of intermediaries — Google, Meta, and other platforms — must now be re-evaluated. In this case, the Court had sought submissions from these entities. But the platforms’ long-standing claim of neutrality is becoming increasingly tenuous. When speech impacts health outcomes, economic decisions, and public trust, platforms cannot afford to merely host — they must adjudicate, or at least signal, epistemic trustworthiness. This judgment sets the stage for deeper inquiries into platform ethics, content governance, and the complicity of platforms in suppressing or elevating speech based on opaque internal policies. Another fault line exposed by this case is the blurred boundary between commercial and public speech. While the court treated Mangal’s video as an act of independent scrutiny, the presence of other commercial interests on parallel channels raised valid concerns. The law must evolve sharper criteria to assess whether a critique is truly in the public interest or covertly driven by competitive bias. Disclosure norms exist, but enforcement is weak and reputational rather than legal. That a high court would balance reputational harm, economic interest, and speech freedoms —while resisting drive for blanket takedowns — shows an admirable constitutional sensibility. The comment threads of YouTube, the disclosure tags of Instagram, and the viral loops of digital dissent may soon become the frontlines of a broader legal evolution — one that begins to define rights, responsibilities, and the balance of power in India’s fast-unfolding tech-driven consumer economy. In today’s economy — powered by data, endorsements, and digital communities — trust is the real currency. And trust isn’t owed; it’s earned, tested, and, when needed, questioned. This judgment is a clear reminder to all of us — brands, influencers, platforms, consumers and regulators — that evidence-backed criticism isn’t dissent or disorder. It’s the framework that keeps democracy honest and accountable. Srinath Sridharan is a corporate advisor and serves as independent director on corporate boards.

Advertisement Westpac’s consumer spending indicator (CSI) “is consistent with per capita spend declining at a 2% annual pace”. Advertisement “The wider picture continues to be one of improving incomes but with households putting much of this towards saving and rebuilding financial buffers rather than spending”, Westpac economics notes. CBA’s household spending insights showed a similar reluctance to spend, with the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) since the 1 July 2024 Stage 3 tax cuts estimated to be only 38%: Advertisement CBA also showed a strong flow of extra payments into CBA mortgage offset and redraw accounts so far in 2025. “The ongoing lift in prepayments in offset & redraw accounts reflect the high opportunity cost of not doing so, given where interest rates are currently”, CBA senior economist Belinda Allen explained. Advertisement “The March data suggests this continued to occur after the reduction in the cash rate in February”. The upshot is that consumer spending is likely to remain muted even with additional rate cuts from the RBA."

But traders didn’t change their expectations for Federal Reserve interest at all. They still see virtually no chance of a move on May 7, and the odds of a quarter point reduction on June 18 held at about 60%. By the end of the year, the market is still pricing in 42% odds that rates will fall a full percentage point from the current level. That seems strange for such an unexpected report , but the first-quarter figures may have been distorted by a surge in imports, and gross domestic product figures can be volatile anyway."

    "article_text": "ETMarkets.com Lackluster quarterly results from consumer-facing companies including McDonald's and Harley-Davidson are the latest sign that American shoppers are curbing spending amid shifting U.S. trade policies. McDonald's posted a surprise decline in quarterly global sales on Thursday and said it was navigating the \"toughest of market conditions\". It echoed recent warnings from restaurant operators Domino's Pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Starbucks that Americans were spending less on dining out. Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder forecast a bigger-than-expected drop in fiscal 2025 sales, while motorbike maker Harley-Davidson joined a spate of companies this week in pulling forecasts, citing the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Investors have been worried that the Trump administration's tariff plans will spur a resurgence in inflation and hurt global economic growth, in turn deterring discretionary spending. \"It's very difficult for retailers to give solid guidance and not be conservative when they don't know what they're going to be able to get in terms of inventories, especially ones that come from China,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Live Events Estee Lauder said sales in the Americas declined primarily due to a dip in \"consumer confidence and sentiment\", which led to elevated inventory levels and destocking at certain retailers. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years, data on Wednesday showed, and consumer spending - which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy - grew at 1.8% after a robust 4% pace in the fourth quarter. The United States has approached China, seeking talks over Trump's 145% tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state media said on Thursday, potentially signaling Beijing's openness to negotiations. Trump instituted sweeping tariffs in early April, unleashing a wave of selling across stocks worldwide and prompting several companies to either withdraw guidance or warn about their performance in the coming months. Fast-casual chain Shake Shack posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Thursday and said it was factoring in some level of pressure on consumer spending as well as headwinds from higher inflation this year. However, results from card companies Mastercard and Visa signaled resilience in consumer spending. \"Visa and Mastercard data say consumers are doing fine, but reports from the likes of McDonald's suggest that it's still the higher-income shopper that is doing the heavy lifting,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"It's an unsustainable situation and likely to break towards a breakdown in spending without a tariff reprieve soon.\" Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

    "article_text": "Gloomy retail earnings show consumers are feeling the pinch of US tariffs Sruthi Shankar May 1, 2025 2 min read MCD By Sruthi Shankar (Reuters) -Lackluster quarterly results from consumer-facing companies including McDonald's and Harley-Davidson are the latest sign that American shoppers are curbing spending amid shifting U.S. trade policies. McDonald's posted a surprise decline in quarterly global sales on Thursday and said it was navigating the \"toughest of market conditions\". It echoed recent warnings from restaurant operators Domino's Pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Starbucks that Americans were spending less on dining out. Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder forecast a bigger-than-expected drop in fiscal 2025 sales, while motorbike maker Harley-Davidson joined a spate of companies this week in pulling forecasts, citing the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Investors have been worried that the Trump administration's tariff plans will spur a resurgence in inflation and hurt global economic growth, in turn deterring discretionary spending. \"It's very difficult for retailers to give solid guidance and not be conservative when they don't know what they're going to be able to get in terms of inventories, especially ones that come from China,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Estee Lauder said sales in the Americas declined primarily due to a dip in \"consumer confidence and sentiment\", which led to elevated inventory levels and destocking at certain retailers. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years, data on Wednesday showed, and consumer spending - which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy - grew at 1.8% after a robust 4% pace in the fourth quarter. The United States has approached China, seeking talks over Trump's 145% tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state media said on Thursday, potentially signaling Beijing's openness to negotiations. Trump instituted sweeping tariffs in early April, unleashing a wave of selling across stocks worldwide and prompting several companies to either withdraw guidance or warn about their performance in the coming months. Fast-casual chain Shake Shack posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Thursday and said it was factoring in some level of pressure on consumer spending as well as headwinds from higher inflation this year. However, results from card companies Mastercard and Visa signaled resilience in consumer spending. \"Visa and Mastercard data say consumers are doing fine, but reports from the likes of McDonald's suggest that it's still the higher-income shopper that is doing the heavy lifting,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Story Continues \"It's an unsustainable situation and likely to break towards a breakdown in spending without a tariff reprieve soon.\" (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar, Purvi Agarwal and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai) View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

It's also anticipated that consumer spending was strong for the month, reflecting Americans pulling forward purchases ahead of expected tariffs. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images CNN — A car-buying frenzy, stoked by tariff fears, drove US consumer spending in March to its biggest monthly gain in more than two years, new data showed Wednesday. Consumer spending leapt 0.7% from February, according to a Commerce Department report released Wednesday that showed Americans shelled out last month for durable goods, particularly automobiles. The Commerce Department’s Personal Income and Outlays report — which provides the most comprehensive federal data on spending, income as well as the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge — further reinforced what the recent retail sales data and anecdotal evidence have been indicating: Americans picked up their spending and likely pulled forward some purchases out of fear that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will raise prices in the months to come. But as of March, price hikes were held in check and overall inflation slowed to its lowest rate since September — in part due to recession fears weighing down oil prices. Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed’s favored inflation gauge — rose 2.3% in March from the year before, slower than February’s 2.7% increase . On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged, versus a rise of 0.4% in February. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta forecast a sharp decline of 2.7% for US GDP in the first quarter of 2025.

But for now, we really need to cross our fingers and hope that incomes and jobs hold up, because those are the things that will insulate us against the effective tariffs and higher inflation.” What this means for interest rates Economists expected the PCE price index to cool sharply to 2.2% annually in March, likely due to falling energy costs as oil prices slumped on lower demand expectations. Energy prices did indeed fall, plunging 2.7% in March. Food prices, however, saw their biggest jump in months, rising 0.5% from February. Excluding food and energy costs, the core PCE price index was flat for the month and slowed to an annual rate of 2.6% from 3%. In any other environment, inflation heading towards 2% would likely fuel optimism that the Fed would resume its rate-cutting ways and lower interest rates. However, Trump’s economy-shaking policy decisions, especially those that have triggered a trade war with China, theaten to put the central bank between a rock and a hard place by stagnating economic growth while driving inflation higher. “Inflation is set to pick up as tariff increases lead to higher goods prices,” Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services, wrote in a note on Wednesday. “This will create a dilemma for [Fed policymakers].

Consumer spending rose 0.7% from February, marking a sharp acceleration from 0.1%. It was the biggest monthly jump in spending activity in more than two years, Commerce Department data shows, as Americans rushed to buy products ahead of the bulk of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. But the latest data lands at a time when uncertainty is swelling about the extent to which Trump’s massive policy moves — including a broad array of tariffs — could upend global order and the US economy.

Consumers didn’t sock away as much into savings last month as they did in February, but the personal saving rate came in at a healthy 3.9%.

    "article_text": "Menu News Kweichow Moutai’s sales growth slows as Chinese consumer demand weakens 01 May 2025 By Ron Emler China’s economic slowdown has hit sales growth for baijiu giant Kweichow Moutai and its rivals in the first quarter of the year. Weaker consumer spending and a shift in sales strategy contributed to the deceleration. The slowdown of the Chinese economy and the associated weakness in consumer demand have been demonstrated by the slowed sales growth of Kweichow Moutai and its baijiu rivals in the first quarter of this year. Kweichow’s sales rose by 10.5% to 50.6 billion yuan ($6.94 billion), compared with 18.5% growth in the same period last year. The world’s biggest beverage alcohol group said its net profit increased by 12% to 26.85 billion yuan during the quarter compared with a 16% rise in the first three months of 2024. Lower revenue guidance and price controls impact growth Moutai’s results had been expected to be weaker after the company had warned investors earlier in the year that it expected annual revenue growth to slow to about 9%, down from 16%. Efforts to maintain relatively stable channel inventory levels and wholesale prices were also cited as factors in the slowing growth rate. Shift toward direct and e-commerce sales Interestingly, while the core baijiu brand contributed the bulk of its revenue, generating 43.56 billion yuan, direct sales reached 23.22 billion yuan while wholesale revenue through distributors totalled 27.36 billion yuan.

Industry-wide pressure on baijiu sales Kweichow was not alone in reporting slowing growth. First-quarter results from baijiu companies such as Wuliangye Yibin and Luzhou Laojiao also reflected consumer spending pressures. Wuliangye Yibin’s revenue growth slowed to 6% while Luzhou Laojiao made a marginal 1.8% gain. Modest share price recovery after 2024 slump Kweichow’s share price on the Shanghai market has gained 1.3% so far this year after sliding by 12% in 2024.

    "article_text": "Is James Hardie Industries (NYSE:JHX) a Small-Cap Construction and Materials Stock Hedge Funds Are Buying? Maham Fatima April 29, 2025 4 min read JHX.AX We recently published a list of the 15 Small-Cap Construction and Materials Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying . In this article, we are going to take a look at where James Hardie Industries (NYSE:JHX) stands against other small-cap construction and materials stocks. Saira Malik, Nuveen’s head of equities and fixed income, joined ‘Closing Bell’ on CNBC on March 26 to discuss her investment strategy in the middle of this uncertain market. She emphasized that two dominant themes are shaping the second quarter of this year: policy uncertainty and questions surrounding the pace of the economic slowdown. Malik noted that markets have shown a little optimism after a rebound from correction territory. This was driven by investor expectations of watered-down tariffs and the return of the term ‘transitory’ regarding inflation effects from tariffs. However, she highlighted that the economy continues to slow. Given this, Malik prefers defensive market sectors, particularly infrastructure. She also identified municipal bonds as a favored fixed-income category. These appeal to local investors who seek stable income streams in the middle of this economic uncertainty. Malik also acknowledged the risk that continued negative sentiment about consumer weakness could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. She pointed out that the economy’s recent strength has been driven by consumer spending and employment, with about half of payroll growth since 2019 coming from government jobs. The recent data on consumer spending, retail sales, and confidence have been weak, but consumers often express pessimism without reducing spending proportionally. Despite this, she stressed that the economy is slowing and warned that ongoing tariff uncertainty could cause a sharper economic downturn. However, she also mentioned potential upside from forthcoming tax cuts and deregulation, which could provide economic support. Malik explained that the market’s recent optimism comes from increasing clarity about tariff implementation and targets. Our Methodology We first sifted through financial media reports, ETFs, and Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 hedge funds database reports to compile a list of the small-cap construction and materials stocks hedge funds are buying.

MC World Desk May 01, 2025 / 08:10 IST U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in Q1 2025, impacted by tariffs. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time since early 2022. The contraction was largely driven by a surge in imports, as businesses sought to stock up ahead of the Trump administration’s tariffs, alongside slowing consumer spending, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The U.S. Commerce Department reported that GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.3%, marking a notable slowdown in economic activity. Slowdown in consumer spending Consumer spending, which is a key driver of economic growth, rose at a modest pace of 1.8% in the first quarter of 2025, the smallest increase since mid-2023. The slowdown in spending is significant, as it signals that U.S. consumers are becoming more cautious amid rising prices and economic uncertainty. The federal government also reduced its spending, with the Department of Government Efficiency cutting jobs and contracts, further contributing to the economic slowdown. Related stories Ukraine, China mineral dominance on agenda as G7 meets Trump announces plan to rename Veterans Day as ‘Victory Day’ in Arlington cemetery speech California Governor Newsom blasts Trump for 'dumb' US climate policy at COP30 Despite these challenges, some positive signs emerged from the data. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which measure demand from businesses and consumers while excluding more volatile factors like international trade and government spending, rose by 3%. This was slightly higher than the previous quarter's 2.9% increase, indicating that domestic demand remains resilient despite the overall GDP contraction. Trade war impact on GDP However, the primary factor behind the contraction was the Trump administration's ongoing trade war. As businesses rushed to import goods before tariffs were implemented, net exports—the difference between imports and exports—subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP. This marked the largest drag on GDP from net exports on record, dating back to 1947. The surge in imports, which grew at their fastest pace since 2020, reflects the pull-forward effect of businesses stocking up ahead of tariff changes, which had a significant negative impact on the GDP calculation. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, commented, “The headline decline overstates weakness because a lot of that was tariff-induced pull-forward.” She suggested that the underlying demand was still solid, with investments in business equipment and inventories helping to counterbalance the negative impact from trade disruptions. Uncertainty in the current quarter As The Wall Street Journal reports, while the GDP data for the first quarter reflects the impact of tariff-related changes, it is a backward-looking indicator. Economic conditions have continued to evolve, with ongoing uncertainty over tariffs and financial market volatility affecting both consumer and business sentiment. The stock market, for instance, saw declines following the GDP release, underscoring concerns about the future trajectory of the economy. President Trump, in a statement on Truth Social, blamed former President Joe Biden for the stock market’s decline, asserting, “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th.” However, Jared Bernstein, a top economic official during the Biden administration, countered these claims, pointing out that the stock market performed better under Biden than under Trump. Bernstein also noted that Trump’s tariffs had contributed to the record drag on GDP from net exports. The continuing impact of tariffs Trump has consistently argued that tariffs are crucial for long-term economic growth, as they would help to bring back manufacturing jobs and make America wealthier. However, the immediate impact of the tariffs has been to create uncertainty, raise prices, and disrupt supply chains. The March trade deficit in goods hit a record, as businesses sought to bring in goods before the tariffs took full effect. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer spending in March surged, driven in part by households purchasing vehicles ahead of the anticipated tariffs. Despite this increase in spending, analysts are concerned that the long-term effects of tariffs will lead to higher prices and reduced consumer confidence. Outlook for the economy Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, warned that while the GDP data “probably overstates the economy’s weakness,” the overall economic outlook remains fragile. Zandi emphasized that if the administration does not find a resolution to the ongoing tariff issues, the U.S. could face even weaker economic conditions in the future, including potential job losses. The Federal Reserve is also facing a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it needs to control inflation, which may rise due to tariffs. On the other hand, it must ensure that the labor market remains strong and that rising unemployment does not exacerbate the economic slowdown. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged that higher tariffs could lead to both increased prices and higher unemployment, creating a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank. A strong start to 2025 Despite these challenges, the U.S. economy entered 2025 with strong fundamentals. Growth in 2024 had been steady, and inflation continued to ease. The labour market showed signs of strength, with low unemployment rates. However, the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their potential to raise prices is likely to weigh on consumer sentiment and economic performance in the coming months. In conclusion, the first-quarter GDP contraction highlights the significant impact that Trump’s trade policies are having on the U.S. economy. While there are signs of underlying strength, the ongoing trade war and its effect on tariffs, prices, and market sentiment present ongoing challenges for both consumers and businesses. As the situation unfolds, the economic landscape remains highly uncertain, with potentially serious consequences for future growth and employment.

    "article_text": "NEW YORK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for U.S. companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a shift in U.S. policy, reported The Associated Press on Wednesday. Tariffs and the stark shift in policy have also shaken consumer and business confidence. The U.S. economy shrank during the first quarter of the year, its first drop in three years. Consumer spending has ramped up, likely an effort to get ahead of tariffs, and companies are pulling back on hiring. \"Stunted consumer spending and weaker employment could further hurt the U.S. economy,\" noted the report. Roughly half of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their latest quarterly financial results, but the focus has been on how they will adjust to tariffs and any change in consumers' behavior. The focus remains blurry for both companies and investors because of the on-again-off-again nature of President Donald Trump's policy, according to the report. Trump has implemented a range of tariffs on goods from some of the biggest U.S. trading partners and many of those countries have hit back with retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, Trump has pulled back or postponed some tariffs. \"The situation remains unpredictable and that is problematic for companies trying to plan ahead and investors looking for stability,\" the report added.

The stock is also being hurt by bearish coverage that was published by an analyst this morning. Stocks pull back on GDP and consumer spending data The U.S. Commerce Department released GDP data for the first quarter today that showed an unexpected contraction. GDP shrank 0.3% year over year in the quarter, falling short of economists' target for growth of 0.3%. The shortfall was driven by a steep rise in imports as purchasers moved to buy foreign goods before new tariffs were put in place at the beginning of this month. Imports are subtracted from GDP, and the purchasing surge was larger than anticipated. While the first quarter's import-driven GDP decline doesn't necessarily suggest any structural weakness in the U.S. economy, investors are concerned because consumer spending increased just 1.8% compared to 4% in last year's quarter. Edgewater Research thinks AppLovin's growth will decelerate a lot this year Before the market opened this morning, Edgewater Research updated its sales targets for AppLovin and highlighted challenges it sees facing the business. While Edgewater stuck with its forecast for first-quarter revenue to increase approximately 55% year over year and reach $1.08 billion in the first quarter, it expects that growth will decelerate substantially as the year progresses. Setting a sales target of $5.7 billion for 2025, Edgewater is now guiding for revenue to increase just 18% annually. It sees signs that growth for the mobile gaming market is losing steam, and it expects that increased competition from Meta Platform s and Alphabet could further curb AppLovin's growth potential. Even with today's pullback, AppLovin is valued at more than 16 times the average analyst sales target for this year. The company has been posting impressive performance and managed to grow sales 43% annually last year, but shares could continue to move lower if it turns out that Edgewater's growth forecast is correct."

    "article_text": "Updated / Wednesday, 30 Apr 2025 15:42 Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, surged 0.7% last month US consumer spending increased solidly in March as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles to avoid higher prices and shortages due to tariffs, but that did little to change economists' views that the economy had shifted into lower gear. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, surged 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in February, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.5% after a previously reported 0.4% increase in February. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the first quarter that was published earlier on Wednesday, which showed GDP contracted at a 0.3% annualised rate last quarter, weighed down by a record surge in imports. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have fanned fears the economy is facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation, commonly referred to as stagflation. Some economists are expecting a recession. Trump sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index was unchanged in March after advancing 0.4% in February. In the 12 months through March, PCE prices increased 2.3% after rising 2.7% in February. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was also unchanged. That followed a 0.5% gain in the so-called core PCE inflation in February. In the 12 months through March, core inflation increased 2.6% after advancing 3.0% in February. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. Economists are forecasting a surge in inflation this year as the Trump administration's import duties raise the cost of goods. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations have jumped to levels last seen in 1981. More stories on News Business Us Economy"

Prices rose by 2.3% year over year in March, according to the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures data released Wednesday. That's down from the 2.5% annualized increase in February but slightly higher than the forecasted 2.2% increase . The PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation. The numbers came out this morning following the release of March's Gross Domestic Product data, which showed the economy contracting at a rate of 0.3% in the first quarter. The contraction was largely attributed to businesses and people \"panic buying\" imported goods before President Donald Trump's tariffs took effect. However, consumer spending also slowed considerably in the first quarter, according to the GDP report. Resilient consumer spending has helped buoy the economy amid stubborn inflation and an uptick in unemployment. The latest data is still unlikely to change the Federal Reserve's vote next week on interest rates as it monitors how tariffs and political turmoil could affect the health of the economy . Experts expect the Fed will hold rates steady next week, as it's done since January after lowering them twice last fall. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to lower rates, although Trump backed off on threats to fire Powell after the stock market responded negatively last week."

The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, marking the first drop in three years. What caused the economy to shrink in the first quarter? Why you should care: The economy was slowed by a rise in imports as companies in the U.S. attempted to bring in foreign goods before President Donald Trump imposed massive tariffs. The Associated Press reported that the January-March drop in gross domestic product— the nation's output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the last three months of 2024.

(Photo by Liao Pan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) Separately, imports rose at a 41% rate and shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. And consumer spending also slowed significantly — 1.8% growth from 4% in October-December in 2024. Federal government spending also dipped 5.1% in the first quarter. Additionally, business investment increased at a 21.9% rate as companies put money into equipment. According to the AP, a category within the Gross Domestic Product data that examines the economy’s strength rose at a healthy 3% annual rate from January through March, up from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The AP noted that the category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories, and government spending. How do Trump’s tariffs impact the economy? Dig deeper: Economists tell the Associated Press that President Donald Trump's import taxes will hurt growth in the second half of 2025 and that recession risks are rising. Trump inherited a stable economy that had been steady despite high interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation. Trump’s trade policies — including 145% tariffs on China — have affected businesses and threatened to raise prices and hurt consumers. RELATED: Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports take effect Citing payroll provider ADP, the AP noted that companies added 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was projected, and down from 147,000 in March. This might indicate that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring with the uncertainty over tariffs.

    "article_text": "April 30 (UPI) -- U.S. economic gross domestic product declined for the first three months of 2025 as imports surged amid Trump administration tariffs, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro brushed off any concern. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said in a statement that real GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter. \"I got to say just one thing about today's news, that's the best negative print I have ever seen in my life,\" Navarro said Wednesday, adding that the markets \"need to look beneath the surface of that.\" The GDP drop, according to the BEA, \"primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending.\" Related Report says U.S. consumer confidence at 5-year low Amazon backs off of listing tariff prices after White House labeled it 'hostile and political' act Fourth quarter 2024 U.S. GDP revised up to annual rate of 2.4% Meanwhile, the Dow dropped 400 points Wednesday morning on the shrinking economy news. \"So, we really like where we're at now,\" Navarro, an ardent Trump supporter, told CNBC . Dow Jones surveyed economists had expected GDP growth of 0.4%, and real GDP increased 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The BEA said imports were up 41.3% in the first quarter driven by a goods increase of 50.9%. \"We had a 22 percent increase in domestic investment. That is off the charts,\" says Navarro, adding how its \"when you strip our inventories and the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs you have three percent growth.\" Increases in investment, consumer spending and exports partially offset the higher imports, according to the BEA. \"Maybe some of this negativity is due to a rush to bring in imports before the tariffs go up, but there is simply no way for policy advisors to sugar-coat this. Growth has simply vanished ,\" FWDbonds chief economist Chris Rupkey said. Consumer spending measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was up 1.8% compared with a 4% increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. The drop in GDP fed more recession fears, even as both the jobs market and consumer spending remain resilient for now. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor, former President Joe Biden , for the poor GDP showing in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. \"This is Biden's stock market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until Jan. 20. Tariffs will start kicking in and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers,\" Trump said. \"Our country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden \"overhang.\" This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\" However, this is not the first time Navarro -- who served a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress stemming from Trump's first term -- has dismissed ongoing concerns over the damaging effect of Trump's economic policies. Weeks ago, Navarro characterized the historic April 10 stock market drop as \"no big deal\" while fears swirl over Trump's tariffs."

It's also anticipated that consumer spending was strong for the month, reflecting Americans pulling forward purchases ahead of expected tariffs. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images CNN — A car-buying frenzy, stoked by tariff fears, drove US consumer spending in March to its biggest monthly gain in more than two years, new data showed Wednesday. Consumer spending leapt 0.7% from February, according to a Commerce Department report released Wednesday that showed Americans shelled out last month for durable goods, particularly automobiles. The Commerce Department’s Personal Income and Outlays report — which provides the most comprehensive federal data on spending, income as well as the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge — further reinforced what the recent retail sales data and anecdotal evidence have been indicating: Americans picked up their spending and likely pulled forward some purchases out of fear that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will raise prices in the months to come. But as of March, price hikes were held in check and overall inflation slowed to its lowest rate since September — in part due to recession fears weighing down oil prices. Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the Fed’s favored inflation gauge — rose 2.3% in March from the year before, slower than February’s 2.7% increase . On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged, versus a rise of 0.4% in February. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta forecast a sharp decline of 2.7% for US GDP in the first quarter of 2025.

Chun/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images Related article US economy goes into reverse from Trump’s abrupt policy shifts “This was a good report, no question about it,” Robert Frick, chief economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview Wednesday. However, that takeaway comes with a major caveat: Trump’s sweeping policies — particularly cutbacks in federal jobs and spending massive tariffs and mass deportations — not only have injected substantial uncertainty into the economy but also have significantly raised recession risks, Frick said. “But let’s not fool ourselves,” Frick cautioned. “Things will get worse later this year, probably later in the summer. But for now, we really need to cross our fingers and hope that incomes and jobs hold up, because those are the things that will insulate us against the effective tariffs and higher inflation.” What this means for interest rates Economists expected the PCE price index to cool sharply to 2.2% annually in March, likely due to falling energy costs as oil prices slumped on lower demand expectations. Energy prices did indeed fall, plunging 2.7% in March. Food prices, however, saw their biggest jump in months, rising 0.5% from February. Excluding food and energy costs, the core PCE price index was flat for the month and slowed to an annual rate of 2.6% from 3%. In any other environment, inflation heading towards 2% would likely fuel optimism that the Fed would resume its rate-cutting ways and lower interest rates. However, Trump’s economy-shaking policy decisions, especially those that have triggered a trade war with China, theaten to put the central bank between a rock and a hard place by stagnating economic growth while driving inflation higher. “Inflation is set to pick up as tariff increases lead to higher goods prices,” Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services, wrote in a note on Wednesday. “This will create a dilemma for [Fed policymakers]. Inflation is still above the [central bank’s] 2% objective, but the labor market could start to soften, putting the committee’s two goals in conflict.” The April jobs report is set to be released Friday and is expected to show a softening in employment gains but a still relatively stable labor market. However, other major economic data released Wednesday could portend some challenges for the months to come: In the first quarter, economic activity contracted for the first time in three years (amid a surge of imports) and a separate report on private-sector hiring showed a precipitous drop-off in job gains. ‘Calm before the storm’ Based on Wednesday’s Commerce Department data, the economy is holding up for now. Consumer spending rose 0.7% from February, marking a sharp acceleration from 0.1%. It was the biggest monthly jump in spending activity in more than two years, Commerce Department data shows, as Americans rushed to buy products ahead of the bulk of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. But the latest data lands at a time when uncertainty is swelling about the extent to which Trump’s massive policy moves — including a broad array of tariffs — could upend global order and the US economy. Helping to fuel spending was a 0.5% jump in personal incomes, a strong rate that bodes well for continued consumer spending, Frick said. “The No. 1 thing I always look for is income, because no matter how anxious people are feeling about the economy or inflation, if they have the money, they’ll spend the money,” he said. Consumers didn’t sock away as much into savings last month as they did in February, but the personal saving rate came in at a healthy 3.9%. Considering those household finance dynamics as well as inflation, Wednesday’s release was a “good report” but also another sign of a “calm before the storm,” Frick said. “In the context of what’s to come, it will help bulwark us against the effect of tariffs and [product] scarcity and layoffs that will be coming,” he said."

    "article_text": "Economic news US economy contracts for 1st time since 2022 on imports surge By Augusta Saraiva April 30, 2025, 9:11 a.m. EDT 3 Min Read Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Bloomberg The U.S. economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump's trade policy. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government's initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed. Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased at the fastest pace since 2020 and boosted by aircraft and computers. The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink. Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the U.S. falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living. The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized 41.3% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren't produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter. Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP. Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024. Growth in consumer spending was driven by a broad-based advance in outlays for services and a pickup in nondurable goods. Several surveys of consumer attitudes have plunged, raising doubts about the ability of households to provide much fuel for the economy. Low-income consumers are already facing hardships of high prices, while wealthier individuals have been set back by this year's drop in stock prices. Meanwhile, business investment in equipment advanced at a 22.5% annualized rate. In addition to a surge in commercial aircraft shipments months after the end of a strike at Boeing, output of information processing equipment and computers also jumped. The GDP report also showed that a closely watched measure of underlying inflation accelerated to a 3.5% pace in the first quarter — the most in a year. Detailed data on inflation and consumer spending for the month of March are due later this morning. The uncertainty over the effect of tariffs on inflation as well as the broader economy has put the Federal Reserve in a tough position. Policymakers have indicated they're in no rush to lower interest rates until they get further clarity on what the White House policies mean for the economy. While the Trump administration has implemented a 90-day pause on some of the more punitive tariffs announced earlier this month, the country's effective tariff rate now stands at almost 23% — the highest in more than a century — according to Bloomberg Economics. Adding to the uncertainty are some exemptions from previously announced higher duties. The president and his economic advisors see tariffs as a means to stoke economic growth over the longer term through the revival of manufacturing. Trump also hopes to drive export growth and erase deficits with U.S. trading partners, raise revenue for the government and bolster national security. Augusta Saraiva Bloomberg News"

    "article_text": "Shoppers move through a market in the Chinatown neighborhood of Los Angeles, Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Andy Bao) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 30, 2025 at 10:33 AM EDT | UPDATED: April 30, 2025 at 4:56 PM EDT By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — A closely watched inflation gauge cooled last month in a sign that prices were steadily easing before most of President Donald Trump’s tariffs were implemented . At the same time, consumers accelerated their spending, particularly on cars, likely in an effort to get ahead of the duties . Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.3% in March from a year earlier, down from 2.7% in February. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6% compared with a year ago, below February’s 3%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed. The slowdown in inflation could be a temporary respite until the widespread duties imposed by Trump begin to push up prices in many categories. Most economists expect inflation to start picking up in the coming months. “Core inflation will inevitably rebound sharply in the coming months,” Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email. “Goods prices will rise much more strongly.” Chambers expects core inflation will near 4% by late this year. Wednesday’s report also showed that consumer spending increased 0.7% from February to March, a healthy gain. Much of the increase appeared to be driven by efforts to get ahead of duties, such as Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars, which took effect April 3. Spending on autos surged 8.1% in March. Still, that means auto sales are likely to fade in the coming months because those assets have already been secured. But spending on restaurants and hotels also jumped after falling in February, a sign Americans are still willing to splurge a little on travel and dining out. The spending increase is noteworthy because consumer confidence surveys have plunged for several months, suggesting Americans have grown increasingly worried about the economy. Yet so far, that hasn’t translated into a noticeable slowdown in spending. Yet many economists expect it will come soon. Some businesses are already seeing it, including some airlines. And Sheryl Tubbs, an Idaho-based creator behind DenimFelt, which converts secondhand denim into stuffed animals and puppets, opened her Etsy shop in late 2019 as a way to supplement her husband’s income. She buys supplies like boxes, buttons and thread from Chinese sellers on Amazon and benefited from the fact that small shipments from overseas have been exempt from tariffs, under what’s known as the “ de minimis exemption .” But the Trump administration has now closed that loophole. Prices for the supplies she buys from China are already rising. On top of that, sales dropped 50% over the past month as her customers pulled back. She will have to raise prices by a dollar or two on her items, which average about $50. But she’s also coming up with new ways to market her business like selling at a local festival and digitizing her patterns so she can sell them. “I definitely have to be more creative and come up with better ways of doing it to compete,” she said. Earlier Wednesday, the government reported that consumer spending slowed in the first three months of the year, compared with last year’s final quarter, as bad weather depressed shopping and Americans took a breather after healthy spending over the winter holidays. The nation’s economy actually shrank 0.3% in the January-March quarter as imports surged as companies sought to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs.

(AP Photo/Andy Bao) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 30, 2025 at 10:33 AM EDT | UPDATED: April 30, 2025 at 4:56 PM EDT By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — A closely watched inflation gauge cooled last month in a sign that prices were steadily easing before most of President Donald Trump’s tariffs were implemented . At the same time, consumers accelerated their spending, particularly on cars, likely in an effort to get ahead of the duties . Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.3% in March from a year earlier, down from 2.7% in February. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6% compared with a year ago, below February’s 3%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed. The slowdown in inflation could be a temporary respite until the widespread duties imposed by Trump begin to push up prices in many categories. Most economists expect inflation to start picking up in the coming months. “Core inflation will inevitably rebound sharply in the coming months,” Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email. “Goods prices will rise much more strongly.” Chambers expects core inflation will near 4% by late this year. Wednesday’s report also showed that consumer spending increased 0.7% from February to March, a healthy gain. Much of the increase appeared to be driven by efforts to get ahead of duties, such as Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars, which took effect April 3. Spending on autos surged 8.1% in March. Still, that means auto sales are likely to fade in the coming months because those assets have already been secured. But spending on restaurants and hotels also jumped after falling in February, a sign Americans are still willing to splurge a little on travel and dining out. The spending increase is noteworthy because consumer confidence surveys have plunged for several months, suggesting Americans have grown increasingly worried about the economy. Yet so far, that hasn’t translated into a noticeable slowdown in spending. Yet many economists expect it will come soon. Some businesses are already seeing it, including some airlines. And Sheryl Tubbs, an Idaho-based creator behind DenimFelt, which converts secondhand denim into stuffed animals and puppets, opened her Etsy shop in late 2019 as a way to supplement her husband’s income. She buys supplies like boxes, buttons and thread from Chinese sellers on Amazon and benefited from the fact that small shipments from overseas have been exempt from tariffs, under what’s known as the “ de minimis exemption .” But the Trump administration has now closed that loophole. Prices for the supplies she buys from China are already rising. On top of that, sales dropped 50% over the past month as her customers pulled back. She will have to raise prices by a dollar or two on her items, which average about $50. But she’s also coming up with new ways to market her business like selling at a local festival and digitizing her patterns so she can sell them. “I definitely have to be more creative and come up with better ways of doing it to compete,” she said. Earlier Wednesday, the government reported that consumer spending slowed in the first three months of the year, compared with last year’s final quarter, as bad weather depressed shopping and Americans took a breather after healthy spending over the winter holidays. The nation’s economy actually shrank 0.3% in the January-March quarter as imports surged as companies sought to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs.

    "article_text": "The US economy shrank at a 0.3 percent annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump’s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump imposed massive tariffs. The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4 percent gain in the last three months of 2024. Imports grew at a 41 percent pace, fastest since 2020, and shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply — to 1.8 percent growth from 4 percent in October-December last year. Federal government spending plunged 5.1 percent in the first quarter. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet had, on average, expected the economy to eke out 0.8 percent growth in the first quarter, but many expected GDP to fall. Financial markets sank on the report. The Dow Jones tumbled 400 points at the opening bell shortly after the GDP numbers were released. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite fell 2 percent. Advertisement The surge in imports — fastest since 1972 outside COVID-19 economic disruptions — is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing a weight on GDP. For that reason, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics forecasts that April-June growth will rebound to a 2 percent gain. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that’s mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what’s produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Swiss chocolates — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. And other aspects of Wednesday’s GDP report suggested that the economy looked solid at the start of the year. A category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 3 percent annual rate from January through March, up from 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Advertisement Still, many economists say that Trump’s massive import taxes — the erratic way he’s rolled them out — will hurt growth in the second half of the year and that recession risks are rising. “We think the downturn of the economy will get worse in the second half of this year,’’ wrote Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. ”Corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes — tariffs are a tax on imports — will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.’’ Wednesday’s report also showed an increase in prices that is likely to worry the Federal Reserve which is still trying to cool inflation after a severe pandemic run-up. The Fed’s favored inflation gauge – the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index – rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, up from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PC inflation registered 3.5 percent, compared with 2.6 percent from October-December. The central bank wants to see inflation at 2 percent. The first-quarter GDP numbers “highlight the bind that the Federal Reserve is in,” Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a commentary. The Fed must weigh whether to cut interest rates to support economic growth or leave rates high because of elevated inflation. “The economy was essentially stagnant in the first three months of the year while growth in headline and core inflation accelerated, fanning concerns of stagflation.’’ Trump inherited a solid economy that had grown steadily despite high interest rates imposed by the Fed in 2022 and 2023 to fight inflation. His erratic trade policies — including 145 percent tariffs on China — have paralyzed businesses and threatened to raise prices and hurt consumers. Advertisement Democrats were quick to blame Trump for disrupting several years of solid economic growth. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said: “100 days into his presidency, Donald Trump’s red-light, green-light tariffs are shrinking our economy, with businesses stockpiling imports in anticipation of tariff doomsday.″ There is potential evidence emerging that the solid job market, a pillar of the US economy during the pandemic recession, may be weakening. On Wednesday, payroll provider ADP reported that companies added just 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was expected, and down from 147,000 in March. That could be a signal that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring amid uncertainty over tariffs. Still, the ADP figures often diverge from the government’s jobs reports, which arrive Friday. Employers in the education and health, information technology, and business and professional services industries all cut jobs. Business and professional services include sectors such as engineering, accounting and advertising. “Unease is the word of the day,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “It can be difficult to make hiring decisions in such an environment.”"

    "article_text": "FILE – Shipping containers are seen ready for transport at the Guangzhou Port in the Nansha district in southern China’s Guangdong province, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 30, 2025 at 9:02 AM EDT | UPDATED: April 30, 2025 at 10:08 AM EDT By PAUL WISEMAN and CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, Associated Press Economics Writers The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March, the first drop in three years, as President Donald Trump’s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump imposed massive tariffs . The January-March drop in gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — reversed a 2.4% gain in the last three months of 2024. Imports grew at a 41% pace, fastest since 2020, and shaved 5 percentage points off first-quarter growth. Consumer spending also slowed sharply — to 1.8% growth from 4% in October-December last year. Federal government spending plunged 5.1% in the first quarter. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet had, on average, expected the economy to eke out 0.8% growth in the first quarter, but many expected GDP to fall. Financial markets sank on the report. The Dow Jones tumbled 400 points at the opening bell shortly after the GDP numbers were released. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5% and the Nasdaq composite fell 2%. The surge in imports — fastest since 1972 outside COVID-19 economic disruptions — is likely to reverse in the second quarter, removing a weight on GDP. For that reason, Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics forecasts that April-June growth will rebound to a 2% gain. Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that’s mainly a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what’s produced domestically. So imports — which the government counts as consumer spending in the GDP report when you buy, say, Swiss chocolates — have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production. And other aspects of Wednesday’s GDP report suggested that the economy looked solid at the start of the year. A category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 3% annual rate from January through March, up from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Still, many economists say that Trump’s massive import taxes — the erratic way he’s rolled them out — will hurt growth in the second half of the year and that recession risks are rising. “We think the downturn of the economy will get worse in the second half of this year,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “Corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes — tariffs are a tax on imports — will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.” Wednesday’s report also showed an increase in prices that is likely to worry the Federal Reserve which is still trying to cool inflation after a severe pandemic run-up. The Fed’s favored inflation gauge – the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index – rose at an annual rate of 3.6%, up from 2.4% in the fourth quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PC inflation registered 3.5%, compared with 2.6% from October-December. The central bank wants to see inflation at 2%. The first-quarter GDP numbers “highlight the bind that the Federal Reserve is in,” Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a commentary. The Fed must weigh whether to cut interest rates to support economic growth or leave rates high because of elevated inflation. “The economy was essentially stagnant in the first three months of the year while growth in headline and core inflation accelerated, fanning concerns of stagflation.’’ Trump inherited a solid economy that had grown steadily despite high interest rates imposed by the Fed in 2022 and 2023 to fight inflation. His erratic trade policies — including 145% tariffs on China — have paralyzed businesses and threatened to raise prices and hurt consumers. Democrats were quick to blame Trump for disrupting several years of solid economic growth. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said: “100 days into his presidency, Donald Trump’s red-light, green-light tariffs are shrinking our economy, with businesses stockpiling imports in anticipation of tariff doomsday.″ There is potential evidence emerging that the solid job market, a pillar of the U.S. economy during the pandemic recession, may be weakening. On Wednesday, payroll provider ADP reported that companies added just 62,000 jobs in April, about half of what was expected, and down from 147,000 in March. That could be a signal that businesses may be taking a more cautious approach to hiring amid uncertainty over tariffs. Still, the ADP figures often diverge from the government’s jobs reports, which arrive Friday. Employers in the education and health, information technology, and business and professional services industries all cut jobs. Business and professional services include sectors such as engineering, accounting and advertising. “Unease is the word of the day,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “It can be difficult to make hiring decisions in such an environment.” Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X RevContent Feed"

    "article_text": "April 29 (UPI) -- A global trade war and inflation concerns have caused U.S. consumer confidence to reach its lowest level since May 2020, according to The Confidence Board. The board's latest consumer confidence index dropped 7.9 points to 86 in April after declining over the past five months. \"Consumer confidence declined ... to levels not seen since the onset of the COVID pandemic,\" said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board. \"The decline was largely driven by consumers' expectations,\" Guichard said. Related China reportedly exempts some U.S. semiconductors from tariffs Analysis: South Korea struggles with Trump tariffs, expects economic slowdown WTO warns Trump's tariffs risk reshaping global trade into 2 rival blocs \"The three expectation components -- business conditions, employment prospects and future income -- all deteriorated sharply, reflecting pervasive pessimism about the future.\" The decline in consumer confidence fell the most among those between ages 35 and 55 and among consumers whose households annually earn more than $125,000 in combined income. People of all political affiliations shared the decline in consumer confidence. The nation's expectations index declined at a faster rate after dropping 12.5 points to 54.4, which is the lowest since October 2011. The current level is significantly lower than the 80-point threshold that The Confidence Board says indicates a recession lies ahead. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the nation's economic output, CNN reported. President Donald Trump 's tariffs policy and subsequent trade wars have raised alarm among consumers and Wall Street investors. Consumer pessimism could lead to reduced spending, which could negatively affect stock markets, business profits and employment levels. \"There's lots of reasons to be worried about consumer spending,\" Richmond (Va.) Federal Reserve President Thomas Birkin told media and others last week. \"Consumer sentiment has dropped ... pretty significantly over the last couple months,\" Birkin said, \"and consumers seem to be more worried about inflation and worried about losing their jobs.\" The Confidence Board was founded in 1916 and is an independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank focused on delivering insights that help its members make meaningful changes to better serve society through sustainable capitalism."

Payments volume -- a gauge of overall consumer and business spending on Visa's network -- jumped 8% in the second quarter, while revenue rose 9% to $9.6 billion. U.S. consumer spending remained resilient during the period on strong wage growth and low unemployment rates but tariff-related inflationary expectations and growth worries have now weighed on consumer sentiment. \"While we are certainly not immune to macroeconomic impacts, our incredibly diverse business model has proven to be resilient in the face of a variety of environments, most recently in second-quarter, and we see this resilience playing out in our financial outlook,\" CEO Ryan Mclnerney said in a call. American Express , which generally caters to affluent customers, also beat estimates for profit earlier in the month. Mastercard is set to report its quarterly earnings later in the week. Visa's shares were up 1% in trading after the bell. They have climbed more than 8% so far this year, outperforming Mastercard's 2.5% gain and American Express' 10% decline. Visa also strengthened its annual net revenue growth forecast to low double-digit from high single-digits to low double-digits expectation earlier. The Street was expecting a 10% growth, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company's fresh repurchase program was higher than its $25 billion buyback announced in 2023. The company posted an adjusted profit of $5.4 billion, or $2.76 per share, in the three months ended March 31. That compared with $5.1 billion, or $2.51 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected an adjusted profit of $2.68 per share. (Reporting by Pritam Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) By Pritam Biswas © Reuters - 2025 Share"

Carlsberg: Britvic brands support otherwise soft quarter Published: 03:54 29 Apr 2025 EDT Carlsberg, despite ‘decent at first glance' metrics, saw a soft start to 2025 dampened by subdued consumer spending. Volumes and revenue were up, 14% and 17% respectively, albeit driven by the acquired Britvic soft-drink brands, whilst the beer segment was weaker versus prior comparatives following the ending of Carlsberg’s licensing and distribution deal for San Miguel. Excluding San Miguel, organic revenue was flat. Growth was seen in premium beer, alcohol-free brews, and Beyond Beer, whilst Carlsberg’s international brands like Tuborg and Brooklyn Beer grew 3% and 10% respectively. The Britvic brands – including Robinsons, R Whites, Tango, J2O, Lipton, plus regional distribution for the likes of Pepsi Max and Mountain Dew – accounted for some 4.7 million hectolitres of volume, or around £340 million (DKK 3 billion) of revenue since the acquisition date in mid-January. “It was a soft start to the year, impacted by the loss of the San Miguel brand and continued subdued consumer spending in an environment with increased macroeconomic volatility,” Carlsberg CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen said. He added: “The Britvic transaction and refinancing were completed in Q1, with the integration starting immediately. “We’re encouraged by the Q1 performance in the UK and Ireland and the strength of the business. “We remain confident in the long-term value creation from this acquisition.” Continue reading"

    "article_text": "Consumer spending expected to remain strong in 2025 The average Malaysian household’s purchasing power in 2025 is expected to be about 8% higher than the 2019 level. (Bernama pic) PETALING JAYA : Malaysian consumer spending is expected to remain strong in 2025 underpinned by a low inflationary environment and a stable labour market, says a Fitch Solutions unit. In a report, BMI Country Risk & Industry Research (BMI) said a strong Malaysian labour market and easing inflation are raising wages in real terms, which has filtered into the disposable incomes of Malaysian households. BMI said Malaysians’ earnings would grow by an average of 3.3% year-on-year, and the average Malaysian household would have a purchasing power about 8% higher than the 2019 level, with a continuously improving trajectory over the medium term to 2029. “Overall, we forecast household spending to grow by 5.2% y-o-y over 2025, in real terms, to a value of RM943.7 billion, up from RM896.9 billion in 2024,” it said. “As a result, household spending has returned to pre-Covid levels of growth, where it grew at a real average rate of 5.2% y-o-y during the 2015-2019 period.” BMI also noted that inflation is forecast to average 2.4% in 2025, which remains low enough to support household purchasing power. It also pointed out that the unemployment rate in Malaysia remained stable at a multi-year low of 3.1% in February, underpinning consumer confidence. BMI forecast unemployment to average 3.1% for the year, supported by foreign investment and tourism. However, BMI said consumer spending would continue to be restrained by Malaysian consumers’ high levels of indebtedness and the correspondingly high debt servicing costs. It said high debt levels leave Malaysian households vulnerable to elevated interest rates, requiring consumers to allocate more of their budgets to debt repayments for longer and constraining their ability to spend on other goods and services. It also forecast the ringgit to strengthen slightly against the US dollar from RM4.6 per US dollar last year to RM4.5 per US dollar this year. Noting that the country remains heavily reliant on imports to meet local demand, it said that the strengthening of the exchange rate means that Malaysian consumers will benefit from cheaper imports.

    "article_text": "Hudson’s Bay Extends Liquidation to Entire Fleet David Moin April 25, 2025 3 min read After triggering liquidations at 86 locations across Canada, the Hudson’s Bay Co. has decided to liquidate its remaining six Hudson’s Bay stores and one Saks Fifth Avenue location. The company had been seeking a buyer for the six stores, but on Friday said it believed that a viable bid for the current six-store model is unlikely, and therefore liquidation sales in those stores began Friday. Should an 11th-hour bid surface, the six stores could stop liquidating. More from WWD What Pulled Hudson's Bay Underwater Canada's Hudson's Bay Forced to Liquidate Unless Last-minute Financing Can Be Found Hudson's Bay in Canada Files for Bankruptcy Protection, Initiates Restructuring Proceedings A company called Reflect Advisors continues to solicit interest in parts of Hudson’s Bay , including certain properties and other assets, as well as a refinancing of all or a portion of the business of the company. But the deadline for these submissions is Wednesday, leaving little hope for Hudson’s Bay to live on, even as a sliver of what it once was. The 73 other Hudson’s Bay, 13 Saks Off 5th and two Saks Fifth Avenue locations began liquidation sales last month, as reported by WWD . The closure of Hudson’s Bay, given that it operated 79 stores across Canada — including some huge downtown locations in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal — dramatically alters the country’s retail landscape and put thousands of people out of work. Hudson’s Bay employs 9,364 people. The venerable retailer, considered the oldest company in North America having been founded in 1670, originally as a trading company, was dragged down by more than 1 billion Canadian dollars in debt, a weak consumer economy and an inability to pay bills. Its first department store opened in 1881 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Past talks to secure financing fell apart. Over the years a handful of retail companies and private equity players considered buying Hudson’s Bay, but they reconsidered after examining the books. Still, Hudson’s Bay’s business had been floundering for years, even before Richard Baker’s NRDC firm took control of the Toronto-based department store chain. However, under Baker’s 17 years of control there has been a revolving door of senior leadership, flip-flopping strategies and the abdication of market share as well as some lucrative monetization of retail real estate. Retail experts saw a lack of investment in the stores, diminishing service levels and deteriorating physical conditions, like malfunctioning escalators and water damage in certain locations. The Hudson’s Bay and Saks Fifth Avenue stores in Canada are expected to operate no later than June 15, although some might close earlier. Additionally, nine Saks Off 5th stores will close Sunday. Through a licensing agreement, three Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off 5th locations have been operating in Canada. Story Continues Hudson’s Bay was severed from Saks Global late last year. It is a separate company from Saks Global, which operates Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th, and which has also been late paying bills. But both businesses are under Baker’s control. Currently, Hudson’s Bay stores are offering 40 to 70 percent discounts storewide, depending on the category. Saks Fifth Avenue in Canada is offering up to 30 percent off storewide, and Saks Off 5th is offering 40 to 60 percent off its lowest ticketed prices. Select luxury brands and the HBC Stripes Collection are not being discounted. In addition, select store fixtures, furnishings and equipment will soon be available for purchase at participating locations. “Hudson’s Bay extends its sincerest gratitude to its dedicated associates and loyal customers for their overwhelming support over the years and throughout this chapter,” the company said in a statement Friday.

Its first department store opened in 1881 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Past talks to secure financing fell apart. Over the years a handful of retail companies and private equity players considered buying Hudson’s Bay, but they reconsidered after examining the books. Still, Hudson’s Bay’s business had been floundering for years, even before Richard Baker’s NRDC firm took control of the Toronto-based department store chain. However, under Baker’s 17 years of control there has been a revolving door of senior leadership, flip-flopping strategies and the abdication of market share as well as some lucrative monetization of retail real estate. Retail experts saw a lack of investment in the stores, diminishing service levels and deteriorating physical conditions, like malfunctioning escalators and water damage in certain locations. The Hudson’s Bay and Saks Fifth Avenue stores in Canada are expected to operate no later than June 15, although some might close earlier. Additionally, nine Saks Off 5th stores will close Sunday. Through a licensing agreement, three Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off 5th locations have been operating in Canada. Hudson’s Bay was severed from Saks Global late last year. It is a separate company from Saks Global, which operates Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th, and which has also been late paying bills. But both businesses are under Baker’s control. Currently, Hudson’s Bay stores are offering 40 to 70 percent discounts storewide, depending on the category. Saks Fifth Avenue in Canada is offering up to 30 percent off storewide, and Saks Off 5th is offering 40 to 60 percent off its lowest ticketed prices. Select luxury brands and the HBC Stripes Collection are not being discounted. In addition, select store fixtures, furnishings and equipment will soon be available for purchase at participating locations. “Hudson’s Bay extends its sincerest gratitude to its dedicated associates and loyal customers for their overwhelming support over the years and throughout this chapter,” the company said in a statement Friday.

    "article_text": "Updated / Friday, 25 Apr 2025 09:54 Retail sales volumes rose by 0.4% in March alone. British retailers reported the best start to the year since 2021 in what may be a fleeting boost for the economy, with rising bills and the US trade war increasingly weighing on consumer morale. Retail sales volumes rose by 0.4% in March alone, after downwardly revised growth of 0.7% in February, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a month-on-month fall of 0.4%. For the first quarter as a whole, retail sales rose by 1.6% - the strongest reading in four years, and providing a 0.08 percentage point boost to overall economic output for the quarter. That may prove to be a high watermark for Britain's consumer economy for the foreseeable future. Earlier on Friday, a closely-watched gauge of British consumer confidence fell in April to its lowest level since late 2023. Market research firm GfK cited rising household energy bills and turbulent global financial markets as reasons for the drop. \"Retailers face an uphill battle to protect margins, sustain investment, and navigate an increasingly complex trading environment,\" said Nicholas Found, head of commercial content at consultancy Retail Economics. \"The outlook is clouded further by uncertainty around U.S. trade tariffs, which has the potential to disrupt shipments if orders are cancelled and routes impacted.\" On Thursday Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he was focused on an expected shock to growth from US President Donald Trump's import tariffs and retaliatory measures by other countries. Some of Bailey's BoE colleagues say the trade war could prove to be disinflationary. Clothing and outdoor retail chains said good weather helped sales last month, although supermarkets struggled, the ONS said. The outlook for the rest of the year looks tougher, with household energy bills on the rise and financial markets in turmoil because of the trade war. Outlook statements this month from major British retailers have been downbeat. Tesco and Sainsbury's, the country's two biggest food retailers, warned profit growth was unlikely this year amid a potential price war. Sportswear retailer JD Sports forecast little or no growth even before any potential impact from US tariffs. More stories on News Business Uk Economy"

    "article_text": "FMCG 3 min read Tariff turmoil: What P&G, Pepsi and other companies are saying about tariffs Companies are grappling with the impact of tariffs, leading to revised financial outlooks and consumer spending adjustments. Procter & Gamble anticipates price hikes, while PepsiCo lowered earnings expectations due to tariff-related costs. Merck also trimmed its forecast, and American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast amid economic uncertainty. AP Updated On Apr 25, 2025 at 08:20 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead. Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales. Advt A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are \"extremely\" or \"very\" concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance Here's what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact: Procter & Gamble Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it's doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties. But P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July. The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates. \"Everything plays into the consumer behavior,\" Schulten said. \"Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.\" Advt Pepsi PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending. The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth. A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects \"elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty\" for the rest of this year. Merck Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue. The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about USD 200 million. American Airlines American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy. While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel. Southwest Airlines Southwest Airlines is trimming its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given \"current macroeconomic uncertainty.\" Dow Chemical company Dow expects to see delays in purchases from businesses and consumers amid tariff-driven economic uncertainty. \"Markets worldwide are awaiting additional clarity into how the tariff and global trade negotiations will land,\" said CEO Jim Fitterling, in a statement. The company is delaying construction of a facility in Alberta, Canada and expects capital expense savings of about USD 1 billion from that decision. It is also expanding an ongoing review of its assets in Europe, including facilities in Germany and the U.K. AP Published On Apr 25, 2025 at 08:16 AM IST See more on: Tariffs impact on companies , U.S. tariffs effects , consumer spending tariffs , Procter & Gamble earnings report , cost of groceries increasing Telegram Facebook Copy Link Comments What are your thoughts?

FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP Pervasive uncertainty due to tariffs is increasing costs for US businesses and consumers, leading to a rush to buy inventory and a gloomy outlook for the future, according to the Fed's first economic survey since late February, when US President Donald Trump began imposing duties on other countries. The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday released its latest edition of the Beige Book to summarize economic conditions and prospects based on a variety of mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from its 12 regional districts. The April 2025 report, based on surveys conducted since February, noted that \"uncertainty around international trade policy was pervasive across reports\", contributing to a weakening economic outlook and dampened business confidence nationwide. It said the \"outlook in several districts worsened considerably as economic uncertainty, particularly surrounding tariffs, rose\". The findings echoed the gloomy forecast of the International Monetary Fund, which cut the US economic growth projection for this year by 0.9 percentage points from its January forecast, with nearly half of that downgrade directly attributable to new tariffs. The looming threat of new tariffs has already begun to alter consumer behavior and business operations. A common theme throughout the Fed report is a \"rush to purchase ahead of tariff-related price increases\", particularly evident in vehicle and nondurable goods sales. For example, in reporting ports and transportation activities, the Fed's Richmond District noted that \"imports for autos and some retail goods increased as orders were placed to get ahead of potential tariffs\", while loaded exports were down significantly, with one port noting an \"unexpected and disappointing\" 25 percent decline month over month. \"Port contacts were particularly concerned about the proposed port call tax on Chinese vessels which, by their estimates, could quadruple cargo handling costs,\" it said. Some ports received multimillion-dollar tariff bills on Chinese cranes that were already ordered and en route as tariffs were enacted and are now subject to the tariff, it added. However, the short-term boost in purchasing was not enough to offset a broader pullback in consumer spending and investment, as \"most districts saw lower non-auto consumer spending\". Business leaders across sectors cited elevated input costs, supplier notices of price hikes and \"firms reported adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons to account for uncertain trade policy\", according to the Beige Book. Significant concern In the Fed's New York District, economic activity contracted modestly, as heightened uncertainty weighed on businesses and consumers. \"Businesses expressed significant concern about tariffs. Outlook darkened, with many businesses anticipating declining activity and rising prices,\" the New York Fed said. This was also the case in the Kansas City District, where expectations about business activity and consumer spending weakened considerably, and prospects of price growth rose at a robust rate, most pronounced in goods sectors. In the manufacturing sector, often at the front line of trade tensions, conditions were described as \"mixed\", with two-thirds of districts indicating either stagnant or declining activity, and several districts seeing a deterioration in demand for nonfinancial services, according to the Beige Book. The Beige Book is published eight times a year. On Wednesday, a coalition of 12 states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that recent tariffs constitute unauthorized tax increases on US citizens. \"Congress has not granted the president the authority to impose these tariffs and therefore the administration violated the law by imposing them through executive orders, social media posts, and agency orders,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said in a statement. In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai called the legal action a \"witch hunt\". Also on Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he believes that excessively high tariffs between the US and China will have to come down before trade negotiations can proceed, Reuters reported. Ryan Petersen, CEO of digital freight forwarder Flexport, took to X on Wednesday to issue stark warnings about the impact of tariffs on the industry. \"In the 3 weeks since the tariffs took effect, ocean container bookings from China to the United States are down over 60% industry-wide,\" he wrote. If the tariffs on China continue at this level, the US will see \"a $2 trillion hit to economic activity in our country, the failure of tens of thousands of American businesses, and the laying off of millions of employees,\" Petersen wrote. huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com Photos 140 dead in monsoon disasters in Nepal Jakarta faces shortage to accommodate the dead Beyond family Ballet Rambert plans centenary tour in China Africa Tech Festival kicks off in South Africa with focus on inclusive digital future Film traces US writers' steps in wartime China Most Viewed in 24 Hours World in Focus ICE in hot water Across Asia + Jakarta faces shortage to accommodate the dead Beyond family Special Coverage + Grow with SCO Live: Middle East truce stands amid claims of victory Friends Afar + Dive into the old world of Chinese martial arts Ties That Bind + Vital pass to boost China-Pakistan trade Top BACK TO THE TOP English 中文 HOME CHINA WORLD BUSINESS LIFESTYLE CULTURE TRAVEL VIDEO SPORTS OPINION REGIONAL NEWSPAPER China Daily PDF China Daily E-paper MOBILE Copyright 1995 - .

TROISE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead. Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales. A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance Here’s what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact: Procter & Gamble Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it’s doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump’s expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties. But P&G’s Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July. The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates. “Everything plays into the consumer behavior,” Schulten said. “Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.” Pepsi PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations , citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending. The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth. A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects “elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty” for the rest of this year. Merck Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue. The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million. American Airlines American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy. While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel. Southwest Airlines Southwest Airlines is trimming its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given “current macroeconomic uncertainty.” Dow Chemical company Dow expects to see delays in purchases from businesses and consumers amid tariff-driven economic uncertainty. “Markets worldwide are awaiting additional clarity into how the tariff and global trade negotiations will land,” said CEO Jim Fitterling, in a statement. The company is delaying construction of a facility in Alberta, Canada and expects capital expense savings of about $1 billion from that decision. It is also expanding an ongoing review of its assets in Europe, including facilities in Germany and the U.K. Associated Press writers Dee-Ann Durbin, Anne D’Innocenzio, and Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Money Investing European Retailers’ View Of U.S. Tariff Turmoil: This Too Shall Pass By Greg Petro , Contributor. Follow Author Apr 24, 2025, 03:18pm EDT Share Save Comment European Retailers’ View of US Tariff Turmoil: This Too Shall Pass MikeShots on Envato On a recent visit, there was little of the hand-wringing and doomsaying expressed by many U.S. retailers. Are Americans overreacting? On a recent business trip to the U.K. and Eurozone, I was struck by the apparent nonchalance of retail industry executives there about the U.S. tariff crisis when, here at home, the headlines have been reporting the story in near-apocalyptic terms. Is Europe somehow insulated from the fallout, or is there something else going on that we Americans are missing? Here at home, Wall Street forecasters are signaling the likelihood of a recession, economists are predicting a new round of inflation plus layoffs, and the National Retail Federation has warned of a bloodbath for small businesses (“Record-high tariffs threaten the American Dream”). It is a theme that has clearly spooked investors and one that U.S. retailers have so taken to heart that they have rushed to fill their distribution centers ahead of time, and have been scrambling to find new sources. Some companies didn’t even wait for the details of the new tariff policy. The day after the new administration was elected last November, Steve Madden, a fashion shoe brand, announced that it was shifting its product sourcing from China to Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, and Brazil. In contrast, most U.K. and European Union retail execs seem to view the squabble between the U.S., China, and its North American trading partners (Mexico and Canada) the way one might feel watching neighbors down the street who are engaged in a curbside shouting match over a property line or a parking spot. MORE FOR YOU “It’s important to note that these are predictions and not guarantees,” according to Carolyn Simpson, an executive with Anglo Scottish Finance, which specializes in asset funding. As quoted in a recent report on eubusinessnews.com , Simpson observed, “Self-reliance and the ability to adapt to change is the key to weathering any sudden change in the global economy. It’s important to remember that changes will continue to evolve over the coming term and that the best the U.K. can do is continue to play fair and focus on growth that benefits all.” Absent the unthinkable—the view from abroad begs a broader question: Can the retail industry that survived the pandemic survive a tariff war? The obvious answer—of course it can. Compared to an as-yet unresolved shouting match over tariffs, what could be worse for our consumer economy than what we experienced starting five years ago—a nearly complete shutdown of commerce, the shutdown of Asia’s workrooms and factories, plus a global supply chain logjam followed by an inventory glut and a huge surge in inflation? One of the conclusions that seems obvious from all of this is that American retailers and their customers have been spoiled by the benefits of cheap labor and materials abroad. For a long time U.S. retailers have been engaged in a competitive race to the bottom on pricing. It’s easy to forget, according to a CNBC analysis last year, that when adjusted for the buying power of a dollar, computers, televisions, and a lot more consumer products are as much as 50% cheaper today than they were 25 years ago. The average price of a gallon of gas, adjusted for inflation, is about what it was at the turn of the century. Meanwhile, Americans have enjoyed a cornucopia of affordable merchandise from apparel to hardware which, fueled by pandemic stimulus payments and unleashed the phenomenon known as revenge spending. The effects of all of these events and decisions has been an ongoing whiplash of spending and reactive nature of retailers to adjust. It is all very myopic. It seems for our European cousins, who have known hardship and economic suffering through two world wars, our tariff problem is mostly a bump in the long road of history, with a much longer-term view.

Even though spending is higher now, financial constraints coupled with expectations that the economy is weakening will cause consumers to cut back in the months ahead, experts predict. “That is a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" says Wharton's assistant professor of finance Sasha Indarte. watch now VIDEO 5:31 05:31 Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin: A lot of reasons to be worried about consumer spending Closing Bell While many Americans are worried about where the U.S. economy is heading, few have changed their spending habits in anticipation of a slowdown. Nearly three-quarters, or 73%, of adults said they are \"financially stressed,\" with most pointing to the tariff wars as the culprit, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll . And yet, consumer spending has remained remarkably resilient. In part because of looming tariffs, shoppers are panic buying . In fact, consumer spending was even stronger than expected in March, according to the Commerce Department and ticked up again in April, data released Wednesday from J.P. Morgan showed. J.P. Morgan also raised its odds for a U.S. and global recession to 60%, by year end, up from 40% previously. More from Personal Finance: Cash may feel safe when stocks slide, but it has risks What higher stagflation risks mean for your money Should investors dump U.S. stocks for international equities? Setting the stage for a slowdown Consumer spending is considered the backbone of the economy because it represents a significant portion of Gross Domestic Product and fuels economic growth. In a speech earlier this month before business journalists in Arlington, Va., Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said \"the economy is overwhelmingly driven by consumer spending.\" Powell also said that he expects President Donald Trump's tariff policies to raise inflation and lower growth. Most experts agree that in the face of higher prices for many consumer goods, Trump's tariffs are igniting a fresh wave of declining sentiment, which plays a big part in determining where the economy is headed. The Conference Boards' expectations index , which measures consumers' short-term outlook, plunged to its lowest level in 12 years and well below the recession threshold, signaling heightened recession risk. The University of Michigan's consumer survey also showed sentiment sank by more than 30% since December among persistent worries of a trade war. \"On-again, off-again rising tariffs and resulting turmoil in the stock market and world economy are clearly impacting consumer concerns about higher prices and future consumer spending growth,\" Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement. How tariffs impact household budgets The Trump administration's tariffs on a host of other countries are currently in the middle of a 90-day pause, with a 10% baseline tariff rate instead applying to all imported goods across the board. The pause is due to expire on July 9, with Trump touting a series of rate negotiations with foreign leaders between now and then. According to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, if the lower tariff rates in effect during the 90-day pause remain in effect permanently, it could reduce real income for the average taxpayer by about $3,100 in 2026 . A separate study by the Budget Lab at Yale estimates that tariffs could cost the average household roughly $3,800 per year. \"Household budgets remain under pressure and highly sensitive to further price increases,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \"Inflation will continue to be central to how consumers feel about their finances, and their capacity for additional spending.\" A looming drop off Financial constraints coupled with expectations that the economy is weakening will eventually cause consumers to spend less, which can cause businesses to cut back or lay off workers, according to Sasha Indarte, an assistant professor of finance at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"That is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"Even a small initial cutback in spending gets amplified,\" she said. \"One person's spending becomes another person's income — you can get this echo effect.\" But basic economic theories don't tell the whole story, Indarte added. Even when consumers intend to cut back, they don't always scale back their spending as much as they want to, or should. Behavioral biases and inertia also play a role, according to Indarte. \"Even when our environment is changing, we are happy doing what we used to be doing. People are used to going to the same restaurants, or driving the same car, we aren't used to making adjustments,\" she said. \"There's a preference for sameness.\" However, once household budgets reach their limits, consumers will no longer be able to afford the lifestyle they were accustomed to — that's \"when the shock materializes,\" she said. At that point, consumers will have to reign in their spending, whether they want to or not, she said, which could lead to an economic drop-off in the months ahead. That prediction was also recently shared by JPMorgan analysts in a research note on Wednesday and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee on Sunday. \"We should be worried,\" Indarte said.

Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it’s doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump’s expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties. But P&G’s Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July. The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates.

Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.” PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending. The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth. A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects “elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty” for the rest of this year. Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue. The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million. American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy. While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news Consumers continue to spend even as trade wars raise recession risk By Jessica Dickler, CNBC • Published April 24, 2025 • Updated on April 24, 2025 at 10:15 am BOOKMARKER Rachel Wisniewski | Reuters While Americans are increasingly concerned about their financial standing, consumer spending has picked up. Even though spending is higher now, financial constraints coupled with expectations that the economy is weakening will cause consumers to cut back in the months ahead, experts predict. “That is a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" says Wharton's assistant professor of finance Sasha Indarte. Stream NBC 5 for free, 24/7, wherever you are. WATCH HERE While many Americans are worried about where the U.S. economy is heading, few have changed their spending habits in anticipation of a slowdown. Nearly three-quarters, or 73%, of adults said they are \"financially stressed,\" with most pointing to the tariff wars as the culprit, according to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll . And yet, consumer spending has remained remarkably resilient. In part because of looming tariffs, shoppers are panic buying . In fact, consumer spending was even stronger than expected in March, according to the Commerce Department and ticked up again in April, data released Wednesday from J.P. Morgan showed. J.P. Morgan also raised its odds for a U.S. and global recession to 60%, by year end, up from 40% previously. More from Personal Finance: Cash may feel safe when stocks slide, but it has risks What higher stagflation risks mean for your money Should investors dump U.S. stocks for international equities? Setting the stage for a slowdown Consumer spending is considered the backbone of the economy because it represents a significant portion of Gross Domestic Product and fuels economic growth. In a speech earlier this month before business journalists in Arlington, Va., Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said \"the economy is overwhelmingly driven by consumer spending.\" Powell also said that he expects President Donald Trump's tariff policies to raise inflation and lower growth. Most experts agree that in the face of higher prices for many consumer goods, Trump's tariffs are igniting a fresh wave of declining sentiment, which plays a big part in determining where the economy is headed. The Conference Boards' expectations index , which measures consumers' short-term outlook, plunged to its lowest level in 12 years and well below the recession threshold, signaling heightened recession risk. The University of Michigan's consumer survey also showed sentiment sank by more than 30% since December among persistent worries of a trade war. \"On-again, off-again rising tariffs and resulting turmoil in the stock market and world economy are clearly impacting consumer concerns about higher prices and future consumer spending growth,\" Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement. How tariffs impact household budgets The Trump administration's tariffs on a host of other countries are currently in the middle of a 90-day pause, with a 10% baseline tariff rate instead applying to all imported goods across the board. The pause is due to expire on July 9, with Trump touting a series of rate negotiations with foreign leaders between now and then. According to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, if the lower tariff rates in effect during the 90-day pause remain in effect permanently, it could reduce real income for the average taxpayer by about $3,100 in 2026 . A separate study by the Budget Lab at Yale estimates that tariffs could cost the average household roughly $3,800 per year. \"Household budgets remain under pressure and highly sensitive to further price increases,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \"Inflation will continue to be central to how consumers feel about their finances, and their capacity for additional spending.\" A looming drop off Financial constraints coupled with expectations that the economy is weakening will eventually cause consumers to spend less, which can cause businesses to cut back or lay off workers, according to Sasha Indarte, an assistant professor of finance at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"That is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \"Even a small initial cutback in spending gets amplified,\" she said. \"One person's spending becomes another person's income — you can get this echo effect.\" But basic economic theories don't tell the whole story, Indarte added. Even when consumers intend to cut back, they don't always scale back their spending as much as they want to, or should. Behavioral biases and inertia also play a role, according to Indarte. \"Even when our environment is changing, we are happy doing what we used to be doing. People are used to going to the same restaurants, or driving the same car, we aren't used to making adjustments,\" she said. \"There's a preference for sameness.\" However, once household budgets reach their limits, consumers will no longer be able to afford the lifestyle they were accustomed to — that's \"when the shock materializes,\" she said. At that point, consumers will have to reign in their spending, whether they want to or not, she said, which could lead to an economic drop-off in the months ahead. That prediction was also recently shared by JPMorgan analysts in a research note on Wednesday and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee on Sunday. \"We should be worried,\" Indarte said.

Procter & Gamble Co. reports financial earns on Oct. 22, 2019. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 24, 2025 at 10:46 AM EDT | UPDATED: April 24, 2025 at 12:30 PM EDT By DAMIAN J. TROISE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead. Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales. Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales. A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance Here’s what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact: Procter & Gamble Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it’s doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump’s expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties.

Southwest Airlines Southwest Airlines is trimming its flight schedule for the second half of the year due to lower demand. The company also said it could not reaffirm its 2025 and 2026 outlooks for earnings before interest and taxes, given “current macroeconomic uncertainty.” Dow Chemical company Dow expects to see delays in purchases from businesses and consumers amid tariff-driven economic uncertainty. “Markets worldwide are awaiting additional clarity into how the tariff and global trade negotiations will land,” said CEO Jim Fitterling, in a statement. The company is delaying construction of a facility in Alberta, Canada and expects capital expense savings of about $1 billion from that decision. It is also expanding an ongoing review of its assets in Europe, including facilities in Germany and the U.K. Associated Press writers Dee-Ann Durbin, Anne D’Innocenzio, and Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Sales of new single-family homes surged in March, exceeding all economist forecasts and adding to a string of upside surprises in recent economic data. New home sales rose 7.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That figure not only beat the consensus estimate of 682,000 but also topped the entire range of economist forecasts, which ran from 650,000 to 700,000. February’s sales figure was also revised slightly higher, from 676,000 to 674,000. The jump in sales, driven largely by activity in the South, comes despite rising concerns about economic growth, elevated mortgage rates, and sliding consumer sentiment. It adds to a growing list of hard indicators—including strong employment and robust consumer spending—that point to ongoing resilience in the U.S. economy. The median sales price of new homes fell to $403,600, down 7.5 percent from a year earlier, reflecting increased supply at lower price points. This will be a relief to Trump administration policy-makers, who have been working on plans to make homes more affordable, especially to young families who make up the bulk of first time homebuyers. The average sales price was $497,700. Inventory ticked up to 503,000 homes for sale, the highest since 2007, representing 8.3 months of supply at the current sales pace. The data suggest continued strength in housing demand entering the spring selling season, challenging expectations that tighter credit conditions and higher interest rates would meaningfully dampen activity. The new home sales data follows a string of stronger-than-expected reports on jobs, durable goods, and consumer spending. Taken together, the indicators suggest that the real economy remains robust even as financial markets and forecasting models grow more cautious."

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news Chipotle is seeing a ‘slowdown' in consumer spending as 2025 gets off to a rough start By Amelia Lucas, CNBC • Published April 23, 2025 • Updated on April 23, 2025 at 6:01 pm BOOKMARKER Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images Chipotle missed first-quarter revenue estimates and said same-store sales dropped for the first time since 2020. CEO Scott Boatwright said the burrito chain saw a \"slowdown in consumer spending.\" Chipotle also lowered the top end of its same-store sales outlook for the year. Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue after its same-store sales declined for the first time since 2020. Executives cited both a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather as two of the factors that dampened demand for its burritos and bowls. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE The company also lowered the top end of its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth. Chipotle shares fell more than 2% in extended trading. The stock closed up 3.5% earlier on Wednesday. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 29 cents adjusted vs. 28 cents expected Revenue: $2.88 billion vs. $2.95 billion expected Net sales rose 6.4% to $2.88 billion. The chain's same-store sales fell 0.4% during the quarter, short of the 1.7% growth projected by StreetAccount estimates. Restaurant transactions fell 2.3% and were only partially offset by a 1.9% increase in average check. Customers started pulling back their spending in February because of economic uncertainty, CEO Scott Boatwright told analysts on the company's conference call. \"We could see this in our visitation study, where saving money because of concerns around the economy was the overwhelming reason consumers were reducing the frequency of restaurant visits,\" he said, adding that the traffic slowdown has continued into April. The spring months typically kick off what Chipotle calls \"burrito season\" — the busiest time of the year for the chain, from Easter through May. But the holiday landed several weeks later this year, delaying the usual seasonal increase in demand, although the limited-time launch of its chipotle honey chicken helped sales in March. Chipotle's sales usually slow during the summer months as college students return home and many customers travel internationally. The company does not expect traffic to its restaurants to grow until the second half of the year. \"I am confident that we have a strong plan to return to positive transaction comps by the second half of the year, and during these uncertain times, we will continue to invest in the things that make Chipotle a special brand — our people, culinary, value proposition, innovation and growth,\" Boatwright said in a statement. For the full year, Chipotle is now projecting same-store sales will grow by low single digits. Previously, it was forecasting same-store sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range. \"Looking forward, our marketing team has an enhanced plan for this summer and the remainder of the year to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved,\" Boatwright said. Chipotle is also projecting higher inflation in the second quarter, fueled by the White House's tariffs on aluminum and a broad 10% import duty. Roughly half the company's avocado supply comes from outside of Mexico, for example. Chipotle Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer estimated that tariffs will add 50 basis points, or 0.5%, to its cost of sales on an ongoing basis. In the second quarter, the tariffs are expected to hit its cost of sales by 20 basis points, or 0.2%, due to the company's inventory before the duties were implemented. \"These estimates do not include any impact from the tariffs that were postponed, or the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada since our imports fall under the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement] exemption,\" Rymer said. The company reiterated its plans to open between 315 and 345 new restaurants by the end of 2025. Chipotle reported first-quarter net income of $386.6 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $359.3 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation grants tied to its recent CEO transition, the company earned 29 cents per share.

CEO Scott Boatwright said the burrito chain saw a \"slowdown in consumer spending.\" Chipotle also lowered the top end of its same-store sales outlook for the year. Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue after its same-store sales declined for the first time since 2020. Stream Philadelphia News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC10. WATCH HERE Executives cited both a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather as two of the factors that dampened demand for its burritos and bowls. The company also lowered the top end of its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth. Chipotle shares fell more than 2% in extended trading. The stock closed up 3.5% earlier on Wednesday. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 29 cents adjusted vs. 28 cents expected Revenue: $2.88 billion vs. $2.95 billion expected Net sales rose 6.4% to $2.88 billion. The chain's same-store sales fell 0.4% during the quarter, short of the 1.7% growth projected by StreetAccount estimates. Restaurant transactions fell 2.3% and were only partially offset by a 1.9% increase in average check. Customers started pulling back their spending in February because of economic uncertainty, CEO Scott Boatwright told analysts on the company's conference call. \"We could see this in our visitation study, where saving money because of concerns around the economy was the overwhelming reason consumers were reducing the frequency of restaurant visits,\" he said, adding that the traffic slowdown has continued into April. The spring months typically kick off what Chipotle calls \"burrito season\" — the busiest time of the year for the chain, from Easter through May. But the holiday landed several weeks later this year, delaying the usual seasonal increase in demand, although the limited-time launch of its chipotle honey chicken helped sales in March. Chipotle's sales usually slow during the summer months as college students return home and many customers travel internationally. The company does not expect traffic to its restaurants to grow until the second half of the year. \"I am confident that we have a strong plan to return to positive transaction comps by the second half of the year, and during these uncertain times, we will continue to invest in the things that make Chipotle a special brand — our people, culinary, value proposition, innovation and growth,\" Boatwright said in a statement. For the full year, Chipotle is now projecting same-store sales will grow by low single digits. Previously, it was forecasting same-store sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range. \"Looking forward, our marketing team has an enhanced plan for this summer and the remainder of the year to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved,\" Boatwright said. Chipotle is also projecting higher inflation in the second quarter, fueled by the White House's tariffs on aluminum and a broad 10% import duty. Roughly half the company's avocado supply comes from outside of Mexico, for example. Chipotle Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer estimated that tariffs will add 50 basis points, or 0.5%, to its cost of sales on an ongoing basis. In the second quarter, the tariffs are expected to hit its cost of sales by 20 basis points, or 0.2%, due to the company's inventory before the duties were implemented. \"These estimates do not include any impact from the tariffs that were postponed, or the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada since our imports fall under the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement] exemption,\" Rymer said. The company reiterated its plans to open between 315 and 345 new restaurants by the end of 2025. Chipotle reported first-quarter net income of $386.6 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $359.3 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation grants tied to its recent CEO transition, the company earned 29 cents per share.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) saw its price target cut by another analyst on Wednesday, marking the thirteenth price target reduction for the stock since President Donald Trump announced his tariff policies on April 2. Expert Ideas : Analysts at Telsey Advisory Group slashed price expectations on Amazon stock from $275 to $235 based on concerns about increased costs and reduced consumer spending related to higher tariffs. Read Next: Apple And Meta Fined Nearly $800 Million For Violating European Union’s Digital Markets Act The analysts said they generally expect sales growth in the high single digits driven by an expanded product assortment, continued strong online spending, strong demand for AWS and benefits from Amazon's faster fulfillment. However, the \"wild card\" remains uncertainty related to the impact of Trump's tariffs, which could drive higher operating costs and lower consumer spending. Telsey analysts pointed to Amazon's significant first-party and third-party exposure to China, highlighting that many third-party sellers are also spending on advertising and fulfillment services. Telsey Advisory Group maintained an Outperform rating on Amazon stock, but lowered the price target based on a reduced EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x, down from 18x, to its estimated 2025 adjusted EBITDA of $163 billion. AMZN Stock Price Action: Amazon shares were up 5.43% at $182.58 on Wednesday, according to Benzinga Pro, amid a broad market rally after Trump signaled the potential of lowering tariffs on China.

    "article_text": "Attendees at the Lenovo Group Ltd. booth at the MWC Shanghai event in Shanghai, China, on Thursday, June 29, 2023. Trump has made exceptions on China tariffs for computers and popular consumer electronics. - Bloomberg WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said he plans to be \"very nice” to China in any trade talks and that tariffs will drop if the two countries can reach a deal, a sign he may be backing down from his tough stance on Beijing amid market volatility. \"It will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” Trump said Tuesday (April 22) in Washington, following earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the standoff was unsustainable. Trump added that \"we’re going to be very nice and they’re going to be very nice, and we’ll see what happens.” Trump also said he didn’t see the need to say he’d \"play hardball” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and that during discussions he wouldn’t raise Covid-19 - an issue that is very politically sensitive in Beijing. The White House recently launched a website that suggested the virus came from a lab in China, irking the nation’s diplomats. Trump’s comments come as US stocks and Treasuries have been battered since he rolled out sweeping tariffs on April 2, later announcing a 90-day reprieve for most nations. The 145 per cent duties Trump has placed on Chinese shipments this year remain in place, though he’s made exceptions for computers and popular consumer electronics. In response, China has been intensifying its outreach to third countries in recent weeks, even warning others not to strike trade deals with the US that hurt Beijing’s interests. During a meeting with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev on Wednesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated that tariff and trade wars undermine the rights and interests of all countries. Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his counterparts in the UK and Austria that China’s stance toward the US aims at not only \"safeguarding its own interests, but protecting international rules and multilateral trade system.” China’s premier, Li Qiang, reportedly wrote a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week, calling for a coordinated response to Trump’s tariffs.. \"Trump is panicking due to the markets plummeting and still very high US Treasury yields,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis. \"He needs a deal and quick. China does not need to offer anything big in such circumstances.” China hasn’t officially responded to Trump’s pledge to play \"nice” but the media outlet Cailian called it \"a sign that Trump is already softening stance on his signature tariff policies.” Trump \"chickening out” was among the top trending topics on China’s Weibo social media website on Wednesday. Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong rose on optimism that tensions with the US may soften, while the offshore yuan strengthened about 0.2 per cent versus the dollar. Beijing had indicated earlier this month that it wants to see a number of steps from the Trump administration before agreeing to any discussions, especially reining in disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet. Beijing had earlier expressed displeasure with comments Vice President J. D. Vance made about \"Chinese peasants,” with one diplomat calling them \"ignorant and disrespectful.” Bessent told a closed-door investor summit that the world’s two largest economies will have to find ways to de-escalate, which would come in the near future. Bessent also said that it was not the US’s goal to decouple from China, according to people who attended the session. Still, the Treasury chief said a comprehensive deal could take two to three years. He also reiterated his view that China has stifled its consumer economy and favoured manufacturing at the US’s expense, saying that any agreement would require a rebalancing of trade that allowed the US to increase manufacturing. Negotiations with China over such a deal haven’t started yet, he said. In recent days, Beijing has sent People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gonsheng, his deputy, Xuan Changneng, and Finance Minister Lan Fo’an to Washington, which this week will host meetings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund. That could create an opening for top Chinese and American officials to exchange views and open the door to trade talks. Also, one key member to the Chinese team that will negotiate with the Trump administration was likely put in place last week, when Li Chenggang was appointed vice commerce minister and trade envoy. Henry Wang Huiyao, founder of the Centre for China and Globalisation research group in Beijing, said Li’s appointment showed \"China is ready to talk.” He added that Trump’s latest comments signaled a \"more reasonable” tone. \"I’m sure this would get a response from China, so hopefully we’ll have a stabilising, cooling period and we can continue our relationship as normal as possible with President Trump,” Wang said. - Bloomberg Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

    "article_text": "Two Sharp with ET: Trump backs off Powell firing | IMF flags recession risk, cuts US growth forecast US President Donald Trump signalled a possible shift in his trade war with China on Tuesday, indicating that the steep tariffs imposed on Chinese imports may be significantly reduced if a deal is reached. This softer tone, following weeks of escalating measures and market turmoil, suggests the White House may be backing away from its earlier aggressive stance. “145% is very high and it won’t be that high,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “It won’t be anywhere near that high. It’ll come down substantially. But it won’t be zero.” He was referring to the effective tariff rate currently applied to many Chinese goods after a series of tit-for-tat hikes. A recent White House fact sheet had said China faces up to 245% tariff. However, this figure refers to the cumulative effect of multiple tariffs on specific products, such as electric vehicles and syringes, rather than a new, blanket 245 percent tariff imposed by the Trump administration. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he plans to be “very nice” to China in any trade talks and that tariffs will drop if the two countries can reach a deal, a sign he may be backing down from his tough stance on Beijing amid market volatility. “It will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” Trump said Tuesday in Washington, following earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the standoff was unsustainable.

Trade deal with China going to happen soon, says Donald Trump; here's how Americans and the world can benefit Responding to Trump’s recent comments on easing tariffs, China’s Foreign Ministry said the United States “can’t say it wants to reach an agreement with China and on the other hand keeps exerting extreme pressure.” The ministry said, “This is not the right way to deal with China and it is not feasible.” The ministry urged the US to conduct dialogue with China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, saying such an approach was necessary for any future trade deal to take shape. However, China said on Wednesday that it was open to holding trade talks with the United States, a day after Trump said the high tariffs he placed on Chinese goods would be reduced if a deal is made. The trade fight between the world’s two biggest economies has shaken markets and sparked worries about a global economic slowdown. \"We do not wish to fight, nor are we afraid of fighting,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun at a regular press conference, adding that China would \"fight to the end\", if necessary.

Bessent said at a private investment conference hosted by JP Morgan Chase that the trade war with China is unsustainable and he expects the battle to de-escalate in the very near future, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. Instead of a hard break or complete decoupling between the United States and China, Bessent told investors that the goal is to have a rebalancing of trade, the source told CNN.

Report says upward social mobility 'may never be as difficult' as scenario suggests Catharine Tunney · CBC News · Posted: Apr 22, 2025 7:03 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 22 Play Listen to this article Estimated 5 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre pointed to a government report that details a dire scenario for Canada in 2040 as reason to not vote for a fourth Liberal term. But the report's authors say the scenario isn't meant to be seen as a prediction for the future. (Laura Proctor/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre pounced on a government report that he argues predicts a \"terrifying\" world in 2040 to warn voters of the dangers of giving the Liberals a fourth term — but the actual report is far more nuanced. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Poilievre pointed to a policy report predicated on the idea that social mobility will severely decline in the coming decades as reason to not vote Liberal. \"The report paints a terrifying picture of a spiral of economic depression and cost inflation,\" Poilievre said after releasing his party's costed platform. \"What they are anticipating on the current trajectory is a total meltdown, a societal breakdown in Canada if we stay on the current track.\" The report is from Policy Horizons, billed as a foresight organization within the federal government which examines trends and possible future scenarios to help Ottawa build programs and policies \"that are more robust and resilient in the face of disruptive change on the horizon.\" Their report, entitled Future Lives: Social Mobility in Question, was released in January but has recently been making the rounds online framed as predicting a \"dystopia .\" Not only is the report far from that stark, its authors stress the document is not meant to be seen as predicting the future. Analysis Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre see very different threats to Canada Conservative platform banks on projected revenues to offset $106B in new measures Premised on the suggestion that downward social mobility \"might\" become the norm in the future, the report's authors lay out a scenario for 2040 \"in which most Canadians find themselves stuck in the socioeconomic conditions of their birth and many face the very real possibility of downward social mobility. \"Currently, most Canadians still believe that they have equality of opportunity,\" it said. \"This may change.\" The authors call the scenario \"neither the desired nor the preferred future,\" but one Policy Horizons suggests is plausible. In the scenario that sets up the report, by 2040 pursuing post-secondary education is no longer considered a reliable path to social mobility, people see inheritance as the only reliable way to get ahead, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many and the value of human labour has shrunk because of artificial intelligence (AI). People also rarely mix with others of different socio-economic status because \"algorithmic dating apps filter by class\" and \"gated metaverses\" offer few opportunities to meet people from different backgrounds. Struggles to afford bills, more powerful unions After laying out that scenario, the report's authors then ask readers to consider a range of policy-relevant implications — both positive and negative. For example, in that future more people may struggle to afford rent, bills or groceries and the resulting stress could worsen mental health challenges. \"In an effort to protect their mental health, some people might redefine success away from accumulating wealth and toward purposefulness or happiness,\" the report said. \"More people might be willing to job-hop for better work-life balance or more meaningful work.\" The report from the government agency says property ownership may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the goal of buying single-family dwellings. (Robson Fletcher/CBC) In that 2040 scenario, the Canadian economy may shrink or become less predictable. The report suggests property ownership may become even more concentrated if younger generations cast aside the goal of buying single-family dwellings in favour of renting or forming alternative households. The scenario could also see trade unions \"grow in power as workers become frustrated,\" noted the report. \"Since many people have less in this future and see no way to improve their status through consumption and display, they spend less. This could shrink the consumer economy,\" it said. If the scenario comes to be, the report poses that people might find alternative ways to meet their basic needs. \"Housing, food, child care and health care co-operatives may become more common. This could ease burdens on social services but also challenge market-based businesses,\" it said. Another consideration is that \"people may start to hunt, fish and forage on public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. Small-scale agriculture could increase.\" Getting ahead may never be as dire as scenario The report concludes that getting ahead may never be as difficult or rare as suggested in this scenario. \"However, social stagnation and downward mobility are plausible elements of the future,\" it said. \"Exploring them supports anticipatory governance by helping policymakers think through potential challenges and opportunities.\" While some of the policy considerations are bleak, the report also concludes that the loss of belief in social mobility could \"make space for positive ideas.\" Analysis Poilievre isn't pivoting, but he's stepping lightly around a few things Liberal platform promises $130B in new measures over 4 years, adding $225B to federal debt \"People could rethink what 'prosperity' means, or 'fulfilment,\" it said. \"They may focus on policies that promote human flourishing. This could include health care, housing, the environment and education for its own sake.\" In a statement to CBC News, a spokesperson for Policy Horizons stressed the social mobility report \"is an exploration of a potential future\" meant to assist the government's planning. \"It is not a forecast nor a commentary on current or future policies,\" said spokesperson Mila Roy. \"Thinking through possible disruptions when developing policies, programs and strategies could help seize opportunities, navigate impacts and minimize risks.\" Policy Horizons falls under the Employment and Social Development Canada portfolio, but is overseen by a committee made up of deputy ministers from across government. The report includes the disclaimer that it \"does not necessarily represent the views of the Government of Canada.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR Catharine Tunney Reporter Catharine Tunney is a reporter with CBC's Parliament Hill bureau, where she covers national security and the RCMP.

The Philippine STAR / Michael Varcas MANILA, Philippines — The economy of Metro Manila expanded at a faster pace in 2024, driven primarily by the growth in the services sector, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Data from the PSA yesterday showed that the economic growth of the National Capital Region (NCR) was at 5.6 percent last year, higher than the 4.9 percent expansion in 2023. Despite the faster expansion posted last year, NCR’s economic growth was slightly below the 5.7 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth at the national level in 2024. Of the major economic sectors, services accounted for the biggest share or 82.9 percent of NCR’s total regional GDP last year. The sector posted a 5.9 percent growth, faster than the 5.7 percent in 2023. Industries that recorded the fastest growth in NCR were transportation and storage (9.4 percent); other services (9.2 percent); and human health and social work activities (8.9 percent). The industry sector, which accounted for 17.1 percent of NCR’s GDP, posted a faster growth rate of four percent last year from 1.3 percent in 2023. Meanwhile, agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed less than 0.1 percent of NCR’s economy. Growth in the sector slowed to 0.8 percent last year from 5.4 percent in 2023. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist Michael Ricafort said in an email that the faster NCR GDP growth in 2024 may be partly attributed to the faster government spending, which registered a 9.9 percent growth compared to the national average of 7.3 percent. He said this offset the slower increases in consumer spending and investments in Metro Manila compared to the national level. Consumer spending in NCR posted a 4.1 percent growth last year, below the 4.9 percent expansion at the national level. Investments in Metro Manila registered a 7.3 percent growth last year, also lower than the national average of 7.7 percent. Ricafort said easing inflation and spending related to election preparations may have also supported the faster NCR growth last year. NCR accounted for 31.2 percent of the country’s total GDP last year, the highest among regions. This was followed by Calabarzon (Cavite-Laguna-Batangas-Rizal-Quezon), which accounted for 14.7 percent of the Philippines’ GDP last year and Central Luzon with the third biggest share at 11.1 percent. In terms of growth rate, Central Visayas posted the fastest expansion of 7.3 percent last year. Caraga placed second with a 6.9 percent growth, followed by Central Luzon, which expanded by 6.5 percent last year. “These three regions exhibited higher growths than the national level growth rate of 5.7 percent,” the PSA said. Other regions that posted growth rates faster than the national level were Davao Region (6.3 percent); Eastern Visayas (6.2 percent); Northern Mindanao (six percent); and the newly created Negros Island Region (5.9 percent). Asked for an outlook for this year, Ricafort said “both NCR and nationwide GDP growth rates at around six percent or slightly below six percent would be possible for 2025.” He said election-related spending in early 2025 could lead to faster NCR and nationwide economic or GDP growth for this year. In addition, he said mild inflation could help improve consumer spending, which could lead to faster economic growth rates both for NCR and at the national level. Inflation from January to March averaged 2.2 percent, within the government’s two to four percent target for the year. ECONOMY BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

    "article_text": "KFC’s US sales fall behind Raising Cane’s, Wingstop Kentucky Fried Chicken added a chicken nugget meal and its mashed potato-based Famous Bowl to its $5 Taste of KFC menu. · Restaurant Dive · Courtesy of KFC Aneurin Canham-Clyne April 21, 2025 3 min read WING YUM QSR This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Restaurant Dive newsletter . Dive Brief: Chicken chains, including Raising Cane’s, Wingstop, Chick-fil-A, Zaxby’s, Bojangles and Popeyes, saw consumer spending increase in 2024 while KFC saw consumer spending fall, according to Circana’s Definitive U.S. Restaurant Ranking 2025 report . KFC’s U.S. consumer spending fell 4% to $4.34 billion, with the chain now ranked #23 in the U.S. by Circana’s estimate. The brand was passed by Raising Cane’s (#16) and Wingstop (#21) in the rankings, as both chains saw dramatic sales growth amid a general expansion of the chicken segment. Dive Insight: Wingstop’s 41% growth in consumer spend marked the largest gains among the top 50 chains, while Raising Cane’s 31% expansion was second greatest. Circana attributed both brands’ success to digital engagement and media strategy, in addition to the growth of the chicken category overall. “Raising Cane's partnered with Post Malone to design custom restaurants, while Wingstop is the official chicken partner of the NBA. As a result, both brands heavily over index with Gen Z, and digital media drives a large percentage of their visits,” the report stated. It is no surprise that the biggest jumps in consumer restaurant spending are coming from chicken chains. “Chicken servings lead the growth in animal protein servings in the restaurant space,” said David Portalatin, Circana’s senior vice president and industry advisor for food and foodservice, in an interview. But this, he said, was less about consumers waking up to a specific protein, and more about brand strategy. “It's really a reflection of when operators execute well and create a good value for their customer, then that's well received in the marketplace,” Portalatin said. Portalatin said that consumers are particularly responsive to menu innovation on staple menu items or perceived elevation of existing offerings, like chicken sandwiches. “Every time over the last several years that somebody expands their geographical footprint or innovates a new version of the chicken sandwich, we see servings growth of chicken sandwiches,” Portalatin said. Given the success of the segment, it is surprising how KFC continues to struggle with sales growth. Estimated 2024 consumer spending among top QSR chicken chains (in $ billions) KFC's total consumer spending fell 4% last year while other chains grew, according to Circana's The Definitive U.S. Restaurant Ranking. Among QSR and fast chicken chains, KFC has now fallen to fifth place in terms of estimated consumer spend, behind Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, Raising Cane’s and Wingstop, but ahead of Zaxby’s and Bojangles. Popeyes’ 2024 consumer spend increased 6%, according to the report, despite value-related stumbles in the mid-year . Story Continues Both Wingstop and Raising Cane’s lag behind KFC in one metric: buyer penetration, with Wingstop at 19% and Raising Cane’s at 24%, while KFC sits at 29%. But this is indicative of the strength of the challenger brands — higher sales at lower penetration indicate considerable customer loyalty or higher ticket, either of which means both chains have whitespace to grow. KFC, despite the breadth of its reach, isn't generating the same buzz. KFC’s efforts to promote itself as a value-oriented brand seem not to have struck gold, and the brand is looking to turn things around. In January, Yum Brands shifted Scott Mezvinsky, formerly of Taco Bell, to lead KFC as CEO . Late last year, the chain debuted a sauce-focused concept with a strong tech element . In February, Yum announced it was transferring the brand’s headquarters from Kentucky to Texas , where Pizza Hut is headquartered. Outside the United States, however, KFC has performed quite well, with 8% systemwide sales growth and 1% same-store sales growth in its international divisions, according to Yum’s most recent earnings report .

Here's why travel influencer parted ways with Apoorva Mukhija Though China has not named India, it has expressed its concerns over the increasing bonhomie between the US and New Delhi and the ongoing talks of resolving the contentious issue of reciprocal tariffs and the Bilateral Trade Agreement. Beijing expressed its discomfiture on Monday as it cautioned countries against entering into trade agreements with Washington at its expense to get exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime. Will India be alternative manufacturing hub? Analysts believe the main reason for China being upset is the possibility of India emerging as an alternative manufacturing hub. After the US tariff on Chinese goods has reached 245%, making it almost impossible for Beijing to export, other countries may divert investments and markets away from China. India is holding talks with the US and the two countries may reach a deal before the deadline of 90 days is over because India is a consumer-led economy and it has lower export dependence, which may give it leverage. PM Modi's Saudi Visit China expressed its concerns a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi left for Saudi Arabia, a country that had earlier shown interest in investing $100 billion in India. It shows India's strategy and capacity of attracting global investment mainly at the cost of China. Chinese, US firms to diversify? After the US-China trade war began, many companies planned to diversify supply chains and move away from China. With a large, skilled, and cheap workforce and government incentives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, New Delhi is likely to emerge as a viable alternative. It can be gauged by the fact that even Chinese companies like Haier and Shanghai Highly Group have accepted strict investment rules in India, like having minority stakes in joint ventures, so that they can access India’s market and bypass U.S. tariffs. China is also aware of the huge and almost insurmountable trade surplus with India. India's reliance on Chinese components makes it clear that India will remain dependent on China for some time to come at least and so Beijing should not be afraid of India. China reaches out to India Moving ahead cautiously, China has urged India to \"stand together\" against U.S. tariffs and reminded it that both countries are developing economies and may be harmed by U.S. protectionism. Taking one step forward, the Chinese Embassy in India said that the China-India trade relationship is \"complementary and mutually beneficial.\" He also warned that U.S. tariffs would deprive the Global South of development rights. Analysts believe exploiting U.S.-China tensions is best suited for India to secure trade concessions. India-China geopolitical realities China is also aware of the geopolitical realities. It believes, and it is true to some extent, that New Delhi's deepening ties with the U.S. are part of a broader strategy to counter Chinese influence in Asia. After tensions over the 2020 Ladakh border clash and India’s restrictions on Chinese investments, it is clear that India may adopt a tough stand against Beijing in the South China Sea. It is clear from the fact that China’s state media criticised India for \"echoing U.S. rhetoric\" to curry favor with the Trump administration. It showed its unease about India aligning with the U.S. to isolate China geopolitically.

    "article_text": "Advertisement China economy Opinion China Opinion Prof Zhang Jun Opinion | More of China’s spending power needs to be unleashed. Here’s how Childcare, healthcare and elderly care are precisely the parts of China’s consumer demand that remain significantly untapped Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP 4 Prof Zhang Jun Published: 4:30pm, 22 Apr 2025 There are signs that the Chinese economy has been improving, owing to the government’s September 2024 stimulus package . Year-on-year gross domestic product growth in the first quarter of this year reached 5.4 per cent – continuing the marked acceleration from last year. Advertisement In fact, the change in policy direction has been evident since late 2022, when Chinese policymakers acknowledged that falling demand was becoming a major problem. The most important cause was the real estate market , where a collapsing price bubble hit local government revenues hard, cutting into residents’ property and business income – an important part of disposable income – and pushing consumer spending below trend. To alleviate the pressure on local governments, the central government allowed them to expand their debt financing by issuing US$1.4 trillion worth of long-term bonds – over five years – to replace their short-term debt. Proceeds from long-term bond issuances were also used to shore up state-owned commercial banks’ balance sheets and enhance their capacity to generate credit. Meanwhile, the central bank has maintained faster credit growth, but is being cautious about lowering policy rates. With China’s real interest rates above 4 per cent, a significant rate cut is unavoidable given concerns about exchange-rate volatility and commercial banks’ financial condition. Chinese authorities understood that stabilising the property and stock markets could mitigate the slowdown in consumer spending. Thus, the stabilisation strategy requires local governments to use a portion of the special debt financing they receive to purchase unsold residential buildings on the market, and to use those units as guaranteed housing for local residents. 02:37 As restaurants struggle in Beijing, ‘restaurant undertakers’ make a profit As restaurants struggle in Beijing, ‘restaurant undertakers’ make a profit It also requires state-owned nonbank financial institutions to buy back and hold more shares. In another country, such measures would sound implausible. But China’s state-owned financial system makes them feasible.

Noor Ul Ain Rehman April 20, 2025 6 min read TGT We recently published a list of 11 Best Retail Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) stands against other best retail stocks to buy right now. Resilient Consumer Spending, Falling Consumer Sentiment Although the stock market is undergoing volatility due to the effects of Trump’s tariffs, the March retail sales report brought a beacon of light by showing that consumer spending remained stronger than expected. The Commerce Department reported that while consumer sentiment continued falling, demand remained high. The retail sales advanced estimate showed a 1.4% month-over-month growth, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 1.2% and significantly exceeding the 0.2% increase in February. CNBC reported on April 16 that, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality (but not prices), the year-over-year growth came up to 4.6%. The monthly rise was the highest since January 2023. The numbers were also better than expected, excluding autos, as sales grew 0.5% compared to the forecast of 0.3%. Economists anticipated that auto sales would rise as consumers attempted to get ahead of the impending aggressive tariffs imposed by President Trump. Hobby, sports goods, and music stores also underwent a 2.4% growth, while hardware stores and building materials underwent a 3.3% rise. Similarly, food service and drinking places grew by 1.8%. These trends thus show that consumer spending is demonstrating resilience amid the uncertainty brought about by tariffs and the concerns of a weakening economy. CNBC reported that Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds, said the following about the situation: “Net, net, these are simply blow-out numbers on March retail sales where the rush is on like this is one gigantic clearance sale. Consumers are expecting sharply higher prices the next year and are clearing the store shelves and picking up bargains while they can.” READ ALSO: 15 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires and 12 Best Cosmetics Stocks to Buy for 2025 . What March’s Positive Retail Sales Report Could Mean These positive retail sales numbers challenge various market sentiment readings that pointed toward looming fears that Trump’s tariffs would plunge the American economy into a recession and take prices sky-high. We discussed this situation in a recently published article on 11 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . Here is an excerpt from the article: Trade policies and tariffs have dominated the stock market since the beginning of April, resulting in volatility and uncertainty. However, CNBC reported on April 16 that retail sales rose 1.4% in March, surpassing expectations. CNBC reported earlier on April 15 that the March retail sales report had the potential to impact investor positioning and confidence. According to Dow Jones, economists and experts anticipated a 1.2% month-over-month growth. Story Continues Our Methodology We sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 retail stocks and chose the top 11 most popular among hedge funds as of Q4 2024. The list is ordered in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Jim Cramer Warns on Target Corporation (TGT): “Be Careful Here—Numbers Have to Come Down” A woman purchasing groceries at a Target store, with a cart full of products. Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a retail giant operating over 2,000 discount department stores and hypermarkets across the US and Canada. It serves its customers various items, including food, everyday essentials, differentiated merchandise at discounted prices, and general merchandise. Its merchandise categories span organic food and beverages, groceries, dairy, and others. The company is facing some headwinds, with management noting weakening consumer confidence and pressure from tariff uncertainty through February. While Target Corporation’s (NYSE:TGT) 2025 guidance reflects flat growth, it also boasts several competitive advantages. It has stores in all 50 states, with store models perfectly fitting the rural, suburban, and urban markets simultaneously, appealing to all income categories. It expects to add around $15 billion in retail sales over the next five years. Management is confident that its initiatives to generate financial efficiencies will position the company for long-term profitable growth. For Target Corporation’s (NYSE:TGT) fiscal year 2026, it is guiding a 1% net sales growth and an adjusted EPS target of $9.80, reflecting an annual 10.6% increase. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is also investing in its business, opening new stores and spending money on remodels. The company is in a position to expand its market share in several categories, enhance its stores and supply chains, improve sales through same-day delivery, expand its media business, and build an online advertising business. Overall, TGT ranks 9th on our list of the best retail stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for TGT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Here’s your weekly digest of the Globe’s most essential business and investing stories, with insights and analysis from the pros, stock tips, portfolio strategies and more. U.S. puts drug tariffs on the table, threatening entire supply chains Open this photo in gallery: An employee checks packaged generic drugs before boxing them on an assembly line at Pharmascience manufacturing facility in Montreal, Quebec December 8, 2022. (Christinne Muschi /The Globe and Mail) Christinne Muschi/The Globe and Mail The Trump administration opened an investigation into the entire pharmaceutical supply chain this week, a move that threatens to widen potential tariffs on prescription drugs. The U.S. Department of Commerce filed notice Monday that it would examine U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The notice’s inclusion of pharmaceutical ingredients means that the more than $7-billion worth of Canadian pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. could be hit by tariffs. Chris Hannay and Irene Galea report that generic companies are likely to be hit hard, and Canada is home to some major generic drugmakers, including Apotex and Pharmascience. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the White House and Florida’s state government are promoting the importation of Canadian medication as a way to lower drug costs. Bank of Canada holds rate steady at 2.75% amid trade war uncertainty Open this photo in gallery: Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem participates in a news conference in Ottawa, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025. Justin Tang/The Canadian Press The Bank of Canada decided to hit pause on its almost year-long monetary policy-easing campaign this week, leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.75 per cent . This move follows seven consecutive cuts, as Mark Rendell reports, which have lowered mortgage rates and other Canadian borrowing costs considerably since last summer. Governor Tiff Macklem said the central bank decided to give itself time to assess the fallout from Trump’s erratic and destabilizing trade war and it needs to “proceed carefully.” The Bank of Canada also decided to forgo its usual forecast in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, but outlined two possible scenarios. The downside scenario sees Canada entering a recession this year and inflation rising above 3 per cent. Mr. Macklem also added that he and his team are “prepared to act decisively if incoming information points clearly in one direction.” The next rate decision is scheduled for June 4. Decoder: As Canadians ditch travel to the U.S., restaurants get a boost As Canadians continue to cancel trips to the United States, one of the big beneficiaries appears to be restaurants here at home. Jason Kirby reports that the number of reservations at Canadian restaurants has grown more than 20 per cent so far in April compared to last year. It seems that Canadian travellers are saving money from the boycott and choosing to spend more at local restaurants – a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy consumer economy. Take a closer look at the numbers in this week’s Decoder series. HBC employees could lose disability benefits, company to auction off artifacts Open this photo in gallery: A shopper walks past an empty sales area at the flagship downtown Hudson's Bay store, in Vancouver, on March 24. DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press As Hudson’s Bay Co. continues to liquidate its operation, many employees are raising the alarm about long-term disability payments . Susan Krashinsky Robertson reports that the payments, which are paid out of the company’s cash and are uninsured, are leaving people at risk of losing their benefits. According to a law firm representing some employees, Hudson’s Bay’s benefit policy provides long-term disability payments through an “administrative services only” [ASO] arrangement, which is not insured – meaning, if the retailer is unable to come up with a plan to keep some of its stores afloat, or if a new owner steps in, those benefits could disappear. The retailer also announced it intends to auction off historically significant artifacts it still owns, including its 1670 charter that played a pivotal role in the history of Canada. Canadian companies embrace stockpiling ahead of tariff threats Open this photo in gallery: Ashley Chapman, the chief operating officer with Chapmans’ Ice Cream is photographed in the company’s dry warehouse in Markdale, Ont. on April 15, 2025. Because of the tariff issue, Chapman’s has been stockpiling items such as sugar cones; containers and plastic wrappers. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail Many Canadian business owners across the country have been purchasing heaps of excess inventory from both the United States and elsewhere around the globe in preparation for U.S. tariffs on Canada, among other global trade partners, and for Canada’s counterlevies. But with U.S. President Donald Trump regularly shifting course on tariffs – and Canada largely spared in the latest round of sweeping levies announced on April 2, which ranged from 10 to more than 100 per cent – the strategy involves significant risk. Mariya Postelnyak spoke to businesses that are in prepper mode , and how they’ve embraced stockpiling as a buffer against potential disruption in the trade of supplies and finished goods. Take our business quiz for the week of April 11 You say you’re confused by all this economic turmoil? Join the club. “The future is no clearer. We still do not know what tariffs will be imposed, whether they’ll be reduced or escalated, or how long all of this will last.” Who said that this week? a. Liberal Leader Mark Carney b. Royal Bank of Canada chief executive David McKay c. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre d. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem d. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. In an era dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump’s capricious moods, even experts are in the dark. Mr. Macklem was frank about the overwhelming lack of visibility as he announced the Bank of Canada’s decision to hold its policy rate steady at 2.75 per cent.

    "article_text": "American Express Tops Estimates as Consumers Continue Spending Aaron McDade April 17, 2025 1 min read AXP Silas Stein / Picture Alliance via Getty Images American Express ( AXP ) on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on solid consumer spending. The credit card giant reported first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $3.64 on revenue that rose 7% year-over-year to $16.97 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $3.47 and $16.94 billion, respectively. Net interest income was $4.17 billion, just above the $4.10 billion consensus. American Express CEO Stephen Squeri said the firm saw first-quarter consumer spending \"consistent with and in many cases better than what we saw in 2024.\" The company affirmed its full-year outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and EPS of $15.00 to $15.50 \"subject to the macroeconomic environment.\" After rising immediately following the report's release, American Express shares were down more than 1% shortly after markets opened. They entered the day down about 15% so far this year. Last week , Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock's rating to \"buy,\" saying the firm's \"high-quality customer base\" would help it be more resilient in an economic turndown or recession.

Maham Fatima April 16, 2025 4 min read STT We recently published a list of the 11 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) stands against other undervalued quality stocks to buy now. On February 24, Kayne Anderson Rudnick chief market strategist Julie Biel joined ‘The Exchange’ on CNBC to discuss her thoughts on how good quality companies can ride out turbulence in the market. Just like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, Biel also suggests inaction as an investment principle and believes that holding high-quality companies can help investors deal with market volatility. She emphasized conviction in investing instead of impulsive decision-making. Biel also noted the general resilience of the US economy, which mainly comes from a robust jobs market as it fuels the consumer-driven economy. She also expressed unease over the limited tools available to address a potential recession that could come from high levels of deficit spending. She thinks inefficient businesses should be allowed to fail while protecting employees during economic cycles. Biel addressed small-cap stocks and explained that they struggle due to their higher leverage and sensitivity to prolonged higher interest rates. They often include significant exposure to real estate and banking sectors and have a high proportion of non-earning companies. She then emphasized that even if one were to invest in small caps, the ideal approach would be to look at high-quality small-cap companies that can yield strong results. Biel’s stock picks are quality companies that focus on tangible and physical solutions instead of those with foundations in hyped technologies like AI. While she acknowledged AI’s potential, she argued that it’s becoming standard and can no longer be categorized as a differentiator. Our Methodology We sifted through the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to compile a list of the top stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 14. We then selected the 11 undervalued stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Story Continues State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) An executive in a suit and tie at a meeting discussing asset management strategies. State Street Corp. (NYSE: STT ) Forward P/E Ratio as of April 14: 8.22 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) provides financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide. It offers investment servicing products and services, such as custody, accounting & fund administration services, recordkeeping, client reporting, investor services operations outsourcing, financial data management, and other similar services and products. The company’s Net Interest Income (NII) is a primary driver of its overall growth. The company expects deposit levels to remain between $230 and $240 billion as it enters the first quarter of 2025. While noninterest-bearing deposits rose slightly in Q4 2024, it’s down 12% when compared to the year-ago period. Loan growth also significantly fuels NII and reached 14% in 2024. This growth relies on lending to private market clients, which make up over two-thirds of the company’s total loans. State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) is now focused on growing its fee-based business. Its servicing fee sales have risen by 45% since 2022, and 250% since 2020, which came from restructuring the sales team and realigning incentives. The company expects to continue to reach its 2025 target of $350 to $400 million in servicing fee sales. Overall, STT ranks 7th on our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of STT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February . It was the highest month-to-month jump since January of 2023, largely driven by purchases of cars and auto parts that are facing 25% tariffs. Multiple automakers had reported a boost in sales during March as people rushed to dealerships to secure a deal before the tariffs took effect. Excluding auto sales, retail sales climbed a more modest 0.5% but still showed signs of rushing to grab discounts before President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and a high-stakes trade war with China start to increase prices. Economists are watching consumer spending patterns after several consecutive months of data showing sinking attitudes about the economy. Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs. Americans also continued to eat out at bars and restaurants in March with 1.8% increase from the month prior and a 4.8% jump compared to the year prior, a discretionary expense consumers were still willing to take on despite sinking feelings about the economy. “The surprise didn’t come from a big number driven by car buying ahead of tariffs, but by how strong spending was beyond vehicles. While Consumer Sentiment may have crashed, the job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite fears about the economy’s standing, the labor market has continued to be a bright spot with employers holding onto workers and a low unemployment rate. Employers beat expectations in March by adding 228,000 jobs and unemployment at a historically strong rate of 4.2%. But whether consumer spending will remain strong enough to uphold the economy remains to be seen as most companies have not yet had to increase prices as a result of the tariffs. Economists are expecting spending to drop with more tariffs in place and many have reduced forecasts for growth and increased the odds of a recession over the next year. “With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY. Businesses are facing prospects of higher costs for products and pressure from the White House to onshore manufacturing and uncertainty about whether the tariffs that have been announced will go into place, creating a difficult environment to plan for could bring pauses in new investments and activity. Trump’s tariffs so far include an across-the-board 10% tax on imports, Chinese goods with a tariff of 145%, Mexican and Canadian products at 25%, along with imported vehicles and auto parts, steel and aluminum also with a 25% tariff. China has responded to the U.S. tariffs with a 125% levy on American exports, though most other countries have backed off retaliatory measures. Other tariffs could soon be coming with investigations into semiconductors, pharmaceuticals , copper and timber, adding to the uncertainty facing consumers and businesses trying to adjust to what has been an erratic rollout of trade policy from the White House. The uncertainty over the trade policy and mixed messaging on consumer spending habits also puts the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot as it tries to keep the economy on track and get inflation back to its 2% target. Inflation cooled to a six-month low of 2.4% in March but it’s unclear whether that pattern will hold once tariff pricing takes effect. The central bank has two primary objectives — keeping prices stable and helping maintain robust employment, that it influences through changes to its benchmark interest rate that has been stuck in place since last year. Lowering rates could help support a weakening economy but also risks pushing prices upward and spiking prices that are already expected to rise due to the tariffs. Fed officials have also warned it will be difficult for them to parse what price increases will be caused by tariffs or by the countless other economic factors that influence costs. Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have projected confidence they are in a good position to be nimble with rates to respond to the effects the tariffs will have on the economy but are still facing a tricky situation to keep the economy on track.

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February .

Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs.

Management said it is strategically focused on its payments businesses and “money movement” capabilities as areas for future growth. U.S. Bancorp has presence with the affluent customer segment and is seeing steady consumer spending patterns.

Δ Management also pointed to the diversification of the bank’s revenue streams as a benefit in today’s operating environment, where U.S. Bancorp sees long-term potential in its payments-focused businesses and embedded money movement. In remarks to analysts during the company’s conference call following the earnings release Wednesday (April 16), CEO Gunjan Kedia said: “Importantly, our credit quality and capital levels are strong. This quarter, our net charge-off ratio improved modestly and we continued to build capital. We are in an environment of intense market and economic volatility … and we are prepared for a variety of possible scenarios.” Eyeing Money Movement Growth “We have an opportunity to do better with our payments businesses,” Kedia said during the call. Money movement capabilities are critical to anchoring client relationships, and we are committed to building a vibrant payments franchise.” Within that segment, the company notched $925 billion in trailing 12 months payments volumes, representing a 4% compound annual growth rate through the past two years. Payments-related average loans were 6.1% higher, compounded, through the same time frame, to $42 billion. “We have a greater focus on the affluent customer,” Kedia said during the call. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The merchant payments services business will be transformed through “greater interconnectivity across the bank [and] a strategic shift to a tech-led operating model that is more consistent with the buying behavior of consumers today,” she said. “Tech-led represents over one-third of total merchant processing revenue, and most of our revenue generation is now concentrated in our five targeted verticals,” including retail, services, travel, entertainment and healthcare. Merchant processing fees were up 3.5% year over year. On a day of broad market losses, U.S. Bancorp shares slipped 2% Wednesday. Chief Financial Officer John Stern said during the call that the first-quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.59% improved one basis point linked quarter. The earnings supplementals indicated that overall 90-day delinquency rates were 0.2%. Within the card portfolio, delinquencies up to 90 days stood at 1.3% of card loans, down from 1.4%. Asked by analysts on the call about consumer spending trends, Kedia said: “We saw a modest pullback in consumer spending early in the year, and that was very weather-related. And it has stabilize d… We are watching the downward trend in consumer sentiment but not seeing that in our spend patterns. Our mix does tilt toward the more affluent customer and toward non-discretionary everyday spend patterns. So that could be an explanation, but we are seeing steady consumer spend patterns in the first quarter.” Later, in discussing the merchant-facing business, Kedia said: “It’s an important organic growth opportunity … the [merchant payments services] business is about 5% of our overall bank, but a very important differentiator for us . It’s a very competitive space, and the reason to think about focusing on the five verticals is you can build stronger deck-led value propositions for each of the vertical s… And the more we have focused our acquisition efforts and our organic growth efforts on those verticals, the deeper and the better execution we have. And today, about 90% of our revenue focus is on those verticals.” Recommended AutoNation Sees Revenues Rise as Tariff Situation ‘Evolves’ American Airlines Leverages Loyalty Program and Co-Branded Cards to Boost Revenue Growth Worldpay Integrates Affirm Into Embedded Payments Offering for SaaS Firms Stablecoin Issuers Race for Bank Charters as Fed Weighs Access See More In: banking , Banks , Consumer Spending , credit , credit cards , Earnings , economy , News , PYMNTS News , Revenue , u.s. bancorp , U.S. Bank"

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February . It was the highest month-to-month jump since January of 2023, largely driven by purchases of cars and auto parts that are facing 25% tariffs. Multiple automakers had reported a boost in sales during March as people rushed to dealerships to secure a deal before the tariffs took effect. Excluding auto sales, retail sales climbed a more modest 0.5% but still showed signs of rushing to grab discounts before President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and a high-stakes trade war with China start to increase prices. Economists are watching consumer spending patterns after several consecutive months of data showing sinking attitudes about the economy. Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs. Americans also continued to eat out at bars and restaurants in March with 1.8% increase from the month prior and a 4.8% jump compared to the year prior, a discretionary expense consumers were still willing to take on despite sinking feelings about the economy. “The surprise didn’t come from a big number driven by car buying ahead of tariffs, but by how strong spending was beyond vehicles. While Consumer Sentiment may have crashed, the job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite fears about the economy’s standing, the labor market has continued to be a bright spot with employers holding onto workers and a low unemployment rate. Employers beat expectations in March by adding 228,000 jobs and unemployment at a historically strong rate of 4.2%. But whether consumer spending will remain strong enough to uphold the economy remains to be seen as most companies have not yet had to increase prices as a result of the tariffs. Economists are expecting spending to drop with more tariffs in place and many have reduced forecasts for growth and increased the odds of a recession over the next year. “With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY. Businesses are facing prospects of higher costs for products and pressure from the White House to onshore manufacturing and uncertainty about whether the tariffs that have been announced will go into place, creating a difficult environment to plan for could bring pauses in new investments and activity. Trump’s tariffs so far include an across-the-board 10% tax on imports, Chinese goods with a tariff of 145%, Mexican and Canadian products at 25%, along with imported vehicles and auto parts, steel and aluminum also with a 25% tariff. China has responded to the U.S. tariffs with a 125% levy on American exports, though most other countries have backed off retaliatory measures. Other tariffs could soon be coming with investigations into semiconductors, pharmaceuticals , copper and timber, adding to the uncertainty facing consumers and businesses trying to adjust to what has been an erratic rollout of trade policy from the White House. The uncertainty over the trade policy and mixed messaging on consumer spending habits also puts the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot as it tries to keep the economy on track and get inflation back to its 2% target. Inflation cooled to a six-month low of 2.4% in March but it’s unclear whether that pattern will hold once tariff pricing takes effect. The central bank has two primary objectives — keeping prices stable and helping maintain robust employment, that it influences through changes to its benchmark interest rate that has been stuck in place since last year. Lowering rates could help support a weakening economy but also risks pushing prices upward and spiking prices that are already expected to rise due to the tariffs. Fed officials have also warned it will be difficult for them to parse what price increases will be caused by tariffs or by the countless other economic factors that influence costs. Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have projected confidence they are in a good position to be nimble with rates to respond to the effects the tariffs will have on the economy but are still facing a tricky situation to keep the economy on track.

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February . It was the highest month-to-month jump since January of 2023, largely driven by purchases of cars and auto parts that are facing 25% tariffs. Multiple automakers had reported a boost in sales during March as people rushed to dealerships to secure a deal before the tariffs took effect. Excluding auto sales, retail sales climbed a more modest 0.5% but still showed signs of rushing to grab discounts before President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and a high-stakes trade war with China start to increase prices. Economists are watching consumer spending patterns after several consecutive months of data showing sinking attitudes about the economy. Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs. Americans also continued to eat out at bars and restaurants in March with 1.8% increase from the month prior and a 4.8% jump compared to the year prior, a discretionary expense consumers were still willing to take on despite sinking feelings about the economy. “The surprise didn’t come from a big number driven by car buying ahead of tariffs, but by how strong spending was beyond vehicles. While Consumer Sentiment may have crashed, the job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite fears about the economy’s standing, the labor market has continued to be a bright spot with employers holding onto workers and a low unemployment rate. Employers beat expectations in March by adding 228,000 jobs and unemployment at a historically strong rate of 4.2%. But whether consumer spending will remain strong enough to uphold the economy remains to be seen as most companies have not yet had to increase prices as a result of the tariffs. Economists are expecting spending to drop with more tariffs in place and many have reduced forecasts for growth and increased the odds of a recession over the next year. “With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY. Businesses are facing prospects of higher costs for products and pressure from the White House to onshore manufacturing and uncertainty about whether the tariffs that have been announced will go into place, creating a difficult environment to plan for could bring pauses in new investments and activity. Trump’s tariffs so far include an across-the-board 10% tax on imports, Chinese goods with a tariff of 145%, Mexican and Canadian products at 25%, along with imported vehicles and auto parts, steel and aluminum also with a 25% tariff. China has responded to the U.S. tariffs with a 125% levy on American exports, though most other countries have backed off retaliatory measures. Other tariffs could soon be coming with investigations into semiconductors, pharmaceuticals , copper and timber, adding to the uncertainty facing consumers and businesses trying to adjust to what has been an erratic rollout of trade policy from the White House. The uncertainty over the trade policy and mixed messaging on consumer spending habits also puts the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot as it tries to keep the economy on track and get inflation back to its 2% target. Inflation cooled to a six-month low of 2.4% in March but it’s unclear whether that pattern will hold once tariff pricing takes effect. The central bank has two primary objectives — keeping prices stable and helping maintain robust employment, that it influences through changes to its benchmark interest rate that has been stuck in place since last year. Lowering rates could help support a weakening economy but also risks pushing prices upward and spiking prices that are already expected to rise due to the tariffs. Fed officials have also warned it will be difficult for them to parse what price increases will be caused by tariffs or by the countless other economic factors that influence costs. Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have projected confidence they are in a good position to be nimble with rates to respond to the effects the tariffs will have on the economy but are still facing a tricky situation to keep the economy on track.

Fallon / AFP via Getty Images Toyota and Lexus cars unloaded from ships sit parked at the Toyota Logistics Services Inc. automotive processing terminal at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, Calif., on April 10. Retail spending — one of the key drivers in the economy — saw its biggest jump in more than two years during March, as more people rushed to buy cars and other big-ticket items ahead of President Trump's new tariffs. Spending at stores, restaurants and car dealerships grew 1.4% in March compared to February, according to Wednesday's data from the Commerce Department. That's the biggest increase since January 2023 — and the driver was mainly autos. Spending on cars, trucks and auto parts rose more than 5% compared to February. Automakers have offered discounts and shoppers rushed to auto lots in anticipation of prices rising as a result of new tariffs, which Trump announced last month and started applying for many imported vehicles early in April. The car data group Cox Automotive had reported March as delivering the hottest new car sales in four years . Economists at Cox Automotive now predict the car-buying might last a couple of months before tariff-fueled price increases would cause sales to slow. Even with a notable rise in retail sales last month, there are concerns that consumer spending could wane as the wider effects of tariffs kick in. Major retailers and big brands have begun scaling back their financial forecasts for the year. The latest survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan is noting steep declines in how people feel about the future of the economy, as anxiety rises over tariffs' impact on prices. But March data, for now, still has people spending generously — on building and gardening supplies, sporting goods and going out to eat. \"The job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,\" said Robert Frick, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in a statement. For comparison, retail spending in February barely rose, and it declined in January. Compared to a year ago, retail sales in March increased 4.6%. NPR's Camila Domonoske contributed to this report.

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February . It was the highest month-to-month jump since January of 2023, largely driven by purchases of cars and auto parts that are facing 25% tariffs. Multiple automakers had reported a boost in sales during March as people rushed to dealerships to secure a deal before the tariffs took effect. Excluding auto sales, retail sales climbed a more modest 0.5% but still showed signs of rushing to grab discounts before President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and a high-stakes trade war with China start to increase prices. Economists are watching consumer spending patterns after several consecutive months of data showing sinking attitudes about the economy. Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs. Americans also continued to eat out at bars and restaurants in March with 1.8% increase from the month prior and a 4.8% jump compared to the year prior, a discretionary expense consumers were still willing to take on despite sinking feelings about the economy. “The surprise didn’t come from a big number driven by car buying ahead of tariffs, but by how strong spending was beyond vehicles. While Consumer Sentiment may have crashed, the job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite fears about the economy’s standing, the labor market has continued to be a bright spot with employers holding onto workers and a low unemployment rate. Employers beat expectations in March by adding 228,000 jobs and unemployment at a historically strong rate of 4.2%. But whether consumer spending will remain strong enough to uphold the economy remains to be seen as most companies have not yet had to increase prices as a result of the tariffs. Economists are expecting spending to drop with more tariffs in place and many have reduced forecasts for growth and increased the odds of a recession over the next year. “With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY. Businesses are facing prospects of higher costs for products and pressure from the White House to onshore manufacturing and uncertainty about whether the tariffs that have been announced will go into place, creating a difficult environment to plan for could bring pauses in new investments and activity. Trump’s tariffs so far include an across-the-board 10% tax on imports, Chinese goods with a tariff of 145%, Mexican and Canadian products at 25%, along with imported vehicles and auto parts, steel and aluminum also with a 25% tariff. China has responded to the U.S. tariffs with a 125% levy on American exports, though most other countries have backed off retaliatory measures. Other tariffs could soon be coming with investigations into semiconductors, pharmaceuticals , copper and timber, adding to the uncertainty facing consumers and businesses trying to adjust to what has been an erratic rollout of trade policy from the White House. The uncertainty over the trade policy and mixed messaging on consumer spending habits also puts the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot as it tries to keep the economy on track and get inflation back to its 2% target. Inflation cooled to a six-month low of 2.4% in March but it’s unclear whether that pattern will hold once tariff pricing takes effect. The central bank has two primary objectives — keeping prices stable and helping maintain robust employment, that it influences through changes to its benchmark interest rate that has been stuck in place since last year. Lowering rates could help support a weakening economy but also risks pushing prices upward and spiking prices that are already expected to rise due to the tariffs. Fed officials have also warned it will be difficult for them to parse what price increases will be caused by tariffs or by the countless other economic factors that influence costs. Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have projected confidence they are in a good position to be nimble with rates to respond to the effects the tariffs will have on the economy but are still facing a tricky situation to keep the economy on track.

Retail sales jumped a robust 1.4% in March, following up a more modest increase of 0.2% in February . It was the highest month-to-month jump since January of 2023, largely driven by purchases of cars and auto parts that are facing 25% tariffs. Multiple automakers had reported a boost in sales during March as people rushed to dealerships to secure a deal before the tariffs took effect. Excluding auto sales, retail sales climbed a more modest 0.5% but still showed signs of rushing to grab discounts before President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and a high-stakes trade war with China start to increase prices. Economists are watching consumer spending patterns after several consecutive months of data showing sinking attitudes about the economy. Consumer confidence has taken a nosedive in 2025 as Americans grow more concerned that inflation could spike again, and tariffs will squeeze their wallets. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index plunged to the lowest level since the worst of the pandemic-induced recession in a preliminary reading released Friday. Economists are watching to see if the sinking confidence leads to a pull-back in spending, which would lead to slower economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of total activity. A retreat in spending has not come to fruition yet with shoppers clearing shelves ahead of tariffs. Americans also continued to eat out at bars and restaurants in March with 1.8% increase from the month prior and a 4.8% jump compared to the year prior, a discretionary expense consumers were still willing to take on despite sinking feelings about the economy. “The surprise didn’t come from a big number driven by car buying ahead of tariffs, but by how strong spending was beyond vehicles. While Consumer Sentiment may have crashed, the job market is holding tough and incomes are rising, and those are the main factors that drive consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Despite fears about the economy’s standing, the labor market has continued to be a bright spot with employers holding onto workers and a low unemployment rate. Employers beat expectations in March by adding 228,000 jobs and unemployment at a historically strong rate of 4.2%. But whether consumer spending will remain strong enough to uphold the economy remains to be seen as most companies have not yet had to increase prices as a result of the tariffs. Economists are expecting spending to drop with more tariffs in place and many have reduced forecasts for growth and increased the odds of a recession over the next year. “With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY. Businesses are facing prospects of higher costs for products and pressure from the White House to onshore manufacturing and uncertainty about whether the tariffs that have been announced will go into place, creating a difficult environment to plan for could bring pauses in new investments and activity. Trump’s tariffs so far include an across-the-board 10% tax on imports, Chinese goods with a tariff of 145%, Mexican and Canadian products at 25%, along with imported vehicles and auto parts, steel and aluminum also with a 25% tariff. China has responded to the U.S. tariffs with a 125% levy on American exports, though most other countries have backed off retaliatory measures. Other tariffs could soon be coming with investigations into semiconductors, pharmaceuticals , copper and timber, adding to the uncertainty facing consumers and businesses trying to adjust to what has been an erratic rollout of trade policy from the White House. The uncertainty over the trade policy and mixed messaging on consumer spending habits also puts the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot as it tries to keep the economy on track and get inflation back to its 2% target. Inflation cooled to a six-month low of 2.4% in March but it’s unclear whether that pattern will hold once tariff pricing takes effect. The central bank has two primary objectives — keeping prices stable and helping maintain robust employment, that it influences through changes to its benchmark interest rate that has been stuck in place since last year. Lowering rates could help support a weakening economy but also risks pushing prices upward and spiking prices that are already expected to rise due to the tariffs. Fed officials have also warned it will be difficult for them to parse what price increases will be caused by tariffs or by the countless other economic factors that influence costs. Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have projected confidence they are in a good position to be nimble with rates to respond to the effects the tariffs will have on the economy but are still facing a tricky situation to keep the economy on track.

    "article_text": "Powell says Fed to stay on hold until clarity on tariff impact Published on 04/16/2025 at 04:02 pm EDT Reuters Share (Reuters) -U.S. economic growth appears to be slowing, with consumer spending growing modestly, a rush of imports to avoid tariffs likely to weigh on estimates of gross domestic product, and sentiment souring, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. For now, he said in remarks prepared for delivery at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed could keep its benchmark interest rate steady \"to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\" Repeating comments made earlier this month, the Fed chief noted that the impact of those and other policy changes \"are still evolving,\" but likely to be \"larger than anticipated.\" MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: The S&P 500 extended a decline and was down 2.8% BONDS: US Treasury 10-year yields fell on Wednesday by nearly five basis points and were last at 4.279% FOREX: The dollar index was down 0.9% COMMENTS: JIM CARROLL, SENIOR WEALTH ADVISOR, BALLAST ROCK PRIVATE WEALTH, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA \"People were expecting Powell to be neutral and he was hawkish instead. When asked if there's such a thing as a Fed put for the stock market, his answer was 'no'. Overall, at this point, we're kind of drifting... I have a hard time interpreting anything these days except that we're operating day-to-day on news flows. Obviously, a lot of people have been taking earnings expectations down as a result.\" RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY \"He is taking a very mainstream view of what these tariffs mean for both inflation and growth, one that is in opposition to how the administration has been portraying it. The administration has put forth the idea that it will create some transitory inflation that will quickly pass and that ultimately it will lead to even greater growth in the country... That isn't the view of most economists and apparently isn't the view of Powell at this point.\" \"He's suggesting that it is going to be potentially difficult economic times if the tariffs stay at these levels. Both in terms of inflation and in terms of growth. And I think that's something investors know. He's just highlighting it.\" SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH, PENNSYLVANIA: \"Powell is confirming what investors have been worried about, and that is the likelihood of slowing economic growth and more stubborn inflation as a result of the tariffs. Basically saying it's sort of still an open-ended situation.\" \"He also said that don't necessarily rely on the 'Fed put', meaning: don't rely on the Fed to sort of bail us out of this situation. Maybe that was sort of an indication that, 'gee... we really don't have the safety net'.\" THOMAS HAYES, CHAIR AND MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NEW YORK \"(Powell) is saying inflation may not be transitory ... and the market doesn't like that because everything Powell has said about inflation since he's been in power ... has been wrong and he's going to be wrong again, and he's going to be rigid about being wrong and that's why the market doesn't like it.\" \"He has no concept that the bigger risk is deflation if the trade war escalates, that's not even in his lexicon of possibilities.\" \"The market is saying he doesn't get it, and what he doesn't get is that while there is a tail risk that inflation remains elevated ... he's not acknowledging the other side of that tail risk, which is that growth can slow so much if this is extended that you have deflation and he'd have to cut aggressively. The fact he does not acknowledge the other side of the tail ... is disappointing.\" TOM GRAFF, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FACET, PHOENIX, MARYLAND \"Powell is between a rock and a hard place. Practically speaking, the Fed can't act proactively to stem any potential economic weakness, given that tariffs are likely to also cause inflation. They simply can't cut rates while inflation is on the rise. This is doubly the case given that inflation is already high. \"There is very real danger that inflation expectations become unanchored in this period. The public has already experienced very high inflation in the recent past, and now is going to experience another bout of inflation, even if it is temporary. If the Fed were to cut rates too quickly thereafter, it would risk appearing that the Fed no longer cares about price stability. That's not a mistake the Powell Fed is going to make.\" MARK MALEK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SIEBERT FINANCIAL, NEW YORK \"Powell said exactly what I would have expected him to say. He finally acknowledged that tariffs will cause some kind of inflation this year, that it certainly can lead to a pullback in capital expenditure and an increase in unemployment. And that leaves the Fed in a very tricky position because of their dual mandate. They need to keep unemployment low and prices down, and now both sides of the coin are going the wrong way for the Fed.\" \"The problem is that there is no tool in Powell's toolbox that deals with both. Of course, the market wanted to hear something different: that they are here to support the markets. He basically said we are not here to do that, it's the market's job to come up with the right pricing. He seemed unconcerned that the markets were volatile and down. This volatility will continue until the market knows what this tariffs policy really looks like.\" ART HOGAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BOSTON \"We didn't get off to a good start today, with the news of Nvidia's writedown, and then Powell sounded more hawkish than he did in his last press conference, leaning into the argument that what is happening is going to push inflation higher. That's all he needed to say and then it was 'Katie, Bar the Door.' I don't think any traders stuck around to listen to anything else after that.\" PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK \"He is basically saying hey, look, you know, tariffs could pose a challenge between controlling inflation and boosting growth.\" \"It looks like first quarter growth is slowing down, consumer spending is moderating.\" \"Powell's saying what the market has been fearing all along. And it's coming from the Fed chief, confirming all these things.\" \"Gold is skyrocketing. The S&P is dropping, the Dow and the Nasdaq are at the lows of the day.\" \"Powell's comments are just confirming what the market has been fearing all along.\" ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAKOTA WEALTH, FAIRFIELD, CONNECTICUT \"The Fed is waiting to see where things go before they make any type of movement on rates, to see if inflation is going to be temporary or if it's going to be a one-time thing, to see how long these tariffs last and whether or not there's any kind of change to it.\" \"They, like everybody else in the market, are probably just as perplexed by the tariffs, the implementation of tariffs and the pullback and the pauses. And that's why they're having to wait this out, because if they move prematurely, they're afraid that they're going to add to the inflationary pressures.\" (Compiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) © Reuters - 2025 Share"

    "article_text": "Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways U.S. retail sales increased by 1.4% in March, the biggest monthly increase since 2023, as consumers tried to prepare for tariffs. Automobile sales jumped 5.3% while building materials sales and bar and restaurant spending also increased. While upcoming tariffs likely drove some spending, economists said the report showed that consumers continued to demonstrate strength beyond the front-loading. Consumers may say they are worried about the direction of the economy, but March’s retail sales report shows that didn’t keep them from spending. U.S. retail sales in March jumped by 1.4% over the prior month, as Census Bureau data showed consumers rushed out to buy cars, building materials and sporting goods. It’s the biggest monthly increase since January 2023. “We got a much stronger retail sales report than we have seen in a long time,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Economics. “Tariff front-running clearly helped lift retail sales to a whole new level of growth last month.\" The strong results come amid a weak start of the year for the retail sector, which saw sales unexpectedly decline in January and rebound only modestly in February . As Expected, Auto Sales Lead March Increases Economists expected to see an increase in sales last month as consumers moved to make big-ticket purchases in advance of tariffs that will likely create significant price increases. Much of the 5.3% monthly jump in automobile sales in March likely came after President Donald Trump announced tariffs that will likely push up car prices, including a 25% tax on all automobile imports . “Some households are getting major purchases in before tariffs bite,” wrote Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein. “Vehicles are moving off dealer lots faster than at any time since the post-pandemic demand surge earlier this decade.” Report Shows Consumers Still Willing to Spend While consumers working to get ahead of tariffs accounted for some spending, economists said the report showed there was still underlying strength in retail sales. Despite recent sentiment surveys that showed growing pessimism over the state of the economy, consumers are still willing to spend. “Once again, consumer spending is managing to avoid the gravitational pull of all the negative dynamics that might otherwise hold it back,” Wells Fargo's economists wrote. Taking out automobile purchases, retail sales rose a more modest 0.5%, down from February but better than expectations. Sales also rose despite a steep decline in gasoline station transactions as fuel prices remained low. Plus, economists were encouraged to see a 1.8% increase in restaurant and bar sales. Wells Fargo said it was a key signal that “while spending may be slowing, consumers have not gone into hiding when it comes to discretionary spending.” However, Sales Could Still Slow as Tariffs Take Hold The report covers sales before President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of “reciprocal” tariffs, which created more market volatility and further deteriorated consumer confidence. Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the U.S. economy, making retail sales a key indicator of ongoing strength. Strong consumer spending helped boost the economy when analysts were anticipating a recession in 2023 that ultimately never emerged. However, some economists are questioning whether consumer spending can maintain its strength in the face of continued uncertainty surrounding tariffs. “We may see another month or two of strong retail sales, but frontloading will eventually end,” Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin. “Looking ahead, consumers are set to face an array of challenges that will make it hard to sustain robust spending.” Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

    "article_text": "Is Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) the Most Undervalued Quality Stock to Buy Now? Maham Fatima April 16, 2025 4 min read GILD We recently published a list of the 11 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stands against other undervalued quality stocks to buy now. On February 24, Kayne Anderson Rudnick chief market strategist Julie Biel joined ‘The Exchange’ on CNBC to discuss her thoughts on how good quality companies can ride out turbulence in the market. Just like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, Biel also suggests inaction as an investment principle and believes that holding high-quality companies can help investors deal with market volatility. She emphasized conviction in investing instead of impulsive decision-making. Biel also noted the general resilience of the US economy, which mainly comes from a robust jobs market as it fuels the consumer-driven economy. She also expressed unease over the limited tools available to address a potential recession that could come from high levels of deficit spending. She thinks inefficient businesses should be allowed to fail while protecting employees during economic cycles. Biel addressed small-cap stocks and explained that they struggle due to their higher leverage and sensitivity to prolonged higher interest rates. They often include significant exposure to real estate and banking sectors and have a high proportion of non-earning companies. She then emphasized that even if one were to invest in small caps, the ideal approach would be to look at high-quality small-cap companies that can yield strong results. Biel’s stock picks are quality companies that focus on tangible and physical solutions instead of those with foundations in hyped technologies like AI. While she acknowledged AI’s potential, she argued that it’s becoming standard and can no longer be categorized as a differentiator. Our Methodology We sifted through the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to compile a list of the top stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15 as of April 14. We then selected the 11 undervalued stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ).

    "article_text": "Pre-tariffs buying fuels US retail sales, weakness lies ahead Jeep Wrangler Willys are displayed at a Jeep dealership in White Lake, Michigan · Reuters Lucia Mutikani April 16, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales increased by the most in more than two years in March as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods to avoid higher prices from tariffs, likely barely keeping the economy afloat in the first quarter. With the stock market selling off and consumer sentiment tanking amid a darkening economic outlook wrought by President Donald Trump's constantly changing tariff policy, the robust sales pace reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday will probably fizzle in the months ahead as consumers hunker down. Economists' gross domestic product growth estimates for the January-March quarter remained stuck below a 0.5% annualized rate, keeping intact investors' fears of stagnant growth and high inflation, commonly referred to as stagflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at an Economic Club of Chicago event on Wednesday acknowledged the economy appeared to have slowed last quarter, noting \"inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public.\" \"It's hard to feel good about Americans panic buying cars as consumer confidence craters,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. \"The economic outlook is in flux with large changes to trade policy nearly every day. Businesses selling cars, appliances and electronics are likely to see less demand in the next month or two as panic buying ends.\" Retail sales increased 1.4% last month, the largest gain since January 2023, after an unrevised 0.2% rise in February, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, accelerating 1.3%. Sales soared 4.6% year-on-year in March. Trump's 25% global car and truck tariffs came into effect in early April, with industry analysts and manufacturers warning that the duties would significantly raise motor vehicle prices. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported a big jump in auto sales in March, attributed by some to a rush by buyers \"to try and beat the tariffs.\" A slew of other duties have been imposed on most goods, resulting in a stampede by consumers to stock up. Receipts at auto dealerships accelerated 5.3%, the biggest advance since January 2023. Sales at building material and garden equipment suppliers shot up 3.3%. Sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and bookstore sales rose 2.4%. Receipts at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, rebounded 1.8%. That was the largest increase since January 2023. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. Story continues Bank credit and debit card data suggest spending continues to be driven by high-income households, with low-income consumers struggling. But amid the sharp losses in asset prices, there are worries high-income households could start retrenching. Consumer sentiment is near three-year lows, with 12-month inflation expectations the highest since 1981. Mass layoffs of public workers as part of an unprecedented campaign by the Trump administration to downsize the federal government are also weighing on morale and could be a potential drag on spending. Economists said the current economic environment could spur precautionary saving, potentially undercutting spending. \"Ordinarily, we would expect consumers to reduce their saving during an inflationary shock, dampening the hit to spending,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"However, given the shock to confidence and the hit to household wealth we now anticipate a rise in precautionary saving. That will amplify the hit to consumer spending from the incomes shock that tariffs will deliver.\" Stocks on Wall Street fell on trade jitters. The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were mostly steady. BROAD GAINS Financial markets continued to expect the U.S. central bank would resume cutting interest rates in June, having paused its easing cycle in January as policymakers weighed the economic impact of the White House's trade policy. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Clothing store sales rose 0.4% while those at electronic retailers increased 0.8%. But receipts at furniture outlets dropped 0.7%. Online store sales edged up 0.1%. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% in March after an upwardly revised 1.3% advance in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.6% after a previously reported 1.0% jump in February. Despite the strength in core retail sales in the last two months, economists estimated consumer spending slowed to about a 1% rate in the first quarter because of sluggish outlays on services, outside of necessities like utilities and insurance. Consumer spending grew at a 4.0% pace in the October-December quarter. The rush to beat tariff-related price hikes helped to support production at factories in March. Manufacturing output rose 0.3% after rebounding 1.0% in February, the Fed said in a separate report, driven by strong rises in the production of motor vehicles as well as aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment. It grew at a 5.1% rate in the first quarter. \"The unfortunate circumstance is this will likely be short-lived,\" said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo. \"Increased uncertainty around tariff policy has led many businesses to pause major capex, which is set to bite domestic manufacturing.\" The Atlanta Fed expects GDP adjusted for imports and exports of gold to contract at a 0.1% rate in the first quarter. A surge in imports as businesses front-loaded goods to avoid tariffs likely weighed on GDP. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the fourth quarter. \"With the economy set to cool sharply in the coming months as tariffs take their toll, price-sensitive consumers are poised to become more judicious with their spending and reduce their non-essential purchases,\" said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon.

    "article_text": "Updated / Wednesday, 16 Apr 2025 13:55 Motor vehicle manufacturers reported a big jump in auto sales in March, attributed by some to a rush by buyers \"to try and beat the tariffs.\" US retail sales surged in March as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles ahead of tariffs, though concerns about the economic outlook are hurting discretionary spending. Retail sales increased 1.4% last month after an unrevised 0.2% rise in February, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, accelerating 1.3%. President Donald Trump's 25% global car and truck tariffs came into effect in early April, with industry analysts and manufacturers warning that the duties would significantly raise motor vehicle prices. Motor vehicle manufacturers reported a big jump in auto sales in March, attributed by some to a rush by buyers \"to try and beat the tariffs.\" Consumers are also stocking up on other imported goods. Bank credit and debit card data suggest spending continues to be driven by high-income households with low-income consumers struggling. There is less discretionary spending, which is mostly on services, the main engine of the economy. With the stock market selling off as the import duties stoke fears of inflation and stagnation in economic growth or even a recession, there are concerns high-income households could start retrenching if the values of their investment portfolios continue to shrink. Consumer sentiment is near three-year lows, with 12-month inflation expectations the highest since 1981. Mass layoffs of public workers as part of an unprecedented campaign by the Trump administration to downsize the federal government are also weighing on morale and could be a potential drag on spending. \"Bank of America card data indicates that 'nice-to-have' discretionary services spending eased in March, while more inflation-driven spending on necessities such as insurance, rent and utilities continues to rise,\" Bank of America Institute said in a note. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% in March after an upwardly revised 1.3% advance in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.6% after a previously reported 1.0% jump in February. Despite the strength in core retail sales in the last two months, economists expect consumer spending slowed considerably in the first quarter because of sluggish outlays on services. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, grew at a 4.0% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. Economic growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 0.5% rate. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting GDP contracting at a 0.3% pace after adjusting for imports and exports of gold. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the fourth quarter.

    "article_text": "Trump’s erratic trade war has unsettled Americans in recent months, stoking fears of inflation picking up in the year ahead. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images Washington CNN — Spending at US retailers skyrocketed last month at the strongest monthly pace in more than two years as Americans rushed to beat President Donald Trump’s massive tariff hikes. Retail sales climbed 1.4% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, up from February’s 0.2% gain and the highest monthly gain since January 2023. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. The strong showing in March was largely driven by sales of cars and auto parts. Excluding those purchases, retail sales were up a more modest 0.5%. Vehicles awaiting shipment are parked at a port on March 27, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan. U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles manufactured outside the United States. Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images Related article Every car is about to get more expensive. ‘It’s just math,’ former Ford CEO says Trump’s erratic trade war has unsettled Americans in recent months , stoking fears of inflation picking up in the year ahead, according to various sentiment surveys. That expectation is now clearly having an effect on people’s purchasing behavior. Americans’ spending frenzy could stretch into April, but will eventually fade, economists say. These brief buying sprints make it difficult for Wall Street and the Federal Reserve to understand the true strength of consumer spending, which powers about 70% of the US economy. “In the near term, we could have some really strong consumer spending numbers, but that just makes things a little bit tricky for the Fed,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. “That means that the Fed just sits and waits to see what happens,” referring to the central bank’s upcoming interest rate decisions. Details from the report Retail sales in March were up across most categories, especially for car dealerships and home improvement stores. Spending on motor vehicles and parts was up a whopping 5.3% in March from February, the strongest monthly pace since January 2023. Meanwhile, sales at home improvement stores rose 3.3% during the same period. Retail sales declined at furniture shops (-0.7%), department stores (-0.3) and gas stations (-2.5). Since the Commerce Department’s figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, the March decline in sales at gas stations could reflect falling gas prices. “Consumers are expecting sharply higher prices the next year and are clearing the store shelves and picking up bargains while they can,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said in commentary issued Wednesday. Americans continued to eat out at restaurants and bars in March, with sales rising a robust 1.8% in March from the prior month. From a year earlier, those sales were up 4.8%. “The increase in bar and restaurant sales shows that consumers were more likely to spend on this discretionary experience,” Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. “We had been seeing waning momentum in this sector as the post-pandemic sugar high wore off and household budgets became constrained by higher prices and higher interest rates, but perhaps things aren’t as dour as the consumer sentiment figures would lead you to believe,” he added. A response to Trump’s trade policy While retail spending was up sharply in March, Americans’ attitudes toward the economy have been down in the dumps due to the Trump’s administration’s whipsawing trade policy, according to the University of Michigan’s latest consumer sentiment survey, among other surveys. Fed officials have taken notice of America’s souring economic mood, but the central bank is specifically tasked by Congress to help drive employment and stable prices. And it is unclear how souring consumer sentiment will translate into spending, and then eventually into both hiring and prices. But Trump’s tariff are widely expected to cause both inflation and unemployment to ratchet higher, putting the economy on a path toward “ stagflation ” — a scenario of stagnant or negative growth and rising unemployment coupled with accelerating prices. ﻿ Stiff tariffs won’t usher in the economic success President Donald Trump is seeking, according to most economists, but cementing America's dominance in artificial intelligence could. Photo Illustration by Jason Lancaster/CNN/Getty Images Related article Trump is trying to reinvent 1950 with his tariffs. He should be planning for 2050 “A tariff is like a negative supply shock. That’s a stagflationary shock, which is to say it makes both sides of the Fed’s dual mandate worse at the same time,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said last week at an event in New York. “Prices are going up while jobs are being lost and growth is coming down, and there is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock.” So far, Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel; 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that aren’t compliant with a free-trade agreement among the countries; a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports; a 25% tariff on cars, with separate tariffs on auto parts coming at a later date; and a 10% baseline tariffs on all US imports. A massive tariff hike on dozens of countries briefly went into effect on April 9, though Trump swiftly delayed the tariff hike that same day until July. He also introduced temporary exemptions for some electronic goods, and he has said separate tariffs are likely coming down the pike on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper and timber."

    "article_text": "In the European session, the main highlight was the release of the UK CPI report. The data missed expectations across the board and although it doesn't change much in the bigger picture (as the focus remains on tariffs), it will strengthen the market's expectation for a 25 bps cut from the BoE at the upcoming meeting. In the American session, we get the US Retail Sales report and the BoC Policy Decision. Some anecdotal data suggests that consumer spending is still holding up despite the bleak sentiment. Expectations of future spending is what the market cares about anyway. The BoC is expected to keep rates unchanged although following yesterday's lower than expected Canadian CPI , there are good chances for a cut as well. 12:30 GMT/08:30 ET - US March Retail Sales The US Retail Sales M/M is expected at 1.3% vs. 0.2% prior, while the ex-Autos figure is seen at 0.3% vs. 0.3% prior. The focus will be on the Control Group figure which is expected at 0.6% vs. 1.0% prior. Consumer spending has been stable in the past months which is something you would expect given the positive real wage growth and resilient labour market. More recently though, we’ve been seeing consumer sentiment cratering to record lows due to the ongoing trade wars which could weigh on spending going forward. US Retail Sales YoY 13:45 GMT/09:45 ET - Bank of Canada Policy Decision The BoC is expected to keep rates unchanged at 2.75%. As a reminder, the BoC cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 2.75% as expected at the last meeting amid concerns over weaker growth ahead due to the trade uncertainty and US tariffs. The central bank emphasized a cautious approach to future decisions, balancing the upward pressure on inflation against the downward pressure on weaker demand. The market sees a 57% probability of a rate cut today and a total of 50 bps of easing by year-end.

    "article_text": "(RNS) — During Holy Week, which began with Palm Sunday (April 13), we remember the last days of Jesus before he was arrested, tortured and killed for challenging the religious and political orthodoxy of his time. Jesus stressed compassion and love over scrupulous observance of religious rules. He refused to join in violence, whether to defend or overthrow the state. He would not kowtow to kings and governors but instead spoke in defense of the poor and marginalized. He fed the hungry without demanding anything in return. He healed the sick and brought peace to those possessed by demons. He reached out with compassion to those who were ostracized for being different. Even sinners flocked to him because he personified the mercy of God. While the common people followed him, those in power derided him for upsetting the status quo. He did not come from the elites but was a carpenter who recruited his followers from fishermen. And when he preached, he told stories rather than quoting respected authorities. For all of this, the people loved him, but the establishment feared and hated him as a disruptive force. They did to him what they do to all troublemakers: They arrested, tortured and killed him. All over the world, Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of human rights lawyers and journalists who stand up for justice in the face of criminality, whether from gangs or governments. Most people are bullied into silence, but these few speak out against corruption and exploitation, and they meet the same opposition that Jesus did. They are arrested, tortured and killed. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of doctors and nurses who put their lives at risk caring for the wounded in war zones. They die when ambulances and hospitals are targeted with bombs, rockets and drones. In following the example of Jesus in caring for the sick, they meet the same fate as Jesus: death. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of refugees forced to flee war, gangs and political violence. They flee because they are politically or religiously different from those with guns. They flee to protect their children. They flee because they have no other option. Rather than being welcomed with Christian love, they are corralled into camps with dilapidated shelter, unsanitary conditions and insufficient food. They die in suffering as Jesus did. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of those sick with smallpox, Ebola, bubonic plague, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, cholera, flu, COVID-19, polio and measles. Most of these diseases are preventable, but only if adequately funded public health programs are made available. But rather than reaching out to the sick as Jesus did, we look the other way, foolishly hoping we will never get sick. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of exploited workers who can not make enough money to support their families and who can lose their jobs at the whim of a distant corporate office that only sees numbers on a spreadsheet. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of women and children trafficked and yet being treated as criminals and not as victims. Christ is again being crucified in the bodies of those with addictions who are shunned rather than being provided with treatment that saves lives and leads to recovery. The crucifixion of Christ continues today in the suffering and death of every living creature whose life has become a victim of our consumer economy and its impact on the climate. We hear Christ’s voice speaking of us, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.” But are we ignorant today? After World War II, many Germans claimed they did not know what was happening to the Jews, but too many did know. Today, no one can claim that they do not know what is happening to God’s children around the world. Print and broadcast media and the internet are filled with examples of Christ again being crucified in the bodies of his brothers and sisters, yet we look away because we do not want to see the face of the crucified Christ. We turn to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube or a streaming service to numb our minds and hearts to the reality of Christ being crucified again in our world. Where were you when they crucified my Lord?

    "article_text": "Should You Buy Rivian While It's Below $12? Howard Smith, The Motley Fool April 12, 2025 5 min read RIVN TSLA Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock hasn't been spared from the tariff-inspired market crash. The electric vehicle (EV) company doesn't manufacture overseas, but it still participates in a global supply chain and is reliant on a strong U.S. consumer economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 , Nasdaq Composite , and Russell 2000 each hit 52-week lows as the market panicked over President Donald Trump's global tariff plans. Rivian stock plunged as well, punctuating a 20% drop over the last three months. That could be a buying opportunity for investors as Rivian enters a critical and transformational period. One Wall Street analyst who recently hosted a talk by Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe does believe now is the time to jump into Rivian stock . \"Pull the trigger\" on Rivian Rivian's CEO has been making the rounds to Wall Street analysts, expressing what he sees as a big opportunity for his company. He spoke with analyst George Gianarikas at Canaccord Genuity 's recent 2025 Sustainability Summit and cited the \"extreme lack of choice\" among domestic EV models as one factor holding back EV sales growth. Scaringe reiterated that sentiment at the Wolfe Research Autos summit on March 18. He said that there were \"very few highly compelling choices\" at price points under $50,000. That's exactly the target market for Rivian's coming R2 SUV. One takeaway Gianarikas took from the summit was that he thinks now is a good time to \"pull the trigger\" on Rivian shares. Rivian's lower-priced R2 SUV should begin shipments next year. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Rivian aims to close the EV gap Investors paying attention could get into Rivian stock just as it fills a critical niche in the market. It's also a time when some of the larger legacy automakers are throttling back EV commitments and aspirations. Rivian's CEO thinks a lack of options for mass-market electric vehicles for under $50,000 has led to the lag in U.S. adoption compared to China and Europe. He wants Rivian's coming R2 SUV to address that gap. Gianarikas agrees and thinks Rivian will soon be the leader of non- Tesla EV manufacturers in the U.S. He called the opportunity \"timely\" and said Rivian has the chance to become \"the next American auto icon.\" The EV leader itself looks to be giving Rivian an opening, too. Investors and consumers alike have become increasingly frustrated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his pivot into politics. It's very likely that damage to Tesla's brand, and frustration with Musk's public persona, has led to some amount of lost sales. Story continues Tesla's first-quarter vehicle sales came in much below already lowered estimates. Whether that's from consumer protests or sluggish overall EV demand, Rivian's R2 and the even smaller and less expensive R3 could be the models to fill the gap. Remember the risk profile Gianarikas went as far as to say, \"It's Rivian's moment.\" He is right that it could be. The lack of EV options under $50,000 certainly puts Rivian in an opportunistic place with its R2 rollout coming next year. It has established its brand in the sector even with relatively low levels of sales. First-quarter deliveries were within expectations at about 8,600 units. Rivian expects deliveries to be relatively flat or slightly down this year versus 2024 as it prepares to start R2 production. Those aren't unexpected results and estimates. Risk remains, though, in how the R2 production ramp-up and reception from consumers will play out. The Canaccord analyst summed it up well, writing: The rubber will/should hit the road with the R2. The price is right. As are the features. As are the aesthetics. After years of hard work with the right vertically integrated strategy, Rivian's time to scale and break into the American consciousness is coming soon. It's a good setup for Rivian. But there are many things out of its control, including consumer interest in EVs and a strong enough economy to support big-ticket purchases. Only investors with sufficient risk tolerance should own the shares. And even then, with only a proper allocation based on the risk profile. The time seems right, however, especially with Rivian stock still below $12. Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?

    "article_text": "Reuters FILE PHOTO: The logo of Hyatt Hotels Corporation is pictured at the International Tourism Trade Fair (ITB) in Berlin, Germany, March 9, 2016. Hyatt Hotels is betting on India's rising population and consumer spending power to help the U.S. hotel chain keep up revenue growth in the double-digit percentage range in the Asian country this financial year, an executive said. Global hotel operators have been building diverse property portfolios in the world's most populous country, targeting its more affluent consumers, whose appetite for domestic travel has been strong since the relaxation of COVID curbs. Hyatt, which has roughly 325 of its more than 1,400 hotels in Asia Pacific, is looking to expand in the region, and \"India is a big part of that,\" Carina Chorengel, a senior executive, told Reuters on Wednesday. Hyatt said it plans to open six hotels in India, home to roughly 1.4 billion people, this year including in smaller cities from northern Ghaziabad to southern Kochi. Within five years, it is planning to double its hotel count in India to 100, Hyatt said. Live Events Many global brands, from fast-food restaurant operators to apparel sellers, have been downplaying the recent slowdown in Indian consumer spending to double down on the country to tap its growing middle class in the longer term. India's growing population, rapid urbanization with more people moving to its cities and their desire to travel more are the key reasons Hyatt is focusing more on India, Chorengel said. The hotel chain would also post revenue growth in the double-digit percentage range in India in fiscal 2026, after recording similar growth in previous years, said Sunjae Sharma, managing director of India and Southwest Asia at Hyatt. Late last year, rival Hilton Worldwide said it plans to quadruple the number of hotel rooms in its India pipeline in five years. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

    "article_text": "Summary We are reducing our 2025 estimate for GDP growth to 1.3% from 2.0%. Higher tariffs, lower spending by the federal government, and extreme market volatility may all weigh on consumer spending and business investment. We now expect GDP to grow 1.4% in 1Q25, 1.0% in 2Q, 1.4% in 3Q, and 1.4% in 4Q. Our 2026 growth estimate is 1.9%, down from 2.1%. We expect federal non-defense spending will decline through 1Q26 before settling at about 1% growth. This may pinch state and local spending and crimp employment at universities and government contractors. Unemployment is low at 4.2%. We expect consumer spending to grow, but at 1.4% compared with our previous estimate of 2.3%. Potentially higher inflation may reduce spending on durable and discretionary goods. Spending on services, such as rent and healthcare, historically is stable. But the stock market's volatility may curtail travel, recreation, and dining out. Indicators driven by a broad array of timely data point to 1Q growth, but the message is less emphatic and many of our concerns are not yet reflected in the numbers. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDP Nowcast was estimating a 1Q GDP decline of 0.3% (adjusted for imports of gold) on April 9. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Staff Nowcast for 1Q called for 2.6% growth on April 4.

    "article_text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Stocks surged Wednesday after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariffs. Investment adviser Kalei Cadinha Puaʻa, CEO of Cadinha and Company, says “this is definitely a step in the right direction.” “We’re hopeful that through negotiations with the 75 countries who are willing to negotiate with administration, that maybe they can drive us to zero-tariff policy, which you know, in the capital markets that would be heroic and and I think at that point, that’s where sustainable gains can be expected,” she said. “We’re very concerned with the dynamics going on geopolitically between the United States and China. We’re a consumer-led economy and so we’re very dependent on the low cost of goods that we import in from China, so the effects of this breakdown in negotiations and tariff rates going higher and higher is not a good sign, and we’ll be watching it very closely,” she said. For those worried about their 401K, Cadinha Puaʻa had the following advice: “Our recommendation is to move towards quality and weight because the announcement that came out today that rallied the market was one that’s just saying, hey, we’re going to put a pause on this for 90 days. So that gives us three months for them to negotiate and figure out, you know, if these policies will turn back on. So the uncertainty is so great. So in a time where uncertainty goes up, then it’s a time for investors to really kind of err on the side of of quality of investing in quality assets. “The second thing is don’t be afraid to reach out to professionals. You don’t have to have an individual person to be working with. If you’re in a 401K, there’s always a 1-800 number that you can call and speak to someone, but this is a time where I really want to encourage investors to speak with professionals because we are going through some really dicey times right now.” Copyright 2025 Hawaii News Now.

Subscribe now New Delhi: India’s electronics exports could more than double to $50 billion per year by 2030 as part of the country’s efforts to take a high seat in the global electronics supply chain, according to three senior industry executives who regularly consult the ministry on the electronics sector. This surge is expected to be driven by the IT ministry’s push for raising the share of locally manufactured components for smartphones, laptops, as well as semiconductor chips, both by local as well as foreign companies. On Tuesday, Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said India’s annual electronics exports to the world crossed ₹ 2 trillion ($23 billion) in FY25. “This marks a 54% growth over FY24,\" he said, adding that electronics production has grown 5x at a compounded annual rate of more than 17% over the past decade. “Exports grew even faster, rising 6x since 2015 at a CAGR of over 20%,\" the minister said. Now, the three executives cited above said India’s latest moves can help the country continue this pace of growth, crossing what one of them said is “an important milestone\" as trade tensions globally, and especially between the US and China, continue to escalate.

This person added that electronics is an obvious candidate driven by the demand for cutting-edge technology in all industries, for which key component makers need to be present in India. “The current set of incentives can have a big impact in attracting foreign companies to set up shop locally,\" the executive said. Incentive scheme As part of the incentive scheme notified by the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) on Tuesday, the Centre will offer companies ranging up to 10% of annual turnover for electronics components mostly used in smartphones, and up to 25% of capital expenditure incurred in locally building equipment and machinery used in the electronics industry. Also read | Electronics maker Indkal Tech looks set to raise $100 million by June The net incentive outlay will span $2.7 billion across six years. A key part of the scheme is the eligibility for foreign companies to access these incentives. “The exact contours will be chalked out for foreign companies by keeping in mind India’s best interests,\" Vaishnaw said. “Details of how the foreign incentives will work will be revealed later.\" Each of these moves will cumulatively help India cross $50 billion in annual electronics exports within five years, each of the above-cited executives said. Vaishnaw, without putting a figure, said that exports of electronics “will grow more than its past decade’s growth\". As per these officials that Mint spoke with, India’s electronics exports have been pegged to grow at 17% CAGR until 2030. Stakeholders said that the growth pace, while being consistent with the past decade, is more important than before. Also read | Why India’s electronics sector is least at risk from Trump's tariff scrutiny “Achieving 17% annual growth at an industry size of nearly $25 billion is a far bigger task than doing it over the past decade, when India’s export of electronics were practically non-existent,\" the second executive cited above said, also requesting anonymity. Once achieved, electronics exports alone will account for 10% of India’s overall electronics economy, which is pegged to cross $500 billion in net annual revenue by 2030. Ankush Wadhera, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) India, said India’s current incentives scheme will “certainly\" help generate greater domestic value. “More importantly, it will help India establish a more sophisticated electronics supply chain in the country, which in the long run will drive greater value of exports,\" he said. Ashok Chandak, president of industry body India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (Iesa), told Mint that ramping up exports could be a crucial thing going forward. “Even if the domestic consumer economy is not soaring, focusing on exports can help India fill that gap and push for its targeted economic growth in the long run,\" Chandak said. Also read | Electronics manufacturing firms tipped to outperform indices this year The move is important for India in attempting to close the huge gap with China. On 6 February, data released by China’s ministry of industry and information technology (MIIT) said that in 2024, it exported 143 million laptops, 814 million phones, and over 298 billion integrated circuits. These exports cumulatively amounted to net export revenue of $2.2 trillion for China. India’s export value, thus, accounts for around 1.5% that of China’s.

    "article_text": "Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Two weeks ago, we outlined a hedging strategy for the equity markets, highlighting the risks of a consumer spending slowdown and the S & P 500's vulnerability at the 5,700-5775 resistance level , with a downside target of 5,400. Since then, the SPDR S & P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) has declined significantly, dropping more than 10% after breaking below the critical $500 support level, validating our concerns. With this move, we're taking profits on our SPY May 16 $575/545 put vertical position (a 298% return on investment), which provided a hedge against portfolio downside. However, the bearish outlook persists, driven by escalating macroeconomic risks, including the latest tariff developments, concerns over the risk-free nature of U.S. Treasurys and a projected U.S. economic slowdown due to the most aggressive levies in over a century. We're now shifting to selling options premiums with updated downside targets for the S & P 500 that would effectively erase the AI-led rally of the past two years. Market timing The S & P 500 , as represented by SPY, has broken below the $500 support level, confirming a bearish trend with significant momentum to the downside. The index's rapid decline from the $570 resistance zone has exceeded our initial $540 target, and the technical setup now points to further downside towards $470 and $430, aligning with historical support levels from early 2023 and late 2022. The VIX spiking to 49 reflects heightened market fear and elevated options premiums, making it an opportune time to sell call verticals for bearish exposure. Market valuation and sentiment The S & P 500's forward PE ratio has contracted further to 19.2x, reflecting the recent market decline, but it remains 2% above the 10-year average of 18.8x, suggesting valuations are still at risk of additional compression in a slowing economy. Bearish thesis: Consumer spending slowdown: The Conference Board's future expectations index, which fell to a 12-year low in March, continues to signal a significant slowdown in consumer spending. Depleted savings and rising debt levels, as highlighted by warnings from Delta, Nike, and Walmart, are exacerbating this trend. Tariff developments: On April 2, new tariffs were implemented, marking the most aggressive levies in over 100 years. These tariffs are expected to disrupt global trade, increase costs for businesses, and further dampen consumer spending, adding pressure on corporate earnings and economic growth. U.S. Treasury concerns: Growing concerns about the risk-free nature of U.S. Treasurys have emerged as the aggressive tariff policies raise fears of inflationary pressures and potential fiscal strain. This uncertainty is eroding confidence in traditional safe-haven assets, contributing to broader market instability. Economic slowdown: The U.S. economy is expected to face a general slowdown as a result of these tariffs, which are likely to reduce global demand, disrupt supply chains, and increase costs. This environment threatens the earnings outlook for S & P 500 companies, particularly those reliant on consumer spending and international markets. Technical breakdown: SPY's break below $500 confirms a bearish trend, with updated downside targets of $470 and $430, levels that would wipe out the AI-led rally of the past two years, reflecting the severity of the current market correction. The trade To continue seeking bearish exposure while capitalizing on elevated options premiums, we're recommending selling an upside call vertical on SPY with the May 23 $500/540 Call Vertical @ $18.36 Credit. This entails: Selling the May 23 $500 call @ $26.04 Buying the May 23 $540 call @ $7.68 The maximum reward is $1,836 if SPY is below $500 at expiration. The maximum risk is $2,164 if SPY is above $540 at expiration. View this trade with updated prices at OptionsPlay . This strategy allows you to maintain bearish exposure while collecting a substantial premium due to the elevated volatility in the options market. With SPY's technical breakdown and mounting macroeconomic pressures—including the impact of aggressive tariffs, U.S. Treasurys concerns, and an expected economic slowdown—this call vertical positions you to profit from further downside towards $470 and $430, with limited risk.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways By Joe Cash, Yukun Zhang and Ethan Wang BEIJING (Reuters) - China hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump singling out the world's second-largest economy for tariffs of more than 100% by raising additional duties on American products to 84% on Wednesday, deepening the trade war between the two superpowers. Beijing also imposed restrictions on 18 U.S. companies, mostly in defence-related industries, adding to the 60 or so American firms punished over Trump's tariffs. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The move comes after Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on China unless it withdrew its retaliatory levies on the United States, taking total new U.S. duties on Chinese goods this year to 104%. Beijing announced in response it would also raise its levies on U.S. goods by 50%, adding to the 34% increase previously announced and due to be implemented on Thursday. \"The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes of China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system,\" China's finance ministry said in a statement. Trump has imposed \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of economies he accuses of \"ripping off\" the U.S. by selling goods into the world's largest consumer economy while maintaining trade barriers that inhibit U.S. firms' market access. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But he has singled out China for the most punishing taxes, setting the stage for a standoff between the world's top two economies. In signs that bilateral ties could deteriorate further, China's culture and tourism ministry late on Wednesday issued a travel advisory for citizens visiting the U.S., citing recent \"deterioration\" of economic and trade relations. Shortly after, the Ministry of Education followed with an alert for students considering studying in the U.S. state of Ohio, saying that a recent state education bill contained \"negative\" China-related provisions. Travel and education are among the top U.S. services exports to China. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement TRADE SURPLUS 'INEVITABLE' Earlier on Wednesday, China released a white paper on U.S.-China commercial ties in which it said Beijing did not deliberately pursue a trade surplus. \"The trade imbalance in goods between China and the U.S. is both an inevitable result of structural issues in the U.S. economy and a consequence of the comparative advantages and international division of labour between the two countries,\" the report said. China's trade surplus with the U.S. widened to $295.4 billion last year from $279.1 billion in 2023, according to U.S. Census data. The goods trade gap peaked in 2018 at $418 billion, the same year Trump, in his first term as president, imposed tariffs on Chinese outbound shipments. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The first U.S.-China trade war concluded with Beijing agreeing to a \"Phase 1\" trade deal with Washington in 2020 in which it agreed to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over a two-year period. Beijing failed to meet its targets when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, but said in its white paper that it had \"scrupulously fulfilled its obligations\" by taking steps to boost its purchases of U.S. goods and accused Washington of having reneged on the deal. \"The U.S. has systematically escalated economic and other forms of pressure against China, the report said. \"Concurrently, the U.S. has promoted false narratives related to human rights, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang and the pandemic.\" China also talked up its efforts to boost its trade in services with the U.S., economic activity that the Trump administration has not factored into its \"reciprocal\" duties. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement WAR OF ATTRITION China is bracing for an economic war of attrition as it tries to court other markets in Asia, Europe and the world. But other countries have much smaller markets than America and are also taking a hit from the tariffs. During Trump's first term, China frustrated U.S. financial and professional services firms by holding up licence applications and carrying out office raids. But Beijing cannot dip into the same playbook this time as it is trying to attract fresh foreign investment to bolster its economic recovery. Still, Chinese policymakers are backing themselves to go toe-to-toe with the Trump administration a second time. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"If the U.S. insists on escalating trade restrictions, China has both the determination and the means to respond forcefully - and will do so,\" a commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement accompanying the white paper's launch. \"There are no winners in a trade war. China does not want one, but the government will never allow the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people to be harmed or taken away.\" Ordinary Chinese people have started to voice their concern. \"The situation has already reached a blatant financial and trade war on the global stage,\" said Ling Wanhua, a 20-year-old Shanghai resident. \"It's already hard for college graduates to find jobs. If the overall environment gets worse, the employment situation for graduates will be even worse.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As worries mount, China began censoring some tariff-related content online, with hashtags and searches for \"tariff\" or \"104\" mostly blocked on social media platform Weibo. Reuters reported China's top leaders planned to convene a meeting as early as Wednesday to discuss measures to boost the economy and stabilise the capital markets. \"I think the 104% tariffs are kind of exaggerated,\" said Wu Lina, a 68-year-old tourist holidaying in Shanghai. \"This president, the way this country treats China, oh my God, it will definitely cause some harm.\" (Reporting by Joe Cash, Nicoco Chan, Ethan Wang, Yukun Zhang, Xiuhao Chen and Bu Shi; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Clarence Fernandez, Kate Mayberry and Alex Richardson) About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Agencies China on Wednesday called its trade surplus with the United States an inevitability and warned it had the \"determination and means\" to continue the fight if Trump kept hitting Chinese goods with tariffs to try and bring it down. U.S. President Donald Trump delivered on his threat to impose duties totalling 104% on Chinese products, signing an executive order on Tuesday that took effect after Beijing ignored his demand that it withdraw retaliatory levies it had announced after Trump unveiled an initial round of tariffs. Trump has imposed \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of economies he accuses of \"ripping off\" the U.S. by selling goods into the world's largest consumer economy while maintaining trade barriers that inhibit U.S. firms' market access.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news Restaurant stocks fall as investors fear recession, sales slowdown By Amelia Lucas, CNBC • Published April 7, 2025 • Updated on April 7, 2025 at 2:02 pm BOOKMARKER Mike Blake | Reuters Restaurant stocks, from McDonald's to Chipotle, fell as investors feared a coming recession. While President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have much direct impact on eateries, another pullback in consumer spending would hurt restaurants. Fast-food chains have historically fared the best during economic downturns. Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming. U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE \"We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,\" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors. Shares of Starbucks fell more than 2%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business , has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs. \"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday. Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla , coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations. Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images A sign is posted in front of an Applebee's restaurant on June 12, 2024 in Hayward, California. Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands , which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped less than 1% and 2%, respectively. Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell 1% and shares of Wingstop sank less than 1%. Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's , Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading. Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants. Few restaurant stocks were in the green. Shares of Dutch Bros ., a fast-growing rival of Starbucks, rose more than 4% in afternoon trading after tumbling nearly 10% on Friday. Cava gained more than 6%. If tariffs encourage companies to return to the U.S., these companies will benefit Charts suggest S&P 500 sell-off will continue until this level, says Carter Worth These oversold stocks could lead the way if the market finds a way to rebound Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is weathering the historic market rout, still up 9% this year Also on CNBC Wedbush says Texas Roadhouse is owning casual dining.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now India's ongoing consumer slowdown, especially in urban areas, has begun to show in the balance sheets of consumer-facing companies. Earnings previews suggest they will report disappointing numbers for the March 2025 quarter across categories. How will India’s consumer economy close FY25 and what can we expect from the new financial year? Mint explains. Also Read | Bumpy: Impact of Karnataka HC ban on bike taxis What are earnings previews predicting? Brokerage firms say they expect consumer packaged goods firms to report 6-8% growth in sales for the quarter although several are likely to see a drop in their Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) and net profits. Equities brokerage firm IIFL Capital wrote this month that consumer demand continues to be “subdued\" and that some of the growth in companies’ topline will likely come from price hikes. Besides, the industry’s margins will be squeezed because inflation is driving up costs of inputs such as wheat, coffee, and palm oil. Trump’s new tariffs may drive these costs up further. Also Read | Mint Primer | Clear signal: How equity deal can play out for Vi What are consumer companies saying? FMCG firms are warning investors about a consumer slowdown. Marico and Dabur told investors in a note that rural demand is growing ahead of urban but high inflation and stagnant wages are hurting sales overall. Marico said sales of its flagship Parachute coconut oil were affected as it hiked prices and reduced package sizes. For Dabur, a delayed and unusually short winter hurt the company’s sales overall as customers bought fewer bottles of the company’s Chyawanprash and honey, both marketed for the winter season. Dabur added that the general trade channel was hurting even as quick commerce and supermarkets grew. So is the situation dire for all consumer categories? No. There are pockets of optimism. Consumer durables companies are expecting a good season this year, especially for air conditioner sales. Car makers will also likely report good sales for the March 2025 quarter as they pushed discounts and deals for the Eid and Navratri festive season. The government’s Vahan portal data shows passenger vehicle sales for March 2025 grew 5% year on year while electric 2-wheelers rose 7%. Also Read | Mint Primer: Do AIF investors need easier accreditation? So will India’s consumer economy be back on track in FY26? Perhaps. There are encouraging signs. For instance, an early and extremely hot summer is expected to drive sales of ACs and fans. Nomura’s brokerage arm wrote in a note this month that AC primary sales likely grew by 20-25% in the March quarter as the IMD forecasted a fierce summer and retailers stocked up. Besides, AC makers like Blue Star said they will likely hike prices this month. Similarly, leading car makers including Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki have hiked prices. Besides, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee is likely to cut rates again this week, boosting consumer demand. Are there risks to this turnaround? Yes. The IMD has predicted a normal monsoon so far, but it will release an official update only later this month. But, a deficit or a surplus in this year’s monsoon could hurt rural areas which are currently fuelling consumer demand. Besides, the US’ recently imposed tariffs has thrown a spanner in the global economy. The aftershocks of these tariffs and resulting global uncertainty could hurt jobs and income growth in India’s export-oriented industries such as IT services. In the long run, these changes could hurt discretionary incomes of urban, premium consumers, hurting growth in consumer demand.

Trump’s latest move to impose tariffs of at least 10% on all imports to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war. The tariff imposed for China was 34% and that nation said it would impose its own equivalent tariff on all U.S. products.

The only exception was Wayfair Inc., which saw a gain, rising from $25.09 at Thursday’s close to $26.05 on Friday.

While speaking News18 outside the Parliament, Shashi Tharoor said, \"Congress wants clarification from the government about what was going on. We are reading in newspapers about the Americans demanding that India should lower tariffs on agriculture products and so on. This raises some real questions. Because our farmers are in a bad shape already. We have seen the farmers protests.

I can partially understand that because some negotiation is supposed to be ongoing but some basic principles that the nation can be reassured by would have been welcomed,\" Tharoor added. When asked about whether there was a silver lining as the tariffs on India are lower than countries like China and Vietnam, Tharoor told News18, \"Calculations have to be done. Some countries that are competing with us for the same export market have tariffs higher than us. This may represent opportunities for Indian manufacturers. But there are other areas where we will be at a disadvantage, where our competition maybe with countries that are only charged 10% tariffs. So, all of these calculations have to be made. It will be helpful that government takes the public into confidence into some of these things.\" United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a major tariff package imposing duties on more than 180 countries, calling them 'kind' and 'discounted'. Announced in the White House Rose Garden, the move marked one of the most extensive trade actions by the US in decades, reversing years of trade liberalisation.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news Fintech stocks such as Affirm, PayPal plunge on concern Trump tariffs will hurt consumer spending By MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC • Published April 3, 2025 • Updated on April 3, 2025 at 4:55 pm BOOKMARKER Danielle DeVries | CNBC Fintech and credit card stocks were hit particularly hard in the market rout that followed President Donald Trump's tariff announcement. Analysts expressed concern about consumer spending and credit. Affirm suffered the biggest decline in the group, falling 19%. The global market rout on Thursday, sparked by President Donald Trump's announcement of widespread tariffs, had an outsized effect on fintech companies and credit card issuers that are closely tied to consumer spending and credit. Affirm , which offers buy now, pay later purchasing options, plunged 19%, while stock trading app Robinhood slid 10% and payments company PayPal fell 8%. American Express and Capital One each tumbled 10%, and Discover was down more than 8%. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE President Trump on Wednesday laid out the U.S. \" reciprocal tariff \" rates that more than 180 countries and territories, including European Union members, will face under his sweeping new trade policy. Trump said his plan will set a 10% baseline tariff across the board, but that number is much higher for some countries. The announcement sent stocks reeling, wiping out nearly $2 trillion in value from the S&P 500 , and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 6%, its worst day since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The sell-off was especially notable for companies most exposed to consumer spending and global supply chains, including payment providers and lenders. Fintech companies that rely on transaction volume or installment-based lending could see both revenue and credit performance deteriorate. \"When you go down the spectrum, that's when you have more cyclical risk, more exposure to tariffs,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, citing PayPal and Affirm as businesses at risk. He said bigger companies in the space \"are more defensive\" and better positioned. Visa , Mastercard and Fiserv held up better on Thursday. Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho, said bank processors such as Fiserv are less exposed to tariff volatility. \"It's considered a safe haven,\" he said. Affirm executives have previously said rising prices might increase demand for their products. Chief Financial Officer Rob O'Hare said higher prices could push more consumers toward buy now, pay later services. \"If tariffs result in higher prices for consumers, we're there to help,\" O'Hare said at a Stocktwits fireside chat last month . Affirm CEO Max Levchin has offered similar comments. However, James Friedman, an analyst at SIG, told CNBC that delinquencies become a concern. He compared Affirm to private-label store cards, and pointed to historical trends in credit performance during downturns, noting that \"private label delinquency rates run roughly double\" in a recession when compared to traditional credit cards. \"You have to look at who's overexposed to discretionary,\" he said. Affirm did not provide a comment but pointed to recent remarks from its executives.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with News Fintech stocks such as Affirm, PayPal plunge on concern Trump tariffs will hurt consumer spending By MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC • Published April 3, 2025 • Updated on April 3, 2025 at 4:55 pm BOOKMARKER Danielle DeVries | CNBC Fintech and credit card stocks were hit particularly hard in the market rout that followed President Donald Trump's tariff announcement. Analysts expressed concern about consumer spending and credit. Affirm suffered the biggest decline in the group, falling 19%. The global market rout on Thursday, sparked by President Donald Trump's announcement of widespread tariffs, had an outsized effect on fintech companies and credit card issuers that are closely tied to consumer spending and credit. Stream Philadelphia News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC10. WATCH HERE Affirm , which offers buy now, pay later purchasing options, plunged 19%, while stock trading app Robinhood slid 10% and payments company PayPal fell 8%. American Express and Capital One each tumbled 10%, and Discover was down more than 8%. President Trump on Wednesday laid out the U.S. \" reciprocal tariff \" rates that more than 180 countries and territories, including European Union members, will face under his sweeping new trade policy. Trump said his plan will set a 10% baseline tariff across the board, but that number is much higher for some countries. The announcement sent stocks reeling, wiping out nearly $2 trillion in value from the S&P 500 , and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 6%, its worst day since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The sell-off was especially notable for companies most exposed to consumer spending and global supply chains, including payment providers and lenders. Fintech companies that rely on transaction volume or installment-based lending could see both revenue and credit performance deteriorate. \"When you go down the spectrum, that's when you have more cyclical risk, more exposure to tariffs,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, citing PayPal and Affirm as businesses at risk. He said bigger companies in the space \"are more defensive\" and better positioned. Visa , Mastercard and Fiserv held up better on Thursday. Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho, said bank processors such as Fiserv are less exposed to tariff volatility. \"It's considered a safe haven,\" he said. Affirm executives have previously said rising prices might increase demand for their products. Chief Financial Officer Rob O'Hare said higher prices could push more consumers toward buy now, pay later services. \"If tariffs result in higher prices for consumers, we're there to help,\" O'Hare said at a Stocktwits fireside chat last month . Affirm CEO Max Levchin has offered similar comments. However, James Friedman, an analyst at SIG, told CNBC that delinquencies become a concern. He compared Affirm to private-label store cards, and pointed to historical trends in credit performance during downturns, noting that \"private label delinquency rates run roughly double\" in a recession when compared to traditional credit cards. \"You have to look at who's overexposed to discretionary,\" he said. Affirm did not provide a comment but pointed to recent remarks from its executives.

    "article_text": "Updated / Thursday, 3 Apr 2025 17:07 Donald Trump announced China would be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed earlier this year China urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest tariffs and vowed countermeasures to safeguard its own interests, after President Donald Trump declared sweeping levies on US trading partners around the world. The US move disregards the balance of interests reached in multilateral trade negotiations over the years and the fact that it has long benefited greatly from international trade, China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" the ministry said, as the world's largest economies look set to spiral deeper into a trade war that stands to upend global supply chains. Mr Trump announced China would be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54% and close to the 60% figure he had threatened while on the campaign trail. Chinese exporters, like those from other economies around the world, will face a 10% baseline tariff, as part of the new 34% levy, on almost all goods shipped to the world's largest consumer economy from Saturday before the remaining, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" take effect from 9 April. Chinese producers sell more than $400 billion worth of goods annually to the US The average US tariff on Chinese goods will be 76%, according to Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and chief economist at the State Department for the last year of the Biden administration. Mr Trump also signed an executive order closing a trade loophole known as \"de minimis\" that has allowed low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the US duty-free. Mr Trump had ordered the US Trade Representative to determine whether China was living up to its commitments under the 2020 \"Phase 1\" US-China trade agreement by 1 April. The deal required China to increase purchases of US exports by $200 billion (€181bn) over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. China bought $154bn in US goods in 2017, before the trade war began, Chinese customs data shows and that figure rose to $164bn last year. Worldwide tariffs \"Arguably, President Trump's tariffs elsewhere will cause the most headaches,\" said Ruby Osman, a China expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \"Chinese firms have been rerouting trade through places like Vietnam and Mexico to avoid US sanctions, but these markets are now being hit with significant tariffs of their own.\" \"China+1\" strategies caught on among Chinese exporters and multinational companies that had made the production powerhouse central to their supply chains during Mr Trump's first term. But with India, Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia - the countries that benefited most from this shift - facing tariffs of between 24% and 46%, the cost advantage of relocating manufacturing out of China is significantly diminished. European Union Chamber of Commerce in China president Jens Eskelund said many companies had adjusted their supply chains specifically to limit their exposure to US-China trade tensions and that \"any subsequent restructuring of supply chains will not be possible overnight\".

The American tariffs will spur more Chinese trade with other places, from Europe to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" he added. But Chinese producers have described shifting to alternative markets as a \"rat race\", resulting in price wars among exporters that risk fanning deflationary forces in the world's second-largest economy as firms continue to squeeze shrinking margins. China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at \"around 5%\" despite Mr Trump's tariff salvos which could halt a largely export-led recovery underway since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put an even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war. \"China knew this day was coming well in advance, the relatively restrained stimulus announcements at March's Two Sessions were a calculation, not an oversight,\" Ms Osman said, referring to China's annual parliamentary meetings. \"Beijing has purposefully kept more in reserve, both in terms of domestic stimulus and retaliatory measures, in case it needs to respond more forcefully,\" she added. China's President Xi Jinping might also enter the fray, following reports the two leaders could meet in June in the United States. \"Trump and Xi are locked in a paradox of pressure and pride,\" said Craig Singleton, senior fellow at Washington-based research institute Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"Trump's strategy mixes maximum pressure with sudden diplomatic overtures - he sees leverage and engagement as complementary. Xi, by contrast, is methodical and risk-averse, relying on delay and discipline. But here's the dilemma: if he refuses to engage, the pressure escalates; if he engages too soon, he risks looking weak,\" he added. \"Neither wants to be seen as folding first, but delay could deepen the standoff.\" More stories on News Asia Business US US tariffs World Accreditation: Reuters"

    "article_text": "Short-sighted politics steering Sri Lanka back towards bankruptcy - Dilith April 3, 2025 04:04 pm Leader of the ‘Sarvajana Balaya’ alliance Parliamentarian Dilith Jayaweera has issued a stern warning to the incumbent government on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump imposing a set of reciprocal tariffs on a several countries including on Sri Lanka. MP Dilith Jayaweera noted that Sri Lanka’s failure to anticipate US President Trump’s 44% reciprocal tax is a ‘self-inflicted’ wound. Issuing a statement on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter), the parliamentarian stressed that ‘short-sighted’ politics is steering Sri Lanka back towards bankruptcy. He added, “With the U.S. buying 23% of our exports ($2.9B in 2024), key industries—apparel ($1.92B), rubber ($330M) (for which U.S. is our largest individual buyer), tea, seafood, gems & more—are at grave risk. Sri Lanka is one of the countries facing the highest Trump-era tariffs.” Meanwhile, earlier today, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a high-level committee to review the potential economic impact of the newly imposed reciprocal tariffs by the US President and to provide recommendations to the government. The committee comprises key economic policymakers and industry experts, including the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI), the Chairman of the Export Development Board (EDB), and the Director General of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Additionally, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chief Economic Policy Advisor of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando, and prominent business figures Ashroff Omar, Sharad Amalean, and Saif Jafferjee have been named in the committee. This initiative aims to assess challenges arising from the US tariff adjustments and propose strategic measures to mitigate any adverse effects on Sri Lanka’s economy and trade. The committee is expected to submit its findings and recommendations to the government in the coming weeks. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. The sweeping duties, which drew bewildered condemnation from many long-standing U.S. allies who found themselves tagged with unexpectedly high tariff rates, promise to erect new barriers around the world’s largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. In a statement delivered from the White House Rose Garden, Trump described the measure as a “declaration of economic independence” and vowed to boost domestic production by levelling the playing field with foreign competitors. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. Earlier, U.S. stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. U.S. stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since mid-February. The new tariff structure introduces a 10 per cent flat rate on all imports and applies higher rates to several major trading partners. At 49 per cent, Cambodia faces the steepest tariff, followed closely by Vietnam at 46 per cent, Sri Lanka at 44 per cent, and China at 34 per cent. Trump also announced a 26 per cent “discounted reciprocal tariff” on imports from India. Sri Lanka faces the sixth highest tariff rates in the world, while currently 25% of the country’s total exports go to the US. The “reciprocal” tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. --With Agencies Inputs"

    "article_text": "Trump slaps 10% tariff on all imports Apr 03, 2025 News …higher rates for some countries WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) – President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would impose a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the U.S. and higher duties on dozens of other countries, including some of the United States’ biggest trading partners, deepening a trade war that he kicked off on his return to the White House. A bar chart showing US trade deficits and surpluses The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world’s largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. U.S. stock futures sank after the announcement , following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. U.S. stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since February. “It’s our declaration of independence,” Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Chinese imports will be hit with a 34% tariff, according to Trump, on top of the 20% levy that he previously imposed on that country. Close U.S. allies were not spared, including the European Union, which faces a 20% tariff. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the higher penalties will take effect on April 9 and will apply to about 60 countries in all. The baseline 10% tariff will take effect on Saturday, the official said. The “reciprocal” tariffs , Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. “In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade,” Trump said. Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, already face 25% tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday’s announcement. The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and “certain minerals that are not available in the United States,” according to a White House fact sheet. Following his remarks, Trump signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages – those valued at $800 or less – duty-free from China, known as “de minimis.” The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico’s cartels to produce the deadly drug, U.S. anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Trump’s barrage of penalties has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since the middle of the last century. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Trump has already imposed 20% duties on all imports from China and 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products . His advisers say the tariffs will return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. Businesses have complained that Trump’s barrage of threats has made it difficult to plan their operations. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise.

Reuters April 03, 2025 / 14:31 IST China bought $154 billion in U.S. goods in 2017, before the trade war began, Chinese customs data shows, and that figure rose to $164 billion last year. China on Thursday urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest tariffs and vowed countermeasures to safeguard its own interests, after President Donald Trump declared sweeping levies on all U.S. trading partners around the world. The U.S. move disregards the balance of interests reached in multilateral trade negotiations over the years and the fact that it has long benefited greatly from international trade, China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad \"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" the ministry said, as the world's largest economies look set to spiral deeper into a trade war that stands to upend global supply chains. Trump on Wednesday announced China would be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54% and close to the 60% figure he had threatened while on the campaign trail. Chinese exporters, like those from other economies around the world, will face a 10% baseline tariff, as part of the new 34% levy, on almost all goods shipped to the world's largest consumer economy from Saturday before the remaining, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" take effect from April 9. Trump also signed an executive order closing a trade loophole known as \"de minimis\" that has allowed low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. duty free. Trump had ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether China was living up to its commitments under the 2020 \"Phase 1\" U.S.-China trade agreement by April 1. The deal required China to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad China bought $154 billion in U.S. goods in 2017, before the trade war began, Chinese customs data shows, and that figure rose to $164 billion last year. \"Arguably, President Trump's tariffs elsewhere will cause the most headaches,\" said Ruby Osman, a China expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \"Chinese firms have been rerouting trade through places like Vietnam and Mexico to avoid U.S. sanctions, but these markets are now being hit with significant tariffs of their own.\" \"China+1\" strategies caught on among Chinese exporters and multinational companies that had made the production powerhouse central to their supply chains during Trump's first term. But with India, Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia - the countries that benefited most from this shift - facing tariffs of between 24% and 46%, the cost advantage of relocating manufacturing out of China is significantly diminished. European Union Chamber of Commerce in China president Jens Eskelund said many companies had adjusted their supply chains specifically to limit their exposure to U.S.-China trade tensions and that \"any subsequent restructuring of supply chains will not be possible overnight.\" The extra levies could encourage China to step up its trade with alternative markets, but no other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, where Chinese producers sell more than $400 billion worth of goods annually. \"Trump's tariffs certainly won't help Chinese firms and will cause some real pain in some sectors, but they don't make any definitive mark on the Chinese economy,\" said William Hurst, Chong Hua Professor of Chinese Development at the University of Cambridge. \"U.S. exports are of declining importance to China. The American tariffs will spur more Chinese trade with other places, from Europe to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" he added. But Chinese producers have described shifting to alternative markets as a \"rat race\", resulting in price wars among exporters that risk fanning deflationary forces in the world's second-largest economy as firms continue to squeeze shrinking margins. China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at \"around 5%\" despite Trump's tariff salvos which could halt a largely export-led recovery underway since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put an even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war. \"China knew this day was coming well in advance, the relatively restrained stimulus announcements at March's Two Sessions were a calculation, not an oversight,\" Osman said, referring to China's annual parliamentary meetings. \"Beijing has purposefully kept more in reserve, both in terms of domestic stimulus and retaliatory measures, in case it needs to respond more forcefully,\" she added. China's President Xi Jinping might also enter the fray, following reports the two leaders could meet in June in the United States. \"Trump and Xi are locked in a paradox of pressure and pride,\" said Craig Singleton, senior fellow at Washington-based research institute Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"Trump's strategy mixes maximum pressure with sudden diplomatic overtures — he sees leverage and engagement as complementary. Xi, by contrast, is methodical and risk-averse, relying on delay and discipline. But here’s the dilemma: if he refuses to engage, the pressure escalates; if he engages too soon, he risks looking weak,\" he added. \"Neither wants to be seen as folding first, but delay could deepen the standoff.\" Reuters first published: Apr 3, 2025 02:31 pm Discover the latest Business News , Sensex , and Nifty updates.

    "article_text": "... By Shane Croucher and Hugh Cameron Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member The chances of a a U.S. recession this year have jumped from 40 percent to 60 percent off the back of President Donald Trump 's announcement of widespread tariffs, according to major Wall Street bank JPMorgan. Why It Matters Even prior to the unveiling of the reciprocal tariffs, economists had warned that the expanding list of countries and items subject to import taxes could disrupt U.S. trade, strain domestic industries while intensifying America's inflationary struggles. Taken together, experts told Newsweek that this could push the U.S. into a recession in 2025. What to Know \"Disruptive U.S. policies have been recognized as the biggest risk to the global outlook all year,\" JPMorgan's chief economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a research note to clients published on Thursday. \"We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and possibly global economy into recession this year. An update of our probability scenario tree makes this point, raising the risk of a recession this year to 60%,\" Kasman added. In his long-awaited \" Liberation Day \" speech, Trump unveiled a 10 percent baseline tariff on all U.S. imports and reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries . The \"reciprocal tariffs\" target nations perceived as pursuing unfair trade practices, with rates as high as 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union , and 24 percent on Japan. ... While Trump had previously vowed to impose like-for-like duties on countries which tariff U.S. imports—\"Whatever they charge us, we're charging them,\" he said— in his speech he stated that the U.S. was not matching the duties directly and instead enacting what he dubbed \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs. Michael Feroli , chief economist at JPMorgan, described Trump's new tariffs as \"the largest tax increase\" since the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, which imposed a 10 percent surtax on individual and corporate income taxes in an effort to curb inflation and reduce the budget deficit during the Vietnam War . What People Are Saying Bruce Kasman, chief economist and head of global economic research at JPMorgan: \"The latest news reinforces our fears as U.S. trade policy has turned decisively less business-friendly than we had anticipated.\" Michael Feroli, chief economist at JP Morgan : \"On a static basis, today's announcement would raise just under $400 billion in revenue, or about 1.3% of GDP, which would be the largest tax increase since the Revenue Act of 1968. We estimate that today's announced measures could boost ... prices by 1-1.5% this year, and we believe the inflationary effects would mostly be realized in the middle quarters of the year.\" \"The resulting hit to purchasing power could take real disposable personal income growth in 2Q-3Q into negative territory, and with it the risk that real consumer spending could also contract in those quarters,\" he added. \"This impact alone could take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.\" President Trump said on Wednesday: \"My answer is very simple if they complain: If you want your tariff rate to be zero then you build your product right here in America because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America.\" Peter Ricchiuti, senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Newsweek: \" The tariffs will be matched by most targeted countries. Tariffs have never worked. They're prosperity killers.\" \"The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self inflicted,\" he added. \"Until the inauguration the U.S. was doing very well. Inflation was coming down, we had record corporate earnings and the highest stock prices ever seen.\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings said: \"This is a game-changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy. \"Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.\" What Happens Next? World leaders, in response to the latest duties, have vowed to respond with their own retaliatory measures on U.S. imports, with the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen stating that the continent was preparing \"countermeasures to protect our interests and out businesses if negotiations fail.\" Request Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial & AI Guidelines Add Newsweek as a preferred source on Google to see more of our trusted coverage when you search.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, DC, USA, April 2, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters INFO The US move disregards the balance of interests reached in multilateral trade negotiations over the years and the fact that it has long benefited greatly from international trade, the Chinese Commerce Ministry says BEIJING, China – China on Thursday, April 3, urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest tariffs and vowed countermeasures to safeguard its own interests, after President Donald Trump declared sweeping levies on all US trading partners around the world. The US move disregards the balance of interests reached in multilateral trade negotiations over the years and the fact that it has long benefited greatly from international trade, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

Then why is China crying. The answer lies in the article itself.

Importing so much from a country that uses it's money to build up it's military with a declared intent of challenging you doesn't make any sense at all. There's nothing that is imported from China that can't be obtained from other countries that don't have a hostile attitude. Why not 100% tariffs on China?

Interesting. -1 ( +3 / -4 ) quercetum Apr. 3 05:03 pm JST If all exports from China to the U.S were banned, it would only be 2.7% of China's gdp. China is doing fine. Popping the bubble and making real estate prices becoming more affordable is a great thing. Japan couldn't handle the bubble, could it. Look where they are now three decades later.

You think made in Vietnam stuffs were 100percent made in Vietnam? Of course not, much of the key components were made in China. If China cut that supply chain, the factories in Vietnam or other Asian countries will stop producing and that means stop exporting to your country. \"Uses it's money to build up it's military with a declared intent of challenging you doesn't make any sense at all. \" That is a reaction from the Chinese due to America's hostility, everyday we are helping your country's low income people can living in an affordable life in America otherwise they will suffer.

Everything is getting worse in the US, it has been stagnating for a long time now. There are no such things as democracy and freedom any more. The leader of the free worlds has become authoritarian and started turning back the clock. It is so obvious, only the rich is protected and free.

Put it into the file incinerator with all the others. If China was an open market for US goods, there would be some pain, but as a mostly closed market, meh. Hopefully, these tariffs will get Apple, MSFT, Cisco and other companies to pull their investments in China out. Not funding a potential war enemy is smarter than funding their military build-up purchasing things. Looking forward to Tik/Tok becoming disconnected from the CCP as well.

    "article_text": "Home Top Stories Trump announces 10% tariff on all imports, with higher rates for some... Top Stories US PRESIDENT Donald J. Trump speaks at an event in Kenosha, Wisconsin, US, April 18, 2017. — REUTERS WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would impose a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the US and higher duties on dozens of other countries, including some of the United States’ biggest trading partners, deepening a trade war that has rattled global markets and bewildered US allies. The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world’s largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. US stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. US stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since February. Chinese imports will be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed, bringing the total new levy to 54%. Close US allies were not spared, including the European Union, which faces a 20% tariff, and Japan, which is targeted for a 24% rate. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the higher penalties will take effect on April 9 and will apply to about 60 countries in all. The baseline 10% tariff will take effect on Saturday, the official said. The “reciprocal” tariffs, Mr. Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on US goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Mr. Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average US family by thousands of dollars. Canada and Mexico, the two largest US trading partners, already face 25% tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday’s announcement. The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and “certain minerals that are not available in the United States,” according to a White House fact sheet. Following his remarks, Mr. Trump signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages – those valued at $800 or less – duty-free from China, known as “de minimis.” The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico’s cartels to produce the deadly drug, US anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Mr. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Mr. Trump’s barrage of penalties has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since the middle of last century. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Mr. Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Mr. Trump previously imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. European leaders reacted with dismay, saying a trade war would hurt consumers and benefit neither side. “We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,” Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said. US Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would introduce legislation to end the tariffs. Such a bill has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress, however. “Trump just hit Americans with the largest regressive tax hike in modern history – massive tariffs on all imports. His reckless policies are not only crashing markets, they will disproportionately hurt working families,” Mr. Meeks said. – Reuters RELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR BIR may miss collection goal this year BSP to implement 24/7 payment system in 2026 Proposed tobacco tax cut unlikely to curb illicit trade — AER"

Click to play the content 0:00 / 0:00 China on Thursday urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest tariffs and vowed countermeasures to safeguard its own interests, after President Donald Trump declared sweeping levies on all U.S. trading partners around the world. The U.S. move disregards the balance of interests reached in multilateral trade negotiations over the years and the fact that it has long benefited greatly from international trade, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" the ministry said, as the world's largest economies look set to spiral deeper into a trade war that stands to upend global supply chains. Trump on Wednesday announced China would be hit with a 34% tariff, on top of the 20% he previously imposed earlier this year, bringing the total new levies to 54% and close to the 60% figure he had threatened while on the campaign trail. Chinese exporters, as with those from every other economy, will face a 10% baseline tariff, as part of the new 34% levy, on almost all goods shipped to the world's largest consumer economy from Saturday before the remaining, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" take effect from April 9. Trump also signed an executive order closing a trade loophole known as \"de minimis\" that has allowed low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. duty free. Trump had ordered the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether China was living up to its commitments under the 2020 \"Phase 1\" U.S.-China trade agreement by April 1. The deal had required China to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. China bought $153 billion in U.S. goods in 2017, before the trade war began, Chinese customs data shows, and that figure rose to $164 billion last year. U.S. stock indexes rebounded to close higher on Wednesday, WORLDWIDE TARIFFS \"Arguably, President Trump's tariffs elsewhere will cause the most headaches,\" said Ruby Osman, a China expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \"Chinese firms have been rerouting trade through places like Vietnam and Mexico to avoid U.S. sanctions, but these markets are now being hit with significant tariffs of their own.\" \"China+1\" strategies caught on among Chinese exporters and multinational companies that had made the production powerhouse central to their supply chains during Trump's first term. But with India, Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia - the countries that benefited most from this shift - facing tariffs of between 24% to 46%, the cost advantage of relocating manufacturing out of China is significantly diminished. Trump's tariffs could encourage China to step up its trade with alternative markets, but no other country currently comes even close to U.S. consumption power, where Chinese producers sell more than $400 billion worth of goods annually. \"Trump's tariffs certainly won't help Chinese firms and will cause some real pain in some sectors, but they don't make any definitive mark on the Chinese economy,\" said William Hurst, Chong Hua Professor of Chinese Development at the University of Cambridge. \"U.S. exports are of declining importance to China. The American tariffs will spur more Chinese trade with other places, from Europe to Southeast Asia and Africa,\" he added. But Chinese producers have described shifting to alternative markets as a \"rat race\", resulting in price wars among exporters that risk fanning deflationary forces in the world's second-largest economy as firms continue to squeeze shrinking margins. China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at \"around 5%\" despite Trump's tariff salvos which could halt a largely export-led recovery underway since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put an even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war. \"China knew this day was coming well in advance, the relatively restrained stimulus announcements at March's Two Sessions were a calculation, not an oversight,\" Osman said, referring to China's annual parliamentary meetings. \"Beijing has purposefully kept more in reserve, both in terms of domestic stimulus and retaliatory measures, in case it needs to respond more forcefully,\" she added. China's President Xi Jinping might also enter the fray, following reports the two leaders could meet in June in the United States. \"Trump and Xi are locked in a paradox of pressure and pride,\" said Craig Singleton, senior fellow at Washington-based research institute Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"Trump's strategy mixes maximum pressure with sudden diplomatic overtures — he sees leverage and engagement as complementary. Xi, by contrast, is methodical and risk-averse, relying on delay and discipline. But here’s the dilemma: if he refuses to engage, the pressure escalates; if he engages too soon, he risks looking weak,\" he added. \"Neither wants to be seen as folding first, but delay could deepen the standoff.\" US tariffs"

At a Rose Garden event, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries, with the White House saying it would take effect on Saturday. US President Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington yesterday. Photo: Reuters Countries with larger trade surpluses with the US would face higher duties beginning on Wednesday, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (25 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (36 percent). Canada and Mexico, the two largest US trading partners, already face 25 percent tariffs on many goods and would not face additional levies from yesterday's announcement. The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and \"certain minerals that are not available in the United States,\" according to a White House fact sheet. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and potentially critical minerals, a White House official said. The White House said the tariffs aim to address \"the injustices of global trade, reshore manufacturing and drive economic growth for the American people,\" but economic experts have warned that the measures could spark a trade war, exacerbate inflation and disrupt international trade. Hours after the announcement, the US Senate passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada. The Senate voted 51-48 to approve the bill and send it to the House of Representatives, where it is likely to be shelved. In a blow to Trump, four Senate Republicans teamed up with Democrats to advance the legislation. The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. US stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. US stocks have erased nearly US$5 trillion of value since February.

    "article_text": "ETMarkets.com President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs, causing concerns over potential global economic slowdown and recession. President Donald Trump's new tariffs announced on Wednesday sent shockwaves through global markets amid worries the aggressive duties will slow growth, hit corporate earnings and stoke inflation , with one analyst calling the move markets' \"worst-case scenario.\" Global markets have been whiplashed since Trump took office and kept up a stream of rhetoric that threatened to unleash a global trade war . Trump's new levies crystallized those fears. He set a baseline of 10% across all imports and higher duties on some of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. Taken together, the duties will erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order following World War Two. In interviews, several investors and analysts said the rhetoric around tariffs had already caused an economic slowdown , hitting both consumer and corporate confidence. The big unknown now is how trading partners will react, they said. Live Events While Wednesday's announcement provided a baseline, it is likely to be followed by months of negotiations and debilitating uncertainty. \"It's created bad sentiment on the future, which slows down things,\" said John Luke Tyner, fixed income analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors in Fairhope, Alabama. \"You've seen slowdowns in projects, capital projects, CEOs' commentary on markets and the economy.\" Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, spoke bluntly of the impact. \"This is the worst-case scenario that the market was expecting, and that's enough to potentially send the U.S. into a recession and that's why the futures are so weak,\" he said. In the United States, stocks future fell as Trump spoke, with S&P 500 E-minis down 3.5%. In currencies, the dollar fell 0.9% against the yen at 148 yen, while the Mexican peso was about 0.4% lower. Prices of safe-havens assets such as gold and Treasury rose. In his speech at the White House Rose Garden, Trump cast the levies in terms of fairness, arguing that the \"reciprocal\" tariffs were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. \"In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade,\" Trump said, calling it a declaration of independence. Initially, as Trump spoke investors latched onto the 10% baseline tariff number, which was less than what they had feared. But Trump then unveiled much higher tariffs against some of the country's biggest trading partners. Some of China's neighbors and biggest trading partners such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were slapped the highest tariffs. Some multinational companies have moved their supply chains to these countries as they looked to diversify away from China amid Sino-U.S. tensions that ratcheted up under Trump's first administration. Exchange-traded funds on these markets listed in New York slumped on the news. \"These figures aligned more closely with aggressive tariff scenarios, putting pressure on risk assets while temporarily supporting the dollar,\" said Uto Shinohara, senior investment strategist at Mesirow Currency Management in Chicago. Analysts expect trading partners to respond with countermeasures that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. \"We've just got one side of the story, which is what we're doing. And the other side of the story is how other countries respond to what we're doing,\" Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina, said. \"So that's a big component to how the market ultimately digests what is being said right now.\" Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors, said the tariffs bode ill for the global economy. \"We are very early innings on what could unfortunately turn into a very serious global trade war,\" Calcagni said. The developments come at a particularly crucial moment for investors in U.S. stocks. In mid-March the S&P 500 confirmed a correction, a drop of 10% from a recent high. The index finished Wednesday's regular trading session 8% below its February record high. \"The tariffs are so comprehensive and so much larger than we expected. People were talking earlier about whether clarity would boost the market. But now you have clarity, and no one likes what they see,\" said Jeanette Garretty, chief economist at Robertson Stephens.

The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. \"It's our declaration of independence,\" Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Details of the tariffs were not immediately known as Trump continued remarks that echoed his longstanding complaints that US workers and companies are hurt by global trade. The uncertainty has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since 1947. The administration has said the new tariffs will take effect immediately after Trump announces them, though it has not yet published the official notice required for enforcement. The administration, however, did publish an official notice that a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on April 3. Trump has already imposed 20% duties on all imports from China and 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. His advisers say the tariffs will return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average US family by thousands of dollars. facebook twitter whatsup linkded email COMMENTS Replying to X Saved !

(Reuters/Carlos Barria ) U nited States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would impose a 10 percent baseline tariff on all imports to the US and higher duties on dozens of other countries, including some of the United States' biggest trading partners, deepening a trade war that has rattled global markets and bewildered US allies. The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. US stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. US stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since February. Chinese imports will be hit with a 34 percent tariff, on top of the 20 percent he previously imposed, bringing the total new levy to 54 percent. Close US allies were not spared, including the European Union, which faces a 20 percent tariff, and Japan, which is targeted for a 24 percent rate. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the higher penalties will take effect on April 9 and will apply to about 60 countries in all. The baseline 10 percent tariff will take effect on Saturday, the official said. The \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on US goods.

Canada and Mexico, the two largest US trading partners, already face 25 percent tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday's announcement. The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and \"certain minerals that are not available in the United States,\" according to a White House fact sheet. Following his remarks, Trump signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages - those valued at $800 or less - duty-free from China, known as \"de minimis.\" The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico's cartels to produce the deadly drug, US anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Trump's barrage of penalties has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since the middle of last century. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Trump previously imposed 25 percent duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. European leaders reacted with dismay, saying a trade war would hurt consumers and benefit neither side. \"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,\" Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said. US Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would introduce legislation to end the tariffs. Such a bill has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress, however. \"Trump just hit Americans with the largest regressive tax hike in modern history - massive tariffs on all imports. His reckless policies are not only crashing markets, they will disproportionately hurt working families,\" Meeks said.

US stocks have erased nearly US$5 trillion of value since February. “It’s our declaration of independence,” Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Chinese imports will be hit with a 34 per cent tariff, according to Trump, on top of the 20 per cent levy that he previously imposed on that country. Close US allies were not spared, including the European Union, which faces a 20 per cent tariff. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the higher penalties will take effect on Apr 9 and will apply to about 60 countries in all. The baseline 10 per cent tariff will take effect on Saturday, the official said. The “reciprocal” tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on US goods. “In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe in terms of trade,” Trump said. Canada and Mexico, the two largest US trading partners, already face 25 per cent tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday’s announcement.

Following his remarks, Trump signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages – those valued at US$800 or less – duty-free from China, known as “de minimis”. The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico’s cartels to produce the deadly drug, US anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Trump’s barrage of penalties has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since the middle of the last century. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Trump has already imposed 20 per cent duties on all imports from China and 25 per cent duties on steel and aluminium, and extended them to nearly US$150 billion worth of downstream products. His advisers say the tariffs will return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average US family by thousands of US dollars. Businesses have complained that Trump’s barrage of threats has made it difficult to plan their operations. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise.

(AFP Photo) by agencies Apr 02, 2025 11:23 pm Edited By Nurbanu Tanrıkulu Kızıl U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on multiple countries during a speech in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday, as he accused other countries of \"ripping off\" his country for decades. \"We will charge them approximately half what they are or have been charging us,\" he said, as he listed import tariffs to the U.S. for certain areas. The EU will face a 20% tariff. Japan must pay 24%. \"This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. It is our declaration of economic independence. Now it is our turn to prosper,\" he added. He said the U.S. was \"standing up for the American worker\" with these new steps. \"Our country and its tax payers have been ripped off for 50 years but it is not going to happen anymore,\" Trump added. Trump held up a chart while speaking, showing the United States would charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs - coming on what Trump has named \"Liberation Day” - are a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish other countries for what he says are years of unfair trade practices. But by most economists’ assessments, the risky move threatens to plunge the economy into a downturn and mangle decades-old alliances. The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world's largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. \"It's our declaration of independence,\" Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. U.S. financial markets have been unsettled in anticipation of Trump’s tariff announcement. Trump insists the moves will strengthen the U.S. economy, even as many experts worry it could lead to higher prices for most American consumers. Among those in attendance included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged in late trading Wednesday, but only after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1% and a later gain of 1.1%. It’s had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31 points, or 0.1%, with an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher. Both also veered from sharply lower in the morning to sharply higher in the afternoon and then doubled back. shortlink copied KEYWORDS tariffs donald trump united states The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

Trump last night said that he would impose a 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher duties on dozens of the country’s biggest trading partners, deepening a trade war that he kicked off on his return to the White House.

Reacting to the 10pc tariffs on UK goods, British Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, “The US is ‘our closest ally’ but ‘nothing is off the table’. “We have a range of tools at our disposal and we will not hesitate to act. We will continue to engage with UK businesses including on their assessment of the impact of any further steps we take.” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, seen as close to Trump, said that tariffs introduced by his administration were ‘wrong’ and would not benefit the United States. “In any case, as always, we will act in the interest of Italy and its economy, also engaging with other European partners,” she added.” “We are going to fight these tariffs with countermeasures,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney."

    "article_text": "Estimated read time: 5-6 minutes KEY TAKEAWAYS President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on most U.S. imports, escalating global trade tensions. The tariffs affect numerous countries, including China, Japan, and the European Union. Experts warn of potential global recession and increased consumer costs in the U.S. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's decision to slap a 10% tariff on most goods imported to the United States, as well as higher duties on dozens of countries from rivals to allies, has intensified a global trade war that threatens to stoke inflation and stall growth. The sweeping duties announced against the serene backdrop of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday immediately unleashed turbulence across world markets and drew condemnation from other leaders now faced with the end of decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. As Asia awoke to the news on Thursday, Japan's Nikkei hit an eight-month low while U.S. and European stock futures dropped sharply following weeks of volatile trading. U.S. stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since mid-February. China, the world's second-largest economy, faced with a fresh 34% tariff on top of the 20% Trump previously imposed, urged the United States to immediately cancel its latest levies and vowed countermeasures. U.S. Treasury chief Scott Bessent urged other nations not to retaliate, moves that could lead to dramatically higher prices for consumers on everything from bicycles to wine. \"If you retaliate, that's how we get escalation,\" Bessent told CNN. Close U.S. allies were not spared Trump's ire, including the European Union, which faces a 20% tariff, and Japan, which is targeted for a 24% rate. Tokyo said it was leaving all options to respond to the \"extremely regrettable\" duties. Others affected included: Ukraine, 10% Qatar, 10% Panama, 10% Venezuela, 15% Vietnam, 46% Taiwan, 32% India, 26% South Korea, 25% Thailand, 36% Switzerland, 31% Indonesia, 32% Malaysia, 24% United Kingdom, 10% South Africa, 30% Brazil, 10% Israel, 17% Philippines, 17% Chile, 10% Australia, 10% Pakistan, 29% Turkey, 10% Colombia, 10% Peru, 10% Costa Rica, 10% Jordan, 20% Dominican Republic, 10% United Arab Emirates, 10% New Zealand, 10% Argentina, 10% Ecuador, 10% Guatemala, 10% Egypt, 10% Saudi Arabia, 10% El Salvador, 10% Trinidad and Tobago, 10% Morocco, 10% The base 10% tariffs go into effect on April 5 and the higher reciprocal rates on April 9. The effective U.S. import tax rate has shot to 22% under Trump from just 2.5% in 2024, according to the head of U.S. research at Fitch Ratings. \"That rate was last seen around 1910,\" Olu Sonola said in a statement. \"This is a game-changer, not only for the U.S. economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.\" The \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other nontariff barriers put on U.S. goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. \"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, already face 25% tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday's announcement. Even some fellow Republicans have expressed concern about Trump's aggressive trade policy. Within hours of Wednesday's announcement, the Senate voted 51-48 to approve legislation that would terminate Trump's Canadian tariffs, with a handful of Republicans breaking with the president. Passage in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, however, was seen as unlikely. Trump's top economist, Stephen Miran, told Fox Business on Wednesday the tariffs would work out well for the U.S. in the long run, even if they cause some initial disruption. \"Are there going to be short-term bumps as a result? Absolutely,\" Miran, the chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisors, told the network's \"Kudlow\" program. Ending 'de minimis' The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and \"certain minerals that are not available in the United States,\" according to a White House fact sheet. Following his remarks, Trump also signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages — those valued at $800 or less — duty-free from China, known as \"de minimis.\" The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House, which said the move was intended to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico's cartels to produce the deadly drug, U.S. anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Trump's barrage of penalties has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since the middle of last century. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Trump previously imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. European leaders reacted with dismay, saying a trade war would hurt consumers and benefit neither side. \"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,\" Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said. U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would introduce legislation to end the tariffs. Such a bill has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Congress, however. \"Trump just hit Americans with the largest regressive tax hike in modern history — massive tariffs on all imports. His reckless policies are not only crashing markets, they will disproportionately hurt working families,\" Meeks said.

    "article_text": "Sponsored By Consumer Trends News NRF predicts 2025 retail sales growth of 2.7% to 3.7% Overall GDP expected to slow to under 2% amid inflation, policy uncertainty Mark Hamstra April 2, 2025 2 Min Read The NRF predicted that the overall U.S. GDP would dip below 2% this year, down from 2.8% in 2024. Shutterstock The National Retail Federation said conditions remain relatively positive for consumer spending in 2025, and predicted that retail sales—excluding auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants—would grow between 2.7% and 3.7% this year. That compares with 3.6% retail sales growth in 2024. Strong employment and wage growth, combined with declining inflation, helped bolster consumer spending last year, said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz in an online presentation on Wednesday. “That favorable environment is expected to carry forward as we head further into 2025, but its trajectory is expected to deteriorate as job growth moderates and policy uncertainty clouds the economic outlook,” he said. The NRF predicted that the overall U.S. GDP would dip below 2% this year, down from 2.8% in 2024. Growth in consumer spending is expected to fall to just over 2%, down from 2.8% in 2024. “Consumer spending is not unraveling,” said Kleinhenz. “That said, consumer confidence is declining, thanks to the lingering headache of inflation and consumers’ anxiety over ever-changing tariff arrangements.” Catherine Cullen, VP of industry and consumer insights at NRF, said consumers who saw their finances boosted by the stimulus provided during the 2020 Covid pandemic have since burned through their accumulated wealth and are beginning to pull back. Related: Grocers need to meet consumers where they are, and that’s in the digital world “Without the extra cushion from savings, consumers are now more vulnerable to economic shocks,” she said. More details: Inflation seen at 2.5% Non-store and online sales, which are included in the total retail sales projection, are expected to grow between 7% and 9% in 2025, vs. 8.1% last year Total retail sales are expected to reach between $5.42 trillion and $5.48 trillion in 2025, including non-store and online sales of between $1.57 trillion to $1.6 trillion The NRF projected that Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index inflation, which measures a broad range of consumer goods and services, will be about 2.5% in 2025, in part due to the impact of tariffs on imported goods Although household finances remain relatively healthy, consumers in lower income brackets have seen lower wage growth and could be under pressure in 2025, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, during the NRF presentation. “A lot of young families are struggling,” he said About the Author Mark Hamstra Mark Hamstra is a freelance business writer with experience covering a range of topics and industries, including food and mass retailing, the restaurant industry, direct/mobile marketing, and technology.

    "article_text": "U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 2, 2025. REUTERS/Leah Millis Trump Drops Tariff Bomb On All U.S. Imports and Higher Reciprocal Rates Mike Schuler Total Views: 2862 April 2, 2025 Share this article By Andrea Shalal and David Lawder WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) – President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would impose a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher duties on some of the country’s biggest trading partners, in a move that ratchets up a trade war that he kicked off on his return to the White House. The sweeping duties would erect new barriers around the world’s largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. “It’s our declaration of independence,” Trump said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. Trump displayed a poster that listed reciprocal tariffs , including 34% on China, 20% on the European Union, and 46% on Vietnam, as a response to duties put on U.S. goods. Here’s the full list, the podium was blocking it during the speech so I missed a few countries pic.twitter.com/AG1AzHtYB4 — Ryan Petersen (@typesfast) April 2, 2025 Other details were not immediately apparent as Trump continued to make remarks that echoed his longstanding complaints that U.S. workers and companies are hurt by global trade. The uncertainty has rattled financial markets and businesses that have relied on trading arrangements that have been in place since 1947. The administration has said the new tariffs will take effect immediately after Trump announces them, though it has not yet published the official notice required for enforcement. The administration, however, did publish an official notice that a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on April 3. Trump has already imposed 20% duties on all imports from China and 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. His advisers say the tariffs will return strategically vital manufacturing capabilities to the United States. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. Businesses have complained that Trump’s barrage of threats has made it difficult to plan their operations. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. Financial markets were volatile as investors awaited Trump’s announcement. U.S. stocks have erased nearly $5 trillion of value since February.

    "article_text": "Trump's tariffs stoke global trade war as China, EU hit back Published on 04/03/2025 at 02:35 am EDT Reuters Share WASHINGTON/BEIJING/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's move to slap a 10% tariff on most goods imported to the United States, as well as much higher levies on dozens of rivals and allies alike, has intensified a global trade war that threatens to stoke inflation and stall growth. The sweeping penalties announced against the serene backdrop of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday immediately unleashed turbulence across world markets and drew condemnation from other leaders now facing the end of an era of trade liberalization that has shaped the global order for decades. As Asia digested the news on Thursday, stock markets in Beijing and Tokyo sank to multi-month lows, with U.S. and European stock futures also pointing to sharp losses as investors scrambled to the safety of bonds and gold. Now facing 54% tariffs on exports to the U.S., the world's No. 2 economy China vowed countermeasures, as did the European Union - Washington's friends and foes united in criticism of measures they fear will deal a devastating blow to global trade. \"The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,\" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding the 27-member bloc was preparing to hit back if talks with Washington failed. U.S. Treasury Chief Scott Bessent earlier warned that any such retaliatory moves would only lead to escalation. Among close U.S. allies, the European Union was targeted with a 20% rate, Japan with 24%, South Korea with 25% and Taiwan with 32%. Even some tiny territories and uninhabited islands in the Antarctic were hit by tariffs, according to a list posted by the White House on X. The base tariffs go into effect on April 5 and the higher reciprocal rates on April 9. Trump said the \"reciprocal\" tariffs were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. \"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far,\" Trump said. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average American family by thousands of dollars. Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, already face 25% tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesday's announcement. Even some fellow Republicans have expressed concern about Trump's aggressive trade policy. Within hours of Wednesday's announcement, the Senate voted 51-48 to approve legislation that would terminate Trump's Canadian tariffs, with a handful of Republicans breaking with the president. Passage in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, however, was seen as unlikely. Trump's top economist, Stephen Miran, told Fox Business on Wednesday the tariffs would work out well for the U.S. in the long run, even if they cause some initial disruption. \"Are there going to be short-term bumps as a result? Absolutely,\" Miran, the chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisors, said. ENDING 'DE MINIMIS' The reciprocal tariffs do not apply to certain goods, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy and \"certain minerals that are not available in the United States,\" according to a White House fact sheet. Following his remarks, Trump also signed an order to close a trade loophole used to ship low-value packages - those valued at $800 or less - duty-free from China, known as \"de minimis.\" The order covers goods from China and Hong Kong and will take effect on May 2, according to the White House, which said the move was intended to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Chinese chemical makers are the top suppliers of raw materials purchased by Mexico's cartels to produce the deadly drug, U.S. anti-narcotics officials say. A Reuters investigation last year showed how traffickers often route these chemicals through the United States by exploiting the de minimis rule. China has repeatedly denied culpability. Trump is also planning other tariffs targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and potentially critical minerals, the official said. Earlier in the day, the administration said a separate set of tariffs on auto imports that Trump announced last week will take effect starting on Thursday. Trump previously imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum and extended them to nearly $150 billion worth of downstream products. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. Now as the reality of the new tariffs sink in, companies around the world must weigh up how to adjust, with their options limited and unpalatable for their customers. \"This is how you sabotage the world's economic engine while claiming to supercharge it,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory deVere Group. \"The reality is stark: these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods - from phones to food - and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent.\" (Additional reporting by Kanishka Singh and Steve Holland in Washington, Joe Cash in Beijing and Benoit Van Overstraeten and Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Writing by Andy Sullivan, Joseph Ax and John Geddie; Editing by Alistair Bell, Diane Craft and Lincoln Feast.)

That was the message emanating Wednesday from a National Retail Federation online presentation on the state of retail and the consumer, when the trade organization forecast that retail sales in 2025 will grow between 2.7 percent and 3.7 percent over 2024, reaching somewhere between $5.42 trillion and $5.48 trillion. The presentation was held before U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his global tariff plans later that day.

This year’s forecast is also in line with the 10-year pre-pandemic average annual sales growth of 3.6 percent. Non-store and online sales, which are included in the total figure, are expected to grow between 7 and 9 percent, year-over-year to a total of between $1.57 trillion and $1.6 trillion. By comparison, non-store and online sales grew 8.1 percent to a total of $1.47 trillion last year. NRF expects GDP growth to decline just below 2 percent in 2025, down from 2.8 percent in 2024 and below the trend of the past few years. “Any way you look at it, a lot is riding on the consumer,” NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, said in a statement. “While we do expect slower growth, consumer fundamentals remain intact, supported by low unemployment, slower but steady income growth, and solid household finances. Consumer spending is not unraveling.” Kleinhenz added that even though consumer confidence is declining, due largely to lingering inflation and consumers’ anxiety over tariffs, that doesn’t mean there will be an immediate drop in consumer spending. “It’s the hard data on employment, income and tariff-induced inflation — not consumer sentiment — that supports our view of a slower trajectory for consumer spending,” he said. With the implementation of tariffs, NRF expects personal consumer expenditure inflation during 2025 to remain at the current level of about 2.5 percent. The NRF also indicated that “household balance sheets appear to be in good shape. Delinquencies on auto loans and credit card payments have risen but remain in line with the pre-pandemic trend. The consumer credit picture should remain healthy as long as the labor market remains solid.” NRF’s retail figures exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants. The 2025 retail sales forecast is based on economic modeling that considers employment, wages, disposable income, consumer credit and previous retail sales, as well as U.S. government sources and the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, which is powered by Affinity Solutions. The forecast came during NRF’s fifth annual “State of Retail & Consumer” virtual event, where Katherine Cullen, NRF’s vice president of industry and consumer insights, said, “Most households have burned through their pandemic savings, without that extra cushion of savings, consumers are more vulnerable to economic shock.” Consumers, she said, received $10 trillion in stimulus during the pandemic. Kelly Pedersen, global retail leader at PWC, said, “consumers are nervous” and that he’s paying particular attention to the lower income demographic. “There is a lot of uneasiness in that group.” Pedersen did cite some bright spots in the retail sector , including Gen Z demonstrating strong interest in in-store experiences, and apparel being “a nice surprise recently,” in terms of retail sales. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, said, “Generally speaking, the economy is doing quite well, with 3 percent growth in GDP, unemployment low at around 4 percent, household finances on average are still relatively healthy. But if you look out on the horizon, I am concerned about a consumer spending slowdown, as income grows more slowly than consumer spending. We are starting to see some cracks in household financials,” he said, noting that younger families are struggling with delinquencies and higher prices, though he is not expecting a major retrenchment. Sarah Wolfe, senior economic strategist at Morgan Stanley, said while the fundamentals of the economy are healthy, uncertainties surrounding tariffs, deregulation and immigration “are hitting consumers and businesses. Consumers are concerned and very price sensitive, it’s impacting the ability of businesses to plan ahead.” Newsletters Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Sign up Jordan Brand and Levi’s Have a New Collaboration on One of Michael Jordan’s Most Famous Shoes Sneaker News By Riley Jones All of Ariana Grande’s Glinda-fied Beauty Moments for ‘Wicked’: Bleached Brows, Micro Bangs and More Culture News By Kaleigh Werner Miss Universe Walkouts and Reactions: How Contestants Supported Miss Mexico After an Organizer ‘Berated’ Her Culture News By Julia Teti Keri Russell Talks ‘The Diplomat,’ Fashion — and Balancing Hollywood and Real Life"
