    "article_text": "Command Line AI Tech Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s AI hiring spree ﻿How Meta’s CEO is spending heavily to reboot his AI team. Also, Apple has an AI problem. ﻿How Meta’s CEO is spending heavily to reboot his AI team. Also, Apple has an AI problem. by Alex Heath Jun 14, 2025, 12:16 AM UTC Link Share Getty Images / The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. AI researchers have recently been asking themselves a version of the question, “Is that really Zuck? ” As first reported by Bloomberg , the Meta CEO has been personally asking top AI talent to join his new “superintelligence” AI lab and reboot Llama. His recruiting process typically goes like this: a cold outreach via email or WhatsApp that cites the recruit’s work history and requests a 15-minute chat. Dozens of researchers have gotten these kinds of messages at Google alone. For those who do agree to hear his pitch (amazingly, not all of them do), Zuckerberg highlights the latitude they’ll have to make risky bets, the scale of Meta’s products, and the money he’s prepared to invest in the infrastructure to support them. He makes clear that this new team will be empowered and sit with him at Meta’s headquarters, where I’m told the desks have already been rearranged for the incoming team. Most of the headlines so far have focused on the eye-popping compensation packages Zuckerberg is offering, some of which are well into the eight-figure range. As I’ve covered before , hiring the best AI researcher is like hiring a star basketball player: there are very few of them, and you have to pay up. Case in point: Zuckerberg basically just paid 14 Instagrams to hire away Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang . It’s easily the most expensive hire of all time, dwarfing the billions that Google spent to rehire Noam Shazeer and his core team from Character.AI (a deal Zuckerberg passed on). “Opportunities of this magnitude often come at a cost,” Wang wrote in his note to employees this week. “In this instance, that cost is my departure.” Zuckerberg’s recruiting spree is already starting to rattle his competitors. The day before his offer deadline for some senior OpenAI employees, Sam Altman dropped an essay proclaiming that “before anything else, we are a superintelligence research company.” And after Zuckerberg tried to hire DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu , he was given a larger SVP title and now reports directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai . I expect Wang to have the title of “chief AI officer” at Meta when the new lab is announced. Jack Rae , a principal researcher from DeepMind who has signed on, will lead pre-training. Meta certainly needs a reset. According to my sources, Llama has fallen so far behind that Meta’s product teams have recently discussed using AI models from other companies (although that is highly unlikely to happen). Meta’s internal coding tool for engineers, however, is already using Claude. While Meta’s existing AI researchers have good reason to be looking over their shoulders, Zuckerberg’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale is making many longtime employees, or Scaliens, quite wealthy. They were popping champagne in the office this morning. Then, Wang held his last all-hands meeting to say goodbye and cried. He didn’t mention what he would be doing at Meta. I expect his new team will be unveiled within the next few weeks after Zuckerberg gets a critical number of members to officially sign on. Tim Cook. Getty Images / The Verge Apple’s AI problem Apple is accustomed to being on top of the tech industry, and for good reason: the company has enjoyed a nearly unrivaled run of dominance. After spending time at Apple HQ this week for WWDC, I’m not sure that its leaders appreciate the meteorite that is heading their way. The hubris they display suggests they don’t understand how AI is fundamentally changing how people use and build software. Heading into the keynote on Monday, everyone knew not to expect the revamped Siri that had been promised the previous year. Apple, to its credit, acknowledged that it dropped the ball there, and it sounds like a large language model rebuild of Siri is very much underway and coming in 2026. The AI industry moves much faster than Apple’s release schedule, though. By the time Siri is perhaps good enough to keep pace, it will have to contend with the lock-in that OpenAI and others are building through their memory features. Apple and OpenAI are currently partners, but both companies want to ultimately control the interface for interacting with AI, which puts them on a collision course. Apple’s decision to let developers use its own, on-device foundational models for free in their apps sounds strategically smart, but unfortunately, the models look far from leading. Apple ran its own benchmarks , which aren’t impressive, and has confirmed a measly context window of 4,096 tokens. It’s also saying that the models will be updated alongside its operating systems — a snail’s pace compared to how quickly AI companies move. I’d be surprised if any serious developers use these Apple models, although I can see them being helpful to indie devs who are just getting started and don’t want to spend on the leading cloud models. I don’t think most people care about the privacy angle that Apple is claiming as a differentiator; they are already sharing their darkest secrets with ChatGPT and other assistants. Some of the new Apple Intelligence features I demoed this week were impressive, such as live language translation for calls. Mostly, I came away with the impression that the company is heavily leaning on its ChatGPT partnership as a stopgap until Apple Intelligence and Siri are both where they need to be. AI probably isn’t a near-term risk to Apple’s business. No one has shipped anything close to the contextually aware Siri that was demoed at last year’s WWDC. People will continue to buy Apple hardware for a long time, even after Sam Altman and Jony Ive announce their first AI device for ChatGPT next year. AR glasses aren’t going mainstream anytime soon either, although we can expect to see more eyewear from Meta, Google, and Snap over the coming year. In aggregate, these AI-powered devices could begin to siphon away engagement from the iPhone, but I don’t see people fully replacing their smartphones for a long time. The bigger question after this week is whether Apple has what it takes to rise to the occasion and culturally reset itself for the AI era. I would have loved to hear Tim Cook address this issue directly, but the only interview he did for WWDC was a cover story in Variety about the company’s new F1 movie. Elsewhere AI agents are coming. I recently caught up with Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi ahead of his company’s annual developer conference this week in San Francisco. Given Databricks’ position, he has a unique, bird’s-eye view of where things are headed for AI. He doesn’t envision a near-term future where AI agents completely automate real-world tasks, but he does predict a wave of startups over the next year that will come close to completing actions in areas such as travel booking. He thinks humans will need (and want) to approve what an agent does before it goes off and completes a task. “We have most of the airplanes flying automated, and we still want pilots in there.” Buyouts are the new normal at Google. That much is clear after this week’s rollout of the “voluntary exit program” in core engineering, the Search organization, and some other divisions. In his internal memo, Search SVP Nick Fox was clear that management thinks buyouts have been successful in other parts of the company that have tried them. In a separate memo I saw, engineering exec Jen Fitzpatrick called the buyouts an “opportunity to create internal mobility and fresh growth opportunities.” Google appears to be attempting a cultural reset, which will be a challenging task for a company of its size. We’ll see if it can pull it off. Evan Spiegel wants help with AR glasses. I doubt that his announcement that consumer glasses are coming next year was solely aimed at AR developers. Telegraphing the plan and announcing that Snap has spent $3 billion on hardware to date feels more aimed at potential partners that want to make a bigger glasses play, such as Google. A strategic investment could help insulate Snap from the pain of the stock market. A full acquisition may not be off the table, either. When he was recently asked if he’d be open to a sale, Spiegel didn’t shut it down like he always has, but instead said he’d “consider anything” that helps the company “create the next computing platform.” Link list More to click on: Joanna Stern’s full interview with Apple’s Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak .

The Wall Street Journal reports that in an unprecedented collaboration between the U.S. military and the tech industry, a group of Silicon Valley executives are set to be sworn in as officers in the Army Reserve on Friday. The inaugural cohort of this new innovation corps, dubbed Detachment 201, includes Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir; Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, CTO of Meta Platforms; Kevin Weil, Chief Product Officer at OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, a former OpenAI executive. The tech recruits will serve around 120 hours a year, focusing on projects that leverage their expertise in AI, data analysis, and other cutting-edge technologies to enhance the Army’s capabilities. Their mission is to help the military prepare for future conflicts, which are expected to heavily rely on ground robots, drones, sensor networks, and AI-powered coordination systems. Gen. Randy George, the Army’s chief of staff, emphasized the importance of this collaboration, stating, “We need to go faster, and that’s exactly what we are doing here.” The program marks a significant shift in the relationship between the Pentagon and the tech industry, which was once hesitant to work on defense-related projects. The tech reservists will enjoy some unique accommodations, such as the flexibility to work remotely and asynchronously, and will be exempt from basic training. They will hold the rank of lieutenant colonel due to their private-sector status and will be deployed based on their specialized skills, making it unlikely for them to find themselves in combat situations. Instead, the executives will work on projects that teach soldiers how to use AI-powered systems or utilize health data to improve fitness. They will also advise the service on acquiring more commercial technology and help the Defense Department recruit other high-tech talent. To avoid conflicts of interest, the recruits will not work on projects involving their employers and will be firewalled from sharing information or participating in projects that could provide financial gain to themselves or their companies. The tech executives expressed their eagerness to serve and contribute to the nation’s defense. Palantir’s Shyam Sankar, who fled violence in Nigeria as a child, sees the program as an opportunity to give back to the country that provided his family with safety and opportunity. Kevin Weil, an ultramarathon runner, is undaunted by the physical fitness requirements, although he expects the tech recruits to be “humiliated” by the real soldiers. As the inaugural cohort prepares to be sworn in, the Army’s tech-reservist program is already generating interest from other branches of the armed forces. Brynt Parmeter, the Pentagon’s chief talent management officer, is pushing for other services to follow the Army’s lead in recruiting top tech talent to bolster the military’s technological capabilities.

    "article_text": "iStock Indian job postings rebounded strongly in May, up 8.9%, following eight consecutive monthly declines, according to data from hiring platform Indeed. However, they are 1.8% lower than a year ago and around 16% below their peak. Despite trending downwards recently, Indian job postings are almost 80% above pre-pandemic levels, ranking highly compared with other major markets for the platform, although it isn’t a like-for-like comparison. Several countries, led by the UK, New Zealand and Switzerland, have posted volumes that are currently below pre-pandemic levels. By comparison, India's posting volumes are healthy. “Indian job creation continues to outpace other countries because of the nation’s transition towards more formal economic arrangements,” said Callam Pickering, Indeed’s APAC senior economist. “As the nation transitions, job creation across the formal sector will be much stronger than overall employment growth nationwide, and we have consistently seen that in recent years. Other economies are not going through a transition of this nature.” Job postings in around 80% of occupations in India increased over the past three months. Gains were the largest in childcare (+27%), personal care and home health (+25%), education (+24%), and production and manufacturing (+22%). These gains more than offset some weakness in sectors like dental opportunities, down 10.2% over the past three months, along with agriculture and forestry (-8.6%), community and social service (-6.8%) and software development (-4.2%). Live Events While software development opportunities have declined recently, the sector continues to have the largest volume of job opportunities on Indeed, accounting for around one-in-five Indian job postings. It highlights how prominent the tech sector has been in India’s emerging formal sector, with multinationals trying to tap into India’s large talent pool. Further, the data shows that, as of May 2025, 1.5% of Indian job postings explicitly mentioned generative AI in their job descriptions, more than doubling over the past year. Generative AI opportunities are concentrated in the tech sector but are increasingly widespread. Around 12.5% of data analytics roles mention generative AI, ahead of software development (3.6%) and scientific research (3.1%). It’s also commonly mentioned across a range of office roles, including marketing (1.1% of job postings) and management (0.9%). Regional hubs have emerged for jobs that either use or help develop generative AI. In Karnataka, 2.4% of job postings mention generative AI, just ahead of 2.3% in Telangana. Maharashtra has the second-largest volume of generative AI opportunities and the largest volume of total job opportunities, but it’s mentioned in just 1% of job postings. Job creation across India’s formal sector remains strong and rose sharply during May. This continues to facilitate a shift from lower-productivity to higher-productivity work as workers transition into the sector. While there is no shortage of workers in India, finding the right set of skills continues to be challenging in some cases. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

This is due to the country's persistent wage and price increments, as well as the global uncertainty around the impact of the U.S.' bilateral trade negotiations on growth and inflation, Carl Ang, fixed income research analyst at the investment firm, wrote in a Friday note. \"Stagflation-like risks have intensified for Japan's economy since Liberation Day, favoring an unchanged policy rate with a neutral tone at this month's BoJ meeting,\" he added. Ang said that the \"earliest appropriate time\" for further tightening will be in the January-March quarter next year. Still, he noted there may be a surprise rate hike, given that the Japanese yen is set to appreciate against the greenback from \"historically weak levels.\" This however, \"remains very much a remote possibility,\" Ang added.

Facebook / Davina Schonle London Tech Week, a prominent event in the global technology calendar, is facing flak over an incident wherein a woman tech founder, accompanied by her baby, was reportedly denied entry, igniting a serious debate about inclusivity and accessibility within the tech industry's major gatherings. Davina Schonle, the founder of AI company Humanvantage, has urged business events to become more inclusive after being refused entry because she had her baby with her at the event. A Mother's Exclusion: The London Tech Week Incident Davina Schonle had planned to attend London Tech Week with her young daughter, who was in a pram. However, after a three-hour drive to the event, she was disheartened to be denied access due to having her daughter with her. In a LinkedIn post , Schonle explained that she limits how long she's away from her baby, believing she should be able to 'build my company with her by my side.' Her post detailing the experience quickly ignited a discussion about inclusion within the tech industry on the platform. After a three-hour drive, Davina Schonle felt 'humiliated' and 'angry' by the incident, which she shared in a viral LinkedIn post.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview News Articles Interviews Calendar Invalid query Tech leap forward: Armenia to host major AI infrastructure June 12, 2025 - 14:34 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan praised the collaboration between NVIDIA and Firebird to build AI infrastructure in Armenia. Firebird, a cloud AI company, and the Armenian government, with support from NVIDIA, have launched an initiative to develop a leading AI infrastructure in the region, according to a Firebird statement via Armenpress. The company plans to launch the project in 2026 using thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, creating a system with over 100 megawatts of power. Firebird outlined a $500 million public–private partnership aimed at advancing AI technologies in Armenia. Officials note that this new AI hub will be a key milestone on Armenia’s path to becoming a tech leader. “We welcome NVIDIA’s partnership and the work with Firebird to construct AI infrastructure in Armenia. This is a significant step in strengthening our tech sector and global partnerships,” said Prime Minister Pashinyan, adding that the government is pleased to support this initiative and open new opportunities for the Armenian people and the region. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that AI factories are the infrastructure of the 21st century. Firebird.ai co‑founder and CEO Razmik Hovagimian stated the goal is to create an innovative launchpad from Armenia to the global stage. “We will invest in cutting‑edge models, robotics and sciences in partnership with world‑leading universities, and build capabilities to incubate the next generation of innovators in Armenia,” Hovagimian said. U.S. Ambassador Christina Kvien expressed enthusiasm for the project: “We are excited about U.S. tech exports and AI leadership fueling more innovation in Armenia’s dynamic tech sector, benefiting both the United States and Armenia.” She added that U.S. firms, including NVIDIA, continue to offer leading solutions globally. “We are proud they are preferred partners for Armenian counterparts.” The initiative was also welcomed on Facebook by Minister of High‑Tech Industry Mkhitar Hayrapetyan. “The AI factory will become a platform for innovation, education, science and entrepreneurship. It will boost local and international startups, ensure science‑tech linkage, and turn Armenia into a regional techno‑hub for real AI creation. With this initiative, Armenia not only responds to global tech shifts but becomes part of them. A new platform is forming where local talent can create relevant solutions aligned with international developments. This is a strategic investment in our country’s long‑term technological progress,” the minister stated. Firebird.ai, founded in San Francisco and Yerevan, plans to launch the Caucasus’ first and largest AI supercomputer in 2026, powered by NVIDIA Blackwell processors. Its future branches will serve as sustainable, high‑performance AI infrastructure for emerging global markets while investing in strengthening local tech talent.

    "article_text": "The good times in Silicon Valley are over—at least as far as the current generation of coders is concerned. The software industry is shrinking and, since 2023, the tech industry has been hemorrhaging jobs at an astounding rate. Workers who would’ve been secure several years ago are now out on their asses . While the reasons for this are diverse (AI is often discussed as a potential culprit and the overall economy has had its ups and downs over the past several years), one potential driver could also be the tax cuts that Trump passed in 2017 . It turns out that a little-known provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 altered a longstanding loophole, known as Section 174, that allowed the tech industry to offload the cost of its research and development operations onto the federal government. Prior to the TCJA, tech companies could deduct 100 percent of the costs of R&D, allowing tech businesses the freedom to commit significant resources towards innovation. Bloomberg reports that, as Congress sought to find a way to offset the cost of giving big tax cuts to billionaires, one place where they discovered fat to trim was the tech industry’s R&D funding. 2017’s bill shifted the deduction from a full write-off to funding that would have to be parsed out over a period of several years. The provision that pared back the funding did not kick in until 2022, however. Not long after it went into effect, the tech industry began shedding jobs like nobody’s business. Indeed, 2023 and 2024 were historically bad years for the tech industry, with major companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google booting workers by the thousands. Quartz took a deeper look at the ties between this policy shift and the tech industry’s troubles and now speculates that there is a positive correlation: …the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Quartz also notes that the policy change would have translated into a loss of income for a variety of positions: The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. The reality of the government’s subsidization of Silicon Valley is particularly ironic given the rabid anti-government sentiment currently circulating in the industry. People like Marc Andreessen would have you believe that tech’s R&D can be funded through private money alone, despite no reputable track record of it happening. Elon Musk’s DOGE, meanwhile, recently attacked the very parts of the government that have been responsible for helping companies like his own (Tesla) flourish. It’s yet another sign that America’s billionaires are so greed-addled that they’re willing to shoot a gift horse in the mouth and call it victory. Not everybody in the tech industry is an idiot, however. There is currently a concerted effort to reestablish the government’s R&D subsidy. The American Innovation and R&D Competitiveness Act , which was introduced by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, would restore the full flow of federal dollars for tech’s development needs. Last month, representatives from major tech firms reportedly signaled to the Trump administration that they might pull back from previous pledges of U.S. investment if the full tax subsidy didn’t return."

    "article_text": "Command Line AI Tech Popular AI apps get caught in the crosshairs of Anthropic and OpenAI ﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. ﻿With the latest moves from both companies, life is getting increasingly treacherous for AI startups. by Alex Heath Jun 7, 2025, 12:38 AM UTC Link Share Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Battlelines are being drawn between the major AI labs and the popular applications that rely on them. This week, both Anthropic and OpenAI took shots at two leading AI apps: Windsurf, one of the most popular vibe coding tools, and Granola, a buzzy AI app for taking meeting notes. ”With less than five days of notice, Anthropic decided to cut off nearly all of our first-party capacity to all Claude 3.x models,” Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan wrote on X this week, noting that “we wanted to pay them for the full capacity.” An additional statement on Windsurf’s website said: “We are concerned that Anthropic’s conduct will harm many in the industry, not just Windsurf.” Here, Mohan’s company is collateral damage in Anthropic’s rivalry with OpenAI, which has reportedly been in talks to acquire Windsurf for about $3 billion. The deal hasn’t been confirmed, but even the spectre of it happening was enough for Anthropic to cut off one of the most popular apps that it powers. After a spokesperson told TechCrunch’s Maxwell Zeff that Anthropic was “prioritizing capacity for sustainable partnerships,” co-founder Jared Kaplan put it more bluntly. “We really are just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future,” Kaplan told Zeff . “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.” Meanwhile, OpenAI sent its own warning shot this week to the budding AI app ecosystem. It announced a “record mode” for ChatGPT — initially only for enterprise accounts — that transcribes calls and generates meeting notes. This is the core use case of Granola, one of my favorite AI tools that recently raised $43 million in additional funding and released a mobile app. Given how quickly Granola has evolved to do more than summarize meetings, I suspect that the company isn’t at risk of extinction. Still, it will be harder to grow when hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users eventually have access to its main functionality. It’s unclear how the tension between the product ambitions of OpenAI and Anthropic and the needs of their API customers will settle out. When I interviewed Anthropic’s chief product officer, Mike Krieger , back in March , the company had just announced its own Claude coding competitor to Windsurf and Cursor, which coincidentally raised $900 million this week. I asked Krieger the obvious question: how does Anthropic think about competing with its API customers? He didn’t really have an answer. “I think this is a really delicate question for all of the labs and one that I’m trying to approach really thoughtfully,” Krieger told me at the time. “Hopefully, we’ll all be able to navigate the occasionally closer adjacencies.” AI investor Zak Kukoff put it well this week: “At some point model providers are going to need to decide if they want to be stable platforms or compete for every vertical.” Ultimately, this week served as a wake-up call for the many startups building businesses on the backs of AI models; if you are successful enough, you run the risk of being copied by your model provider. A lot of companies are thinking through this risk right now, especially as OpenAI builds a new team to help its API customers “translate abstract ideas into production applications.” “You have to wonder if the recent moves by the big AI labs to more directly compete with the app layer will be one giant tailwind for incumbents like Google, Amazon, MSFT, etc.,” Michael Mignano , a Granola board member, wrote this week . “If developers can’t trust the labs, maybe it’s better to trust the big guys like they did for cloud?” A different take on AI and job loss This week, I heard two CEOs contradict the growing fear that AI will destroy jobs en masse, at least when it comes to engineering roles. The first was Sundar Pichai , whom I watched speak at Bloomberg’s tech conference in San Francisco. He downplayed Dario Amodei’s doomerism fear about job loss, correctly pointing out that “we’ve made predictions like that for the last 20 years about technology and automation, and it hasn’t quite played out that way.” He went so far as to say, “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base into next year,” because AI “allows us to do more.” The next day, I walked down the street to the Moscone Center to see Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy , who had just spoken to a room of 4,000 developers with AI pioneer Andrew Ng . I asked Ramaswamy if AI had changed his hiring plans, and he said he agreed with a ranking of hiring desirability for engineers that Ng had just described onstage, with the top being experienced engineers who leverage AI tools, followed by early-career engineers who are all-in on AI. He noted that new graduates who avoid AI tools are at the bottom of the desirability ranking and may struggle to find jobs. If anything, it’s the middle of the workforce — those who are in the middle of their careers and hesitant to adopt AI tools — that is the most in danger of near-term displacement, Ramaswamy argued. “Companies tend to accrete middle management, so there’s very much a push to get more people who are doing . How do we get them as leveraged as possible? Snowflake has historically been a little top-heavy on the engineering side, so we are balancing that out.” Overheard “Oh, man, the girls are fighting, aren’t they?” - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commenting on what was the best day on Twitter in years. “Maybe there’s a world where you have one AI in the sky. Maybe you actually have a bunch of domain-specific agents that require a bunch of specific work to make it happen. I think the evidence has really been shifting towards this menagerie of different models.” - OpenAI’s Greg Brockman speaking at the AI Engineer’s World Fair. “Give it a year. We’ll be doing a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate.” - Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas onstage at Bloomberg’s tech conference . “We were accidentally cash flow positive in Q1, which was cool.” - Substack CEO Chris Best speaking at The Information’s creator economy summit. Personnel log As part of a broader leadership reshuffling , Microsoft’s CEO of LinkedIn, Ryan Roslansky , is now also leading the Office portfolio of products. After a short stint as a distinguished AI engineer at Meta, Rohan Anil is leaving to join Anthropic. Richard Fontaine , CEO of the Center for a New American Security, is also joining the board of Anthropic’s controlling trust. Tesla’s head of Optimus, Milan Kovac , is leaving to spend “time with family,” according to Elon Musk. Christian Szegedy , a co-founder of xAI, is leaving to be the chief scientist of an AI startup called Morph. Gary Briggs will serve as the interim chief marketing officer of OpenAI while Kate Rouch takes medical leave . Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora , who was also an early Google executive, is joining Uber’s board.

Home » These surprising cities saw the biggest increase in millionaires These surprising cities saw the biggest increase in millionaires These cities may not be famous, but they’re attracting and producing millionaires in record time. Here’s the list… By Jenna Solomon 06-06-25 18:45 in Travel 0 Shenzhen saw the biggest growth in dollar millionaires over the last decade. Image via Pixabay. While American cities like New York or the Bay Area still boast the most dollar millionaires in real numbers, a few destinations have emerged as new hubs for the wealthy. These cities have seen the biggest increase in dollar millionaires over the past decade. They’re mostly fast-growing centres of technology and innovation. Meanwhile, a few also offer tax incentives to attract the wealthy. That’s according to the World’s Wealthiest Cities Report 2025, which is published by Henley & Partners, a firm that advises the wealthy on where to move to look after their assets. ADVERTISEMENT 1. Biggest increase in millionaires: Shenzhen, China Between 2014 and 2024, Shenzhen saw a 142% increase in dollar millionaires. The Chinese city is a major technology hub, with companies like Huawei and Tencent based there. Once a rustic fishing village, Shenzhen is now the fastest-growing destination for dollar millionaires . The technology scene continues to attract entrepreneurs and financiers. 2. Scottsdale, USA Most South Africans may not hear much about Scottsdale, but tech entrepreneurs and those with six-figure account balances will know all about it. The American city’s millionaire population grew by 125% over the past decade. Like Shenzhen, Scottsdale’s attraction is its booming tech industry. It also offers a luxurious lifestyle, especially in golf estates, and favourable state tax conditions. 3. Bengaluru: Popular with millionaires in India It could be a surprise, but this Indian city is popular with the very wealthy. Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore, saw a 120% increase in dollar millionaires. That took place in just ten years, between 2014 and 2024. The city’s flourishing tech industry, affordable living costs, and growing infrastructure have made it a hotspot for the wealthy. ADVERTISEMENT 4. West Palm Beach, USA Over the past decade, West Palm Beach gained 112% more dollar millionaires. This American city offers the wealthy a laid-back lifestyle, thanks to its coastal location.

Experts weigh in Are IT job layoffs making Bengaluru landlords cautious? Brokers say many landlords are now reconsidering lease renewals for tech tenants Updated on: Jun 07, 2025 9:55 AM IST By Souptik Datta Share via Copy link Bengaluru’s residential real estate market is beginning to feel the impact of ongoing job cuts in the tech industry. Suresh Gowda (name changed), 40, who was employed at a medical entrepreneurship firm in the city, had been planning to buy a home. However, after losing his job, he has put those plans on hold and is now focusing on finding new employment while exploring investments in stocks and other avenues instead. Real estate brokers point out that several landlords in Bengaluru are now uncertain about renewing leases for techie tenants, with many discussing whether to continue or end agreements after the 11-month term. (Representational Image) (ChatGPT ) Real estate brokers say the wave of layoffs has shaken buyer sentiment and dampened market confidence. It’s not just homebuyers and tenants who are concerned; landlords, too, are growing cautious. Several landlords in Bengaluru are reportedly reconsidering lease renewals for tech sector tenants, with many debating whether to extend agreements after the standard 11-month term or let them lapse amid rising uncertainty. This comes as global MNCs have already declared major layoffs in 2025. According to media reports, Microsoft has announced a fresh round of layoffs impacting 305 employees, just weeks after it laid off over 6,000 staff members worldwide. In its official statement, Microsoft said it is making “organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” Will tech layoffs spark lease renewal doubts among Bengaluru landlords? Real estate brokers point out that several landlords in Bengaluru are now uncertain about renewing leases for techie tenants, with many discussing whether to continue or end agreements after the 11-month term. \"Today in Bengaluru, landlords are becoming doubtful about tenants, especially from the tech sector. We see a lot of discussions happening around whether landlords should renew agreements with techies or let them go when the 11-month rental term ends,\" said Kiran Kumar, vice president at Hanu Reddy Realty. In some cases, tenants are struggling; they’re already paying EMIs and can’t manage the rent. These kinds of discussions are common now, especially in areas like Marathahalli and near Manyata Tech Park, he said. Also read: Bengaluru tech layoffs: Is it the right time to invest in real estate? Netizens weigh in Why does Bengaluru real estate rely on layoffs and market movement? According to Vestian Research, the IT-ITeS sector accounted for 40% of all real estate leasing in the city in 2024, highlighting its heavy dependence on the tech industry. With global tech firms continuing to announce layoffs, a decline in hiring and rising job losses could trigger a chain reaction, delaying home buying and rental demand, experts say. They say Bengaluru provides a comprehensive ecosystem for the tech industry, encompassing education, a robust talent pool, and ample opportunities for the real estate sector. \"Most real estate buyers in Bengaluru are salaried professionals, with a significant number relying on home loans. The majority are employed in IT companies or in roles that support the tech industry. As apartment prices continue to climb, we are also seeing growing interest from CXOs and business professionals, particularly those linked to the technology sector,\" Zayd Noaman, president of CREDAI Bengaluru, previously told HT.com. Layoffs and their impact on Bengaluru real estate Experts note that the rising adoption of automation and artificial intelligence is reshaping the tech industry, altering the demand for certain roles and causing shifts in the job market. While growth is slowing in some areas, new opportunities are emerging in advanced tech fields. \"With job uncertainty looming, the overall decision-making cycle of homebuyers has gone up. They are taking their time to make a final decision. This shows that they are somewhat cautious,\" Priyanka Kapoor, senior vice president, Research, ANAROCK Group, told HT.com. \"It is always advisable to be cautious while investing in real estate assets. Prospective buyers should meticulously analyse their financials and make informed decisions as real estate investments are long-term commitments,\" Shrinivas Rao, FRICS, CEO, Vestian, said. Also Read: Bengaluru rentals stay high as landlords capitalize on return-to-office demand, but tenants remain wary Will Bengaluru’s rental market flatten out? Rental rates have remained flat over the past few months compared to the same time last year, said Kumar. “In high-growth areas near tech corridors in the east and north of Bengaluru, there hasn’t been significant rental appreciation. Places like Marathahalli, Electronic City, and Whitefield have seen fewer rental enquiries. While rents in these areas rose by 15–20% last year, this year the increase is much lower, around 7–8%.” Also Read: Bengaluru real estate: One month’s rent for a fresh coat of paint now the norm in the IT Capital’s rental market As the market normalizes following the bull run of the last 3-4 years, “a price correction is expected, particularly in cases where properties are overpriced,” said Raghavendra Rao, AVP of marketing at Indiassetz. Since 2023, popular rental hubs like Koramangala, Sarjapur Road, Whitefield, and Bellandur saw rent increases of up to 20-35% annually. “Now, landlords are becoming more flexible on rent expectations, especially in suburban pockets, where supply has risen and tenants are more cost-conscious due to stagnant salary growth,” Rao noted. Overall, while a short-term correction may affect prices and rents in Bengaluru’s real estate market, experts added that long-term fundamentals remain strong, particularly as the city continues to be a major tech and business hub.

TOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Jun 6, 2025, 10:11 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, advocates for renewed collaboration between Silicon Valley and the US military, highlighting the industry's historical roots in defense. He emphasizes a \"return to grace\" through partnerships like Meta's with Anduril Industries for AI-powered military gear. Bosworth clarifies that Meta's involvement focuses on supplying components with multi-use potential, not a full shift to defense contracting. Andrew Bosworth, CTO, Meta Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth has issued a stark reminder to Silicon Valley about its foundational relationship with the US military, suggesting that a renewed partnership marks a \"return to grace\" for the tech industry. Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech Summit, Bosworth emphasised that the tech industry was originally built on military collaboration, and that a “silent majority” in Silicon Valley has always supported defense projects. He emphasised that the region was essentially built on a \"three-way investment between the military, academics, and private industry.\" Meta’s defense tech push Bosworth’s remarks follow Meta’s recent partnership with Anduril Industries , a defense tech firm, to develop AI-powered military gear , including augmented reality helmets. He stated that Silicon Valley’s roots in military innovation had been severed over time, but the industry is now reopening to defense collaborations. \"The effort has been funded through private capital, without taxpayer support, and is designed to save the US military billions of dollars by utilizing high-performance components and technology originally built for commercial use,\" Anduril said in its May statement. Historically, many tech companies avoided military contracts, with employees protesting defense-related projects. However, Bosworth believes the tides have turned, and that patriotism and technological advancement can coexist. Bosworth clarified that Meta’s partnership with Anduril does not signal a shift toward defense contracting. \"They have a system within a program, and we’re simply supplying them with components. Everything we’re developing is designed for consumers, with a clear focus on consumer audiences,\" he stated. He further explained, \"A lot of this technology has potential for multi-use applications, and that’s where I see an opportunity to build a partnership.\" AI Masterclass for Students.

Generate Key Takeaways I admit I’m disappointed that Saturday Night Live’s season is over and we won’t get a cold open on Elon Musk’s public breakup with President Donald Trump, but I am resisting the urge to be amused. I think the somber truth is that the US tech industry, which got played by the bromance, will be hurt by all of this for decades. But the biggest loser will be the average American. Technology has been the key to US prosperity since World War II, and Musk’s bitter split with the White House is symbolic of the dagger being driven through the industry’s future. The cuts to basic research will reverberate for decades. Preventing current and future foreign scientists and technologists from coming here or studying here is a self-inflicted wound that may never heal. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The DOGE argument for slashing research dollars, as it was described to me by sources, was that the money was going to the wrong places, and universities were capturing too much of it before it ever made its way to the lab. It needed to be wiped out and then redistributed. The system was long overdue for serious reform. But if DOGE had a plan as it took a sledgehammer to an essential element of American innovation, we’ll likely never see it now. And even so, the damage has been done. The effects are so widespread that you can’t avoid bumping into them. This week, I met a startup founder trying to cure diseases who has to contend with tariffs on basic lab equipment. I met a college professor whose Chinese research assistants have gone from being would-be patriotic Americans to potentially being sent home to help America’s biggest rival. And I spoke to a venture capitalist who can already see the pipeline of investable academic projects threatened by cuts in research. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Long before some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names leapt onto the Trump train, the seeds of that revolt had been planted. The Biden administration made clear that the Democratic Party was no longer an ally of the tech industry. The Trump administration seems willing to meet the right people in tech and say the right things, but its policies are antithetical to a thriving ecosystem of innovation. The tech industry should now ask: Which political party is willing to do what it takes to maximize American innovation? Which party is willing to set aside petty differences and ego, and work in the interests of American prosperity? And then it should wait to see who can prove it. About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Jun 4, 2025 How culture attracts commerce in Utah County Utah County has one of the youngest labor forces in the country — that’s a draw for some employers. The Age of Work by Kai Ryssdal , Maria Hollenhorst and Andie Corban Play Listen Now Save Share Download Ryan Brady, Director of the Utah County office of Foundever, a contact center company, speaks with “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson about the company’s recruiting challenge. Marketplace As part of our ongoing series “The Age of Work” about how demographic shifts — specifically the aging U.S. labor force — are shaking up the global economy, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and ADP chief economist Nela Richardson visited Utah County, which is one of the youngest in America . Yesterday, we explored Utah’s entrepreneurship culture at a startup incubator . Today, we’re looking at the relationship between established employers and Utah County’s labor force. One reason for Utah County’s low median age (25.5 compared to almost 39 nationally), is the number of college students in the area. Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University, with about 80,000 students between them, are both located within the county. Plus, the University of Utah and several community and technical colleges are all within commuting distance of Utah County employers. Julia Anas, chief people officer at Qualtrics, a home-grown Utah County technology company with dual headquarters in Provo, Utah, and Seattle, Washington, said the company recruits heavily from the local universities. “But there are folks we've also relocated here to experience Utah, its beauty and obviously the opportunities it can create for families.” Over the past 10-15 years, northern Utah’s tech industry has exploded. An analysis from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah found that in 2018, Utah’s tech industry supported one in seven jobs in the state and one-sixth of worker earnings. Some of those jobs are from local startups, like Qualtrics. But much of that growth is from well-established companies, including Adobe , Oracle , and Microsoft , opening offices in Utah County. “Utah has made its place on the map,” said Anas. She relocated to Utah from California several years ago for her job at Qualtrics. “I think it's really attractive for those who have younger families.” Another industry that’s found a home in Utah County is contact centers, sometimes called “call centers.” These are companies that allow other companies to outsource their customer relations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Customer Service Representative is the most common job in Utah County. “There are a couple of reasons why Utah is a good place for a contact center,” said Ryan Brady, the operations director of the Utah office of Foundever, a global contact center company headquartered in Luxembourg. “We have had a lot of success with the particular demographic, or the group of people that's here.” Ryssdal and Richardson spoke with Brady about what makes Utah County uniquely suited to the industry.

The three major companies disclosed their intentions to eliminate a combined 168 jobs, according to WARN letters the companies sent to the state Employment Development Department. All were described as permanent. Walmart will slash 108 positions on Aug. 22, affecting workers at a San Bruno site where the retailer crafts e-commerce and online services. On July 6, Google will layoff 53 workers in Sunnyvale. In Mountain View and Sunnyvale, Microsoft announced plans for eight staffing reductions on Aug. 1. The former autonomous vehicle company Cruise said one job cut occurred on May 30. The tech industry is no longer a robust engine that helps to power the Bay Area economy. Instead, it has begun to weigh down hiring . The weakness in the Bay Area tech industry so far in 2025 is widespread, according to seasonally adjusted estimates that Beacon Economics derived from the monthly reports released by the state EDD. Of the 11,200 net loss in tech jobs for the Bay Area, the majority occurred in the San Francisco-San Mateo region. The nosedive in tech employment has materialized in the San Francisco metro area despite some optimistic assessments that the artificial intelligence industry was providing a jobs lift to the city. Here is how tech job trends looked in the Bay Area’s three largest urban centers over the first four months of 2025, according to this news organization’s compilation of the Beacon Economics industry estimates: — San Francisco-San Mateo suffered a net loss of 5,400 tech jobs. — The South Bay lost 3,400 tech jobs. — The East Bay shed a net total of 2,100 tech jobs. In the North Bay, Sonoma County lost 200 tech jobs, and Marin County lost 100 positions. Tech job totals were unchanged in Solano County and Napa County over the first four months of this year. The tech industry has entered what appears to be a protracted period of attempting to right-size its operations in the Bay Area after massive hiring sprees during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, companies also have jumped into new fields such as artificial intelligence even as they downsized in sectors that did not appear to be as promising.

    "article_text": "2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool June 4, 2025 5 min read SPOT META Key Points Up 44% year to date, this streaming service stock keeps moving higher thanks to its newfound profitability. This social media giant boasts some of the best fundamentals within the tech sector. 10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms › After a very tough start to the year, tech sector stocks are back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dipped as much as 24% from highs set earlier this year. However, in recent weeks, the index has rallied significantly, erasing nearly all of those losses and pulling back to even for 2025. Given this market recovery, those looking to invest in tech stocks are now wondering what stocks are worth considering when the market is trading near all-time highs. There are two tech stocks that I would strongly consider right now. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Spotify Technology First up is Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) . As of this writing, Spotify stock is up 50% year to date, making it one of the top-performing stocks so far in 2025. Indeed, over the last three years, Spotify is up more than 477%. What's behind this excellent performance? And why do I think the stock will continue to beat the market? There are three main reasons for the company's success. First, Spotify boasts a strong competitive moat. By creating personalized playlists and honing its suggestions based on its users' likes and dislikes, Spotify gives its customers what they want when they want it. In addition, with over 675 million monthly average users , Spotify now benefits from a significant network effect, where people can easily connect with others to share new tracks and playlists. Consequently, Spotify users are less likely to leave the platform once they have built out their musical preferences and connected with friends. Second, Spotify's fundamentals have improved greatly. In particular, Spotify is now a consistently profitable company -- something that couldn't be said a few years ago. Indeed, take a look at Spotify's net income by quarter, and it's clear that the company has turned an important corner. After many quarters of struggling to generate any profit at all , the company has now produced several quarters of net income in the $200 million to $300 million range. Over the last 12 months, Spotify's net income stands at $1.3 billion. Spotify's management is the last key piece to the puzzle. CEO Daniel Ek deserves credit for Spotify's performance. In 2022, Ek prioritized profitability by slashing costs while still focusing on growth. He's both the founder and CEO of the company; his capable leadership and solid track record are more reasons investors should have confidence in Spotify . Story Continues 2. Meta Platforms Then there's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) . Here, too, t here are three aspects of Meta's stock and its business that I find particularly appealing. First off, Meta is a leader in digital advertising. The company generates a staggering $170 billion in annual revenue, and around 97% of that revenue comes from ad revenue generated by its social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. What's more , the digital advertising sector continues to grow at a strong pace. Statista estimates that by 2030, fully 80% of all advertising will be digital, amounting to around $1.2 trillion worldwide. That would represent an increase in digital ad spending of roughly 50% over the next five years. Second, Meta is a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company , too . It has invested billions in AI infrastructure, which is already generating returns for the company by improving ad strategies and return on investment (ROI) for advertisers on its platforms, which, in turn, drive higher ad rates. As Meta continues to invest in AI, higher platform engagement and additional (perhaps paid) features could help drive higher revenue and profitability for the company. Lastly, because of its prominent place within the digital advertising food chain and its AI initiatives, Meta's fundamentals are some of the best within the tech sector. Over the last 12 months, Meta generated: $170 billion in revenue $67 billion in net income $52 billion in free cash flow On top of those impressive metrics, in its most recently reported quarter, Meta bought back more than $13 billion of its own stock, reducing its overall share count and boosting the price of outstanding shares. To sum up, Meta's business model is firing on all cylinders and its stock boasts excellent fundamentals. Investors looking for a strong tech stock with fantastic prospects should strongly consider Meta. Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

    "article_text": "Innovation Mental Health In The Tech Industry: A Leadership Mandate By Vivek Singh , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 02, 2025, 07:00am EDT Share Save Vivek Singh, Sr. Vice President of IT & Strategic Planning Palayekar Companies Inc . getty Mental health is no longer a luxury reserved for large corporations—it’s a strategic necessity for any company aiming to retain talent and build sustainable workplaces. As a young tech leader, I didn’t fully grasp the depth of this issue. But in February 2020, I had the privilege of attending a reception at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. The event was organized by the World Youth Group under the theme #IAmWithYou. At this gathering, I started to understand the necessity of bringing awareness to and finding solutions for the global rise in emotional and mental health issues. All business leaders must think more about how to design our modern work environments for human well-being. In the tech industry, we may be among the worst offenders. The Numbers Don’t Lie The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently reported that 76% of U.S. workers have experienced \"at least one symptom of a mental health condition,\" and 84% believe their workplace conditions contributed to it. This issue impacts businesses: 81% said they’ll seek future employers that support mental well-being. Also, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety and depression alone cost the global economy over $1 trillion annually in lost productivity. Despite this, most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still lack structured wellness programs. One of the big challenges for the tech industry, in particular, is the role that physical exercise plays in mental health. The WHO recommends \"at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week,\" a goal that often feels out of reach in sedentary office settings. The first step in addressing this issue for leaders in the tech industry is to recognize our teams in these statistics: long hours, screens everywhere and no real pause to move. A Wake-Up Call For The Tech Industry The #IAmWithYou gathering in 2020 planted the seed for what is now growing into a formal United Nations resolution: International Sports Week. The resolution proposes an annual observance from April 5 to April 9, encouraging governments to invest in sports, physical activity and recreational programs. All tech companies should take part in this week, but we must also think about how to incorporate physical activity into our offices year-round. It’s not rocket science: Physical activity improves how we feel, think and work . Think back to your childhood—the joy of playing outside, the energy, the freedom. That wasn’t just fun—it was emotional clarity, mental release and health in motion. Physical activity is more than fitness; it’s a catalyst for stress relief, connection and sharper thinking. Data from the HHS and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reinforce the same truth: Lower stress leads to higher focus, creativity and long-term performance. To solve this crisis, the tech industry must stop viewing wellness as an HR checkbox and start treating it as part of our infrastructure. To begin, draw inspiration not only from other companies but also—crucially—from non-tech models. For example, the WHO’s SME Wellness Guide offers several actionable tips on how to incorporate physical activity in the workplace. Likewise, college athletics programs can provide excellent examples for improving wellness and mental health in teams. Once you've got a solid plan, every tech leader should embrace these three mantras: • Mental health is a business imperative, not a benefit. • Physical activity is a strategic investment, not extracurricular. • Workplace design must evolve—from screen-bound to human-centered. The next generation of talent isn’t chasing beanbags or Ping-Pong tables. They’re seeking workplaces that genuinely care about their well-being. As leaders, we must lighten the load—not add to it. It’s time to stop treating wellness as an afterthought. Let’s embed it into the way we work, lead and live. Because when movement shapes our culture, we don’t just build better companies—we cultivate healthier, more resilient people.

    "article_text": "Tech industry leaders call for fixed tax regime and investor-friendly reforms in FY26 budget The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) has urged the federal government to avoid introducing new taxes on the IT sector in the upcoming national budget. Scheduled for June 10, the budget is seen as critical for Pakistan’s growing tech industry, which currently supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. P@SHA Chairman Sajjad Mustafa Syed stated that out of the $700 million invested in the country’s IT industry, $600 million comes from companies affiliated with the association. He emphasized that consistent and business-friendly policies are essential for continued growth and international investor confidence. Syed called for a fixed tax regime for the next ten years, from 2025 to 2035, to be formally included in the upcoming FY26 budget. He also stressed the importance of maintaining the 0.25% withholding tax rate for PSEB-registered companies even beyond 2026, under this long-term system. Highlighting inequalities within the tax system, he pointed out that remote freelancers only pay a 1% tax, while full-time salaried IT workers may be taxed up to 35%. He urged the government to create fair and uniform tax policies for all employment categories within the sector. Moreover, Syed emphasized the need to simplify the process for transferring foreign earnings, noting that unclear financial rules could scare off potential investors. He warned that if reforms are not made quickly, around 600,000 jobs in Pakistan’s IT sector could be at serious risk. As the budget date approaches, P@SHA’s strong message adds pressure on policymakers to adopt reforms that protect jobs and help position Pakistan as a global technology hub."

    "article_text": "On the last day of Web Summit Vancouver, Innovate BC president Peter Cowan announced a renewed $30 million commitment to the provincial Crown agency’s Integrated Marketplace program, designed to help de-risk the adoption of technology services from across BC. The initiative is being funded in collaboration with PacifiCan after a successful three-year pilot. Local entrepreneurs Jessica Yip and Scott Beatty joined Cowan at the announcement, alongside Diana Gibson, BC’s new minister of Jobs, Economic Development, and Innovation (JEDI). Gibson was named to the role in November 2024, taking over from Brenda Bailey. Now six months into her tenure, BetaKit caught up with Minister Gibson after the press conference to talk about upcoming policies, dismantling trade barriers, BC’s slipping venture numbers, and her thoughts on the first-ever Web Summit Vancouver. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. What feedback have you received from the tech ecosystem so far, and how is that shaping your mandate? The data shows our tech sector has been thriving. Its growth has outpaced inflation for the last ten years, and we have over 180,000 people working in that sector now. We’ve heard that the talent pool is rich here and that it is attracting investment and business. We’ve invested to deepen that talent pool and continue to work with our research universities and our tech sector to ensure that ecosystem support is there. We’ve also heard that the richness of the ecosystem, moving from early R&D through to big anchor companies, is starting to [take root]. The diversity of size and scale really puts you on a jumping-off point to grow to the next level. Is there a specific piece of innovation policy you are excited about? Today, the thing I’m most excited about is the Integrated Marketplace program. The program is showing incredible results. First, it delivers for the startup that’s given a reference customer and the opportunity to jump onto the national and world stage. Second, it helps the industry partner that’s looking to solve a problem—whether that’s a port, or an airport, or the health sector delivering in rural and remote communities. And it helps them be at the forefront of innovation, too. They can pick up early tech and innovation and be competitive. And it helps the government problem-solve. The 30 startups we’ve been supporting are showing incredible results. Your predecessor was thanked by CEO Paddy Cosgrave for her help in bringing Web Summit to Vancouver. What policies from her time as JEDI minister are you looking to continue? Minister Bailey leaves really big shoes to fill, and had such ambition. It’s a testament to her legacy that the tech sector is in such a strong and resilient place at this moment, where we are all facing such headwinds. We share a real passion for continuing to see our tech sector on the world stage, growing and thriving. She worked hard to bring Web Summit here, and it is really the moment for Web Summit to be here in Vancouver while we profile the incredible innovation in BC. We are looking to continue to ensure the framework is there with the investments we’ve had in talent and the new talent spaces we’ve invested in. [With the] Innovate BC and InBC Crown corporations that are working to support the ecosystem, whether that’s through investment, or whether that’s through IP mentorship. So, continuing to build out the supports around our tech sector so that it can thrive to continue to grow the legacy Minister Bailey left. Last year, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments offered a combined $14.8 million CAD to bring Web Summit to Vancouver. Has the event been worth the investment so far? Every penny. The relationships I’ve seen built already, the feedback we’ve heard is that the partnerships are here. The energy is here. It’s so important that we’re here in Vancouver showcasing the innovation. The over 12,000 companies here [across BC] that are able to be on the world stage and what our government is doing to be at the table is a real indicator of that priority. A recent CVCA report showed that BC fell behind Alberta in Q1 capital deployment. Is that alarming, and what can BC do to regain ground? We were ahead of the game on VC, and there may be others playing some catch-up there, but I’m not worried. BC continues to invest, to engage, and to partner. Our ecosystem is rich, and thriving, and resilient. We will continue to grow together. Programs like Integrated Marketplace, our Manufacturing Jobs Fund, and our new digital sector tax credit show that our government is at the table to work with our partners across the tech ecosystem to see them supported to thrive and grow. We’ve also seen a dearth of early-stage venture funding across the country. What policy steps are you taking to help venture funds and early-stage startups in BC? I think that’s part of what we are doing with our Integrated Marketplace and with InBC. We are working with InBC to work with our venture capital funds and angel investors to support that gap. We are doing a review of our innovate programs right now so we can identify specific gaps where we can better support the tech ecosystem. We will also be coming out with additional actions later. The new prime minister has committed to eliminating interprovincial trade barriers. Which areas of BC tech will benefit most, and which barriers are you fighting to eliminate? We know it can be challenging, particularly when we are facing headwinds, and our government is looking to ensure it is as easy as possible to do business here in BC. That is why I have an ease of doing business review in my ministry mandate and why we are looking to unlock interprovincial trade barriers and internal trade barriers to doing business. What we see is a multiplicity of layering. For example, layered regulation and duplication, and that is what I am looking to tackle. In the midst of US trade tensions, is BC procuring more Canadian tech, and will that continue? That is really what Integrated Marketplace does. It allows us to buy BC while we profile the success of our BC innovation through proof cases, real problem solving, and real-world examples, while they can show their results with the reference customer and jump to the world stage. It gives us the opportunity to unlock that BC opportunity. Feature image courtesy Innovate BC."

    "article_text": "Command Line AI Tech OpenAI wants ChatGPT to be a ‘super assistant’ for every part of your life An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” An internal strategy document lays out OpenAI’s ambition to build “your interface to the internet.” by Alex Heath May 30, 2025, 11:18 PM UTC Link Share If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Image: The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Thanks to the legal discovery process, Google’s antitrust trial with the Department of Justice has provided a fascinating glimpse into the future of ChatGPT. An internal OpenAI strategy document titled “ChatGPT: H1 2025 Strategy” describes the company’s aspiration to build an “AI super assistant that deeply understands you and is your interface to the internet.” Although the document is heavily redacted in parts, it reveals that OpenAI aims for ChatGPT to soon develop into much more than a chatbot. “In the first half of next year, we’ll start evolving ChatGPT into a super-assistant: one that knows you, understands what you care about, and helps with any task that a smart, trustworthy, emotionally intelligent person with a computer could do,” reads the document from late 2024. “The timing is right. Models like 02 and 03 are finally smart enough to reliably perform agentic tasks, tools like computer use can boost ChatGPT’s ability to take action, and interaction paradigms like multimodality and generative UI allow both ChatGPT and users to express themselves in the best way for the task.” The document goes on to describe a “super assistant” as “an intelligent entity with T-shaped skills” for both widely applicable and niche tasks. “The broad part is all about making life easier: answering a question, finding a home, contacting a lawyer, joining a gym, planning vacations, buying gifts, managing calendars, keeping track of todos, sending emails.” It mentions coding as an early example of a more niche task. Even when reading around the redactions, it’s clear that OpenAI sees hardware as essential to its future, and that it wants people to think of ChatGPT as not just a tool, but a companion. This tracks with Sam Altman recently saying that young people are using ChatGPT like a “ life advisor.” “Today, ChatGPT is in our lives through existing form factors — our website, phone, and desktop apps,” another part of the strategy document reads. “But our vision for ChatGPT is to help you with all of your life, no matter where you are. At home, it should help answer questions, play music, and suggest recipes. On the go, it should help you get to places, find the best restaurants, or catch up with friends. At work, it should help you take meeting notes, or prepare for the big presentation. And on solo walks, it should help you reflect and wind down.” At the same time, OpenAI finds itself in a wobbly position. Its infrastructure isn’t able to handle ChatGPT’s rising usage, which explains Altman’s focus on building data centers. In a section of the document describing AI chatbot competition, the company writes that “we are leading here, but we can’t rest,” and that “growth and revenue won’t line up forever.” It acknowledges that there are “powerful incumbents who will leverage their distribution to advantage their own products,” and states that OpenAI will advocate for regulation that requires other platforms to allow people to set ChatGPT as the default assistant. (Coincidentally, Apple is rumored to soon let iOS users also select Google’s Gemini for Siri queries. Meta AI just hit one billion users as well, thanks mostly to its many hooks in Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook.) “We have what we need to win: one of the fastest-growing products of all time, a category-defining brand, a research lead (reasoning, multimodal), a compute lead, a world-class research team, and an increasing number of effective people with agency who are motivated to ship,” the OpenAI document states. “We don’t rely on ads, giving us flexibility on what to build. Our culture values speed, bold moves, and self-disruption. Maintaining these advantages is hard work but, if we do, they will last for a while.” Elsewhere Apple chickens out: For the first time in a decade, Apple won’t have its execs participate in John Gruber’s annual post-WWDC live podcast . Gruber recently wrote the viral “something is rotten in the state of Cupertino” essay, which was widely discussed in Apple circles. Although he hasn’t publicly connected that critical piece to the company backing out of his podcast, it’s easy to see the throughline. It says a lot about the state of Apple when its leaders don’t even want to participate in what has historically been a friendly forum. Elon was high : As Elon Musk attempts to reframe the public’s view of him by doing interviews about SpaceX, The New York Times reports that last year, he was taking so much ketamine that it “was affecting his bladder.” He also reportedly “traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall.” Both Musk and the White House have had multiple opportunities to directly refute this report, and they have not. Now, Musk is at least partially stepping away from DOGE along with key lieutenants like Steve Davis. DOGE may be a failure based on Musk’s own stated hopes for spending cuts, but his closeness to Trump has certainly helped rescue X from financial ruin and grown SpaceX’s business. Now, the more difficult work begins: saving Tesla. Overheard “The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us.” - Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Decoder , explaining why the company’s search results won’t be changed for President Trump or anyone else. “Compared to previous technology changes, I’m a little bit more worried about the labor impact… Yes, people will adapt, but they may not adapt fast enough.” - Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on CNN raising the alarm about the technology he is developing. “Meta is a very different company than it was nine years ago when they fired me.” - Anduril founder Palmer Luckey telling Ashlee Vance why he is linking up with Mark Zuckerberg to make headsets for the military. Personnel log The flattening of Meta’s AI organization has taken effect, with VP Ahmad Al-Dahle no longer overseeing the entire group. Now, he co-leads “AGI Foundations” with Amir Frenkel , VP of engineering, while Connor Hayes runs all AI products. All three men now report to Meta CPO Chris Cox , who has diplomatically framed the changes as a way to “give each org more ownership.” Xbox co-founder J Allard is leading a new ‘breakthrough’ devices group at Amazon called ZeroOne. One of the devices will be smart home-related, according to job listings. C.J. Mahoney , a former Trump administration official, is being promoted to general counsel at Microsoft, which has also hired Lisa Monaco from the last Biden administration to lead global policy. Reed Hastings is joining the board of Anthropic “because I believe in their approach to AI development, and to help humanity progress.” (He’s joining Anthropic’s corporate board, not the supervising board of its public benefit trust that can hire and fire corporate directors.) Sebastian Barrios , previously SVP at Mercado Libre, is joining Roblox as SVP of engineering for several areas, including ads, game discovery, and the company’s virtual currency work. Fidji Simo’s replacement at Instacart will be chief business officer Chris Rogers , who will become the company’s next CEO on August 15th after she officially joins OpenAI.

    "article_text": "News Technology Microsoft layoffs linked to AI restructuring, not performance: Satya Nadella explains Microsoft layoffs linked to AI restructuring, not performance: Satya Nadella explains Satya Nadella clarified that the recent layoffs affecting 6,000 employees were due to internal reorganisation driven by the company’s growing focus on AI, not performance issues. Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada addressed misconceptions around coding. Microsoft Image Source : Reuters Written By: Saumya Nigam @snigam04 Published: May 30, 2025 17:35 IST , Updated: May 30, 2025 17:35 IST New Delhi: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has clarified that the recent global layoffs affecting around 6,000 employees (3 per cent of the workforce) were due to restructuring efforts, not employee underperformance. During a company-wide town hall, Nadella said, “This was about reorganisation rather than performance,” pointing to Microsoft’s massive AI expansion and changing business priorities as the key drivers. The company has committed to spending USD 80 billion this fiscal year to build AI infrastructure and speed up the deployment of Copilot AI tools across services. Engineering and product development teams were among the most affected, reflecting how AI is reshaping even core technical roles. CPO: “Coding isn’t dead, it’s evolving” Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada countered growing concerns that AI is making coding skills obsolete. “I fundamentally disagree with the idea that coding is dead,” she said on a recent podcast. While acknowledging that AI now writes up to 30 per cent of internal Microsoft code, she emphasised this marks a shift, not the end of programming. She likened the change to how developers moved from assembly and C to higher-level languages. In the AI era, engineers may become “software operators”, managing and fine-tuning AI-generated code, rather than writing it from scratch. Project managers and coders: Roles will evolve In Washington State alone, 40 per cent of the eliminated roles were software engineers, and 30 per cent were project managers, according to Bloomberg. Despite these cuts, Chennapragada stressed that project managers will play a new role, helping teams navigate AI-generated ideas through editing and prioritisation, rather than being phased out. This restructuring highlights a major shift in the tech industry: AI won’t replace professionals, but it will redefine how they work.

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 29, 2025 at 3:05 PM PDT Tech companies disclosed plans to chop an estimated 419 jobs in the Bay Area, according to official WARN letters the firms sent to the state Employment Development Department. LinkedIn announced 270 job cuts, affecting workers in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Francisco. Of these, 159 were planned for Mountain View. The layoffs occurred on May 15, the company stated. Chegg reported 88 layoffs in Santa Clara. The downsizing occurred May 15. Hewlett Packard Enterprise disclosed 61 job cuts in San Jose. The reductions transpired on May 2. All of the job cuts were described as permanent. The staffing reductions come at a time when the Bay Area tech industry is struggling with its pace of hiring. Tech companies added 100 jobs in the region in April, according to a Beacon Economics seasonally adjusted estimate of tech industry employment categories derived from the official state EDD monthly jobs report. Employers added 1,600 tech jobs in the South Bay but slashed 1,200 tech positions in the East Bay and chopped 400 tech jobs in the San Francisco-San Mateo metro area, the Beacon estimate determined.

    "article_text": "2 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool May 28, 2025 5 min read CRTO HPE ^GSPC Key Points The tech sector has outperformed the broader market in recent years, but some proverbial Silicon Valley stocks remain undervalued. Criteo’s stock price is down, but its free cash flow has hit an all-time high. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a major force in high-performance computing, yet its stock remains cheap. 10 stocks we like better than Criteo › The tech sector has been a market-beating beast in recent years. Tech-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) have delivered annual returns of more than 21% over the last three years. Broad market trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) only gained 15.5% per year over the same period. Yes, that's a fantastic return from a historic perspective, but the tech sector offered even stronger gains. Image source: Getty Images. The technology boom has been driven by artificial intelligence (AI) news, starting with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Many leaders in the AI market have soared sky-high, adding fuel to the tech sector's market performance fires, but also making those market darlings a bit expensive. Fortunately, the market-moving forces left a few top-notch companies behind. I still see several tech stocks with a combination of bright business prospects and modest stock prices. Let's check out a couple of underappreciated bargain-bin tech stocks. This dynamic duo looks ready for a fresh bull run. 1. Criteo Digital advertising has been a troubled sector since the first signs of an inflation crisis in 2021. Paris-based commerce media specialist Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO) provides purchase-inspiring ad services to global brands. This focus placed the Parisian company in the epicenter of the inflation-based slowdown -- why invest in lavish marketing campaigns when consumers are pinching pennies and tightening belts? Criteo's revenues have indeed slumped since then, and so has the stock price. You know what's surging in recent quarters, though? That would be Criteo's free cash flows : CRTO Free Cash Flow data by YCharts The cash profits took a temporary dip, but came back stronger, with trailing cash flows reaching an all-time high in May's Q1 2025 report. But Criteo's stock price is down more than 30% in the last quarter, and the shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 11.3 times earnings and 6.6 times free cash flow. I'm not saying the digital ad market is roaring back to life in the spring of 2025. The political climate may result in another inflation spike, and advertisers are already reducing their ad-spot spending right now. Hence, Criteo's undervalued stock may see more volatility and weakness in the coming months. However, I think the market makers have underestimated Criteo's ability to turn cash profits in a soft market. Story continues The Criteo shares you buy at a discount in this downswing should return to more reasonable valuation ratios someday. At the same time, the company's robust cash generation makes it less vulnerable to short-term financial challenges. You can buy Criteo stock with confidence while it's cheap. This one is poised for great long-term returns, and patience is the greatest Wall Street virtue of them all. 2. Hewlett Packard Enterprise My next recommendation is more of a household name. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) has been around (in some form) since 1939. As the data center and cloud computing operator of the old HP business, HP Enterprise (aka HPE) plays a serious part in the AI boom. Indeed, seven out of the 10 most powerful supercomputers today were built by HP Enterprise. Only Chinese rival Lenovo has more systems in the top 500 than HP Enterprise, and nobody can match the total number-crunching performance of this company's ultra-powerful systems. Any company or organization that needs a top-performance system for their AI training and operations is likely to check out HP Enterprise's catalog first. So I'm talking about an AI powerhouse here. Yet, the stock price has dropped 16% lower year to date while smaller system builders Super Micro Computers (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Dell (NYSE: DELL) are up by 41% and down by just 1%, respectively. Trading at 8.9 times earnings and 14.3 times free cash flow, HP Enterprise looks downright cheap next to these challengers. HP Enterprise's stock could double or triple in price and still be affordable next to Supermicro or Dell. This could be a great value play on the hardware side of the AI boom. Should you invest $1,000 in Criteo right now? Before you buy stock in Criteo, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Criteo wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $653,389 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $830,492 !* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor ’s total average return is 982% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 171% for the S&P 500.

    "article_text": "(Google, City of Mountain View) Middlefield Park, a residential neighborhood in Mountain View located on Ellis Street, East Middlefield Road, West Maude Avenue and Logue Avenue, concept. By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM PDT | UPDATED: May 29, 2025 at 4:28 PM PDT MOUNTAIN VIEW — Google is pursuing the sale of 40 acres of its Mountain View properties for possible housing developments as the search giant seeks to operate more efficiently, the company confirmed. Spokesperson Ryan Lamont said the tech company is exploring the sale of its Middlefield Park site , a mixed-use neighborhood Google had secured approval for. “We continue to focus on investing in real estate efficiently to meet the needs of our hybrid workforce and business,” Lamont said. Google said it is considering potential buyers with the expertise and resources to build residential housing , according to Lamont. “A shift to housing at Middlefield Park would be a plus both for the region and for Google,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Campbell-based Creative Strategies, which tracks the tech industry. City officials have already approved 1,900 homes with 2.4 acres of land to be dedicated to the city of Mountain View for the development of up to 380 units of affordable housing. The development plan includes 50,000 square feet of active ground-floor uses such as shops, restaurants and community spaces. Middlefield Park also was expected to produce 1.3 million square feet of office space. Plans for the neighborhood envision the removal of 14 existing industrial, office and research buildings to clear the way for the new village. “Right-sizing is the correct way to look at this,” Bajarin said. “These sales have more to do with Google’s strategic direction. These Mountain View buildings in particular were important at the height of Silicon Valley’s tech boom. But right now these buildings are not as strategic for Google.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the roster of potential buyers for Middlefield Park consists of one company or multiple companies with residential development expertise. It also isn’t certain whether Google would sell all the sites to one buyer or multiple new owners. None of the Middlefield Park sales maneuvers signal a retreat by Google from its home territories. “We remain committed to our long-term presence in Mountain View,” Lamont said. Changing times are nothing new for companies like Google and others in Silicon Valley. “The tech industry is dynamic,” Bajarin said. “It ebbs and flows. The tech industry can carry out layoffs at the same time it’s hiring a lot of people.” The early months of 2025 produced a rough start for the industry in the Bay Area. Companies slashed a net total of 8,700 positions, according to a Beacon Economics estimate. Employers chopped 6,900 jobs in January and another 1,800 in February. “All bets are off for the whole tech industry,” said Russell Hancock, president of San Jose-based think tank Joint Venture Silicon Valley. “Google and other tech companies have become more cautious and incremental.” Following the COVID-19 pandemic, some businesses had to rethink how they would operate and expand. Google was no exception, according to Hancock. “Google is in business to change the world, create cutting-edge profits, make money,” Hancock said. “Google also had a more expansive view of their enterprise. They wanted to build communities, create neighborhoods, build housing and be a company that would integrate all of those things. “The pandemic changed everything. It threw a wrench into everything. It’s a different world on the other side of this. If you are running any company, you look at the world completely differently.” Now, for companies like Google, the rise of artificial intelligence is having an effect on present and future operations. “Artificial intelligence is real, investments are happening, AI profitability is there, and the tech’s efficiency kick is paying off,” Hancock said.

    "article_text": "The tech sector has been a market-beating beast in recent years. Tech-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ 0.27% ) have delivered annual returns of more than 21% over the last three years. Broad market trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO +0.23% ) only gained 15.5% per year over the same period. Yes, that's a fantastic return from a historic perspective, but the tech sector offered even stronger gains. Image source: Getty Images. The technology boom has been driven by artificial intelligence (AI) news, starting with the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Many leaders in the AI market have soared sky-high, adding fuel to the tech sector's market performance fires, but also making those market darlings a bit expensive. Fortunately, the market-moving forces left a few top-notch companies behind. I still see several tech stocks with a combination of bright business prospects and modest stock prices. Let's check out a couple of underappreciated bargain-bin tech stocks. This dynamic duo looks ready for a fresh bull run. Expand NASDAQ : CRTO Criteo Today's Change ( 1.40 %) $ 0.31 Current Price $ 22.51 Key Data Points Market Cap $1B Day's Range $ 22.22 - $ 22.78 52wk Range $ 19.50 - $ 47.27 Volume 405K Avg Vol 421K Gross Margin 53.81 % Dividend Yield N/A 1. Criteo Digital advertising has been a troubled sector since the first signs of an inflation crisis in 2021. Paris-based commerce media specialist Criteo ( CRTO +1.40% ) provides purchase-inspiring ad services to global brands. This focus placed the Parisian company in the epicenter of the inflation-based slowdown -- why invest in lavish marketing campaigns when consumers are pinching pennies and tightening belts? Criteo's revenues have indeed slumped since then, and so has the stock price. You know what's surging in recent quarters, though? That would be Criteo's free cash flows : CRTO Free Cash Flow data by YCharts The cash profits took a temporary dip, but came back stronger, with trailing cash flows reaching an all-time high in May's Q1 2025 report. But Criteo's stock price is down more than 30% in the last quarter, and the shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 11.3 times earnings and 6.6 times free cash flow. I'm not saying the digital ad market is roaring back to life in the spring of 2025. The political climate may result in another inflation spike, and advertisers are already reducing their ad-spot spending right now. Hence, Criteo's undervalued stock may see more volatility and weakness in the coming months. However, I think the market makers have underestimated Criteo's ability to turn cash profits in a soft market. The Criteo shares you buy at a discount in this downswing should return to more reasonable valuation ratios someday. At the same time, the company's robust cash generation makes it less vulnerable to short-term financial challenges. You can buy Criteo stock with confidence while it's cheap. This one is poised for great long-term returns, and patience is the greatest Wall Street virtue of them all . Expand NYSE : HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise Today's Change ( -4.15 %) $ -0.99 Current Price $ 22.89 Key Data Points Market Cap $32B Day's Range $ 22.77 - $ 23.75 52wk Range $ 11.96 - $ 26.44 Volume 29M Avg Vol 28M Gross Margin 28.65 % Dividend Yield 0.02 % 2. Hewlett Packard Enterprise My next recommendation is more of a household name. Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE 4.15% ) has been around (in some form) since 1939. As the data center and cloud computing operator of the old HP business, HP Enterprise (aka HPE) plays a serious part in the AI boom. Indeed, seven out of the 10 most powerful supercomputers today were built by HP Enterprise. Only Chinese rival Lenovo has more systems in the top 500 than HP Enterprise, and nobody can match the total number-crunching performance of this company's ultra-powerful systems. Any company or organization that needs a top-performance system for their AI training and operations is likely to check out HP Enterprise's catalog first. So I'm talking about an AI powerhouse here. Yet, the stock price has dropped 16% lower year to date while smaller system builders Super Micro Computers ( SMCI 3.46% ) and Dell ( DELL 2.75% ) are up by 41% and down by just 1%, respectively. Trading at 8.9 times earnings and 14.3 times free cash flow, HP Enterprise looks downright cheap next to these challengers. HP Enterprise's stock could double or triple in price and still be affordable next to Supermicro or Dell. This could be a great value play on the hardware side of the AI boom."

Ive, a key player in Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) design history, will now be directing design at OpenAI. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , in his latest weekly \"Power On\" shared that Apple’s stronghold in the tech industry is being challenged. The tech giant, which has been grappling to make significant progress in artificial intelligence, is seeing an exodus of talent, including high-ranking executives and engineers. This comes at a time when competitors like Google and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are making strides in generative AI. Jony Ive, Apple’s former designer who played a pivotal role in the design of the iPhone and other iconic products, has now joined the ranks of a competitor. OpenAI has acquired Ive’s io startup for a whopping $6.5 billion. Ive will now be in charge of design at OpenAI, which includes the development of new hardware devices. While Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9 will showcase redesigned versions of Apple’s operating systems, no major AI breakthroughs are anticipated. The OpenAI deal is a wake-up call for Apple, which seems to be stuck in a legacy world.

However, the tech landscape is evolving, and AI is fast becoming as fundamental as the multitouch display was two decades ago. Apple’s past triumphs don’t assure its future, and the company is evidently struggling to adapt. Apple is developing smart glasses for next year, but this device will be an add-on to the iPhone, not a substitute. The pressure is mounting for Apple to pioneer the next computing era, which entails revitalizing the Apple Intelligence platform, launching innovative new hardware, and creating the next iPhone before its competitors. The acquisition of Ive’s startup by OpenAI signals a significant shift in the tech industry. With Apple’s key talent moving to competitors and the company’s struggle to make substantial progress in AI, its dominance is under threat. The tech landscape is evolving rapidly, and companies that fail to adapt risk being left behind. This development underscores the importance of AI in shaping the future of the tech industry.

    "article_text": "Billionaire fund manager, skeptical of AI, backs shocking stock Samuel O'Brient May 24, 2025 4 min read AMD NVDA A highly controversial figure in some circles, Ken Griffin remains one of Wall Street’s most prominent and respected hedge fund managers. Since founding Miami-based hedge fund Citadel Securities in 1990, Griffin has amassed a net worth of more than $44 billion. This makes him one of the highest-earning people in his field, second only to Israel Englander of Millennium Management. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵 While Citadel’s aggressive trading strategy has garnered criticism over the years, the fund’s success is undeniable, as evidenced by the fact that it reported its largest trading revenue haul to date in March 2025, with 55% gains for the year. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has minted a new generation of market winners over the past several years, some financiers have embraced this new technology. Griffin has taken a different approach and expressed some skepticism. But some recent filings reveal he sees potential in one AI stock. Hedge fund Citadel, led by billionaire Ken Griffin, made some surprising moves during Q1.Image source: Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Ken Griffin recently doubled down on one AI stock, trimmed his bet on a close rival Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, many companies have focused on tapping into this booming market, from established tech-sector leaders to new, cutting-edge startups. Through it all, both retail and institutional investors have been working hard to identify the next winners before they surge. Related: Billionaire fund manager unloads over $100 million of Tesla stock For many, that meant trying to find the next Nvidia ( NVDA ) . Often considered the industry’s most prominent chipmaker, the tech-sector giant has become synonymous with the AI boom, as its shares surged to new heights and analysts heaped praise on the stock. Despite its track record, Griffin isn’t so bullish on Nvidia’s growth prospects. During the first quarter of 2025, Citadel slashed its NVDA stock position roughly in half, selling 1,555,264 shares. Data shows that this puts it among the fund’s top sells by change in portfolio percentage. Griffin hasn’t embraced AI as much as some of his peers, maintaining a skeptical outlook toward the technology’s overall impact. “Do we use it in our investment business? A little bit, a little bit. I can’t say it’s been game-changing,” he recently stated . “It saves some time. It’s a productivity enhancement tool. It’s nice [but] I don’t think it’s going to revolutionize most of what we do in finance.” He added that generative AI models are limited as investment analysis tools, since they are still unable to produce long-term forecasts. While Citadel trimmed its stake in Nvidia in Q1, it doubled down on one of the chipmaker’s biggest rivals. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) also produces graphics processing units (GPUs) that help companies build and scale large language models (LLMs). Story Continues More Hedge Fund News: Fund manager has shocking Elon Musk and Tesla prediction Veteran fund manager sends surprising message on the weak dollar Billionaire fund manager makes $40 million bet on Dollar Tree While it’s often overshadowed by Nvidia, AMD stock seems to be a favorite of Griffin. Citadel increased its stake in the chipmaker by more than 300%, adding 2,786,115 shares to its position during Q1, a current market value of roughly $326 million. Why does Griffin favor one AI stock over the other? As close rivals, Nvidia and AMD are often compared, despite the fact that Nvidia has consistently outperformed its smaller-cap peer. Wall Street is quite bullish on the two stocks, which maintain 34 and 22 buy ratings, respectively, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus for both. Related: One AI stock makes up 78% of Nvidia's investment portfolio However, when someone like Ken Griffin bets big on one stock while trimming his position in the other, investors are likely to listen. The answer may lie in the zero-sum nature of financial markets, as multiple analysts have illustrated. Jay Goldberg of Seaport Research Partners recently highlighted several potential concerns regarding NVDA stock, including questions from customers regarding the utility of Nvidia’s technology and the “complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems.” He added that many customers are taking steps to design their own chips in-house, in a clear attempt to decrease their reliance on Nvidia’s overpriced GPUs. Meanwhile, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri recently issued a bullish take on AMD, speculating that it could benefit from Nvidia’s problems. “The story in our eyes still hinges on the new family of AI solutions coming next year, but customer traction among US hyperscalers is gaining momentum, and AMD may be able to draft off of NVDA’s ‘growing pains’ in ramping these new system solutions this year,” he stated.

    "article_text": "Innovation AI Agents And Trade Policies: The Biggest Impacts On Tech Today By Andreas Bubenzer-Paim , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) May 23, 2025, 09:45am EDT Share Save Andreas Bubenzer-Paim is Head of Technology Banking at BMO . Overseeing the delivery of financial services to U.S. technology companies. getty Whether it’s shifting consumer demand, politics, the economy or social trends, the tech sector is influenced by what’s going on in the world. Right now, however, no issues are having a more immediate impact than the rapid progression of artificial intelligence and recent trade policies. Artificial Intelligence: Even Bigger Than We Think AI has advanced beyond the introductory stage to the implementation period. AI hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google and Meta are set to spend over $320 billion in 2025 on AI-related technologies and infrastructure, up 40% from 2024. Every sector appears to be pushing forward with AI adoption. Retailers use AI for inventory optimization; banks use it for fraud prevention; industrial companies use it to create predictive maintenance tools; and healthcare firms deploy AI for drug discovery and diagnostics. Generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have disrupted the tech sector, and Chinese startup DeepSeek has further shaken things up. In January, the company’s latest model, DeepSeek R1, claimed to outperform the latest OpenAI model at a fraction of the cost . Fears over DeepSeek’s potential disruptive impact caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet—including erasing close to $600 billion from AI chipmaker Nvidia’s market capitalization. Several countries have banned DeepSeek , deeming it a \"national security risk.\" Several U.S. states have also banned the app from government devices, and the Trump administration is reportedly weighing a nationwide ban on government devices, citing concerns over DeepSeek’s handling of user data. While AI has dominated conversations about the future of business, it’s clear we still haven’t fully grasped how quickly things are moving or the true potential impact of this technology. The most immediate impact comes from agentic AI, which can perform multistep tasks with little human intervention. Over the next five to 10 years, AI will likely evolve from AI assistants completing single tasks to AI agents independently perceiving, evaluating and solving more complex tasks—ultimately performing entire job functions. According to market intelligence firm IDC , \"generative and agentic AI will completely transform the way enterprise applications are designed, delivered, and engaged with by users.\" Some financial institutions have made generative AI assistants available to their employees with an eye toward agentic AI, while others are exploring using AI for credit reviews. What would have taken portfolio analysts several days to complete can now be accomplished in a matter of hours. This isn’t something we expect to happen in the next few years; it’s happening now. These AI tools will help reduce turnaround times, costs and new product development cycles, and the speed of innovation will further accelerate in the medium to long term. Tariff And Trade Impacts The Trump administration’s tariffs on a wide range of goods from the U.S.’s biggest trading partners—and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by some of those countries—are creating uncertainty across all industries, and the tech sector is no exception. Technology relies heavily on global supply chains, which makes it particularly susceptible to trade policy disruptions. The current tariff environment mostly affects the hardware side of the industry—semiconductors, communications equipment and the like—in the following ways: Supply Chain Disruption The tech sector relies heavily on integrated global supply chains. New trade policies may compel companies to reassess and restructure these networks, causing operational delays and increased costs. Many of these supply chain setups were already tested and improved on during the U.S.-China trade war that began in 2018 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, many companies have diversified their manufacturing and/or supplier base globally, in some cases reshoring portions back to the U.S. They’ve also become more flexible in product design to adjust to component shortages. In some cases, companies can execute tariff-driven reshoring fairly quickly; in others—like the highly complex semiconductor supply chain—the process could take several years. Increased Production Costs Tariffs on essential components, such as semiconductors, are expected to raise manufacturing expenses for tech companies, potentially leading to higher consumer prices. Investment Uncertainty The unpredictability introduced by fluctuating trade policies can deter investment within the technology sector, as businesses may hesitate to commit resources amid an unstable trade environment. Conclusion In the face of these potential shocks, tech companies may consider going back to pandemic-era strategies like diversifying their supplier base or reshoring manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. Apple, for example, recently announced a $500 billion investment in U.S. facilities over the next four years, which could help it avoid tariffs on goods imported from China. But reshoring is not a short-term fix. It’s a process that will take years before companies—and the U.S. economy—see any benefits. In the meantime, companies can focus on short-term solutions by answering the following: • Do you already have a diversified supplier base to mitigate potential tariff-related impacts? If not, start exploring and talking to potential additional suppliers (in a different geography than your current suppliers). • Can you pass on part or all of the cost from tariffs to your customers? Review your existing contracts and try to renegotiate where appropriate and possible. • Can you replace imported components with ones manufactured in the U.S.? Have your product team explore alternatives to some of the harder-to-get components. The bottom line is that the time to act is now.

    "article_text": "Apple, Samsung, and Google are three of the most prominent forces shaping the global technology landscape. While they are often seen as fierce competitors, their relationships extend beyond rivalry into a complex web of interdependence. Each company brings unique strengths to the table, creating a dynamic where competition and collaboration coexist. This intricate balance is a cornerstone of the tech industry, driving innovation and ensuring sustained growth in a rapidly evolving market. The video below from Marques Brownlee gives us a detailed look at why these three tech companies need each other. Watch this video on YouTube . Apple and Samsung: A Complex Partnership Apple and Samsung are well-known adversaries in the smartphone market, yet their relationship is far more nuanced than simple competition. Samsung serves as a critical supplier for Apple, providing OLED displays that are integral to the performance and visual appeal of Apple’s flagship iPhones. This collaboration is mutually beneficial: Samsung earns substantial revenue from supplying these components, while Apple gains access to some of the most advanced display technology available, making sure its devices remain at the forefront of innovation. Despite this collaboration, challenges loom on the horizon. Apple is actively investing in microLED display technology , a move that could reduce its reliance on Samsung. This strategy aligns with Apple’s broader efforts to control its supply chain, as seen in its transition from Intel processors to its proprietary M-series chips. If Apple successfully adopts microLED displays, it could significantly alter its relationship with Samsung, potentially diminishing Samsung’s role in Apple’s product development. Such a shift would not only impact the two companies but could also ripple across the broader tech supply chain. Apple and Google: A Profitable but Controversial Alliance The partnership between Apple and Google is one of the most lucrative in the tech industry, yet it is not without controversy. Google reportedly pays Apple around $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on Safari, using the iPhone’s vast user base to maintain its dominance in mobile search. For Apple, this arrangement provides a steady and substantial revenue stream, while Google secures a critical foothold in the competitive search market. However, this alliance has drawn scrutiny from regulators. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether this agreement violates antitrust laws, raising questions about its future viability. If the courts rule against the partnership, Apple could face several pivotal decisions. It might continue the relationship under stricter regulations, switch to a competing search engine, or even develop its own search platform. Each of these scenarios carries significant implications, not only for Apple and Google but also for the broader tech ecosystem. A disruption in this partnership could reshape how users interact with search technologies on Apple devices, potentially altering the competitive dynamics of the search industry. Google and Samsung: Building an Ecosystem Together The relationship between Google and Samsung underscores the importance of collaboration in the tech industry. Samsung relies on Google’s Android operating system to power its smartphones, while Google benefits from Samsung’s dominant position in the global Android market. This symbiotic relationship ensures that both companies maintain their leadership in the highly competitive smartphone industry. Beyond software, their partnership extends into strategic financial agreements and product integration. Google often debuts new Android features on Samsung devices, showcasing their close alignment. Additionally, Google pays Samsung to pre-install its services, such as the Gemini AI platform , on Samsung smartphones. These arrangements not only strengthen Google’s ecosystem but also reinforce Samsung’s position as a leading Android manufacturer. By working together, the two companies ensure that Android remains a dominant force in the global smartphone market, benefiting both their businesses and the broader Android ecosystem. The Interplay of Competition and Collaboration The relationships between Apple, Samsung, and Google highlight the intricate dynamics of the tech industry, where competition and collaboration are deeply intertwined. These companies rely on one another to sustain innovation, meet consumer demands, and maintain their positions as industry leaders. While challenges such as regulatory scrutiny and technological shifts may disrupt these partnerships, they also underscore the necessity of cooperation in navigating an increasingly interconnected market. Understanding these dynamics offers valuable insight into how the tech industry operates. The interplay of rivalry and mutual dependence among these giants not only drives technological advancements but also shapes the future of the global technology landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, the balance between competition and collaboration will remain a defining feature of its growth and innovation.

    "article_text": "Nvidia CEO shares blunt message on China chip sales ban Samuel O'Brient May 21, 2025 4 min read NVDA Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock is in full focus after CEO Jensen Huang issued a strong statement on an important tech policy matter. Investors have harbored plenty of questions since the year began, as the new presidential administration has considered what its agenda will be on artificial intelligence (AI). The fast-growing frontier of the tech sector has emerged as an increasingly important area of public policy that experts believe legislators cannot afford to ignore. 💵💰 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵 Prior to leaving office, President Joe Biden passed an AI diffusion rule that limited the countries to which U.S. companies could sell chips. This quickly sparked a backlash from the tech community, as industry leaders argued that it would negatively impact not just their progress but also the U.S.’s AI dominance. Huang has issued statements on this policy before, making it clear where he stands. But earlier today (May 21), he addressed it again. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently spoke out against the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule.Image source: Edelson/Getty Images Huang doesn’t hold back in his take on China chip curbs After weeks of waiting, members of the AI community finally got what they had been anxiously awaiting last week, when the White House announced it would be rescinding Biden’s AI diffusion rule. This has been met with praise from many tech-sector leaders, who have made it clear they believe these initial policies were misguided. Related: Nvidia stock surges after surprising China trade war news Huang is certainly among them. The Nvidia CEO has been beating the drum on the importance of relaxing U.S.-China chip curbs for months. In early May 2025, he met with representatives of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the risks that he believed it posed to his company and the broader industry. On May 11, he spoke at Taipei‘s Computex tech forum and issued an even more blunt take on the China chip curb policy, describing the export control as a blatant “failure” and highlighting ways in which the new policies will benefit U.S. tech companies. As he noted, companies like Nvidia stood to lose a valuable market share if they were not able to sell in China. The east Asian nation has its own growing ecosystem of chipmakers who could have likely filled the void left by Western companies, severely compromising the U.S.’s AI dominance. “The local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development,” Huang stated . He added that the U.S. should remember that “China has 50% of the world’s AI researchers” and that the country is extremely efficient at producing software. Story Continues More Nvidia News: Nvidia CEO sounds the alarm on Chinese rival Veteran fund manager unveils bold Nvidia stock price target after rally Nvidia CEO sends Washington 10-word message on AI chip change Using his own company’s numbers, Huang illustrated the risk posed to firms like Nvidia by the original AI chip curbs. According to him, the leading chipmaker wrote off “billions of dollars” worth of sales, and its share of China’s booming AI chip market has fallen from 95% to 50% during Biden’s time in office. What’s next for Nvidia and its AI chip stock peers? Having received good news from Capitol Hill regarding the AI diffusion rule, Nvidia and its peers should be able to move forward with few obstacles. It comes at a highly opportune time, as it will likely enable Nvidia to continue competing with Huawei, a Chinese tech conglomerate that announced a new chip in April that it claims can compete with one of Nvidia’s most popular graphics processing units (GPUs). Related: One AI stock makes up 78% of Nvidia's investment portfolio Wall Street seems optimistic about Nvidia’s prospects. Loop Capital Markets recently reiterated its Buy rating on NVDA stock and bullish price target of $175. “The gist is our work suggests NVDA’s Apr Q print and July Q guide can be ‘good enough’ vs. Street to support the stock into what we believe is a 2HCY2025 materially stronger than Street,” the investment bank states, though it notes that there remain a lot of “moving parts” regarding Nvidia’s future. Even so, this recent development is likely a bullish indicator for AI stocks. It eases restrictions on chip sales and indicates that the Trump administration’s AI policy will include less regulation, just as Trump and Vice President JD Vance have discussed . This will likely set the stage for a future in which companies like Nvidia continue to dominate the AI market.

    "article_text": "AP Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Silicon Valley is witnessing a new kind of contest in order to dominate the field of artificial intelligence. While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters. Companies including OpenAI and Google , eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called “ICs” – the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies. Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI’s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech’s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman’s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources – both people and compute – behind the work he was excited about. A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Live Events Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said. Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment. In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.

    "article_text": "US-EU digital regulation tensions risking tech industry trade war Stu Robarts May 21, 2025 3 min read GLDAF Tensions between the US and the EU about antitrust and other digital regulation will continue to heighten under the second Trump administration and are likely to result in an escalating trade war within the tech industry, a new report forecasts. GlobalData’s Antitrust report notes that US President Donald Trump views the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) as “overseas extortion” of US companies but that Brussels has said it will make no concessions on its digital rules in trade negotiations with the US. It contends that Big Tech will be caught between these opposing views, with the DMA focussed on making the digital sector fairer and more contestable by regulating the power of “gatekeeper” companies in the sector. “There will likely be an acceleration in DMA enforcement as the EU uses the threat of fines and sanctions as bargain chips in tariff negotiations with Washington,” the report states. “The result could be a damaging tit-for-tat trade war in the tech industry.” Antitrust – efforts to avoid the over-concentration of power – is one of four sets of regulation that GlobalData expects to be specifically targeted in the coming years, the others being data privacy, online harm and AI ethics. There are six other areas it suggests will also gain attention from regulators but to a lesser extent: tax avoidance, misinformation, IP infringement, ESG, US-China sanctions and obstruction of justice. Antitrust and big tech Antitrust is an area of particular relevance to Big Tech due to the that power many major platforms and companies have built up within the industry and the advantage it affords them in maintaining competitive advantage. The report notes that tech platforms can build userbases by offering valuable or popular services at no cost. This, it adds, would have historically placed them outside the interests of antitrust regulators, which were principally concerned with price. However, the non-transparent data and privacy practices of many platforms can be seen as a detriment to product quality, bringing antitrust into the equation. Network effects can mean that new market entrants can struggle to compete against existing players. At the same time, large platforms can use data analytics from their large userbases to optimise performance in one way or another via data analytics, which often means that profit is prioritised over privacy and experience for the user. With all this in mind, the report adds: “Existing competition laws were not conceived for the digital era, particularly when defining significant market power and anticompetitive practices. They have struggled to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy, where tech giants thrive thanks to their extensive, established customer networks and low-cost capital.” Story Continues The DMA is the EU’s effort to curb the power of such companies that have become so-called “gatekeepers”– those that have an annual turnover equal to or above € 7.5bn ($8.5bn), operate a core platform service with more than 45 million monthly active end users in the EU, have more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the EU and met those two previous points for the past three years. However, many of the biggest tech companies in the world who meet these conditions are from the US, such as Amazon, Meta, Apple and Microsoft. GlobalData’s report suggests that the Trump administration view fines imposed on some of these companies as the EU begins to enforce the DMA as a “form of taxation” that warrants retaliation. “The Trump administration has emboldened Big Tech’s lobbying against EU competition laws and EU digital legislation more broadly,” it says. “Early in 2025, Mark Zuckerberg publicly complained about European ‘censorship’ and called on Trump to defend tech companies against it. Apple's Tim Cook reportedly asked the White House to intervene directly against EU fines imposed on his company. “Against this background, there are concerns that the new US administration will increase the pressure on Brussels around the DMA to ensure that US companies do not receive too much scrutiny and avoid fines.” \"US-EU digital regulation tensions risking tech industry trade war\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.

The Communications, Space and Technology Commission said the index is designed to assist policymakers and regulators in keeping pace with rapid changes in the sector. The index evaluates 194 countries based on 50 indicators across four key areas: regulatory authority independence, mandate, framework, and market competition. The Kingdom’s performance in the ICT Regulatory Tracker adds to a string of international successes in the technology sector. It has maintained its position as the second-highest ranking G20 nation in the ITU’s ICT Development Index for a second consecutive year. Saudi Arabia also ranked second among G20 countries in the UN’s Telecommunication Infrastructure Index. Separately, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia was named “Country of the Year” and topped the global rankings for the fastest-growing tech startup ecosystem in the 2024 StartupBlink Index. Riyadh was recognized as the world’s fastest-growing city in this category. Saudi Arabia ranked first globally in healthtech, and second in both insurtech and investment tech, as well as in logistics and delivery applications. It placed third in digital payments, fifth in gaming, and seventh worldwide in edtech. Riyadh also posted the highest global growth rate in innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems. The capital ranked first in nanotechnology and transportation technology, and second in fintech. As part of its broader strategic vision, the Saudi government is working to maximize the economic impact of the tech sector. The digital economy now contributes more than SAR495 billion ($132 billion) to GDP, representing 15% of the total. The ICT market size exceeded SAR180 billion ($48 billion) in 2024, creating over 381,000 quality jobs. Women’s empowerment has been a cornerstone of this transformation. Female participation in the tech sector surged from 7% in 2018 to 35% in 2024, the highest in the region and above the G20 and EU averages. In the realm of digital government, Saudi Arabia ranked fourth globally for digital services, second among G20 nations, and first in the region."

    "article_text": "Cantor Fitzgerald Reiterates Overweight on Aurora (AUR), Targets $12 Ghazal Ahmed May 19, 2025 4 min read We recently published a list of 11 AI Stocks On Wall Street’s Radar . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street’s radar. US President Donald Trump is all set to revive the country’s struggling coal industry. Last month, he signed a series of executive orders so that the government could meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers. Executive Order 14241 will allow several older coal-fired plants about to retire to continue generating power for the foreseeable future. This will be done to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence. READ NOW: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street Right Now and 9 AI Stocks Poised to Gain from Trump’s Middle East AI Push Repeatedly promoting coal as a power source for data centers, Trump told the World Economic Forum in January that he would be approving power plants for AI through an emergency declaration. He also called on tech companies to use coal as a backup power source. “They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup — good, clean coal.” However, with the tech industry investing billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and leveraging nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand, the use of coal is actually against the tech companies’ environmental goals. Nevertheless, the tech industry does acknowledge that fossil fuel generation will eventually be needed to help navigate the electricity demand from AI. However, these companies are focusing on natural gas as it emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power. “To have the energy we need for the grid, it’s going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time. We’re not surprised by the fact that we’re going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.” We would certainly consider it but I don’t know if I’d say it’s at the top of our list.” -Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Story Continues Cantor Fitzgerald Reiterates Overweight on Aurora (AUR), Targets $12 A closeup of a self-driving hardware unit inside the dashboard of a passenger vehicle. Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ: AUR ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Aurora Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ:AUR) is a self-driving technology company. On Monday, May 19, Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a positive outlook on the stock with an “Overweight” rating and a $12.00 price target. The company has recently achieved a significant milestone by launching its commercial self-driving service, Aurora Driver, in Texas. This milestone not only aligns with the management’s projected timeline but also places the company as the first to introduce self-driving trucks in the United States. Aurora will also be deemed a pioneer in operating a commercial autonomous driving service with heavy-duty trucks on public roads in the country. The company has announced plans to extend its driverless services by the end of the year. Its Autonomy Performance Indicator (API), a metric used to track the performance and readiness of autonomous vehicle systems, has reached 95% in the first quarter of 2025. This figure exceeds Aurora’s commercialization goal of 90%, a win for the company, which underscores its advancement in delivering reliable self-driving technology. Overall, AUR ranks 11th on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street’s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AUR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AUR and that has 100x upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock .

Data provided by the Department of Enterprise in response to a recent parliamentary question shows that the number of social media companies operating in Ireland has fallen by a fifth, from 40 in 2022 to 32 last year, while the number of employees in social media companies has fallen by 11 per cent from 15,478 in 2022 to 13,744 last year. DBI said it \"welcomes the commitments in the new Programme for Government to make Ireland an EU centre of expertise and a regulatory hub for companies operating across the EU Digital Single Market, while also ensuring that Ireland benefits from the innovation and investment potential of new technologies like AI\". Advertisement However, \"DBI believes the Programme for Government’s ambition must be matched with a pro-business, pro-growth approach to supporting Ireland’s digital and tech sector to balance digital compliance and growth\". In particular, DBI is calling on the Government to: Review and enhance the mandate and work of the Data Protection Commission and the State’s enterprise agencies to provide enhanced advisory and support services for businesses. Champion an accelerated simplification of EU digital regulation, to boost innovation and growth across the digital and tech sectors, and to seek data transfer agreements with more third countries. Digital Business Ireland chairperson Caroline Dunlea said: “The fall-off in jobs in social media companies operating in Ireland provides a timely reminder that Ireland must not take the digital and tech sector for granted. “Government must do more to protect jobs in the digital and tech sectors and to safeguard Ireland’s reputation as a supportive base for global digital and tech companies. “A pro-business, pro-growth approach to supporting the digital and tech sectors must be prioritised by the coalition as part of its competitiveness agenda.”"

What Happened : Gates intends to boost his foundation’s charitable contributions to public health and education in the coming two decades. Conversely, Musk has leveraged the White House DOGE office to drastically curtail US foreign aid expenditure and disband the US Agency for International Development, which he has termed a “criminal organization.” Gates’ strategy entails a long-term plan, whereas Musk’s method aligns with the tech industry’s fast-paced, disruptive ethos. Gates recently revealed plans to dissolve the Gates Foundation within the next 20 years, but contrary to reducing expenditure, he plans to augment it. As per the report by Insider, the foundation is set to distribute $9 billion in 2026 and aims to double the $100 billion it has donated since its inception in 2000, with a target of donating an additional $200 billion to public health and education causes by December 31, 2045. In contrast, DOGE, under Musk’s stewardship, has drastically reduced funding to USAID, leading to significant disruptions and a reduction of more than 80% of USAID’s contractual commitments. This has left organizations globally that depended on US funding scrambling to fulfill their missions. Also Read: Bill Gates Says This Simple Trait Is the Secret to His Success The divergent approaches of Gates and Musk to “efficiency” are clear. Musk’s strategy with DOGE embodies the lean, do-more-with-less ethos of tech startups, while the Gates Foundation aims to deliver humanitarian aid using a data-driven approach and expertise from organizations working directly with those in need. The disagreement between the two billionaires extends to their views on philanthropy. Gates has criticized Musk for his role in slashing the USAID budget, while Musk has previously dismissed most philanthropy as “bullshit.” Why It Matters : This public disagreement between two influential figures highlights the ongoing debate about the role of philanthropy and efficiency in addressing global challenges. Their contrasting approaches reflect broader discussions within the tech industry and philanthropic sector about the best ways to allocate resources and achieve impact. This debate will likely continue to shape the future of philanthropy and international aid.

The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) may be an attractive investment for several reasons, based on its structure, performance, and market positioning. Below are key points to consider when evaluating why to invest in SPMO, along with potential risks: Reasons to Invest in SPMO 1. Momentum-Based Strategy : • SPMO tracks the S&P 500 Momentum Index, which selects approximately 100 stocks from the S&P 500 with the highest “momentum score.” Momentum investing focuses on securities that have shown strong recent price performance, with the expectation that they will continue to outperform in the near term. This strategy can be particularly effective in bull markets or stable market conditions. • The momentum score is calculated based on the 12-month price change (excluding the most recent month) and adjusted for volatility, favoring stocks with smoother price increases. This approach aims to capture stocks with persistent performance while mitigating some risk. 2. Strong Historical Performance : • SPMO has outperformed the broader S&P 500 in various periods. For example, as of May 8, 2025, it returned 16.2% over the past year, 16.5% annualized over three years, and 22.2% annualized over five years, earning high grades (A) in its category (Large Blend). • Since its inception in 2015, SPMO has shown significant capital appreciation, often rising twice as fast as the S&P 500 in certain years, particularly due to exposure to high-momentum sectors like technology and AI-related stocks. 3. High Ratings and Consistency : • As of April 30, 2025, SPMO received a 5-star rating from Morningstar for both 3- and 5-year periods, based on risk-adjusted returns, placing it in the top 10% of 1,256 funds in its category. This reflects consistent performance and effective risk management. • The fund’s methodology, which weights stocks by market capitalization and momentum score, has contributed to its ability to deliver strong returns during favorable The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) is a compelling investment option for those seeking exposure to the technology sector. Below are key reasons to consider investing in VGT, along with potential risks, based on its structure, performance, and market positioning: Reasons to Invest in VGT 1. Broad Exposure to the Technology Sector : • VGT tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index, which includes large, mid, and small-cap U.S. companies in the information technology sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). With approximately 316 holdings, VGT offers diversified exposure to tech giants like Apple (16.07%–17.89%), Microsoft (13.05%–17.28%), and Nvidia (15.42%), as well as smaller tech firms, reducing single-stock risk. • The fund’s heavy allocation to information technology (99.90%–100% of the portfolio) makes it an ideal vehicle for investors bullish on tech-driven trends like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and cybersecurity. 2. Strong Historical Performance : • VGT has delivered robust returns, driven by the rapid growth of its top holdings and the broader tech sector. Over the past five years, it achieved a compounded average return of approximately 23.3%, turning a $10,000 investment into over $28,000. Over 10 years, a $10,000 investment grew to $60,684–$62,239, significantly outperforming broader market ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO, $32,634–$34,622) and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI, $31,002–$33,344). • As of December 4, 2024, VGT’s year-to-date return was approximately 31.11%, and its 12-month return was 36.74%, reflecting strong momentum in the tech sector. 3. Low Expense Ratio : • VGT’s expense ratio is among the lowest in its category at 0.09%–0.10%, meaning investors pay only $9–$10 annually per $10,000 invested. This is significantly below the industry average of 0.58% for similar funds and lower than competitors like the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW, 0.39%). Low fees enhance long-term returns, especially for long-term investors. • Vanguard recently announced a reduction in VGT’s expense ratio from 0.10% to 0.09%, further improving its cost efficiency. 4. High Rankings and Analyst Confidence : • VGT holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), based on factors like expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum. It is consistently rated as a top choice for technology sector exposure. • Morningstar places VGT in the lowest fee quintile among peers, and its portfolio is praised for cost advantages and alignment with investor interests. 5. AI and Tech Growth Tailwinds : • The fund’s top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle) are leaders in AI, cloud computing, and semiconductor industries, which are expected to drive significant growth. The rapid adoption of AI technologies has bolstered VGT’s returns, and analysts see continued upside for tech companies fueling these trends. • The Technology - Broad sector ranks highly (top 13%–38% among Zacks sectors), reflecting strong investor confidence in its growth potential. 6. Dividend Yield and Tax Efficiency : • VGT offers a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.47%–0.64%, which more than offsets its low expense ratio and provides a small but meaningful income stream. Its low dividend yield also makes it tax-efficient for investors holding it in taxable brokerage accounts. • The fund’s passive management and low turnover enhance tax efficiency, minimizing capital gains distributions. 7. Large Asset Base and Liquidity : • With assets under management of $70.85 billion to $90.18 billion, VGT is the largest ETF targeting the Technology - Broad segment, ensuring high liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads. Its average daily trading volume (e.g., 783,126–1,030,593 shares) supports ease of trading. • Vanguard’s reputation as a leading ETF provider adds credibility and stability to the fund. Potential Risks 1. Concentration Risk : • VGT’s top five holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle) account for roughly 50% of the portfolio, making it sensitive to the performance of these mega-cap tech stocks. A downturn in these companies could disproportionately impact returns. • The fund’s near-100% allocation to the tech sector means it lacks diversification across other sectors, increasing vulnerability to tech-specific downturns. 2. Volatility : • VGT has a beta of 1.16–1.23 and a three-year standard deviation of 24.90%–26.57%, indicating higher volatility than the broader market. This makes it a medium-risk choice, unsuitable for risk-averse investors. • The fund experienced a 14.04% loss year-to-date as of April 10, 2025, reflecting tech sector volatility, though it rebounded to a 31.11% gain by December 2024. 3. Valuation Concerns : • Some analysts note that VGT has become expensive, with a P/E ratio of 24.34, potentially signaling overvaluation in the tech sector. Investors should be cautious about entering at peak valuations. • The tech sector’s high growth expectations may not be sustainable long-term, as historical market returns average closer to 10% annually. 4. Macroeconomic Risks : • External factors like rising interest rates, inflation, or trade policies (e.g., tariffs) could impact tech stocks. For example, a 2024 sell-off was exacerbated by concerns over tariff impacts on inflation, affecting VGT’s performance. • A potential economic downturn could reduce demand for tech products and services, impacting VGT’s holdings.

    "article_text": "Money Banking & Insurance Let’s Foster, Not Stifle, Innovation By Chris Perry , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I explain the impact of new financial technologies on our markets. Follow Author May 15, 2025, 09:00am EDT May 15, 2025, 02:55pm EDT Share Save Comment As political leaders work to remake the global trade framework, they shouldn’t neglect one of the most powerful drivers of economic growth: innovation. Shutterstock In my last column, I talked about how innovation from the fintech sector has helped companies in financial services and other industries, and how companies can apply lessons from fintech to accelerate their own technology development efforts. Since then, markets have been upended by the announcement of a set of historic new tariffs that is creating an unprecedented modern world saga. Although most of those tariffs are now “on pause,” and may even be successfully negotiated, it appears that the world is moving away from the globalization model that has dominated international relations for the past 20-plus years. I have no doubt that successful companies and smart business professionals around the globe will continue revolutionizing the world with new products and discoveries—regardless of what the future economic order looks like. But given the importance of innovation as a source of growth in today’s economy, political leaders setting new rules for trade should consider how policies will impact innovation. At the very least, they should ensure new rules don’t stifle corporate research and development investments. In a best-case scenario, political decision-makers should make it a point to include policies that encourage innovation at a global level. Whether this is via government co-investment, tax or trade policy, or downright innovation sharing (public domain), it is critical that innovation is encouraged at the highest level. Innovation Helps Drive Growth Over the past decade, innovation has been a major driver of both economic growth and financial market performance. For proof, just look at the so-called Magnificent Seven, which make up nearly one-third of S&P 500 valuation. Even though those stocks have been beaten up over the past several months, these leaders in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, e-commerce, communications and other innovative technologies still drive global stock markets. Globalization has helped fuel the innovation that has driven the Mag 7 and other tech companies to current valuations. Access to global markets allows companies to invest heavily in R&D, confident that they will be able to attract the capital needed to support these efforts, and that demand for products from companies and consumers around the world will make these investments worthwhile. Prior to the start of the current trade war, these factors were helping encourage companies around the world to spend more on innovation. For example, in 2024, financial service companies participating in Broadridge’s Digital Transformation & Next-Gen Technology Study were devoting 22% of their tech budgets to innovation. In 2025, that share jumped to 29%. The DeepSeek Example Globalization has also ensured that even the biggest and most innovative companies will face fierce competition, leading to better products and prices for consumers. Consider the DeepSeek example. In January 2025, Chinese technology company DeepSeek announced that it had produced an artificial intelligence model that matched the performance of existing models at a fraction of the cost. That announcement roiled global markets. Concerned that DeepSeek’s accomplishment would lessen demand for premium AI chips, investors bailed on Nvidia stock, wiping out $600 billion in market valuation in a single day and dragging down much of the U.S. tech sector with it. MORE FOR YOU But then an important thing happened: Valuations started to recover. Nvidia stock bounced back 9% the day after the announcement. Within the next month, the overall tech sector recovered most of the value lost on the day of the announcement, and the U.S. stock market as a whole set a new high in February. Why did Nvidia and the tech sector recover? Well, first, there was some speculation that DeepSeek might have exaggerated its cost savings. But more broadly, investors came to the conclusion that, over the long term, this innovation from an upstart Chinese competitor would be good for artificial intelligence development, good for the global tech sector, and possibly even good for Nvidia. By lowering costs and increasing access to AI, the DeepSeek advance could increase demand for the technology, propelling the industry and markets to greater heights. That’s the power of innovation at a global level. The Spirit Of Innovation Generally, software and services are not subject to tariffs. However, I am concerned that uncertainty about global trade and economic direction could make companies pull back from innovation. As the global economy slows, companies will have less free cash to invest in R&D, and more reason to hold onto their capital instead of investing it. Over a longer term, if fragmented markets reduce global demand, the potential returns on new-product development could decline, making companies less enthusiastic about investing in innovation on a more secular basis. Overall, I am confident that the spirit of innovation will prevail. Companies and individuals will continue pushing the frontiers of technology as they always have, regardless of global trade policy—and artificial intelligence is already accelerating the pace of discovery. But policymakers do have influence. They must encourage innovation, protect IP and ensure the “Tariff Age” does not stifle human advancement via muted technical innovation. Decisions about how best to address important national security and economic concerns will have an impact on how much companies spend on R&D and how hard or easy it is for companies to collaborate and compete in emerging technologies. So, when political leaders sit down at the negotiating table, let’s hope they keep innovation in mind. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

    "article_text": "AFP News Microsoft announced a major workforce reduction on 14 May 2025, cutting approximately 6,000 jobs, about 3% of its 228,000 global employees. The layoffs, targeting divisions like LinkedIn, Xbox, and software engineering, are the company's largest since 2023. Aimed at streamlining operations to bolster AI investments, the cuts raise concerns about job security in tech, particularly at LinkedIn, a vital career networking platform. As Microsoft reshapes its priorities, what's at stake for employees and the industry? A Wide-Ranging Cut Across Teams The layoffs, confirmed on 14 May 2025, span multiple divisions and regions. 'Microsoft is making tough but necessary decisions to align resources with strategic priorities,' a company spokesperson told MSN News . LinkedIn, acquired by Microsoft in 2016 for £19.8 billion ($26.3 billion), is significantly affected, following earlier reductions of 716 jobs in 2023. Xbox, facing a slowing gaming market, and software engineering teams, crucial for Azure and Windows , also face cuts. The reductions focus on management roles to flatten hierarchies, per CNBC . The announcement triggered concern on X , with users on 14 May 2025 estimating up to 3,000 LinkedIn jobs lost, though unconfirmed. The tech sector's broader slowdown, with firms like Amazon cutting jobs in 2024, amplifies fears, as noted in TechCrunch's coverage of industry trends. Microsoft's move reflects a strategic shift towards high-growth areas like AI, but at a significant human cost. LinkedIn's Role Under Pressure LinkedIn, a cornerstone for job seekers worldwide, faces challenges as its workforce shrinks. The platform, generating £11.7 billion ($15.5 billion) in 2024 revenue, is central to Microsoft's ecosystem but has seen slower growth compared to AI-driven segments like Azure. The layoffs could strain LinkedIn's ability to enhance tools like Recruiter or Learning, critical for professionals navigating a competitive job market. X posts, on 14 May 2025, highlight concerns about LinkedIn's management cuts weakening its community focus, though these remain speculative. The irony of a job platform cutting jobs resonates widely, potentially impacting user trust. With rivals like Indeed gaining ground, Microsoft must balance LinkedIn's operational needs with its AI ambitions, ensuring the platform remains a reliable resource for career advancement. What's Next for Microsoft and Tech? Microsoft's layoffs reflect a broader tech industry trend, with firms like Deloitte cutting 20,000 jobs in 2025, per X sentiment. The company aims to reinvest savings into AI, targeting a £78 billion ($103 billion) AI market by 2027, but risks alienating talent in a competitive field. For affected workers, Microsoft provides severance packages and career transition support, though details remain limited, leaving employees uncertain about their future prospects. The layoffs, following a 2% stock dip on 13 May 2025, reflect investor unease amid Microsoft's aggressive pivot to artificial intelligence and cloud computing innovations. The tech sector faces ongoing turbulence, with rival firms also slashing jobs, intensifying competition for skilled talent. LinkedIn's role in connecting job seekers to opportunities faces intense scrutiny, as its workforce reductions, part of Microsoft's 6,000 job cuts announced on 14 May 2025, threaten to undermine the platform's effectiveness. These cuts, impacting teams behind tools like Recruiter and Learning, could hinder innovation in a tightening job market, where professionals rely on LinkedIn for career advancement. The platform's ability to support job mobility is at risk, as reduced staffing may slow updates to features critical for navigating the competitive tech sector. This challenging period, marked by industry-wide layoffs, raises concerns about LinkedIn's capacity to remain a vital resource for millions seeking employment stability.

CEO Tim Cook during the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board’s first meeting in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington on March 6, 2019. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) The tech industry is breathing a sigh of relief after the U.S. and China agreed to substantially lower tariffs, underscoring the prospect of de-escalation in a trade war that has been particularly challenging for the sector. The two countries appear to be walking back from a costly tit-for-tat exchange on tariffs, announcing a 90-day reduction in import taxes as they continue to negotiate a more lasting deal. The tech sector saw its stocks tumble earlier this year as massive tariffs threatened to strain supply chains and raise consumer prices. While it received some relief last month when President Trump exempted electronics from the import taxes, the industry’s outlook is even more optimistic now as tensions ease. “It’s a relief valve for U.S. Big Tech,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Hill. “It takes the nightmare supply chain situation off the table.” The U.S. and China announced Monday that they had agreed to reduce tariff rates for 90 days amid negotiations. The U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China will reduce import taxes on American goods from 125 percent to 10 percent. ‘Incredibly damaging outcomes’ The trade truce marks a sharp departure from months of escalation between Washington and Beijing. “It’s de-escalation from what could have been an incredibly damaging set of outcomes for both China and the United States if those tariffs stayed in place at those very high rates. So, in my view, cooler heads are prevailing,” said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. While trade tensions were rising between the two countries in the first few months of President Trump’s second term in office, they took a turn for the worse when Trump announced wide-ranging “reciprocal” tariffs in early April. This included a 34 percent tariff against China, which, when coupled with an earlier 20 percent import tax, brought the total rate on Chinese goods to more than 50 percent. The two sides went tit for tat on tariff increases before settling at rates well above 100 percent. The hefty tariffs on Chinese imports spooked the tech industry, whose supply chains are heavily reliant on China. Trump also levied tariffs on India and Vietnam, where tech firms have increasingly relocated their manufacturing in recent years to diversify their supply chains and shield them from potential disruption. The president ultimately put most of his “reciprocal” tariffs on hold amid widespread market panic. However, he left the China tariffs, along with a baseline 10 percent import tax, in place. Trump later exempted electronics from the tariffs, although the victory was short-lived for the tech industry, after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled plans to implement sector-specific tariffs. ‘Hopes and prayers’ for a long-term deal The recent detente between the U.S. and China has many in and around the tech sector hopeful about the possibility of a larger trade deal and greater economic stability and certainty. “Our hopes and prayers are that of course this a forerunner to a more negotiated deal,” David Warrick, executive vice president of Overhaul, a software-based supply chain solutions company, said. “The hope from the tech sector perspective is that this is a really good starting point,” Warrick added. “Now, how well can we negotiate to get us to a more balanced agreement?” The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) touted the recent development as “meaningful progress toward reducing bilateral tensions and stabilizing the global economy.” “Importantly, the significant temporary tariff pause from both parties will help bring certainty to business operations and economic markets,” ITI President and CEO Jason Oxman said in a statement. “The tech industry welcomes the constructive and serious approach both governments have taken and urges leaders from both sides to leverage tech sector input and feedback as they continue negotiations,” he added. Following the announcement, Trump said he spoke to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who he said plans to open more plants in the U.S. Apple was particularly vulnerable to the tariffs, as the iPhone maker manufactures the vast majority of its products in China. Cook previously promised to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including through building a new facility in Texas. ‘Not out of the woods’ However, some experts are still voicing caution, emphasizing that the future of U.S.-China trade relations remains uncertain. “The reduction in tariffs and apparent progress to a wider trade deal reduces the risk of further tariff escalation, but does not remove it completely,” Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement to The Hill. Tariffs are still relatively high compared with previous rates, and the tech industry faces the prospect of additional sector-specific import taxes down the line. “Let’s just keep in mind that, yes those tariff rates are really high, but the tariff rates that are now going to be in effect as of tomorrow are also very high historically speaking,” Brzytwa said. “This is still relatively complex and, depending on what the tariff is for any given product, it still might be high enough where a company decides that tariff payment isn’t worth the cost of importing it,” he continued. “The company might not be able to even sell the product in the United States.” “We’re not out of the woods yet there,” he added of the sector-specific tariffs. “That is also a source of uncertainty and unpredictability for us. It’s still difficult for our companies to plan around this.” Add as preferred source on Google Tags Jason Oxman Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Microsoft employed 228,000 full-time workers as of last June, the last time it reported its annual headcount. About 55 percent of those workers were in the US. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said the layoffs will be across all levels and geographies but will focus on reducing management levels. Notices went out on Tuesday. Microsoft announced a smaller round of performance-based layoffs in January. But the 3 percent cuts will be Microsoft’s biggest reported layoffs since early 2023, when the company cut 10,000 workers, almost 5 percent of its workforce, joining other tech companies that were scaling back their pandemic-era expansions. Advertisement The latest layoffs come just weeks after Microsoft reported strong sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations for the January-March quarter, which investors took as a dose of relief during a turbulent time for the tech sector and US economy. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said on an April earnings call that the company was focused on “building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers.” She also said the headcount in March was 2 percent higher than a year earlier, and down slightly compared to the end of last year."

The layoffs affect various departments and follow a broader trend in the tech industry amid rising costs and shifting demands. Written By Govind Choudhary Updated 13 May 2025, 09:53 PM IST Microsoft has announced plans to cut approximately 6,000 roles across its global workforce, citing efforts to streamline its organisational structure and reduce layers of management. Microsoft has announced plans to cut approximately 6,000 roles across its global workforce, citing efforts to streamline its organisational structure and reduce layers of management. The job reductions will affect fewer than three per cent of the company's total staff and will span various departments, levels, and regions — including LinkedIn. A company spokesperson stated the move is part of ongoing adjustments designed to keep Microsoft competitive in an increasingly dynamic market landscape. \"We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,\" the spokesperson said. Microsoft job cuts in 2024 The technology giant , which had a global headcount of 228,000 as of June 2024, regularly undertakes strategic layoffs to refocus on key business areas. This latest round of cuts follows a broader trend across the tech industry, where companies are recalibrating amid shifting demands and rising operational costs. Microsoft last implemented significant job cuts in January 2023, when around 10,000 employees were let go — impacting teams working on HoloLens, its augmented reality headset, and other hardware divisions. Also Read | Tech layoffs surge in 2025: Over 22,000 jobs cut amid AI and automation push The current restructuring comes amid a surge in expenditure on artificial intelligence infrastructure and cloud services. Microsoft has committed to spending roughly $80 billion this fiscal year on data centres to support Azure and AI-driven offerings — a figure highlighting the scale of its ambitions in the space. In line with fiscal year-end practices — which concludes in June — the company has already begun reconfiguring some internal teams. Recent changes include transferring sales responsibilities for small and medium-sized business clients to third-party firms, alongside adjustments in several technical units. This wave of job cuts mirrors a wider trend in the technology sector. Earlier this year, Meta said it would reduce its workforce by five per cent through performance-related exits, while Salesforce made over 1,000 positions redundant to pivot towards new AI-oriented roles.

Photograph: Adam Gray/Reuters This article is more than 5 months old US deputy attorney general Todd Blanche tipped as librarian of Congress This article is more than 5 months old Blanche, who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, was appointed acting librarian on Monday The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, has been appointed acting librarian of Congress – leading to a showdown on Capitol Hill after two other appointees were denied entry to one of its buildings. The Justice Department made the announcement about Blanche on Monday. He replaces longtime librarian Carla Hayden, who was fired by the White House last week amid criticism from conservatives that she was advancing a “woke” agenda. Two other Trump appointees to the library attempted unsuccessfully to enter the Copyright Office on Monday, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. Trump abruptly fires librarian of Congress in latest purge of government Read more Brian Nieves, a deputy chief of staff and senior counsel in Blanche’s office, was named acting assistant librarian, and Paul Perkins, an associate deputy attorney general and veteran Justice Department attorney, is now the acting register of copyrights and director of the Copyright Office – replacing Shira Perlmutter, whom the Trump administration pushed out last weekend. Nieves and Perkins were in the hallway outside the Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress and directly across the street from the main building, but could not get in without access to badges, according to the source. After a brief discussion with library officials and US Capitol police, whom the library had contacted, the appointees left voluntarily. Capitol police said that no one was barred from, or escorted out of, the building and otherwise referred questions back to the Library of Congress. Senate majority leader John Thune told reporters on Monday that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump has the power to fire the librarian of Congress, who is technically a legislative branch employee. “We want to make sure congressional equities are respected and protected in this process,” Thune said. The implications of Trump installing a close ally as librarian of Congress could be far-reaching. The nonpartisan agency is largely known as the thinktank of Capitol Hill, and provides analyses meant to help lawmakers in the legislative process. But Democrats are already concerned about what kind of information Trump-appointed officials could access in a process that is typically confidential between the Congressional Research Service and lawmakers. Senior House Democrats on Monday also raised the prospect that data held by the Library of Congress, which holds a vast archive of books and historical documents, could have been improperly transferred to the executive branch, including officials at Trump adviser Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Unauthorised information sharing “could compromise legislative branch independence and the ability of members of Congress to carry out their constitutional duties,” according to the letter, which was signed by lawmakers including New York representative and Connecticut representative Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrats on the House Administration and Appropriations committees, respectively. They are asking for an inspector general investigation. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Since returning to office in January, Trump has removed officials he regards as opposed to him and his Republican agenda. Shortly before her firing, Perlmutter’s office released a highly anticipated report that questioned the legality of the tech industry’s use of copyrighted works to “train” their artificial intelligence systems and compete with the human-made works they were trained on. The report – despite being marked as “pre-publication” – quickly made waves in legal circles after it was posted online late last week, winning praise from creators who have challenged the tech industry in court, and criticism from a tech industry trade group. But attention around the report grew after Perlmutter’s firing Saturday, including from Trump’s supporters. Mike Davis, a lawyer who regularly defends Trump, posted an alarm emoji on social media and warned: “Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators’ copyrights for AI profits. This is 100% unacceptable.” Blanche was named the No 2 Justice Department official after serving as Trump’s criminal defence attorney in two cases brought by the department during Joe Biden’s administration. He is a former federal prosecutor who was a key figure on Trump’s defence team in his New York hush money trial, which ended in a conviction on 34 felony counts.

Accompanied by Aram Salatyan, Chair of the Engineering Association Board, and Bagrat Yengibaryan, Director of the Enterprise Incubator Foundation, the delegation toured the facility. Ambassador Maragos was briefed on the main operational areas of Engineering City, its ongoing projects and initiatives, and its long-term vision. He explored the existing infrastructure, plans for a High-Tech Accelerator and National Supercomputing Center, and met with companies currently operating on-site, learning about their work and products. He also shared his impressions following the visit. Discussions included potential new areas of cooperation, and parties reached preliminary agreements for future actions. Engineering City operates under a public-private partnership model, implemented by the Enterprise Incubator Foundation with strong support from the Armenian government—particularly the Ministry of High-Tech Industry—and the participation of the Engineering Association and several private firms. Currently, it hosts 30 engineering and high-tech companies employing around 350 people, the majority of whom are experienced engineers.

    "article_text": "Money Investing Apple Stays Weaker Than Other Tech: What The Price Charts Reveal By John Navin , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. John Navin is a Colorado-based journalist who writes about stocks. Follow Author May 12, 2025, 12:03pm EDT May 13, 2025, 02:16pm EDT Share Save Comment Apple iPhone getty Apple is not keeping up with the new enthusiasm showing up in other tech stocks on the most recent Trump administration tariffs news. This is odd considering that the iPhone maker is the largest single position among all equities in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. That’s usually a mark of distinction. The Apple iPhone 16e was launched in February 2025 and replaced a number of older iPhones. It’s peculiar that the stock has dropped in price since then. The ever-changing tariff situation with China — and the company’s reported expanding reliance on India to make the product — have created uncertainty. To demonstrate the difference between Apple’s stock performance and that of tech stocks in general, here’s the daily price chart of the Technology Select Sector SPDR fund: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund daily price chart, 5 12 25. stockcharts.com Price for the tech ETF is now above both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. I’ve red-circled that area on the chart. The fund has 69 holdings in the sector and is widely followed as measure of the group’s performance. From $175 in early April to $225 in mid-May amounts to a 28% move upward in about five weeks. Now, take a look at the Apple daily price chart: Apple daily price chart, 5 12 25 stockcharts.com MORE FOR YOU Note that the stock remains well below the 200-day moving average. Note also that it’s unable to close above the down trending 50-day moving average. This is peculiar considering how strong the tech sector as a whole is — represented in the Tech Select Sector SPDR Fund price chart above. Consider the free advertising for Apple among Wall Street money managers that Warren Buffett has the stock as its largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway fund. With the popular new iPhone out and selling, what’s holding investors back from buying more of the stock? Here’s the daily price chart for Microsoft: Microsoft daily price chart, 5 12 25. stockcharts.com The big tech favorite is well above both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. Note how close it is to the December 2024 high. Investors are still in love with this stock. Here’s the weekly chart for the tech sector ETF: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund weekly price chart, 5 12 25. stockcharts.com In the red-circled area you can see that the tech ETF is now above the 50-day moving average and far above the 200-day moving average. It looks as if resistance at just above the $240 level may be tested. Now, here’s how the Apple weekly price chart looks: Apple weekly price chart, 5 12 25. stockcharts.com The price in early April dipped below the 200-day moving average and bounced off of it. Nevertheless, the stock has been unable to make it back above the 50-day moving average. Also, Apple is a long way from the late 2024 high of near $260. The weekly Microsoft price chart is here: Microsoft weekly price chart, 5 12 25. stockcharts.com The price never dropped below the 200-day moving average which continues to trend upward. It’s above the 50-day moving average for three straight weeks now. Buyers have moved back in. Comparing the iPhone maker to tech stocks in general, you have wonder: Why are investors reluctant to purchase it with the enthusiasm being shown for the rest of the sector?

What Happened : Zuckerberg, in his address at the Stripe Sessions conference, underscored the advantages of AI for startups. He proposed that AI enables small teams to concentrate on their primary business concepts, thereby facilitating the development of superior quality products. Furthermore, Zuckerberg touched upon the potential of AI to function as a midlevel engineer capable of writing code, an idea he had previously shared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Nonetheless, he cautioned about possible drawbacks, such as the threat of security vulnerabilities going unnoticed without adequate code review, reports the Insider. “Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” Zuckerberg said. “I think that this is just going to lead to much better quality stuff that gets created around the world because now you’re just being able to have these, like, very small talent-dense teams that are, like, passionate about an idea,” he added and as quoted by the outlet. Also Read: Mark Zuckerberg Is ‘Kind Of Creepy And Controlling’ – This Is What Meta’s New AI Chatbot Says About Its Boss Other tech magnates have also expressed similar views. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan emphasized the idea of “vibe coding”, which enables small teams to deliver work that would usually necessitate a larger team. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have also championed the application of AI in their respective organizations. However, despite the potential advantages, some experts have voiced concerns. Harry Law, an AI researcher at the University of Cambridge, cautioned that over-dependence on AI could impede understanding about system architecture or performance, and could complicate scaling or debugging. Why It Matters : The endorsement of AI by Zuckerberg and other tech leaders underscores the growing recognition of AI’s potential to revolutionize the tech industry. While the benefits of AI are clear, the cautionary note struck by experts like Law highlights the need for a balanced approach. As AI continues to evolve, it will be crucial for startups and established companies alike to navigate the potential pitfalls while harnessing the transformative power of this technology.

The two sides discussed measures for comprehensive economic cooperation and entered a total of 14 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) in nuclear energy and high-tech industry areas. First, Minister Ahn and the government delegation visited Czech Prime Minister Fiala to discuss wide-ranging cooperation across industries, energy, construction, infrastructure, and science technology. In the presence of Prime Minister Fiala, Minister Ahn and Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Lukáš Vlček signed a Korea-Czech nuclear reactor cooperation arrangement, building on the MOU forged previously in September 2024. The two countries’ governments will be making joint effort for the success of the Dukovany power plant project as well as collaboration on the additional order of two reactor units and Korea-Czech joint entry into third countries. Minister Ahn and Minister Vlček also inked a Korea-Czech battery cooperation MOU for stronger joint response going forward regarding the EU Battery Regulation. Furthermore, Minister Ahn and Minister Vlček discussed cooperation in nuclear energy and high-tech industry areas including batteries and automobiles. In the presence of both ministers, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and other members of Team Korea sealed 10 MOUs with Czech companies for cooperation on the Czech nuclear reactor project. In addition to widening the scope of collaboration in nuclear energy, Korea and the Czech Republic are also aiming to deepen strategic cooperation in high-tech industries. In line with implementing the Vltava Advanced Industries Cooperation Vision announced on September 20, 2024, the two sides signed a letter of agreement on the establishment of an automotive cooperation center and a robotics cooperation center, raising anticipation for enhanced collaboration in R&D, talent training, and demonstration projects. Meanwhile, Korea’s National Assembly members and government delegates met Czech President of the Senate Miloš Vystrčil for lawmaker-level discussions on extensive cooperation between the two countries in areas spanning nuclear reactors, high-tech industries, energy, and construction. In view of this year marking the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the 10th anniversary of the strategic partnership between Korea and the Czech Republic, Minister Ahn noted that the two countries have further solidified their trust relationship and stated that efforts will be made to closely communicate with the Czech authorities so as to finalize the new reactor contract as soon as possible.

Credit: AP A sign at Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. is shown on Oct. 8, 2010. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) WASHINGTON, USA — Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three project sites for advanced nuclear energy as the energy required to power burgeoning artificial intelligence projects rises sharply. Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Google will provide capital for the projects, which the companies say will each produce 600 megawatts of power capacity. No dollar figure for Google's investment was given. “Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation,\" said Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's head of data center energy. Google and Elementl said they will collaborative with utility and regulated power companies to identify and advance new projects. “We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid,” said Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert. U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles. Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute. Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms. In October, Amazon announced that it was investing in small nuclear reactors , just two days after a similar announcement by Google. A month before that, Constellation Energy, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said it it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. Amazon, Google and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Elementl Power was founded in 2022.

Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Google will provide capital for the projects, which the companies say will each produce 600 megawatts of power capacity. No dollar figure for Google's investment was given. “Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation,\" said Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's head of data center energy.

U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles. Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute. Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms. In October, Amazon announced that it was investing in small nuclear reactors , just two days after a similar announcement by Google. A month before that, Constellation Energy, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said it it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979.

Casey Means is a MAHA celebrity; her cofounder is now in charge of dismantling the IRS. by Tina Nguyen May 8, 2025, 1:35 PM UTC Link Share Levels’s first product was a continuous glucose monitor connected to a $400-per-month health tracking app. Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge Tina Nguyen is a Senior Reporter for The Verge and author of Regulator , covering the second Trump administration, political influencers, tech lobbying and Big Tech vs. Big Government. Before she was chosen as Donald Trump’s latest nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Casey Means came from the world of healthcare startups – and cofounded one with a tech entrepreneur who’s now a key Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) operative in charge of dismantling the IRS. In 2019, Means, a holistic medicine doctor who rose to prominence in the Trump-adjacent Make America Healthy Again movement (also called MAHA), launched Levels, a biowearables and health-tracking company, with Sam Corcos, who’s now leading efforts at DOGE to construct a “mega API” that compiles American taxpayers’ data . The company, whose first product was a blood glucose tracker connected to a $400-per-month subscription app, received tens of millions of dollars funding over the past several years – notably from Andreessen-Horowitz’s venture capital arm a16z, which led its $12 million seed round and its Series A round. “Both the health of our people and the fiscal solvency of our country are at stake,” Marc Andreessen, now a Trump advisor and a critical player in the rise of the tech right, said in a press release announcing its Series A extension back in August 2024. “Levels is a case study of the application of technology to both.” Their affiliation is by no means hidden: Corcos and Means both describe themselves as cofounders and currently active employees of Levels on their LinkedIn pages, with Corcos listed as CEO. They also have a joint authors page on the Levels blog, frequently co-hosted a company podcast , are mentioned in press releases about the company , and often highlighted each others’ works on their social media feeds. “Super proud to share that Levels Co-founder, Casey Means, MD , along with her brother, Calley Means , sat down with Joe Rogan to talk about the importance of metabolic health,” Corcos posted on LinkedIn last October. “It’s amazing to see the impact they’re having and how they’ve brought this pressing issue into the national discourse.” Means, now a close associate of Health & Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was announced as Trump’s nominee for Surgeon General after the president abruptly pulled his original pick, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, the day before she was due to testify in front of the Senate. Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, also happens to be the sister-in-law of former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for his role in Signal-gate. (Last week, Trump announced that he was reassigning Waltz to be his Ambassador to the United Nations, a role widely seen as punishment for adding a journalist to a classified group chat.) Corcos, who is also a special advisor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, has become a public-facing figure in stories about DOGE, the quasi-governmental agency led by Elon Musk to drastically reduce the federal government’s workforce. (Disclaimer: This reporter attended college with Corcos at Claremont McKenna College.) According to reports from Wired , behind the scenes, Corcos is in charge of efforts to consolidate all taxpayer data into one single database, a move that has alarmed security analysts and IRS engineers – both for the speed at which DOGE is doing it, and because a “mega API” project would allow any singular entity, including private companies and foreign governments, to access and export said data.

    "article_text": "deagreez - stock.adobe.com By Clare McDonald, Business Editor Published: 08 May 2025 10:45 The areas of artificial intelligence (AI) young people are interested in varies between genders, according to research by InnovateHer. The social enterprise asked more than a thousand students between the ages of 12 and 17 their opinions on AI, and found more boys than girls interested in the subject – 69% and 54% respectively – but also differing areas of focus, with girls worried about AI bias and boys concerned about cyber security. “While it’s encouraging to see such interest [in AI] from both sides, these differences risk reinforcing long-standing stereotypes,” said Chelsea Slater, co-founder and CEO of InnovateHer. “We believe these patterns stem from the messages young people receive from an early age about careers, tech and who belongs in those spaces. “At InnovateHer, we’re working to challenge those narratives and ensure all young people can see themselves in the future of AI.” The areas of AI students were interested in depended on their gender – girls are predominantly concerned with ethics, policy and data analysis, while boys’ main area of focus was on on machine learning, robotics and AI development. This divide between male and female participants in the technology sector is not a new thing, and men are more likely than women to pursue technology careers for a variety of reasons – in fact, women and young girls feel they are sometimes actively discouraged from joining the sector, and misconceptions about the skill sets needed for a tech role leave women feeling the sector isn’t for them. There are also concerns in the tech sector about automation replacing a large number of women’s jobs , and while many argue it will create as many as it replaces , only 29% of girls believed AI would create more jobs in the future, compared with 53% of boys. Read more about diversity in tech With the theme of ‘igniting leadership potential’ , the 2024 Everywoman in Tech Forum focused on helping women to be strong and authentic tech leaders While businesses increasingly understand how gender, ethnicity or sexuality may impact a person’s experience in the tech sector , many don’t take into account how some will have an overlap of these experiences Almost 70% of girls actually think AI will make it harder for women to pursue technology careers, partly because of the bias it may create in the hiring process, especially because of the lack of role models already in the tech sector. A lack of role models is often cited as a reason why girls avoid the tech sector , but it also means that the fewer women involved in the technology sector, the fewer women will be part of the decision-making processes surrounding AI , and the more likely it is these technologies will be built with biases. A large number of girls – some 79% – think there should be more stringent regulations surrounding AI, specifically to prevent worsening AI bias, with 71% expressing concerns about AI reinforcing the gender bias that already exists in many elements of decision-making in the tech workplace. Boys, on the other hand, are less concerned about bias and more concerned about regulating AI to bolster cyber security and address privacy risks. But there are other concerns among girls when it comes to AI. Almost 70% of female students linked the use of AI recommendation algorithms used in social media to poor mental health, naming negative perceptions of body image and online bulling as some of the negative impacts social media algorithms can have. While 29% of boys noted that AI can play a part in toxicity online, fewer of them linked this to a decline in mental wellness. InnovateHer’s AI Programme for Girls In response to a series of industry roundtables, social enterprise InnovateHer has announced plans to launch a programme aimed at teaching girls between the ages of 13 and 17 about AI. Firms including Sony, The Guardian , Channel 4 and Manchester Metropolitan University were involved in the roundtable discussions that came to the conclusion there is an urgent need to ensure younger people have the appropriate skills for the future. The programme will aim to develop a curriculum designed to educate girls about what opportunities AI presents to them, how AI works and the challenges it brings with it. The initiative is currently looking for industry backing, with the aim of launching a pilot in September 2025 before a national roll-out in January 2026. With modules covering bias in data, ethical design and real-world applications of AI, the programme will open up conversations around innovation, values and impact – while nurturing technical and creative skills.

    "article_text": "Ministers call on tech firms for ‘bold ideas’ to tackle justice system crisis 7 May 2025, 22:34 | Updated: 07 May 2025 Government building stock. Picture: PA Tech bosses will meet with the Justice Secretary on Thursday as part of Government plans to use technology to overhaul the justice system. Top technology firms are set to meet with the Justice Secretary for the first time to look at how artificial intelligence and technology could be used to tackle violence in prisons and cut re-offending. Shabana Mahmood is urging companies including Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google to work with ministers as part of Government plans to use technology to overhaul the justice system. Using data to help probation officers improve risk assessments and tracking offenders in the community are among some of the aspects to be considered. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood (Danny Lawson/PA) How digital platforms could help rehabilitate offenders and help them integrate back into society is also on the agenda for ministers and around 30 companies meeting on Thursday. The move follows a pledge from the Lord Chancellor to introduce technology to stop probation staff “drowning” in paperwork when more time could be spent supervising offenders. Meanwhile, the backlog of crown court cases also stands at a record high. Ms Mahmood said: “We inherited a justice system in crisis, with prisons close to collapse and staff overburdened and under pressure. “We need bold ideas to address the challenges that we face – supporting our staff, delivering swifter justice for victims, and cutting crime. “Today, we have an analogue justice system in a digital age. “The UK has a world-leading and growing tech sector, and I know our tech firms have a huge role to play in delivering our Plan for Change to make streets safer.” Julian David, chief executive of trade association TechUK – which co-organised the event, said the roundtable presents an “excellent opportunity” for the tech sector to showcase the “transformative role” technology can play in modernising the criminal justice system. After the meeting, a follow-up event for the whole industry to apply to present their ideas is expected in the coming months. Microsoft’s UK public sector general manager Amanda Sleight said: “Microsoft is committed to advancing the ethical use of AI technology to reduce the administrative burden on prison and probation staff, allowing them more time to focus on delivering high-quality frontline services, reducing recidivism and helping integrate offenders back into society.” The Conservatives suggested the Government’s plans were “not even close to being enough” to reform the justice system. Shadow justice minister Kieran Mullan said: “After 14 years in opposition, Labour still have no answers beyond putting criminals back out on to the streets and soon will be scrapping short sentences for offenders – this announcement is not even close to being enough. “Labour are clearly out of their depth.” By Press Association"

    "article_text": "Money Markets Why Is Bitcoin’s Price Up 25% In A Month? By Trefis Team , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analysts for Great Speculations Follow Author May 05, 2025, 05:00am EDT May 06, 2025, 02:34pm EDT Share Save Comment The Bitcoin logo is displayed during the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, 2025. (Photo by Giuseppe CACACE / AFP) (Photo by GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied impressively over the past month, climbing more than 25% from around $75,000 on April 9 to around $95,000 today. This performance has outpaced several smaller cryptocurrencies, including XRP and ADA. What’s driving this significant uptick? The answer lies in a combination of macroeconomic factors creating perfect conditions for Bitcoin’s growth. Separately, over the past five years, 60% of the time when earnings were announced, positive one day returns were observed in this stock. See: Buy Or Sell Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Earnings? Dollar Weakness Fuels Bitcoin Strength The U.S. dollar has weakened considerably, falling approximately 4% against the Euro in just one month and 8% since the beginning of the year. This decline stems partly from ongoing tariff concerns affecting the US economy. Bitcoin, designed as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, typically benefits from dollar weakness for two key reasons: First, a depreciating dollar motivates investors to find alternative stores of wealth, and Bitcoin’s finite supply and a large institutional adoption position it as a desirable option for preserving purchasing power. Second, dollar weakness often coincides with a broader increase in risk appetite, prompting investors to diversify out of the traditional safety of the U.S. dollar and into higher-risk, higher-return assets like cryptocurrencies. Tech Rally Creates Supportive Environment Beyond currency dynamics, the recent tech stock rally has created a supportive environment for Bitcoin. The Nasdaq index has surged 18% during the same period, indicating renewed investor confidence in technology-driven assets. Bitcoin, as both a technological innovation and an alternative asset class, often benefits from positive sentiment in the tech sector. MORE FOR YOU Investors appear to be looking beyond near-term tariff threats, instead focusing on longer-term growth potential. This perspective shift has benefited both traditional tech stocks and digital assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin: The Crypto Market's Front-Runner Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Bitcoin consistently emerges as the primary beneficiary of new investment flows. When broader economic conditions favor cryptocurrency investment, capital typically flows first to Bitcoin before spreading to smaller altcoins. This pattern explains why Bitcoin has outperformed several smaller cryptocurrencies during this rally. Future Outlook The factors driving Bitcoin’s current rally show little sign of reversing. Some financial institutions project the U.S. dollar could fall another 15-20% over the next few years, which would likely continue to support Bitcoin's value proposition. Combined with the positive momentum in equity markets, particularly in the tech sector, Bitcoin appears well-positioned to break through the psychological $100,000 barrier and potentially surpass its all-time high of approximately $109,000 in the near future. As traditional financial systems face increasing uncertainty, Bitcoin's role as both a technological innovation and a potential hedge against currency devaluation continues to strengthen its appeal to a growing investor base. While Bitcoin may move higher, it remains a risky asset. As a long-term investment option, you can explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio , which is rooted in quality that seeks reliability, predictability, and compounding growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that?

On the third day of WAVES 2025, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Ashwini Vaishnaw formalised and exchanged the agreements with representatives of the tech industry. Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting L. Murugan and MIB Secretary Sanjay Jaju were also present during the announcement.

IICT (which will operate in the same format as IITs) is expected to bring professional expertise to India’s budding AVGC-XR (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics-Extended Reality) sector.

Joining Vaishnaw at the ceremony were NVIDIA VP Richard Kerris, JioStar’s Sanjog Gupta, Adobe VP Mala Sharma, Google India Country Head Preeti Lobana, Wacom Senior Director Rajiv Malik, Sandeep Bandibekar (Head of Sales, State Government and Healthcare), Microsoft’s Mainstream Services Partners Director Sandeep Bandivdekar, Meta’s Public Policy Director Sunil Abraham, and major IICT stakeholders, among others. Photo: PIB Thanking the tech industry partners who extended partnerships to IICT, the Union Minister doubled down on India’s commitment to make IICT a major educational infrastructure for the AVGC-XR sector. “We will be following the same template that we have created for the IITs and IIMs in our country, to make it into a world-class institution,” added Vaishnaw. “These alliances are designed to boost education, R&D and innovation across animation, visual effects, gaming, comics, film, and extended reality,” the ministry stated."

    "article_text": "Small Business Five Strategies For Empowering The Next Generation Of Tech Talent By Nathan Miller , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) May 02, 2025, 10:15am EDT Share Save Nathan Miller, Founder and CEO of Rentec Direct , industry-leading property management software for real estate professionals. getty In an era where technology is reshaping industries at a pace we’ve never experienced before, our future depends not only on innovation but also on the people driving technology forward. Championing the goals, aspirations and development of emerging generations of tech talent is a strategic investment in the future of our industry. With tech jobs projected to grow at about twice the rate of the overall workforce over the next decade, I believe today’s business leaders have both an opportunity and a responsibility to guide, support and shape a community of dynamic, ethical and forward-thinking innovators. Here are five strategies I have found to be effective for empowering aspiring tech influencers and driving the evolution of the tech industry. 1. Supporting Mentorship And Knowledge-Sharing Seasoned entrepreneurs have a wealth of insights and lived experience that can be invaluable for emerging talent—especially when it comes to navigating challenges, capitalizing on opportunities and making strategic decisions. By engaging in or establishing mentorship programs , taking on advisory roles and participating in networking opportunities, you can provide young professionals with the guidance, connections and real-world perspectives needed to accelerate their growth and build a strong foundation for success. Mentorship doesn’t have to fall on your shoulders alone—business leaders can encourage their leadership teams to contribute, as well. For example, several members of my leadership team serve on boards, sit on committees or hold volunteer leadership positions that allow them to share their industry expertise with the broader community—young professionals included. By fostering mentorship and knowledge-sharing at all levels, we can collectively empower the next generation of leaders. 2. Investing In Education Businesses can play an important role in shaping the future of tech by actively investing in initiatives that support the next generation of innovators. In my experience, prioritizing funding for programs like scholarships and startup incubators can not only foster fresh ideas and disruptive new technologies but also provide young professionals with the resources they need to develop their professional skills. These investments can help bridge the gap between education and industry while cultivating a strong pipeline of skilled talent. At my company, one of our core values involves fostering talent here in our regional tech sector. One of the ways we make this a reality is by offering a scholarship program that provides financial assistance to students pursuing technology-related degrees in our home state. Through this program, I've seen how even modest scholarships can make a meaningful difference in removing financial barriers and building a more diverse, inclusive and skilled workforce. By prioritizing investments in education, companies can go beyond supporting individual careers, helping to drive long-term innovation and industry growth. 3. Bridging Academics And Industry As touched on above, one of the biggest challenges for graduating students entering the tech industry is navigating the gap between classroom learning and the practical skills needed to succeed in the workplace. While an academic education certainly provides foundational knowledge, real-world experience is essential for preparing students—especially in the ever-evolving tech industry. Consider implementing initiatives like boot camps, technical training programs and other collaborations between your business and universities to help close this gap and ensure that graduates are workforce-ready. Internship programs are another powerful way to offer hands-on experience and allow aspiring tech professionals to gain knowledge in real-world settings. While interns are developing their problem-solving skills and starting to build their professional networks, your business can benefit from their fresh perspectives and innovative thinking. You can also participate as a guest lecturer, develop an apprenticeship program, collaborate on capstone projects or contribute to curriculum advisory boards to help give students exposure to real-world problem-solving and industry expectations. For example, our Director of Operations serves on the business advisory committee at our local community college and regularly guest-lectures as part of their introductory business course. By engaging with academia where possible, businesses can further contribute to developing a skilled and innovative talent pipeline . 4. Encouraging A Continuous Learning Culture Don’t overlook the emerging leaders who are already part of your team, including those who might be early on in their careers and still discovering their full potential. Creating a culture of ongoing growth and professional development is important for preparing your team to stay ahead of shifts and new developments in the fast-paced tech landscape. Consider providing access to training programs, workshops, certifications or industry events that can help young professionals refine their skills and stay competitive. At my company, we conduct weekly all-hands training sessions to keep the entire team up to date on the latest features and best practices for our software platform. Additionally, be intentional about creating opportunities for younger talent to share their ideas and take on leadership roles. Invite them to lead presentations, contribute an article to your company blog, take the lead on an internal project or represent the company at an industry event to help build confidence and credibility. In my experience, recognizing the contributions of emerging talent and providing them with opportunities to take ownership can accelerate their development as future industry leaders. 5. Emphasizing The Importance Of Ethics Today’s tech leaders have a unique responsibility to instill a strong ethical foundation in the next generation as technology continues to impact nearly every aspect of our daily lives. I've found that championing responsible technology use—particularly in areas like AI, cybersecurity and data privacy—encourages innovation that is both forward-thinking and socially responsible. I believe business leaders can and should facilitate discussions on ethical dilemmas, integrate ethics-driven decision making into training and embed accountability into company culture. By prioritizing integrity as highly as innovation, businesses can help shape the industry to be trusted by and beneficial to society. Final Thoughts From my observations, the future of the tech industry will bank on the development of a new generation of innovators who are skilled, ethical and adaptable. Leaders who invest in nurturing and empowering emerging talent today can help shape the direction of tomorrow’s industry, ensuring that our future is dynamic, responsible and full of possibilities.

Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Safe Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds? A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Ives specializes in the tech sector. Why Ives Remains Largely Bullish on Big Tech Capital spending within the tech sector \"is holding up,\" while investments in AI in general remain very solid, according to Ives. Further, \"tariffs..are not stopping the AI Revolution,\" and MSFT, AMZN, and META are all poised to benefit from the continued proliferation of AI, the well-known analyst explained. In general, \"software is the safety blanket\" for investors at this point, while Meta Platforms (META) will also get a significant lift from a resilient ad market, Ives stated. Ives' Bottom Line on Big Tech \"Big Tech will be more of a confidence booster this week rather than\" feeding the Street's fears, he predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

    "article_text": "Visa wants to give artificial intelligence 'agents' your credit card FILE - A Visa logo is displayed on a credit card in New Orleans, Aug. 11, 2019. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) · Associated Press Finance · ASSOCIATED PRESS MATT O'BRIEN April 30, 2025 5 min read V Artificial intelligence “agents” are supposed to be more than chatbots. The tech industry has spent months pitching AI personal assistants that know what you want and can do real work on your behalf. So far, they're not doing much. Visa hopes to change that by giving them your credit card. Set a budget and some preferences and these AI agents — successors to ChatGPT and its chatbot peers — could find and buy you a sweater, weekly groceries or an airplane ticket. “We think this could be really important,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in an interview. “Transformational, on the order of magnitude of the advent of e-commerce itself.” Visa announced Wednesday it is partnering with a group of leading AI chatbot developers — among them U.S. companies Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity, and France's Mistral — to connect their AI systems to Visa's payments network. Visa is also working with IBM, online payment company Stripe and phone-maker Samsung on the initiative. Pilot projects begin Wednesday, ahead of more widespread usage expected next year. The San Francisco payment processing company is betting that what seems futuristic now could become a convenient alternative to our most mundane shopping tasks in the near future. It has spent the past six months working with AI developers to address technical obstacles that must be overcome before the average consumer is going to use it. For emerging AI companies, Visa's backing could also boost their chances of competing with tech giants Amazon and Google, which dominate digital commerce and are developing their own AI agents. The tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models — the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data , they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that. “The early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,” Forestell said. “You get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, ‘OK, you go buy it.’ Visa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases. Story Continues “The payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,\" Forestell said. “That’s why we started working with them.” The new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant. Many consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone's digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer's behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes. Forestell said that doesn't mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people — like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists — or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that “just powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,” Forestell said. Other shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background. And what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York. Forestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to “go spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,\" he said. Part of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer's consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases. “Visa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer. “When we generate a recommendation -- say you’re asking, ‘What are the best laptops?’ — we would know what are other transactions you’ve made and the revealed preferences from that.” Perplexity's chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it's still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says. The San Francisco startup has also, along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a federal court it would consider buying Google's internet browser, Chrome, if the U.S. forces a breakup of the tech giant in a pending antitrust case .

If President Donald Trump’s tariffs hold, it would be devastating for the business models of PDD Holdings Inc.’s Temu, Shein, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s international retailers, and the thousands of small Chinese companies making goods for export.

Generative AI and supportive Chinese policy support have both played a role in boosting the tech sector. \"We're seeing a significant acceleration in AI investment in China,\" said Tim Wang, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Monolith Management, where he manages a $400 million public equity fund. Visitors attend a major auto show in Shanghai on April 25, 2025. Hector Retamal | Afp | Getty Images This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. The big story China's tech world isn't getting distracted by whether the U.S. and China will talk on trade. From new artificial intelligence models to the world's largest auto show, Chinese tech companies are flaunting new developments thick and fast. Online delivery companies JD.com and Meituan are even publicly waging a competition for users, evoking the heyday of China's internet boom that spawned Alibaba . At the opening of the Shanghai auto show on April 23, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD announced five new models and Zeekr debuted its new hybrid 9X SUV . Robotaxi operator Pony.ai showed off three new vehicles that it claimed would slash costs for autonomous driving by 70%, helping the U.S.-listed company move closer to profitability. A day earlier, Huawei announced that this year, its latest driver-assist system will be able to automatically park a car , similar to valet service at a restaurant. Huawei sells the software to electric car manufacturers. \"The intense competition has pushed innovation in [China's new energy vehicles] ... things we thought were still a decade away, are more or less now at our fingertips,\" said Tu Le, founder and managing director at consulting firm Sino Auto Insights. He pointed to examples such as high-speed charging and driver-assist systems in mass market cars. AI for video Generative AI and supportive Chinese policy have both played a role in local tech development. IQiyi , dubbed China's \"Netflix,\" last week in Beijing touted its AI tools for cutting production costs and refining scripts. The company showed off its virtual studio set, and how generative AI can quickly transform the style of a TV show with human actors to one using 3D animation. \"This conversion effect was not achievable last year, or even in March,\" Liu Wenfeng, president of iQiyi's infrastructure and intelligent content distribution business group, told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"It's only recent technology that can achieve better consistency and stability in [generating] images.\" But he cautioned that AI still has a long way to go for it to generate videos that show actors, products and scenes with the same consistency as a live-action shot. In the meantime, he said virtual production and AI-supported efficiencies allow the company to respond more quickly to audience interests. Other Chinese companies are also trying to use AI for video. On April 15, Chinese short-video company Kuaishou released an update to its AI video generation model, Kling, spurring worries from media blog The Ankler about the consequences for Hollywood . A few days after the Kling upgrade, Alibaba released its latest open-source AI video generation model , while Beijing-based startup Shengshu Technology upgraded AI video product Vidu Q1, which claims to \" rival cinematic-grade visual effects .\" Alibaba on Tuesday also released its latest AI model, Qwen 3 . \"We're seeing a significant acceleration in AI investment in China,\" said Tim Wang, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Monolith Management, where he manages a $400 million public equity fund. \"Key breakthroughs in foundational models are closing the gap with global leaders,\" he said, \"and we're optimistic about the future of consumer AI applications, regardless of current trade headlines.\" Chinese companies are also turning to e-commerce and tech tools to mitigate the impact of tariffs . Several hundred exporters are now using tech company Baidu's AI-powered virtual human tool to sell products online via livestreams, said Xiaoli Ping, Baidu vice president and general manager of its e-commerce business. She claimed the tech cuts livestreaming costs by more than 80%, and can generate a higher purchase rate than employing human livestreamers. Baidu last week released what it claims is a \" more persuasive\" virtual human , as well as new AI models that are even cheaper to use than prior versions. Policy support Excitement around Chinese AI picked up in late January after homegrown DeepSeek released a free AI model and chatbot that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT. That breakthrough shattered perceptions that U.S. restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors would limit local AI development. Particularly for startups in critical tech industries, the Chinese government has many policies to help them connect with local suppliers and receive financing, said Beiping Tan, general manager at Beijing-based Tourongbang Management Consulting. China has also increased its efforts to develop and train talent, he said. His consulting firm has highlighted state policies for attracting individuals from outside China, especially those with doctorate degrees in engineering and natural science. Individual benefits include a 3 million to 5 million yuan ($410,000 to $690,000) one-time payout and an 800,000 yuan rental subsidy, while the employer can also receive subsidies for the majority of the individual's salary and 3 million yuan in research funding. DeepSeek and other Chinese tech breakthroughs this year are the cumulation of years of research spending and education development, pointed out Ding Wenjie, investment strategist for global capital investment at China Asset Management Co. \"We believe China will have more homegrown champions to surprise the world in the future.\" Even if that prediction comes true, that doesn't mean it will be a straight path up given the overall economic headwinds. Goldman Sachs pointed out that first-quarter industrial profit data indicated there was no growth outside of high-tech industries. China didn't meet all its lofty \"Made in China 2025\" targets set a decade ago, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said, noting the policy also fueled unhealthy overproduction in certain sectors. Intense competition in China's EV industry has also meant its development has plateaued for now, said Yichao Zhang, partner at consulting firm AlixPartners. He pointed out that automakers will need to work harder to create distinctive brands, traditionally the edge of foreign companies. But as China's rapid transformation into a global EV leader has shown, Zhang expects the Chinese dominance of the local market — and their international ambitions — to continue regardless. Top TV picks on CNBC Ordering a robotaxi ride on WeChat may soon be possible, says Pony.ai CEO Pony.ai's Co-founder and CEO James Peng talks to CNBC's Lin Lin about the company's tie-up with Chinese tech giant Tencent and the robotaxi push in China. Nio's CEO is confident the firm will break even in 2025 despite brutal competition Nio CEO William Li tells CNBC's Lin Lin that he's upbeat about improving the company's gross margin and breaking even in fourth quarter this year despite tariffs and cut-throat competition. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent: It's up to China to de-escalate trade tensions Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the latest developments on President Trump's trade negotiations with other countries, the state of tariff negotiations with China, how soon countries will reach trade deals with the U.S., and more. Need to know China released a plan to encourage companies to hire more recent graduates . The greater emphasis on employment support came after a high-level Politburo meeting on April 25 that called for targeted measures to help businesses in face of trade tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump claims he talked to Chinese President Xi Jinping. But there's no date and Beijing is saying there isn't any contact. Meanwhile, Xi emphasized AI and tech development during a trip to Shanghai on Tuesday. A few days earlier, China's finance minister and central bank governor were both in Washington, D.C., for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. China is ramping up its alternative energy development to reduce reliance on U.S. crude. The country on Monday said it approved five nuclear power projects , while releasing plans to develop hydrogen energy research and services this year. In the markets Chinese and Hong Kong stocks swung between gains and losses in a choppy session on Wednesday. Mainland China's CSI 300 was flat while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes several major Chinese companies — was up 0.22% as of 11:20 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 has lost over 4% while the Hang Seng Index has gained nearly 10% so far this year. The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield was slightly down at 1.625%.

    "article_text": "Amazon pushed back against a report that it planned to show the cost of tariffs next to some products on its e-commerce site. (Michel Spingler / Associated Press) By Queenie Wong Staff Writer Follow April 29, 2025 Updated 4:36 PM PT 44 Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print The White House on Tuesday blasted Amazon over a proposal to show the cost of President Trump’s tariffs next to the price of some products on its e-commerce site. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a news conference . “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Amazon said in a statement that its team that runs Amazon Haul, where people can find low-cost items, considered listing import charges on some items but the suggestion “was never approved and is not going to happen.“ Amazon Haul features items as low as $2.99 along with other discounts. Advertisement The White House’s remarks came after Punchbowl News reported that the Seattle-based company was planning to show the cost of Trump’s tariffs on its e-commerce site. The public spat between the White House and Amazon underscores the backlash the Trump administration faces over tariffs imposed on various countries including China. While major tech companies including Amazon, Meta, Google and Apple have been trying to strengthen ties with Trump by touting investments they’re making in the United States, uncertainty over tariffs and regulation have also rattled the tech industry . Advertisement Trump placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, a move that has prompted some merchants who sell goods made in China from providing discounts as part of Amazon Prime Day, Reuters reported. In April, when Trump announced that his administration planned to impose a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries, tech industry trade groups warned that the move would drive up the cost of consumer electronics, including Apple’s iPhone. Business ‘Nowhere to hide.’ How Apple and others in Silicon Valley are bracing for Trump tariffs The Trump administration’s tariffs will significantly hurt Silicon Valley tech companies like Apple, which has manufacturing operations in China, Vietnam and India. April 5, 2025 The White House said that it’s imposing tariffs to bring back manufacturing jobs to the United States and that relying too much on foreign producers could threaten economic security. Advertisement Trump then said he would exempt some electronics such as laptops and smartphones from tariffs. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment but appears to have resolved tensions with Amazon. Trump told reporters later on Tuesday that he had a “great” call with Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos. “He solved a problem very quickly. And he did the right thing, and he’s a good guy,” Trump said. Advertisement Amazon’s stock dropped after the White House’s remarks, but jumped back up after the company said it wouldn’t go through with the idea. Amazon’s stock price dropped slightly on Tuesday to close at $187.39.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stands against other growing dividend stocks. Value stocks are enjoying a rare period of strength amid this year’s broader market downturn. With earnings season approaching, it remains to be seen whether their recent edge over high-growth stocks will hold. The S&P Value Index—which includes sectors like banking, consumer staples, and healthcare, featuring companies that trade at relatively low valuations—has fallen around 9% this year. That’s a smaller drop compared to the more than 15% decline seen in the growth-focused counterpart. Concerns over steep valuations in the tech sector, coupled with a wave of risk aversion triggered by tariffs, have pushed investors to shift from growth to value. While similar shifts haven’t lasted long in the past, some investors believe that this time could be different, as expectations for value-oriented firms are modest enough that they may exceed them when earnings reports begin next month. Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, made the following comment about value investing: “The bar has been set pretty low for value stocks compared to the uncertainty surrounding growth names and their ability to deliver on earnings estimates. If value can at least match or slightly beat expectations, the runway is clear for them.” According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts are forecasting a 12% decline in first-quarter earnings for value companies compared to the same period last year, while growth companies are expected to post a 20% increase. Supporters of value stocks believe that these lower expectations are already factored into their relatively modest valuations. On the other hand, optimism surrounding growth stocks—particularly in the tech sector—has soared in recent years, largely driven by enthusiasm over advancements in artificial intelligence. Historically, value stocks have lagged behind. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 Value Index has only outperformed its growth counterpart five times on an annual basis. During that period, the value index climbed 202%, while the growth index surged by 600%. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services, made the following statement: “Growth is about 40% more expensive; this outperformance of value was very long overdue. Due to the incredible strength of the Magnificent Seven, too many investors crowded into growth thinking it won’t correct.” Story Continues Investors often turn to dividend stocks when looking at companies with lower valuations. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, pointed out that dividend-growth stocks—those known for consistently raising their payouts—have underperformed the broader market in 2024. He attributed this to a market that has largely been driven by a handful of fast-growing tech names. However, he also remarked that while dividend-paying stocks may trail during such growth-led rallies, they tend to hold up better during market downturns, as seen in 2022 and 2018. Companies that consistently raise their dividends are often both profitable and financially stable—traits that become especially important during times of economic downturn. McKesson Corporation (MCK): Among the Growing Dividend Stocks with Low PE Ratios A successful pharmacist in front of shelves of drugs in a community-based oncology pharmacy. Our Methodology For this list, we focused on dividend-paying companies that have consistently paid dividends over the years and have also demonstrated a track record of increasing their payouts. From that group, we considered stocks with forward P/E ratios below 25, as of April 22. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their P/E ratios. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK ) Forward P/E Ratio as of April 22: 18.59 McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is an American healthcare company, headquartered in Texas. The company focuses on pharmaceutical distribution, medical supplies, health information technology, and healthcare management solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) posted revenue of $95.3 billion in the recent quarter, marking an 18% year-over-year increase. Adjusted operating income also saw a solid 16% rise, reaching $1.5 billion. However, revenue came in just below analysts’ expectations of $96.08 billion, partly due to softer results in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment. With a forward P/E ratio of 18.80, the company is viewed as one of the more appealing value opportunities in the market. Following this strong performance, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) raised its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to a range of $32.55 to $32.95, representing an expected annual increase of 19% to 20%. The company also reiterated its commitment to shareholder returns, distributing $3.1 billion over the first nine months of 2024, which included $254 million in dividend payments. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), one of the best growing dividend stocks, currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.71 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.41%, as of April 22. The company has raised its payouts for eight consecutive years. Overall, MCK ranks 22nd on our list of the best growing dividend stocks with low P/E ratios. While we acknowledge the potential of MCK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MCK but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock .

Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVRG ) Forward P/E Ratio as of April 22: 16.67 Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVRG) ranks 21st on our list of the best growing dividend stocks with low P/E ratios. The Missouri-based electric services company provides electricity generation, transmission, and distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers. With renewed concerns over trade wars and the return of tariff discussions, companies like Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVRG) stand out as appealing investment options. Electricity isn’t subject to tariffs—it’s a local, essential service that operates independently of global supply chains. This kind of business model tends to remain stable when broader economic conditions become uncertain. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVRG) reported revenue of $1.26 billion, which showed a 5.85% growth from the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts’ estimates by $14.6 million.

It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.6675 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.91%, as of April 22. At the end of Q4 2024, 38 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVRG), growing from 30 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $1.3 billion. With over 4 million shares, Millennium Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q4.

(NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares during a rough patch in 2022 has become one of the most high-profile missed opportunities today. What Happened: In January 2022, Ackman revealed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management , had purchased more than $1 billion worth of Netflix stock—about 3.1 million shares—when it was trading around $400. The move came after Netflix stock had fallen more than 65% amid concerns over slowing growth and a tech-sector sell-off. However, the bet soured quickly. By April, Netflix's stock plummeted further following a disappointing earnings report and investor uncertainty surrounding its ad-based subscription plans. See Also: Netflix CEO Says Streaming Company ‘Saved Hollywood’ As Stock Hits New All-Time Highs Ackman exited the position just three months later, when shares were trading near $225, taking a loss of approximately 40%. In total, Pershing Square's short-lived Netflix investment cost the firm an estimated $400 million. At the time, the sale seemed prudent. Netflix's stock continued to slide, bottoming out near $175 in the following months. But in a surprising turn, both the broader tech sector and Netflix rebounded sharply. As of today, Netflix shares are trading around $1,096.87—a stunning recovery of over 168.085% from Ackman's highest estimated buy-in. Had Ackman held onto the position, those 3.1 million shares would now be worth nearly $3.4 billion, turning a brief misstep into one of his most lucrative trades ever. Why It's Important: Last week, Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters reassured investors that the company remains confident , even amid market turbulence and growing recession fears driven by new tariffs. He went on to say that entertainment has traditionally remained strong during economic downturns, and Netflix continues to see that pattern hold. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos added that the company is staying focused on factors within its control, stating, \"We're not changing anything in the forecast.\" For the first quarter, Netflix reported revenue of $10.54 billion —a 12.5% year-over-year increase—slightly beating Wall Street's estimate of $10.52 billion. Global markets have seen heightened volatility in response to new trade tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump . The S&P 500 is down by 6.54% year-to-date while the Nasdaq-100 has slipped 8.40% during the same period. Price Action: Netflix shares are up 23.70% year-to-date and have soared 94.21% over the past 12 months, according to Benzinga Pro . The streaming giant holds a growth score of 69.79% and a momentum rating of 95.93, based on Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings. Click here to see how it compares to other leading entertainment and tech companies. Netflix currently has a consensus price target of $1,082.97 from 32 analysts, with the highest target of $1,514 issued by Rosenblatt on April 21. Recent ratings from Evercore ISI Group, Macquarie, and Wedbush point to an average target of $1,183.33, suggesting an 8.17% potential upside.

(NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares during a rough patch in 2022 has become one of the most high-profile missed opportunities today. What Happened: In January 2022, Ackman revealed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management , had purchased more than $1 billion worth of Netflix stock—about 3.1 million shares—when it was trading around $400. The move came after Netflix stock had fallen more than 65% amid concerns over slowing growth and a tech-sector sell-off. However, the bet soured quickly. By April, Netflix's stock plummeted further following a disappointing earnings report and investor uncertainty surrounding its ad-based subscription plans. See Also: Netflix CEO Says Streaming Company ‘Saved Hollywood’ As Stock Hits New All-Time Highs Ackman exited the position just three months later, when shares were trading near $225, taking a loss of approximately 40%. In total, Pershing Square's short-lived Netflix investment cost the firm an estimated $400 million. At the time, the sale seemed prudent. Netflix's stock continued to slide, bottoming out near $175 in the following months. But in a surprising turn, both the broader tech sector and Netflix rebounded sharply. As of today, Netflix shares are trading around $1,096.87—a stunning recovery of over 168.085% from Ackman's highest estimated buy-in. Had Ackman held onto the position, those 3.1 million shares would now be worth nearly $3.4 billion, turning a brief misstep into one of his most lucrative trades ever. Why It's Important: Last week, Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters reassured investors that the company remains confident , even amid market turbulence and growing recession fears driven by new tariffs. He went on to say that entertainment has traditionally remained strong during economic downturns, and Netflix continues to see that pattern hold. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos added that the company is staying focused on factors within its control, stating, \"We're not changing anything in the forecast.\" For the first quarter, Netflix reported revenue of $10.54 billion —a 12.5% year-over-year increase—slightly beating Wall Street's estimate of $10.52 billion. Global markets have seen heightened volatility in response to new trade tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump . The S&P 500 is down by 6.54% year-to-date while the Nasdaq-100 has slipped 8.40% during the same period. Price Action: Netflix shares are up 23.70% year-to-date and have soared 94.21% over the past 12 months, according to Benzinga Pro . The streaming giant holds a growth score of 69.79% and a momentum rating of 95.93, based on Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings. Click here to see how it compares to other leading entertainment and tech companies. Netflix currently has a consensus price target of $1,082.97 from 32 analysts, with the highest target of $1,514 issued by Rosenblatt on April 21. Recent ratings from Evercore ISI Group, Macquarie, and Wedbush point to an average target of $1,183.33, suggesting an 8.17% potential upside.

    "article_text": "Philip Morris International Inc. (PM): Among the Growing Dividend Stocks with Low PE Ratios Vardah Gill April 24, 2025 5 min read PM We recently published a list of the 30 Growing Dividend Stocks with Low PE Ratios . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other growing dividend stocks. Value stocks are enjoying a rare period of strength amid this year’s broader market downturn. With earnings season approaching, it remains to be seen whether their recent edge over high-growth stocks will hold. The S&P Value Index—which includes sectors like banking, consumer staples, and healthcare, featuring companies that trade at relatively low valuations—has fallen around 9% this year. That’s a smaller drop compared to the more than 15% decline seen in the growth-focused counterpart. Concerns over steep valuations in the tech sector, coupled with a wave of risk aversion triggered by tariffs, have pushed investors to shift from growth to value. While similar shifts haven’t lasted long in the past, some investors believe that this time could be different, as expectations for value-oriented firms are modest enough that they may exceed them when earnings reports begin next month. Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, made the following comment about value investing: “The bar has been set pretty low for value stocks compared to the uncertainty surrounding growth names and their ability to deliver on earnings estimates. If value can at least match or slightly beat expectations, the runway is clear for them.” According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts are forecasting a 12% decline in first-quarter earnings for value companies compared to the same period last year, while growth companies are expected to post a 20% increase. Supporters of value stocks believe that these lower expectations are already factored into their relatively modest valuations. On the other hand, optimism surrounding growth stocks—particularly in the tech sector—has soared in recent years, largely driven by enthusiasm over advancements in artificial intelligence. Historically, value stocks have lagged behind. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 Value Index has only outperformed its growth counterpart five times on an annual basis. During that period, the value index climbed 202%, while the growth index surged by 600%. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services, made the following statement: “Growth is about 40% more expensive; this outperformance of value was very long overdue. Due to the incredible strength of the Magnificent Seven, too many investors crowded into growth thinking it won’t correct.” Story Continues Investors often turn to dividend stocks when looking at companies with lower valuations. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, pointed out that dividend-growth stocks—those known for consistently raising their payouts—have underperformed the broader market in 2024. He attributed this to a market that has largely been driven by a handful of fast-growing tech names. However, he also remarked that while dividend-paying stocks may trail during such growth-led rallies, they tend to hold up better during market downturns, as seen in 2022 and 2018. Companies that consistently raise their dividends are often both profitable and financially stable—traits that become especially important during times of economic downturn. Philip Morris International Inc. (PM): Among the Growing Dividend Stocks with Low PE Ratios A man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products. Our Methodology For this list, we focused on dividend-paying companies that have consistently paid dividends over the years and have also demonstrated a track record of increasing their payouts. From that group, we considered stocks with forward P/E ratios below 25, as of April 22. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their P/E ratios. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM ) Forward P/E Ratio as of April 22: 22.88 Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company. The company has made strides in expanding its product offerings, particularly with the development of Iqos—its heat-not-burn tobacco devices—which have captured notable market share in key regions such as Japan. The company has also secured the U.S. sales rights for Iqos from Altria, marking a significant move in its global strategy. Another area of growth has been Zyn, the oral nicotine pouch brand acquired through its purchase of Swedish Match. Due to rising demand, Philip Morris is scaling up Zyn production to meet consumer needs. The stock is grabbing investor attention this year as it is up by over 35% since the start of 2025. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) posted strong results, with revenue increasing 7.3% year-over-year to $9.7 billion and operating income climbing 14.8% to $3.3 billion. The company’s shift toward smoke-free products continues to gain traction, with combined shipments of heated tobacco and oral nicotine products exceeding 40 billion units in a single quarter for the first time. On March 6, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) announced a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share, maintaining the previous payout. The company has now increased its dividend for 15 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best growing dividend stocks. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.29%, as of April 22. Overall, PM ranks 30th on our list of the best growing dividend stocks with low P/E ratios. While we acknowledge the potential of PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock .

    "article_text": "1 Market-Beating Artificial Intelligence (AI) ETF That Could Turn $250,000 Into $1 Million Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool April 23, 2025 5 min read ^GSPC NFLX NVDA ORCL The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) has delivered a compound annual return of 10.3% since it was established in 2001, comfortably beating the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has generated an average annual gain of 7.8% over the same period (as of this writing). It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on the broader technology industry, so it has successfully navigated transformational booms driven by the internet, enterprise software, cloud computing, and more. Now, the bulk of the companies that make up its top holdings are laser-focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI), which could be the most valuable opportunity in the tech industry's history. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Here's how the iShares ETF could turn $250,000 into $1 million over the long term. Image source: Getty Images. A diversified way to invest in the AI boom The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF holds 283 different stocks, including most of the major players in the AI race. Its top-five holdings are Microsoft , Apple , Alphabet , Nvidia , and Meta Platforms , which represent a combined 41.7% of the portfolio's value, so the fund is quite top-heavy. However, the fund also holds a stake in a long list of companies that are successfully deploying AI into their legacy businesses to create new growth opportunities. Some of them include: Company Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting Netflix 3.78% Salesforce 2.15% Oracle 1.89% Adobe 1.38% Advanced Micro Devices 1.29% Palo Alto Networks 1.01% CrowdStrike 0.84% Atlassian 0.30% Datadog 0.26% Docusign 0.14% Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 17, 2025, and are subject to change. Netflix operates the world's largest streaming service for movies and TV shows. It uses AI in its recommendation engine to show subscribers the content they are most likely to enjoy, which keeps them engaged for longer periods of time. The company is coming off another quarter of record revenue through the first three months of 2025. Oracle was founded in 1977 and found early success with its database management software. The company evolved over time to help its business customers capitalize on the internet boom in the early 2000s and the cloud revolution in the 2010s. Now, it operates some of the world's best data centers for AI development, with a customer list that includes industry leaders like OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Elon Musk's xAI. Story Continues Oracle recently placed an order for 30,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' latest AI data center chips, the MI355X, which are expected to rival Nvidia's industry-leading Blackwell chips when they start shipping in the next few months. But AMD's AI opportunity transcends the data center because it also makes some of the most powerful AI chips for personal computers, which could be the industry's next big growth opportunity. Then there are Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike, two of the world's largest cybersecurity vendors. They have woven AI into their flagship products to automate everything from threat detection to incident response, which is critical because modern organizations face a growing number of threats as they shift more of their operations into the digital realm. Turning $250,000 into $1 million As I highlighted above, the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 10.3% since 2001. However, that annual return accelerated to 18.7% over the past decade thanks to the proliferation of technologies like enterprise software, cloud computing, and now, AI. The table below shows how long it could take for the ETF to turn a starting balance of $250,000 into $1 million, based on three different scenarios: Compound Annual Return Time To Reach $1 Million 10.3% 15 Years 14.5% (midpoint) 11 Years 18.7% 9 Years Table and calculations by author. Simply put, investors who park $250,000 into the iShares ETF could find themselves with $1 million within 15 years, even if it reverts back to its long-term average return of 10.3%. But it won't necessarily be smooth sailing, because ETFs geared toward a specific industry like technology can be very volatile. In fact, the iShares ETF is down 17% in 2025 amid the simmering global trade tensions, which is much worse than the 10% decline in the S&P 500. So, even though the ETF typically beats the index over the long run, steep drawdowns are the price investors will pay for the opportunity to earn those strong returns. AI could be the biggest tailwind for the tech industry since the iShares ETF was established in 2001. Goldman Sachs estimates it will add $7 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade, and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management thinks it can improve labor productivity by an eye-popping $200 trillion by 2030. A lot of that value will be created by the companies in the iShares ETF, so patient investors have a legitimate chance to earn a solid return over the long run.

    "article_text": "Stock heatmap by FinViz.com Tue, 22 Apr 2025 14:46:11 GMT Sector Overview The stock market displayed robust activity today, with the Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors spearheading a pronounced rally. Leading the charge, Apple (AAPL) surged by 2.36%, followed closely by Amazon (AMZN), which marked a 2.56% increase. Such performance reflects growing investor confidence in the tech and retail giants, likely driven by positive quarterly forecasts and market momentum. Technology: The tech sector witnessed significant gains today. Microsoft (MSFT) rose by 0.93%, and Nvidia (NVDA) achieved an impressive 2.01% upswing, signaling heightened market optimism in tech infrastructure and AI advancements. Consumer Cyclical: Tesla (TSLA) experienced an outstanding boost of 3.39%, helping uplift the sector overall. This growth hints at rising consumer demand and favorable market conditions for vehicular innovations. Communication Services: Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) also performed well, rising by 1.25% and 0.39%, respectively, reinforcing solid investor sentiment in digital advertising platforms. Market Mood and Trends Today's market tone is decidedly bullish, with a strong uptrend depicted across key market players. The positive movements are fueled by consumer electronics and tech sector optimism, which past reports have projected as high-growth areas. Conversely, the aerospace and defense sector, led by firms like Raytheon Technologies (RTX), which fell by 8.05%, faces headwinds, possibly due to geopolitical uncertainties or cutbacks. Strategic Recommendations Investors should focus their attention on the thriving sectors of technology and consumer cyclical. Stocks like Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon are demonstrating promising trends and should remain a focal point for those looking to capitalize on current market conditions. Meanwhile, cautious monitoring of aerospace stocks is recommended due to potential volatility. Diversifying across resilient sectors, such as financials—where firms like Visa (V) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are holding strong—can offer a balanced approach to portfolio management.

Ground Picture/Shutterstock Javier Simon 4/22/2025 | Updated: 4/22/2025 0:00 X 1 Regardless of what happens with U.S. trade policy and resultant market volatility, the nation’s major tech companies are likely to remain at the forefront of innovation and technological advances, which gives them a longevity and survival edge even in times of economic turmoil. Plus, many financial advisers recommend you avoid panic selling during market downturns and instead remain invested as you pick up strong stocks at a premium. So if you want to jump into the tech sector, here are some top picks. Nvidia As the market recovered following extreme volatility amidst trade uncertainty, the stock price of artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia jumped by more than 17 percent for its best week since August 2024.

(Emily Steinberger / Associated Press) To the editor: The growing divide between Silicon Valley executives and employees is a warning sign flashing red for awareness ( “Political divide in Silicon Valley: As many tech leaders embrace Trump, their workforce has not,” April 13). Tech leaders leaning into President Trump’s agenda risk more harm than anything. Workers are feeling undervalued and detached from tech industry visions that promised an emerging union that caters to innovation and collaboration. This disconnect threatens the tech culture, constructing imbalances where innovation suffers and productivity fails. Companies must see the action of a collaborative culture that attends to the needs of workers within these industries. Leadership accountability and inclusivity mark a balance of accountability needed for progress in the workplace. It is time for Silicon Valley to see that ethics and unity are essential features in the technology community. Ignoring the concerns for political expediency shows neglect for workers everywhere.

    "article_text": "Pakistan’s IT exports reached an all-time high of $342 million in March, according to the Ministry of IT. This marks the highest-ever monthly export figure for the country’s tech sector. The increase continued a strong trend, with 18 straight months of growth. Officials credit the rise to strong policy support and the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). In the first nine months of the 2025 fiscal year, total IT exports hit $2.8 billion. The government’s “Uraan Pakistan” plan aims to boost exports to $10 billion by focusing on currency stability and growth policies. Minister of State for IT, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, said demand for Pakistani tech services is growing worldwide. She expects further increases in exports in the coming months."

    "article_text": "Command Line Policy Tech The government doesn’t understand Meta ﻿The FTC’s antitrust case fails to address the real source of the social media giant’s power. ﻿The FTC’s antitrust case fails to address the real source of the social media giant’s power. by Alex Heath Apr 18, 2025, 10:37 PM UTC Link Share Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. The government should be scrutinizing Meta’s power. Unfortunately, its legal attack isn’t cutting to the heart of what keeps Meta big. This week, I spent three days in a Washington, DC courtroom watching Mark Zuckerberg testify. He was there defending his company from being broken up by the Federal Trade Commission, which is seeking to unwind his acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp on the grounds that they were anticompetitive. At times, he was made uncomfortable and challenged with evidence that he wanted to “neutralize” rivals. Primarily, what I observed was the FTC’s misunderstanding of how social media works. To establish the market it argues Meta has a monopoly in, the FTC has defined a subset of social media that it calls “personal social networking services.” This category includes apps that primarily facilitate sharing between friends and family, but for some reason, doesn’t include private messaging apps. The government argues that Meta’s only competitors in this market are Snapchat and MeWe, an obscure, blockchain-based social network that claims to have 20 million users. Conveniently for the FTC, including only these two companies gives Meta a de facto legal monopoly status in the US with 80-percent market share. The FTC must know this market definition is ridiculous because the agency’s lead attorney for the case, Daniel Matheson , didn’t ask Zuckerberg about MeWe once during the roughly 13 hours he was on the witness stand. When he was finally asked about MeWe by Meta’s lead attorney, Mark Hansen , Zuckerberg testified that he hadn’t heard of it before the government’s lawsuit. I sympathize with the difficulty of defining the market for an antitrust case like this, and Judge James Boasberg may ultimately disregard the FTC’s definition (or Meta’s much broader one) for his own anyway. Following Google’s loss of its ad tech monopoly case this week, it’s notable that judges have recently ruled twice in favor of the government in Big Tech antitrust lawsuits. On TV, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is meanwhile speaking to an audience of one by trying to frame the Meta case as a fight against censorship. That may give the FTC a political edge in scoring a win beyond the courtroom. Whatever kind of legal wrangling the FTC is trying to do here, it’s not getting at the real source of Meta’s power, or even the actual market it operates in. If the government accurately included all the players that Meta considers competitors —TikTok, YouTube, iMessage, X, Telegram, etc.—there is simply no way it could argue that Meta has a monopoly market share in the US. Consumer behavior suggests strongly that this broader market is a reality; Meta presented internal data at trial that showed how Facebook and Instagram traffic surged when TikTok was briefly offline in the US earlier this year. As it focuses on acquisitions from over a decade ago in a market that has undergone radical changes since then, the FTC is largely ignoring what Meta’s business thrives on: network effects. The more people there are on a social network, the harder it becomes to unseat. The lawsuit mentions this as a source of power, but it’s far from the focus of the case. Time after time, Zuckerberg has leveraged network effects to grow his empire. He did it with Facebook to grow Instagram. In turn, the infrastructure developed for those apps has been used to scale WhatsApp, which now has nearly 3 billion users. He’s doing it again by using Instagram to grow Threads and integrating Llama-powered features into all of his apps. ”If any app gets sufficiently large, it has the opportunity to spread out and do different things,” Zuckerberg said from the witness stand. This can be an antitrust issue in its own right—Google, for instance, has been accused of using its leverage in one market to unfairly promote products in a different market—but it’s an enduring source of power that simply breaking up the company won’t solve. Sure, spinning Instagram and WhatsApp off into different companies could create new short-term competitors. But to maintain that competition in the long run, you’d want to let people take their profiles, and possibly even their friend lists, with them to other services. This kind of thing is a privacy and regulatory nightmare to implement, but there’s no denying that people want this level of control—just look at the buzz around Bluesky and ActivityPub, the latter of which Meta has hooked Threads into. [] The FTC v. Meta trial is just getting started and may still bring damning evidence that the company needs to be broken up. However, so far, the government appears to be missing the point. Elsewhere OpenAI’s ever-growing ambitions: It’s hard to think of any company in the history of tech that is shipping faster and growing its ambitions more than OpenAI right now. Just this week, we saw the release of GPT-4.1 , o3, and o4-mini , reports that it may buy Windsurf, the startup behind the AI coding tool Codeium, for $3 billion , and our scoop that Altman is quietly working on a social network .

    "article_text": "Stephen Maturen / Getty Images Close UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) stock had one of its worst days ever on Thursday after the healthcare giant unexpectedly cut its profit forecast for the year. UnitedHealth stock fell more than 22% on Thursday, its biggest daily decline since 1998. Thursday marked the company’s fourth-worst day on Wall Street since going public in 1984. UnitedHealth’s precipitous drop rippled through the stock market . Fellow health insurers Humana ( HUM ) and Elevance Health ( ELV ) dropped 7.4% and 2.4%, respectively. And UnitedHealth, the priciest stock in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, detracted an estimated 789 points from the blue-chip index, which fell 1.3%; if UnitedHealth stock hadn’t moved at all today, the Dow would have risen 262 points, or 0.7%. UnitedHealth’s slump erased about $120 billion off its market capitalization , which puts it among the costliest stock routs of all time. It’s the kind of wealth-decimating drop that’s rarely seen outside of the tech sector, where corporate valuations are underpinned by growth expectations that can balloon and, in moments of crisis, pop. Meta ( META ), for example, became the first company to lose more than $100 billion in a single day in 2018 after the company—then called Facebook—reported disappointing quarterly revenue. In defensive sectors like health care and consumer staples, companies usually lose that kind of market value over long periods of slow decline. Pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ) and cosmetics giant Estée Lauder ( EL ), for example, have each lost about $100 billion in value over the last 10 and 3 years, respectively, as they’ve struggled with slumping sales. To be sure, UnitedHealth, with a $535 billion market cap, was the 14th largest company in the S&P 500 heading into Thursday’s session, giving it lots of market value to lose. Outside of the tech sector, only Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ), Eli Lilly ( LLY ), Walmart ( WMT ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), and Visa ( V ) were worth more before Thursday. Still, companies of UnitedHealth’s size often operate stable businesses that require a massive shock, like Covid-19, to suffer the kind of sell-off seen Thursday.

    "article_text": "Stocks resume sell-off as tariff costs hit tech and Powell delivers starkest warning yet on Trump's trade war Josh Schafer · Reporter April 16, 2025 3 min read ^DJI ^SPX NVDA QQQ ^GSPC US stocks tumbled on Wednesday as investors were reminded of the costs President Trump's tariffs will have for major companies and the challenges these policies may present for the broader US economy. The market sell-off intensified in the final hours of trading as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered perhaps his starkest warning yet on the potentially stagflationary effects of Trump's tariff policies. Powell warned during a speech in Chicago of the \"challenging\" impacts of the uncertainty that has hit the economy, adding the central bank will \"wait for greater clarity\" before considering any interest rate adjustments. These remarks amped up the potential negative impacts of sweeping tariffs and took away the likelihood the Fed would be quick to cut rates should the economy slow. Specifically, Powell warned tariffs \"are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" adding, \"The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.\" Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet The benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dropped about 2.2% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) shed roughly 700 points, or around 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell over 3% as the new chip provisions weighed on the tech sector. Wednesday's losses upset what had become a more stable environment for financial markets after the initial shock of \"Liberation Day\" sent markets reeling earlier this month. These remarks came in the middle of what was already shaping up to be a negative day for US stocks, led by the tech sector. AI chip leader Nvidia ( NVDA ) revealed late Tuesday night that new restrictions from the US government on its chip exports to China would result in $5.5 billion in charges. AMD ( AMD ) made similar announcement, saying the new provisions could cost the chipmaker up to $800 million. Nvidia and AMD both fell about 7% on the day. \"What this comes down to is this continued level of uncertainty in the markets,\" Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO, told Yahoo Finance. Policy uncertainty has been at the forefront of the recent market sell-off . Economists broadly expect these policies to boost inflation and slow economic growth . To some, that combination leads to a clear result. \"Recession odds are climbing even further as Powell pushes back the timing of cuts,\" Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note on Wednesday. During the question-and-answer session at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell was asked directly whether the Federal Reserve would intervene if the stock market continued to plummet. Story Continues \"No,\" Powell said, denying the theory that there is a so-called Fed put , or level of a stock market sell-off where the Fed would cut interest rates to calm markets. Powell said markets are currently attempting to asses a highly uncertain environment, and that leads to volatility. \"Markets are doing what they're supposed to do,\" Powell said. \"They're orderly and they're functioning just about as you would expect them to function.\" US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at the Economic Club of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, on April 16, 2025. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) · KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI via Getty Images On Wednesday, that market function featured shifting investor views on Nvidia amid the new costly provisions laid on by the Trump administration. Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance that the slide in Nvidia shares was \"emblematic\" of the issues driving the stock market lower over the past month. As earnings season progresses in the weeks ahead, it's unlikely Nvidia will be the only company to warn about higher costs. \"This is uncertainty,\" Sosnick said. \"And uncertainty is a killer for a company, for any company.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Semiconductor stocks dropped as major AI players Nvidia and AMD anticipated charges related to restrictions on chip exports to China. Oil prices partially recovered from recent declines, helping lift numerous stocks in the oil and gas sector. Major U.S. equities indexes tumbled Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago that changes in U.S. trade policy could pressure growth and boost inflation . Noting declines in business and consumer sentiment, Powell suggested the Fed is poised to await more visibility on possible tariff impacts before modifying interest rates. The S&P 500 ended the session 2.2% lower, while the Dow declined 1.7%. Tech sector underperformance weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 3.1%. Shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services ( JBHT ) skidded 7.7%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, following the logistics company's earnings release. Although first-quarter sales and profits edged out expectations, executives noted that tariffs were weighing on demand as customers attempt to gauge the potential impact on their supply chains and overall businesses. J.B. Hunt stressed that it is evaluating options to reduce its costs as it navigates these challenges. The top executive from marketing and corporate communications firm Omnicom ( OMC ) reaffirmed plans to move forward with the acquisition of advertising giant Interpublic Group ( IPG ), pushing back against claims that the deal could result in client losses. However, shares of both companies dropped more than 7% on Wednesday. Semiconductor stocks dropped after chip giants Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) said they expect to take significant charges related to export restrictions imposed by the Trump administration. Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion hit in its fiscal first-quarter results. In comparison, AMD foresees a charge of up to $800 million. Reports said that Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308, and other equivalent chips will need export licenses to be sold to Chinese firms. AMD shares plunged 7.4%, while Nvidia shares lost 6.9%. Palantir Technologies ( PLTR ) shares declined 5.8% on Wednesday, reversing some of the strong gains notched this week after the data analytics firm struck a deal with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for the deployment of Palantir's artificial intelligence (AI) military system. Shares of other enterprise software providers also lost ground amid broad pressure in the tech sector following Powell's comments about tariffs and their possible inflationary impact. Story Continues Crude oil futures prices moved higher after the U.S. government announced sanctions on Chinese importers of oil from Iran, increasing concerns about global supply. The uncertain outlook for the global economy has pressured the commodity's price this month, and the bounce back helped lift oil and gas stocks. Shares of exploration and production company APA Corp. ( APA ) led the way, with a gain of 3.2%, marking Wednesday's top performance in the S&P 500. Abbott Laboratories ( ABT ) shares jumped 2.8% after the maker of medical devices and other health care products reported better-than-expected first-quarter sales and profits . The company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance. It announced plans to invest $500 million in two manufacturing and research and development (R&D) facilities in Texas and Illinois that are set to open this year. Gold prices surged to another record high as the precious metal's safe-haven appeal remains solid in the tense geopolitical environment. Shares of Newmont ( NEM ), the world's largest gold producer, advanced 2.6%. Read the original article on Investopedia View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

It's become the benchmark for measuring stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) performance locally and abroad. Unfortunately, even the S&P 500 isn't immune to high volatility , as we've seen in the days following President Donald Trump's new tariff plan . The plan has sparked concerns about higher costs, reduced consumer spending, and increased recession chances . Despite the uncertainty in the stock market, the S&P 500 is one of the best investments anyone can make. However, given the current environment, investors could take a different approach to investing in the S&P 500 by buying shares of the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ( RSP +0.58% ) .

This has always been the case, but the problem is that megacap stocks (especially in the tech sector) have shot up in valuation over the past few years, and now the S&P 500 is a little too top-heavy. Below is how much the S&P 500's top 10 holdings are represented in both the standard S&P 500 and the equal-weight ETF: Company Percentage of S&P 500 Percentage of Equal-Weight ETF Apple 7.24% 0.19% Nvidia 6.07% 0.20% Microsoft 5.85% 0.21% Amazon 3.93% 0.19% Meta Platforms 2.88% 0.18% Alphabet (Class A) 1.97% 0.11% Berkshire Hathaway 1.87% 0.22% Broadcom 1.84% 0.20% Alphabet (Class C) 1.62% 0.09% Tesla 1.62% 0.21% Data source: Vanguard and Invesco. S&P 500 percentages as of Feb. 28. Equal-weight percentages as of April 11. There's a stark difference between 10 companies making up 34% of an index and those same companies comprising 1.8%. When it's going well, it can go very well. When it's going badly, it can go very badly. Other than Berkshire Hathaway , every stock in the S&P 500's top 10 holdings is down year to date through April 14 and has weighed on the index. ^SPX data by YCharts The equal-weight S&P 500 doesn't rely as heavily on the tech sector The equal-weight ETF helps hedge against concentration risks, especially with the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks and the tech sector. Every sector will likely face challenges with the Trump administration's new tariff plan, but the tech sector could be more vulnerable because of how many top companies rely on imports from countries like China and Taiwan. I don't see the tech sector stalling or losing long-term growth potential, but investors could lean more toward dividend and value stocks until some of the tariff-related uncertainty works itself out. With the equal-weight ETF, your exposure is more evenly spread between sectors: Sector Equal-Weight S&P 500 ETF Standard S&P 500 Industrials 15.79% 8.3% Financials 14.69% 14.5% Information technology 13.31% 30.7% Health care 11.82% 10.8% Consumer discretionary 10.02% 10.5% Consumer staples 8.02% 5.9% Utilities 6.52% 2.4% Real estate 6.09% 2.2% Materials 5.10% 2% Energy 4.31% 3.3% Communication services 4.03% 9.4% Data source: Invesco and Vanguard. Equal-weight percentages as of April 11. S&P 500 percentages as of Feb. 28 The S&P 500 is meant to give a snapshot of the U.S. economy. The equal-weight ETF ensures a more balanced representation instead of one skewed by a handful of megacap tech companies. The equal-weight ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 Going for the equal-weight ETF doesn't mean giving up your chance for high growth. In fact, since it hit the market in April 2003, the equal-weight ETF has outperformed the S&P 500. RSP data by YCharts I still believe the standard S&P 500 should be the foundation of most investors' portfolios, but the equal-weight ETF can be a great complement to the top-heavy nature of the S&P 500."

Login Donald Trump has taken his coterie of tech billionaire bros for a rollercoaster ride with his tariff war. The US president’s decision to dramatically hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 per cent last week was followed by a U-turn on Friday night to exclude smartphones, computer chips, hard drives, memory chips and other selected electronics from these levies. Two days later, in a confusing turn of events, Trump claimed on social media that “NOBODY is ‘getting off the hook’” and that electronics would still be subject to the 20 per cent tariffs. These actions have undermined the American tech sector’s relative stability, particularly in consumer electronics and high-tech industries. Loading...

Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( NASDAQ:AMD ETR:AMD ) View Price & Profile AMD takes first steps towards onshoring production after Trump tariff shock Published: 04:01 15 Apr 2025 EDT Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD, ETR:AMD) will soon begin manufacturing its key processor chips in the United States for the first time, using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) new Arizona facility. The shift marks a notable expansion of AMD’s supply chain beyond Asia, amid growing geopolitical tension and trade uncertainty. Until now, AMD’s chips, including its EPYC line used in data centres, have been produced exclusively at TSMC’s plants in Taiwan. The move to the US comes as the tech sector faces fresh scrutiny from the Trump administration, which is investigating whether semiconductor imports pose a national security threat - a step that could lead to new tariffs. AMD joins Apple and Nvidia in tapping TSMC’s Arizona plant, as companies look to diversify production. The firm has also completed its acquisition of US-based ZT Systems, strengthening its position in the AI server market and expanding its domestic footprint. Continue reading"

    "article_text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. “One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said. Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry’s political allegiances remain divided . But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. “I think you’re seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry. “The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.” The biggest example of that is Elon Musk , the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump’s administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump’s campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump’s inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him . Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration’s posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites . During Trump’s first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It’s against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. “We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.” The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers’ dreams of changing the world for the better. Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. “Now,” she said, “if you’re part of a startup, you’re hoping you’ll be absorbed in a way that’s profitable.” Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it’s headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. Stay informed on what is happening in Clark County, WA and beyond for only $1.99/week Subscribe “I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. “I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.” It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives. “The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.” “Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.” Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. “The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what’s going on,” he said. “It’s going to be different forever.” Morning Briefing Newsletter Get a rundown of the latest local and regional news every Mon-Fri morning.

Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. “Now,” she said, “if you’re part of a startup, you’re hoping you’ll be absorbed in a way that’s profitable.” Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it’s headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. “I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. “I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.” It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives. “The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.” “Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.” Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. “The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what’s going on,” he said. “It’s going to be different forever.” Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles and video journalist Haven Daley contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 10:54 AM MDT | UPDATED: April 14, 2025 at 11:02 AM MDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. “One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.

(AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) Expand Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry’s political allegiances remain divided . But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. “I think you’re seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry. “The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.” The biggest example of that is Elon Musk , the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump’s administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump’s campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump’s inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him . Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration’s posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites . During Trump’s first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It’s against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. “We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.” The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems.

(AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 12:54 PM EDT | UPDATED: April 14, 2025 at 1:02 PM EDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. “One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.

(AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) Expand Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry’s political allegiances remain divided . But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. “I think you’re seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry. “The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.” The biggest example of that is Elon Musk , the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump’s administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump’s campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump’s inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him . Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration’s posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites . During Trump’s first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It’s against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. “We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.” The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers’ dreams of changing the world for the better. Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. “Now,” she said, “if you’re part of a startup, you’re hoping you’ll be absorbed in a way that’s profitable.” Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it’s headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. “I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. “I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.” It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives. “The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.” “Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.” Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. “The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what’s going on,” he said. “It’s going to be different forever.” Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles and video journalist Haven Daley contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Laura Bratton April 14, 2025 at 4:03 PM 0 Copied Apple ( AAPL ) led the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks higher Monday as investors cheered the Trump administration's temporary tariff exemptions for tech products announced over the weekend. US Customs and Border Protection issued regulations late Friday exempting consumer electronics, networking equipment, and computing products — including GPUs and servers — from reciprocal tariffs. Taken together, the products represent $340 billion in global imports, with China accounting for $100 billion of the exclusions, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in an analysis early Monday. Apple stock rose over 2%. The exemptions cover almost all of its products — smartphones, personal computers, tablets, smartwatches, and other accessories, according to Citi analyst Atif Malik.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) rose 0.6% Monday afternoon. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet On April 2, Trump announced global reciprocal tariffs, including levies of 34% and 46% on imports from Taiwan and Vietnam, respectively, to go into effect on April 9. The president instead announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariff plan last Wednesday — with the exception of a 145% reciprocal tariff on Chinese imports. Trump also left in place a 10% global baseline tariff effective April 5. On Sunday, however, Trump said the tech exemptions were a temporary measure , telling reporters aboard Air Force One Sunday: \"The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future because as with steel, like we did with automobiles, like we did with aluminum — which are now fully on — we'll be doing that with semiconductors, with chips, and numerous other things.\" \"That'll take place in the very near future,\" Trump said, adding that semiconductor tariffs will be announced \"over the next week.\" President Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that the confusing messaging was an overall good sign for the tech industry, writing in a note to investors late Sunday: \"Overall, we view the dizzying weekend tariff news as a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names at it gives some flexibility and allows for China negotiations to hopefully take place in the coming months which could deescalate some tariff/trade war issues with Big Tech caught in the middle.\" The Magnificent Seven tech stocks suffered major losses following the April 2 announcement of Trump's reciprocal tariff plan, at one point shedding a cumulative $2 trillion from their market capitalizations .

    "article_text": "Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Among the Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in? Vardah Gill April 14, 2025 6 min read AVGO We recently published a list of the 13 Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other best technology dividend stocks. There was a time when tech stocks drew investor interest purely for their growth potential. But more recently, they’ve been gaining attention for a different reason: dividends. This marks a major shift, given that tech companies have traditionally focused their resources on innovation and expansion. Today, a significant portion of the tech sector consists of established firms with solid business models, healthy margins, steady growth, strong financials, and manageable debt levels. According to S&P, about 39% of tech companies in the Composite 1500 index are now returning capital to shareholders through dividends—a notable jump from 28% back in 2013. In addition, technology stocks have emerged as a major contributor to the market’s overall dividend payouts. FactSet data showed that tech companies now account for around 13% of the total dollar value of dividends within the S&P Composite Index. That puts the tech sector just behind financials, making it the second-largest source of dividends in the index—with a strong chance of taking the top spot in the near future. What’s more surprising is that tech companies haven’t just begun distributing dividends—they’ve also seen a select group consistently raise their payouts year after year. This group includes some of the world’s most prominent and successful names, alongside major global consulting firms, credit card providers, and other tech-adjacent players. Over the past several years, dividend growth from the technology sector has outpaced that of the broader market. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed that tech companies within the S&P Composite more than doubled their total dividend payouts by 2023 compared to 2013. This growth ranks as the fourth highest among all sectors and significantly surpasses the Index’s overall dividend increase of 7.2% during the same timeframe. With tech’s current dividend payout ratio at just 39%, there appears to be considerable room for further expansion. The move by leading tech firms to start paying dividends has sparked discussions around finding the right balance between capital appreciation and income generation. Sam Witherow, who manages the JPM Global Equity Income fund, noted that although his fund has traditionally included a mix of dividend-paying companies and those focused on capital growth, the characteristics of some of these companies are now evolving. He made the following comment about these strategies: Story Continues “We are seeking to provide clients with both a yield premium to the market and a dividend growth premium to the market at the aggregate portfolio level. It’s the combination of the two characteristics that typically leads to the best risk-adjusted returns. To deliver this we have always looked to have diversified exposure across global industries including traditionally growthier industries like consumer discretionary or tech.” Sam Buckingham, an investment manager at Abrdn Portfolio Solutions, pointed out that growth stocks offering smaller dividends could be useful for income funds aiming to diversify across different sectors and investment factors. He explained that while these stocks typically start with lower yields, they often have the potential for dividend growth over time. When paired with more traditional income stocks—like those in the utilities sector that offer higher initial payouts but slower growth—they can help create a more balanced portfolio. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Among the Best Technology Dividend Stocks to Invest in? A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Our Methodology For this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Information Technology index, which tracks the performance of major tech companies. From there, we identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders and picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, as per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database. The stocks are ranked according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 161 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks third on our list of the best dividend stocks from the tech sector. The American semiconductor company offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted a revenue of $14.9 billion, marking a 24.7% increase compared to the same quarter a year earlier. This figure exceeded analysts’ expectations by $325.2 million. The company’s top-line growth and adjusted EBITDA were driven by strong momentum in its AI-focused semiconductor offerings and infrastructure software. Revenue from AI surged 77% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, while infrastructure software sales rose 47% to reach $6.7 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also maintained a healthy cash position, generating more than $6.1 billion in operating cash flow. Free cash flow topped $6 billion, accounting for roughly 40% of total revenue. The company returned $2.77 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends during the quarter, reinforcing its shareholder-friendly approach. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.37%, as of April 10. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) grew to 161 in Q4 2024, from 128 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $22 billion. With nearly 24 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q4. Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

    "article_text": "Nation World Some top tech leaders have embraced Trump. That's created a political divide in Silicon Valley Many of the valley's traditionally liberal tech workers say they're feeling betrayed as some of the most prominent leaders in the industry have embraced Trump. Credit: (AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) Demonstrators rally against President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in San Jose, Calif., as part of a national day of action, April 5, 2025. SAN JOSE, Calif — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. “One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said. Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided . But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. “I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry. “The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.” The biggest example of that is Elon Musk , the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him . Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites . During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. “We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.” The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers’ dreams of changing the world for the better. Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. “Now,” she said, “if you’re part of a startup, you’re hoping you’ll be absorbed in a way that’s profitable.” Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. “I feel sick to my stomach now,” she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. “I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,” Sylvester said. “It was not all OK.” It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump’s challenges to the country’s system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley’s top executives. “The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,” said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. “Unfortunately, you’ve got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.” “Just coming here, everyone’s saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,” Wood added. “We’re all scared.” Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. “The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.” ___ Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles and video journalist Haven Daley contributed to this report.

(NASDAQ: TSLA ), and Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter (currently X) as well as Square, now called Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ ), have ignited a debate over intellectual property rights. The tech magnates have suggested a complete eradication of IP laws, a move that has stirred controversy in the tech industry. What Happened : Dorsey initiated the discussion with a post on X stating, “delete all IP law.” Musk, who now owns X (formerly Twitter), promptly agreed with Dorsey’s sentiment. The discussion comes amid ongoing lawsuits faced by AI companies, including OpenAI, co-founded by Musk, over alleged copyright violations. The debate has drawn a mixed bag of reactions. Tech evangelist Chris Messina supported Dorsey’s stance. He wrote on BlueSky social, “Jack has a point\" as \"Automated IP fines/3-strike rules for AI infringement may become the substitute for putting poor people in jail for cannabis possession.\" Meanwhile, others, like Ed Newton-Rex of Fairly Trained , on BlueSky, criticized the interaction between the tech executives. “Tech execs declaring all-out war on creators who don't want their life's work pillaged for profit,” posted Newton-Rex. SEE ALSO: OM Token’s 90% Crash Leaves Holders Reeling —MANTRA Blames ‘Reckless Liquidations,’ CEO Says ‘Fixing This’ Why It Matters : The exchange of views between the tech innovators comes at a time when Meta Platforms ‘ (NASDAQ: META ) Llama AI models have been caught in a copyright lawsuit over the use of pirated e-books for training. Dorsey’s and Musk’s recent comments are in line with their long-held views on intellectual property rights. Dorsey has been a vocal critic of IP laws, viewing them as barriers to innovation. In his subsequent posts under the current one, he argued that the current IP system restricts creativity and unfairly benefits gatekeepers at the expense of creators. There are \"much greater models to pay creators\" while claiming \"the current ones take way too much from them and only rent-seek,” posted Dorsey. Similarly, Musk’s endorsement of Dorsey’s post is consistent with his 2014 Tesla patent pledge not to enforce patents against “good faith” users. However, in a twist of events, Tesla sued Australian company, Cap-XX in 2023, suspecting the supercapacitors used for energy storage in EV batteries likely infringed on two U.S. patents held by a Tesla subsidiary. Their recent comments have reignited the conversation around intellectual property rights in the tech industry, a topic that will undoubtedly continue to be a point of contention.

    "article_text": "Synopsis Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. AP Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump 's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. \"One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\" Lyons said. Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. \"I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\" said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. \"The shift hasn't been for a lot of people,\" said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \"It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention.\" The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House 's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk . Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. \"We're still in the belly of the beast,\" said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \"If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\" The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was \"don't be evil,\" a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. \"Now,\" she said, \"if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable.\" Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. \"I feel sick to my stomach now,\" she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. \"I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\" Sylvester said. \"It was not all OK.\" It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. \"The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\" said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \"Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\" \"Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\" Wood added. \"We're all scared.\" Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. \"The trust is broken.

    "article_text": "Nation World Some top tech leaders have embraced Trump. That's created a political divide in Silicon Valley Many of the valley's traditionally liberal tech workers say they're feeling betrayed as some of the most prominent leaders in the industry have embraced Trump. Credit: (AP Photo/Emily Steinberger) Demonstrators rally against President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in San Jose, Calif., as part of a national day of action, April 5, 2025. SAN JOSE, Calif — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. “One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said. Political gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided . But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. “I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry. “The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.” The biggest example of that is Elon Musk , the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him . Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites . During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk. Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. “We’re still in the belly of the beast,” said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. “If the lake was frozen, there’s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.” The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington’s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world’s problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers’ dreams of changing the world for the better. Google’s motto was “don’t be evil,” a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth.

After his victory, even more rushed to Trump’s side, with Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg going on Joe Rogan’s podcast to talk about his admiration for the president-elect and the need for more “ masculine energy ” in US corporate culture. Then came the Liberation Day tariffs, and then Obliteration Day in markets, and finally the Equivocation Day partial tariff rollback. Meanwhile Meta shares are trading below their price on the day of Zuckerberg’s appearance on Rogan. It turns out that whatever the merits of masculine energy, a global trade war is not good for the tech industry."

    "article_text": "The Trump administration is carving out big tariff exemptions for the tech industry. While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he’d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he’d already imposed on goods from China). There’s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump’s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are “excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,” with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and machines that make semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China and from the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit — until last night’s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as “a dream scenario for tech investors.” Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in “the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. Recommended Videos “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different\" bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Sparing electronics was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an anticipated tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., burdening Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone and torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. An electronics exemption would remove “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

    "article_text": "Is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) a NASDAQ Stock with the Highest Upside Potential? Maham Fatima April 12, 2025 4 min read ADBE We recently published a list of the 13 NASDAQ Stocks with the Highest Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other NASDAQ stocks with high upside potential. On April 7, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to discuss how the current tariff environment could impact tech supply chains. Musk’s actions and Trump’s tariffs have contributed to broad economic uncertainty, which Ives also referred to as the economic Armageddon for US tech in an earlier conversation. He expressed concern about the structural supply chain challenges posed by recent tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Ives highlighted that the US tech sector has historically maintained an edge over China but this could be wiped out if manufacturing were relocated to the US. The logistical hurdles of building manufacturing plants in the US are not negligible and it would take 4 to 5 years to establish facilities capable of sustaining production levels comparable to those in Asia. He also acknowledged that he hasn’t downgraded major stocks like the ones in MAG7 but remains cautious. If these previously highlighted issues persist for months, Ives anticipates drastic cuts in earnings. This uncertainty surrounding tariffs could lead to lower demand for emerging technologies like AI and cybersecurity. He explained that this situation could severely impact the US tech companies and lead to broader cuts across the tech sector — potentially up to 25% in earnings. He also criticized Elon Musk’s political involvement, which he believes has caused permanent damage to his brand and customer base. He estimated a 20% demand destruction in Europe and 10% in the US. Our Methodology We used the Finviz stock screener to select the 13 stocks with the highest analysts’ upside potential (at least 35%) as of April 8. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential. We have also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Q4 2024, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Is Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) a NASDAQ Stock with the Highest Upside Potential? A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Story Continues Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Average Upside Potential as of April 8: 54.09% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117 Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a tech company that operates through its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising segments. It offers its solutions directly to enterprise customers through its sales force and local field offices, and directly to businesses and consumers. It also licenses its products to end-user customers through app stores and websites. The company’s Digital Media segment includes Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, which together generated $4.23 billion in FQ1 2025, which was up 12% year-over-year. Digital Media’s annualized recurring revenue was also up 12.6%. This was driven by the growing subscription-based revenue stream within this segment. Other factors that contributed to this growth include Adobe Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) PDF software, the web and mobile versions of Acrobat also performed well, and Adobe Express. The integration of GenAI features, such as Firefly, in Adobe Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) offerings, has been well-received by enterprise customers. For instance, the AI Assistant in Acrobat helps users with tasks like summarizing and editing PDFs. The web and mobile versions of core applications in Creative Cloud, like Photoshop and Illustrator, also had their paid subscriptions grow 35% year-over-year. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : “We added to several existing positions in the quarter including Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Workday, Shopify, MSCI, and Paycom Software. We feel Adobe is poised for re-accelerating revenue and earnings growth partially due to the monetization of its Firefly GenAI product embedded in its creative software.” Overall, ADBE ranks 5th on our list of NASDAQ stocks with the highest upside potential. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ADBE, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Generate Key Takeaways Reed’s view On Friday, when the global economy was in full panic mode after the “Liberation Day” tariffs, I told you not to panic! There’s just no world in which the Trump administration deliberately tanks the US tech industry. Of course, it became equally clear over the last week that there’s no master plan. But there’s some predictability in the directionless economic policy of the White House. You can count on them to throw spaghetti against the wall and try seemingly crazy things. And they know how crucial the tech industry is to national security and the cold war with China. So, in essence, the fundamental trajectory of Silicon Valley hasn’t changed. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement What’s different is that this administration is clearly willing to play favorites among companies and sectors. That’s why tech leaders like Tim Cook will have to spend time at the White House groveling for the necessary carveouts. Meanwhile, the tech IPO window may be closed for a while, but waiting on a public offering is something Silicon Valley founders and venture capitalists know how to do. Tariffs on China remain, but there’s a limit even on how far that will go, too. Where the administration could have the biggest impact on the tech industry is in government-funded research and development. That will determine whether the US wins the quantum computing race and develops nuclear fusion. AI, quantum, and fusion are complementary technologies. Winning in AI but losing in quantum or fusion would be an economic and national security disaster for the US. But so far, there’s been no action from the Trump White House on this front. It’s pulled back on research deemed a waste of money, or too “woke,” but hasn’t reallocated it to critical projects. The president scratched his tariff itch, but the most consequential decisions for the tech industry are ahead. The DOGE faction of the administration believes spending on basic research is going to accelerate, with a greater focus on key research areas. But the DOGE folks are up against the longstanding Republican tradition of cutting funding for research. This ideological battle is the one everyone in tech should be watching. Notable China is thinking about quantum. Last month, the Chinese government announced it is building a $138 billion venture fund to invest in new technologies, including quantum computing, AI, and hydrogen energy storage, Reuters reported. US tech innovation will move forward whether the government is on board or not, economist Nouriel Roubini told Bloomberg last week. “Mickey Mouse could be in power in the United States, the US is going to have 4% growth by the end of the decade, and it’s going to be higher in the next decade,” he said. “Even Trump, even with the bad policy, cannot screw up technological innovation.” CNN’s Stephen Collinson related Trump’s improvisation to the attitude of a real estate shark, “raising the stakes to intolerable levels to seek leverage.” It’s the latest example of Trump, whether accidental or deliberate, acting like a “madman” to accomplish his agenda by making his opponents question his sanity , he writes.

    "article_text": "Minnesota social media tax considered Minnesota could become the first state to tax social media companies if a new bill gets passed by lawmakers this year. FOX 9’s Corin Hoggard explains how it could work. The Brief A pair of DFL bills would create a use tax on social media in Minnesota, generating an estimated $92 million a year in revenue. The bill would charge an escalating tax on social media platforms based on their number of users in Minnesota. Sites with more than 100,000 users would be subject to tax. There are 14 of those right now, according to the Department of Revenue. Tech lobbyists and Republicans opposed the bills, saying it could impact small businesses that rely on social media. ST. PAUL, Minn. (FOX 9) - Minnesota could become the first state to tax social media companies if a new DFL bill gets passed. But their Republican counterparts seem less than thrilled by the idea. The original tax Big tech only: Platforms with more than 100,000 users would have to pay the new social media tax. The bigger the platform, the bigger the tax, and the state expects revenue of more than $90 million a year. Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, Truth Social, Bluesky – the names are ubiquitous in the U.S., where almost 250 million people use social media and part of the appeal is that we use them for free. \"If you are not paying for a service, you are not the consumer, you are the product being sold,\" said Rep. Zack Stephenson, (DFL-Coon Rapids) . \"And with social media, that is exactly what is happening.\" Smoking solutions? Help or harm: Stephenson compared the harms of social media to cigarettes, and argued the solutions may look the same. He doesn’t want to ban social media, but he supports a bill to tax them. \"The bill does nothing to stop what is a real harm,\" said Rep. Kristin Robbins (R-Maple Grove) . House Republicans argued social media companies will just pass the tax to their users. Some say people know their data is being mined for profit, so they should just stop logging on if they think it’s bad. Unintended consequences Tech industry warning: Tech lobbyists have warned of unintended consequences. \"This could lead companies to limit or scale back free widely used services like Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube and Facebook,\" said Kouri Marshall of the Chamber of Progress. They also say retailers and restaurants get affordable advertising on social media and this could increase those costs. But on the flip side, businesses that aren’t virtual believe the tech industry should pay its fair share. \"If we don't do things like this and find ways to tax industries that are growing in new areas and generating a lot of revenue, then the burden will remain relatively higher on all of those more traditional industries,\" said Eric Bernstein of We Make Minnesota. What's next: The bill passed through committees in the House and Senate on Wednesday, but House Republicans could block it from ever getting a vote, so its destiny is uncertain.

    "article_text": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Wednesday, Donald Trump, once again, took to Truth Social to abruptly shift US trade policy, announcing a 90-day pause “substantially” lowering reciprocal tariffs against all countries except China to 10 percent. Because China retaliated— raising tariffs on US imports to 84 percent on Wednesday—Trump increased tariffs on China imports to 125 percent “effective immediately.” That likely will not be received well by China, which advised the Trump administration to cancel all China tariffs Wednesday, NPR reported . “The US’s practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” the Chinese finance ministry said, calling for Trump to “properly resolve differences with China through equal dialogue on the basis of mutual respect.” For tech companies, trying to keep up with Trump’s social media posts regarding tariffs has been a struggle, as markets react within minutes. It’s not always clear what Trump’s posts mean or how the math will add up, but after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified Trump’s recent post, the stock market surged, CNBC reported , after slumping for days. But even though the stock market may be, for now, recovering, tech companies remain stuck swimming in uncertainty. Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade for the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)—which represents the $505 billion US consumer technology industry—told Ars that for many CTA members, including small businesses and startups, “the damage has been done.” “Our small business and startup members were uniquely exposed to these reciprocal tariffs and the whipsaw effect,” Brzytwa told Ars. “There’s collateral damage to that.” In a statement, CTA CEO Gary Shapiro suggested that the pause was “a victory for American consumers,” but ultimately the CTA wants Trump to “fully revoke” the tariffs. “While this is great news, we are hearing directly from our members that the ongoing additional 10 percent universal baseline tariffs and this continued uncertainty, are already hurting American small businesses,” Shapiro said. “CTA urges President Trump to focus his efforts on what he does best, dealmaking. Now is the time to reposition the United States with our allies as a reliable trading partner while growing the American and global economy.” Trump pause isn’t necessarily a “good thing” Even though Trump’s pause leaves time for US trade partners and allies to hopefully renegotiate trade deals that eliminate reciprocal tariffs, there’s no promise negotiations will end in the kind of stable trade agreements that tech companies depend on while building global supply chains. “Essentially, just because we’re going down to 10 percent doesn’t mean that that’s a good thing,” Brzytwa told Ars. “That tells us that there’s still an interest in part of the administration of keeping a tariff in place for the entire world, and that still is harmful, especially for our small businesses and startup members. That environment of unpredictability and uncertainty undermines their ability to plan, to innovate, to succeed, to source.” For the consumer tech industry—especially makers of laptops, smartphones, tablets, and game consoles—the tit-for-tat trade war with China is particularly threatening, since “China still is the predominant source of laptops, tablets, video game consoles, smartphones and monitors,” Brzytwa said. Although many companies built up stockpiles of popular products to keep consumer prices low by limiting imports through Trump’s negotiation phase, the CTA expects those stockpiles will “eventually dwindle,” Brzytwa said. For some in the tech industry, the timing of the tariffs couldn’t be worse. Research firm Canalys estimated that PC makers will see lower demand later this year, with PC prices spiking just as PC makers hoped to increase sales by hyping AI features, Reuters reported . Even tech companies that promptly reacted to the CTA’s most extreme forecast—estimating earlier this year tech industry impacts of 100 percent tariffs on China goods—weren’t fully prepared for today’s 125 percent tariffs to be announced. “None of it’s good in the long run,” Brzytwa told Ars. “Americans are trying to buy affordable products before the tariffs really bite. And as those stockpiles dwindle, the companies will have to replenish the products that they have in their inventories to sell to the American consumer. And maybe at some point they will start having to pay the tariff or they will have to find ways to shift their supply chains incredibly quickly to other markets, and there’s no guarantee that they can, and that also will be costly.” CTA urges Trump to quickly end reciprocal tariffs Currently, the tech industry is left hoping that Trump’s negotiations with countries other than China will go well, and potentially “lead to more stable, durable trade relationships… but more importantly, to actual binding and enforceable trade agreements,” Brzytwa said. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that Trump’s negotiations could potentially take weeks to resolve, a timeline that may be a relief to tech companies. Brzytwa told Ars that negotiations “better be quick” and not “drag on for months and months and months, leaving these tariffs in place,” or else the tech industry’s ability to innovate could be hampered. A PwC analysis found earlier this month—prior to the pause, retaliations (including new tariffs on US imports to the European Union ), and increased China tariffs—that tariffs hitting the tech, media, and telecommunications industry could increase tenfold, from approximately $13 billion to approximately $139 billion a year. But all PwC could recommend was that tech companies consider “reassessing global sourcing options” and shifting the countries where they do business, neither of which can be quickly achieved in response to a Truth Social post likely moving markets fast. “We’ve been very supportive of the US government negotiating free trade agreements that are comprehensive in nature, covering all the issues to eliminate tariffs and other non-tariff barriers to trade,” Brzytwa said. “That’s the direction we want the government to go in. That’s good for US businesses and innovation in the long run and for our competitiveness and for our strategic relationships, the world.” For now, Trump appears to be maintaining that arbitrarily imposing tariffs is the best way to spark negotiations, not just to influence deals with other countries, but with companies. Ahead of announcing tariffs on semiconductors—which Brzytwa noted may possibly include tariffs on all imports containing semiconductors—Trump threatened the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) with a 100 percent tax if it doesn’t build chipmaking plants in the US, Reuters reported . Trump considers this approach superior to Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, which awarded TSMC billions to build plants here. “TSMC, I gave them no money… all I did was say, if you don’t build your plant here, you’re going to pay a big tax,” Trump said.

Conversely, the healthcare sector is experiencing significant setbacks, creating a dynamic landscape for investors. Sector Overview 🚀 Technology & AI: The technology sector is notably vibrant today. Notably, Nvidia (NVDA) leads the charge with a remarkable increase of 3.86%, reflecting confidence in AI innovations. Other AI-related stocks like AMD also show strong gains, up by 6.04%, boosting optimism about this transformative technology. 📉 Healthcare: It's a challenging day for healthcare, with Eli Lilly (LLY) plummeting by 3.22% and AbbVie (ABBV) dropping 4.11%. These declines may suggest regulatory concerns or competitive pressures weighing heavily on investor sentiment. 🏦 Financial Sector: Mixed results prevail, as Visa (V) records a modest increase of 0.42%, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) marks a minor decline of 0.59%, reflecting varied investor reactions within the sector. Market Mood and Trends The overall market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, highlighted by the strength in tech stocks. The ongoing buzz around AI continues to capture investor attention, propelling tech shares upward. Healthcare's downturn, however, suggests apprehensions towards impending regulations and competitive dynamics. Strategic Recommendations Given today’s market dynamics, investors might consider increasing exposure to the thriving tech sector, particularly AI and semiconductor stocks, which are showing strong momentum. Current trends indicate promising growth potential in these areas, making them attractive options for risk-tolerant portfolios. Conversely, caution might be warranted when approaching healthcare stocks amid regulatory uncertainties. Investors should remain vigilant, monitoring developing news that could impact these market dynamics. Diversifying across resilient sectors such as technology and consumer cyclical can help mitigate risks associated with healthcare stock volatilities.

    "article_text": "Here's 1 Nasdaq ETF to Consider Even as the Index Enters Into a Bear Market Stefon Walters, The Motley Fool April 9, 2025 5 min read COMP ^GSPC QQQE NVDA MSFT Well, it's official: The Nasdaq Composite has entered bear territory. A bear market occurs when a major index drops over 20% from recent highs, and that's precisely what has happened with the Nasdaq Composite, which is down around 24% from its Dec. 16 high. The index was already having a rough 2025, but it was sent plunging after President Donald Trump announced his new tariff plan on April 2. The new tariffs, which affect imports from around 180 countries, will raise costs on lots of goods, including key products from countries that top companies in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rely on. Although the index is in a bear market, that doesn't mean investors should avoid it. There are still ways to have it set up long-term investors nicely. One of them is an exchange-traded fund (ETF): the Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (NASDAQ: QQQE) . ^IXIC data by YCharts. What differentiates this ETF from other Nasdaq ETFs This ETF doesn't include every stock in the Nasdaq Composite. However, it does work off the Nasdaq-100, a subset that contains the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the exchange. The Direxion ETF stands out because it's equal-weighted instead of market cap-weighted like many other Nasdaq ETFs. This means investments are spread virtually equally among all companies in the Nasdaq-100 instead of larger companies receiving more of the investment and having a larger influence on the movement of ETFs. Megacap tech stocks -- and the \"Magnificent Seven\" in particular -- make up the vast majority of the standard Nasdaq-100. In fact, the seven stocks ( Apple , Nvidia , Microsoft , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Alphabet , and Tesla ) account for over 45% of the index. As they go, so goes the index, for better or worse. ^NDX data by YCharts . Percentages from Jan. 1 to April 7. This ETF relies less on the tech sector's performance With a handful of tech stocks making up a large chunk of the Nasdaq-100, it's no surprise that the tech sector is heavily represented in the index. Tech is still the largest sector in the equal-weight ETF, but it's much less than with the standard index. Below are the sectors and how much they account for in each: Sector Percentage of Equal-Weight Nasdaq-100 Percentage of Standard Nasdaq-100 Information technology 40.65% 51.29% Communication services 9.98% 15.11% Consumer discretionary 12.01% 14.73% Consumer staples 7.09% 5.48% healthcare 10.15% 4.98% Industrials 10.96% 4.61% Materials 1.00% 1.27% Utilities 4.05% 1.24% Energy 2.10% 0.56% Financial 0.99% 0.54% Real estate 1.01% 0.19% Source: Direxion. Percentages as of Dec. 31, 2024. Story Continues The tech sector has been the most rewarding over the past couple of decades, but you never want to lose sight of the importance of diversification. Many other indexes, like the S&P 500 , are already tech-heavy at the top, so investing in the standard Nasdaq-100 could make your portfolio a little too tech-leaning. Tech stocks tend to do well when the economy is expanding. However, they can be a liability when the economy is in a downturn and recessions (or recession fears) lead investors to favor dividend and value stocks. This ETF gives you a bit of both. You still get exposure to big-name tech stocks and benefit from growth periods, but you also avoid overconcentration, and you cushion the potential blow of a tech industry stumble. A history of long-term returns This ETF hit the market in March 2012 and has produced good returns in the 13 years since. QQQE data by YCharts . Gray area represents a recession period. Averaging 11% annual returns over a 13-year period (outperforming the S&P 500 in that span) is impressive for a diversified ETF. By no means does this mean the ETF will continue at this pace, but it does show how being equal-weight focused doesn't take away from its growth potential. I wouldn't make the Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ETF the bulk of my portfolio, but it can be a good supplemental piece to help reduce concentration risk and give you exposure to the broader Nasdaq-100 index.

    "article_text": "Presented by le Wagon Five reasons to join the tech sector in Germany now Looking for a new career path? The booming AI and data industry is leading to more work opportunities for internationals in Germany. Published: Wed 9 Apr 2025 08:50 CEST 1 comment Germany's promising AI future is a career opportunity for internationals. Photo: Annie Spratt, Unsplash. While it is inevitable that new technologies like AI will take away some job roles, many more will be created. Tech skills, specifically those in AI, will be required in almost all sectors. People will not be replaced by AI but by those who know how to capitalise and utilise this new technology. The Wo rld Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report 2025 projects that automation, AI and data processing will see an increase of 78 million jobs by 2030. This presents an opportunity for those seeking a new career or looking to upskill, with skilled workers needed to fill these new jobs of the future. For internationals in Germany, taking an intensive course in AI and Data can provide the skills, education and experience to launch a new career. Germany is fast being recognised as a growing epicenter for AI in Europe. Major semiconductor and AI companies like TSMC, SAP and Infineon are establishing or growing their multibillion-euro facilities in the country. Meanwhile, Berlin, Munich and Hamburg are becoming global tech hubs, attracting investment and creating thousands of new job positions in tech fields. The AI sector in particular is undergoing impressive growth, with a 47 percent increase in AI-related job postings over the past year, according to recent studies by Bitkom. Here are five ways internationals in Germany can benefit from joining the tech sector. 1. A future-proof career Jobs and skills related to AI and technology are growing in demand according to LinkedIn . According to its Global Job Market Report, AI and data roles are projected to grow by 40 percent annually by 2027. While the German job market looks rocky, and finding a job as an international can be difficult, the tech industry is booming in Germany so a career in the fast-growing AI and data arena is an easy way to make a safe career choice. The sector is resilient, which means a job in tech offers long-term stability and professional growth. This is where specialty training providers in tech education, like Le Wagon , come in. Le Wagon is a globally number-one-rated bootcamp provider in the tech industry.

An exciting career in an innovative field Jobs in the tech industry are as varied and diverse as the ways in which new technologies permeate every corner of our lives. Many of the jobs of the future likely do not exist yet and cannot even be imagined. From creating something never before seen in robotics, to developing an algorithm to help the healthcare industry, the skills of workers in the tech industry will be needed for all kinds of jobs in the future.

Paul C. 2025/04/14 11:51 I would like to come to Germany with my kids as a tech worker who has 30+ years of experience in the US. However, I was told that as an older worker (over 55) I am now cut off from the public healthcare system. If I am going to be forced to have private insurance, I am disinclined to come over.

    "article_text": "( KRON ) — Following Meta’s closing down of Bay Area offices and thousands of tech layoffs since the start of 2025, uncertainty looms over the industry. KRON4 spoke to experts about how artificial intelligence is to blame and how workers can recover. However, the Bay Area tech industry has also experienced waves of layoffs and downsizing. Whether it’s Meta cutting three offices in Fremont or Oakland-based Block laying off 240 remote California employees or gamemaker Niantic , who just sold Pokemon Go for almost $4 billion, laying off 68 employees, the impact is felt throughout.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement No, a massive Tesla showroom is not opening in the East Bay Ahmed Banafa, an engineering professor at San Jose State University and tech expert, says this reset is alarming but also cyclic. “I know the future is here, I know technology is here, the next invention, the next ground zero for technology is here in Silicon Valley, but you have to be patient, you have to be ready,” Banafa said. “We have seen it in the 2000s, 2008; we have it after the pandemic; we have seen how many people lost their jobs — thousands and thousands of people because nobody knows the future.” The main culprit is artificial intelligence driving the industry’s economic success while also driving its workers out. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “It can turn against the people that created it and take their jobs. At the same time, it’s a cause for growth where companies say I will reduce the payroll, I will have the same output and without paying them that much money,” Banafa said. Combine A.I. and tariffs. Rob Enderle, who has spent 40 years in the tech industry and currently runs the Enderle Group, says the tech industry is now being hit by the perfect storm. “Companies kind of battering down the hatches to prepare for significant reduction of sales and your 401K is collapsing at the same time, that’s kind of your reserve so it puts people in a tremendous amount of stress,” Enderle said. Fake job seekers using AI reportedly flooding job market Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement So what’s next for tech workers who want to stay in the industry? “They can find a job either training AI or administrating or servicing; those will all be jobs that are much more secure,” Enderle said. “You have to be part of that technology because nobody is safe,” Banafa said.

    "article_text": "Share Speaking on the Schwab Network recently, well-known analyst Dan Ives advised investors with a time horizon of more than one year to buy Nvidia (NVDA) stock. Ives also weighed in on the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Apple (AAPL). Ives Remains Bullish on Nvidia’s Long-Term Outlook Despite His Worries About Tariffs Investors who can hold onto Nvidia’s shares for more than a year should buy the stock, Ives stated. Ives noted that he views NVDA as one of the best positioned names in the tech sector. The analyst remains upbeat on NVDA’s long-term outlook even though he’s quite bearish on the tech sector overall due to the tariffs. “The tariffs could take the tech industry back a decade,” the analyst stated. The Potential Impact of the Tariffs on AAPL If Apple’s iPhones are built in the U.S., they will cost $3,500, but if they are made in China, they will have a price tag of just $1,000, according to Ives. Additionally, he estimated that it would take AAPL three years to move just 10% of its supply chain to America, while it would have to spend $20 billion to accomplish the latter goal. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

What Happened: On Sunday, Dan Ives , an analyst from Wedbush Securities , warned that Trump’s tariffs could severely hinder the U.S. tech sector's growth. Ives underscored the long-term impact of the trade policies, stating, “Investors know math and the sad reality” — suggesting the U.S. tech industry could be set back by a decade if these tariffs remain in place. Trump’s reciprocal tariff strategy, which includes a 10% universal tariff on all imports and additional duties targeting countries like China, India, and the EU, sparked a massive sell-off in the stock market. See Also: Apple Making iPhones In America A Fantasy That Sounds Great ‘Behind The Microphones,' Says Top Analyst Dan Ives The S&P 500, which represents some of the largest companies in the U.S., lost $5 trillion in market value , with key companies in the tech sector suffering heavy losses. Their collective market cap erosion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META ), Nvidia Corp. (NASAQ: NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) amounted to a staggering $1.8 trillion, with Apple losing $534 billion alone. Company Stock Price On Wednesday ($) Shares Outstanding (Billion) Stock Price On Friday ($) Market Cap on Wednesday (Billion $) Market Cap on Friday (Billion $) Erosion (Billion $) Apple 223.89 15.04 188.38 3367.31 2833.24 534.07 Microsoft 382.14 7.43 359.84 2839.30 2673.61 165.69 Amazon 196.01 10.6 171.00 2077.71 1812.60 265.11 Alphabet A 157.04 5.83 145.60 915.54 848.85 66.70 Alphabet C 158.86 5.50 147.74 873.73 812.57 61.16 Meta 583.93 2.19 504.73 1278.81 1105.36 173.45 Nvidia 110.42 24.4 94.31 2694.25 2301.16 393.08 Tesla 282.76 3.22 239.43 910.49 770.96 139.52 Why It Matters: The tariffs have far-reaching consequences, especially for the U.S. tech sector, which relies heavily on global supply chains. Apple, for example, could see the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max soar from $1,599 to around $2,300 , according to industry analysts. Furthermore, the tariffs could push tech companies to reconsider their operations and manufacturing locations. While the U.S. government is betting on reshoring jobs, the increasing cost of labor and the slow pace of manufacturing build-outs could mean limited job growth, particularly with increasing automation. Ives previously pointed out that tech earnings would likely decline by 15% , and the price of consumer electronics could rise by up to 50%, burdening American consumers. Despite a robust U.S. labor market that added 228,000 jobs in March , escalating trade tensions have cast a shadow over the positive economic momentum. Comparisons to the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 — which deepened the Great Depression — are fueling concerns about the broader global economic outlook.

Report us Related Topics Israel high-tech Technology Jobs Economy Some 8,300 high-tech workers have relocated from Israel in the year and a half since the October 7 Hamas massacre and the ensuing war, accounting for 2.1% of the industry’s workforce, according to a survey published Monday by the Employment Service. The survey also revealed that Israeli tech firms now employ approximately 440,000 people abroad in 2025, compared to 400,000 employed within Israel. 2 View gallery ( Photo: Shutterstock ) The data on \"long-term relocation\" is based on border control records from the Population and Immigration Authority and reflects a trend linked to growing political and security instability. The findings point to stagnation in high-tech employment since 2022, with an increasing number of workers choosing to relocate. Unlike previous years—when the tech industry consistently outpaced other sectors in growth—this past year saw high-tech expand at a similar rate to the broader economy.

The situation is even more stark in publicly traded Israeli tech firms. Out of 260,000 employees at companies such as Check Point, NICE and Wix, only 60,000 are based in Israel. In addition, 4,500 new hires for R&D positions were made abroad. 2 View gallery Check Point offices in Tel Aviv ( Photo: Shutterstock ) The Israel Innovation Authority noted that the high-tech job market has been stagnant since 2022, despite a shortage of approximately 17,000 skilled workers. For the first time in over a decade of steady growth, the number of employees in the industry has dropped by 5,000 this year. Non-technical roles have seen an even steeper decline. The authority warned that the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to significantly impact employment levels in the sector. It called on the government, private industry and academic institutions to prepare for the changes ahead. << Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram >> Comments New comment The commenter agrees to the privacy policy of Ynet News and agrees not to submit comments that violate the terms of use , including incitement, libel and expressions that exceed the accepted norms of freedom of speech. send comment \" \""

Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently sat down with podcaster Raj Shamani for his podcast ‘Figuring Out’ and shared his views on India’s entrepreneurship boom and why the country is becoming a global talent hub. Bill Gates also praised the innovations being done in India with great talent and frugal solutions.(File/AFP) Gates advised the young minds in India to travel more and see the places where the less privileged live. “You can travel and see people who don't have the same opportunities. They're smart, but their school's not good, or they have health problems,” he said. He also praised the innovations being done in India with great talent and frugal solutions. Giving the example of digital public infrastructure, he said that India is leading with initiatives such as “Aadhaar”. Bill Gates’ kids to get 1% inheritance During the conversation, Bill Gates also discussed his views on inheritance and giving money to kids. He said that when it comes to his kids, they have been provided with a great upbringing and academic opportunities, but will get “less than 1 per cent of the wealth.” Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda , have three children - Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe Gates. He also emphasised the need for his kids to make their own efforts and not be dependent on his fortunes. “I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success and not be overshadowed by the incredible luck and good fortune I had”, he said in the podcast. Bill Gates on tech sector and philanthropy Gates also noted that people who have made fortunes from technology are less dynastic and more philanthropic. “The tech sector is probably the most aggressive about giving most of it away,” he said. Talking about his love for philanthropy, he also explained why it's important to teach kids about philanthropy early on. He said that parents need to tell them they will be given incredible opportunities, but the resources will go back to the neediest through the foundation. “You don’t want your kids to ever be confused about your support for them and your love for them”, said Gates. In his view, the young generation is also pushing for parents to be more philanthropic now. His kids have seen the work his philanthropic foundation does and are very proud of it, he said.

As US markets stagger under the weight of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer isn’t mincing words. Speaking at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration, Ballmer warned that both consumers and investors will feel the sting of trade restrictions on imports from more than 100 countries. “As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good,” he told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. Yet amid the economic turbulence, Ballmer sees a long-term play.

Referencing mounting global pressures and a potentially weakening economy, Ballmer stressed a longer-term approach. “Whether it's going to be a down economy, whether it's going to be pressure from governments around the world. If you take a long-term view, don't worry so much about the short-term and short-term profits; serve your customers well. Serve the governments and cultures in which you serve well.

Now, with tariffs hitting over 100 countries, he anticipates more instability. “I took just enough economics in college to know that tariffs are actually going to bring some turmoil,” he noted. The impact is already visible in the tech sector. Microsoft’s stock closed down 3.5%, Apple tumbled 7.2%, Google slipped 3.4%, and Amazon dropped 4%. Broader indexes mirrored the decline, with the S&P 500 shedding 6% and the Nasdaq falling 5.8%. “People are feeling it, not just the stock market. People are going to feel it,” Ballmer said, underlining the widespread economic strain beyond Wall Street.

Speaking at a recent ILTV and Afeka Academic College of Engineering event , Simhon told ILTV that “there is no other country that has so many people employed in the high tech sector as in Israel.” He explained that the high-tech industry employs around 10% of Israel’s workforce and contributes approximately 15% of the country’s GDP. “It provides a lot of tax revenue, lots of foreign currency, and also a kind of clout, because many countries look at us and say we want to be that way,” Simhon said.

The Details: China said it intends to impose a 34% tariff on all U.S. imports starting on April 10 and has tightened export controls on rare earth minerals critical for high-tech industries. Global financial markets have tumbled and all major U.S. indexes were deeply red for a second day amid the escalating trade war with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) down 2.83% and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ) down 2.99% in early trading. Read Next: Trump Slaps 25% Tariffs On Autos: What It Means For Your Next Car Purchase Expert Ideas: Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives on Friday described Trump's tariffs as a \"bad science experiment that in the process will cause an economic Armageddon in our view and crush the tech trade, AI Revolution theme, and overall industry in the process.\" If the tariffs go into effect in their current form, tech company earnings will decline by 15% and the price of all electronics could go up by 40% to 50% for consumers, Ives predicted. He warned that the U.S. tech industry would be set back by a decade while \"China steam rolls ahead.\" Ives pointed to build-out times of four to five years for a manufacturing facility in the U.S., the high cost of labor and a lack of highly-skilled workers as factors that would lead to the \"crushing\" of the U.S. tech industry. The Wedbush analyst closed the note with a glimmer of hope that negotiations may be able to stop the \"self-inflicted debacle of epic proportions\" of the current tariff environment. \"We assume tariff negotiations start now otherwise dark days are ahead for tech…and US consumers pay the price for this..not a debate,\" Ives wrote. China's finance ministry also called for trade discussions Friday morning, which could \"resolve trade differences through consultation in an equal, respectful and mutually beneficial manner.\" President Trump took to Truth Social with a response that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” In a separate post , Trump said, “this is a great time to get rich” and his “policies will never change.” Read Next: Trump’s Tariffs Prompt China To Vow ‘Countermeasures’: Experts See Retaliation Likely Image: Shutterstock SPY SPDR S&P 500 $681.66 1.59 % Overview QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 $623.82 2.31 % Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Businessman Ashneer Grover reacted to union minister Piyush Goyal's remarks on Indian startups on Friday, saying politicians are the only people in the country who need a \"reality check\". Businessman Ashneer Grover (left) and Union minister Piyush Goyal.(File) Speaking at the Startup Mahakumbh 2025 in New Delhi on April 3, Goyal urged the startup community in India to shift their focus from grocery delivery and ice cream making to the high-tech sector, such as semiconductors. He also compared Indian startups with those in China, pointing out that “the other side” is working on “robotics, machine learning, 3D manufacturing, and next-generation factories.\" Reacting to Goyal's remarks, Ashneer Grover pointed out that startups in China also started with food delivery and subsequently turned towards technology.“The only people in India who need a ‘reality check’ are its politicians. Everyone else is living in the absolute reality of India,” Grover wrote on X. The former managing director of BharatPe also suggested that it may be time to change the public discourse in India from “history to science.” “China also had food delivery first and then evolved to deep tech. It’s great to aspire for what they’ve done - maybe time for politicians to aspire for 10%+ economic growth rate for 20 years flat before chiding today’s job creators. Maybe time to change ‘public discourse’ from history to science!” Grover added. Piyush Goyal's remark On Thursday, Piyush Goyal asked India's startup community to focus more on the tech sector, like semiconductors, machine learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) as compared to grocery delivery and ice cream making. Goyal argued that luxury consumer brands created by the children of billionaires aren't to be mistaken for real startups. \"Are we going to be happy being delivery boys and girls... Is that the destiny of India? This is not a startup, this is entrepreneurship... What the other side is doing -- robotics, machine learning, 3D manufacturing and next generation factories,\" Goyal said. Earlier today, Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha, in an X post, claimed that his company, which he also co-founded, has created almost 1.5 Lakh jobs and generated nearly “ ₹ 1,000+ Crores of tax contribution to the government per year.” “It is easy to criticise consumer internet startups in India, especially when you compare them to the deep technical excellence being built in US/China…\" he said.

This marked the most severe single-day decline for tech stocks in over five years. What Happened : The sharp fall triggered widespread apprehension regarding the future of the tech sector. Dan Ives , the Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, spoke to CNBC and linked the market’s downfall to the proposed tariffs and their potential effects on global supply chains and consumer costs. The tech sector, traditionally a favorite among investors, found itself in a vulnerable position due to fears of economic disruption. Ives characterized the situation as “essentially an economic Armageddon” if the current tariff proposals, which could impose a 54% duty on Chinese imports, are not revised. Companies with significant exposure to China, such as Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and various semiconductor firms, bore the brunt of the sell-off. The Magnificent Seven stocks saw a collective market cap loss of over $1 trillion on Thursday. Ives underscored the unprecedented uncertainty that has gripped the market, stating, “This is as nervous as I’ve seen investors since Covid March 2020.” In the run-up to upcoming earnings calls, Ives identified three key factors for investors to watch: Firstly, the future of the tariffs is uncertain. Economic Advisor Peter Navarro hinted at possible negotiations, but if the tariffs remain, Ives warned they could reduce demand by 15–20% due to rising costs. Second, the lack of clear guidance from companies due to the ‘head-scratching nature of the tariffs’ could exacerbate market jitters. Finally, Ives pointed to specific areas of focus: the AI revolution, data center buildouts, and consumer-facing products like the iPhone. See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin Dump On Tariff News – Benzinga Why It Matters : Dan Ives is usually bullish on the potential for technology, however, he has turned cautious as the proposed tariffs, aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing, could instead disrupt supply chains that have been fine-tuned over decades. Ives highlighted the gap between policy statements and real-world challenges, warning that moving production entirely to the U.S. could significantly raise costs for tech giants like Apple. \"Talking in front of a microphone in the 202 area code is a lot different than the reality of moving the supply chain.\" Despite the current market upheaval, Ives maintains a cautious optimism for the long term, advising investors to look beyond the immediate chaos and consider potential buys if tariff fears ease. \"You have to look on the other side, assuming some sort of normalized earnings into 2025 and even 2026,\" he advised, naming Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple as potential buys if tariff fears subside. Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VGT ) dropped 7.24%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLK ) fell 6.82% on Thursday.

    "article_text": "Europe’s tech industry is bracing for impact after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs yesterday. The US slapped a 20% tariff on imports from the EU — twice the rate for the UK. Switzerland fared even worse, receiving a hefty 32% levy. Several European tech firms, investors , and analysts told TNW that the measures could disrupt supply chains, force pricing adjustments, and stem the flow of transatlantic VC capital — plunging European tech companies big and small into uncertainty. “Trump’s trade tariffs will have a huge impact on the global tech landscape, forcing startups to reconsider their headquarters and assess alternative markets,” said Louis Fearn, principal and sustainability lead at InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover. For companies with hardware-dependent models, the tariffs represent a major cost challenge. Miika Mäkitalo, CEO of Finnish firm HappyOrNot, which makes customer feedback terminals, noted that nearly half of the company’s business is across the pond. He said the tariffs might force the firm to consider “initiating assembly and production in the United States.” The 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! Although the tariffs only apply to physical goods, service-based startups will also feel the impact. Benjamin Avraham, founder and CEO of Swiss fintech Okoora, said there are many “secondary effects” that will harm the “smaller startup community” indirectly. These include changes in supply chains, barriers to VC investments, and increased volatility in exchange rates. Software could also suffer from additional constraints. Amanda Brock, CEO at open-source lobby group OpenUK, said that while software has long been characterised as an intangible service, it “may be subject to other trade restrictions.” The fallout has already begun. Trump’s tariffs have sent markets into disarray and risk compounding existing tensions in global trade. Stocks have plunged around the world and countries have promised retaliatory measures. “The newly announced blanket tariffs by President Trump create more uncertainty in the global tech industry,” said Martin Hartley, Group CCO of international tech consultancy Emagine. “These measures could make businesses in the EU avoid the US altogether to sidestep additional costs.” For European startups, the tariffs may force a stark strategic choice. “Trump is playing with fire,” warned Matt Penneycard, partner at UK-based Ada Ventures. “Startups selling to US customers now face two options: anchor in Europe and embrace its stability, or find ways to maintain access to the States by setting up operations there.” He added that this moment could be an opportunity for Europe. “As the US becomes a tougher place to operate, top talent may follow stability — this is Europe’s moment to build a new Silicon Valley.” European startups are the heartbeat of TNW Conference , which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

The industry fears that major constraints on skilled immigration would hold back innovation, he says. Play Listen Now Save Share Download Getty Images Subscribe: Apple Spotify Amazon RSS Registration for the H-1B visa lottery closed last week. The tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of this program for specialized workers. But uncertainty has been spreading due to the Donald Trump administration’s restrictive stance on immigration policy. Even legal immigrants have felt the crackdown. It’s led some companies to advise their H-1B holders not to leave the country for fear that they could be barred from returning. Gerrit De Vynck delved into the risks to the visa program for The Washington Post. He told Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino about anxiety in Silicon Valley over a potential loss of talent and brake on innovation, as well as the impact on tech workers’ lives. Gerrit De Vynck: There’s a set number of H-1Bs that can be awarded every year. It’s around 65,000, and so people apply through immigration lawyers. Generally, if you work at a company, the company kind of handles that for you, and some of them get these visas. So yeah, Amazon is the biggest right now, but companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, they also, every single year, apply for hundreds or thousands of H-1B visas for their workers. Meghan McCarty Carino: And then on the list, there are some companies that are not exactly household names, but are sort of contracting companies that also feed into the tech industry, right? De Vynck: Yeah, I mean, this is another really important part of the H-1B system, and the most controversial part, I would say. There’s these large IT consulting companies, so these are companies that if businesses don’t want to have their own IT staff, they might contract it out to these companies. And they also apply for a lot of H-1B visas for their workers. These companies are not always based in Silicon Valley or sort of in the San Francisco Bay Area. A lot of them are actually based in Texas and form a big part of the skilled economy in places like Houston and Dallas. And the reason that those companies are a bit more controversial is because people have this sort of stereotype that the H-1B is being used for workers, particularly from India, to come to the United States, get these jobs at salaries that are below what American workers might be willing to work for. And so people see these companies as using the H-1B to undercut American workers. And I think these companies and even the workers who work for them would push back pretty strongly against that and say, these salaries are still really good, especially if you are coming from another country. A lot of these salaries are definitely in the range of $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year. And maybe, if you live in a place like Texas, that is a solid salary that I think a lot of Americans would agree with. And so that’s kind of the other side of the H-1B. And there have been reports over the years, there’s been journalistic organizations that have, have sort of gone out and shown that some of these companies have committed, or at least, sort of fudged some of their applications. And so I think that also leads into this conversation where a lot of people, regardless of how they feel politically about immigration, they do think that this system needs to be reformed in some way, that even if they want to continue having skilled workers coming into the United States being able to stay and work here, they need to change the way that the H-1B system works in some way. But of course, there isn’t agreement on what exactly to do about that. McCarty Carino: As you noted, H-1Bs are awarded through a lottery system. The registration for it just closed. What do we know about how the Trump administration might handle the awarding of H-1Bs? De Vynck: I mean, this is a huge question that is really hanging over the entire community of immigrants in the United States, not just those who work in tech. But then you have some other people, such as Elon Musk or other members of the tech industry that are now close to Trump, who say, “No, some of us are immigrants. We work with immigrants, and skilled visas like the H-1B are really important,” because when a tech company needs to grow really quickly, say they’ve got a great idea, they’re building something in AI, they’re raising a bunch of money, and they can’t just slowly hire people over many years, they need to go from zero to 100 very quickly. Being able to access those talent pools from other countries is very important to them, and so we’ve seen this debate flare up amidst Trump’s key supporters several times over the last several months, and there is not yet consensus on what the administration is going to do when it comes to skilled workers in tech. McCarty Carino: President Trump’s relationship with the tech industry is very different now than it was during his first term. But remind us what the Trump administration’s approach was to H-1Bs during that first term. De Vynck: During his first administration, Trump did say he wanted to get rid of the program. He caused a lot of concern, a lot of panic. And for people who were renewing their H-1B or applying for new H-1Bs, there was definitely a slowdown in processing times. There was also an increase in rejections. There was an increase in the government saying, hey, you need to send me more information before I can give you this visa. But overall, the program itself was not dismantled. It stayed in place despite some of the rhetoric. There was no major disruptions to the H-1B program during the first Trump administration. And so I think a lot of people going into the second Trump administration thought that even if there was some anti-immigration rhetoric, they probably wouldn’t really, at the end of the day, touch the program. And I think people are rethinking that now that the second Trump administration is moving a lot more decisively and aggressively on a lot of the things that maybe in the first Trump administration they kind of left in the realm of rhetoric. And I think people are particularly concerned about Trump’s goal to end birthright citizenship in United States because a lot of people on H-1Bs are married to someone on H-1B who maybe they either met in the United States, or maybe they came over to the United States together as a couple. And usually when people like that have children, they’re born in the United States, they automatically become American citizens. And there are even cases of people whose children grow up and then apply for their parents to become citizens, even though their parents have been waiting for a green card for many, many years and have been working and contributing to the United States. And now, if Trump succeeds in changing the definition and ending birthright citizenship in America, those children will no longer be citizens when they’re born. And that’s something that really scares and concerns people on these visas. McCarty Carino: And as you noted in the story , there has been this broader crackdown on legal immigrants, many of them student visa holders, also green card holders, permanent residents who have been detained by the administration often over kind of ties to the protests over the war in Gaza. But I mean, how is this kind of broader environment affecting perceptions of the U.S. and kind of the, the uncertainty over legal immigration? De Vynck: I mean, I think people are looking at the United States in a way that they maybe didn’t before. I think immigrating to the United States has always been difficult. I mean, there’s a lot of forms, to qualify for an H-1B you have to be a pretty impressive person. A lot of people want to work at Google, want to work at Apple, and very few people actually get those jobs. And so I think a lot of people who are working in Silicon Valley in H-1Bs are very proud of themselves. They maybe were the top of their class in their country of origin. They found a place at an American university, and then they were able to sort of leverage that into getting one of these jobs. And so they really see themselves as living the American dream. They see themselves as contributing to America. They see themselves as building a life here. Of course, some do return to their countries, but most of the people that I’ve experienced and talked to in the tech industry on these visas, they intend to stay in America. And, of course, they still have family back home. They would travel for weddings, for funerals, for vacations, and now their lawyers are telling them, don’t leave the country because we can’t guarantee that you will be allowed back in even though you have an approved visa. And so that is really changing the way people feel and think. And I think it will dissuade some people from choosing this path to come to America. They may choose to go to other countries such as Australia or the UK or Canada instead. That said, though, I still think that the U.S. is seen as this beacon of a place where you can build a life, you can make a lot of money, you can participate in some of the most exciting things going on in the world, especially if you are a technical person. And so I don’t think that we’re going to necessarily see a huge dropoff in the amount of people who want to apply for these visas and just throwing up their hands and saying, “Sorry, America is not for me.” They will continue to run the gauntlet and see if they can find a place here up until the program is ended, if that does happen. McCarty Carino: Should the number of H-1Bs be significantly reduced, what are the implications for innovation and for U.S. competitiveness in technology? De Vynck: When you talk to people in the tech industry, I mean, whether they’re on visas or not, they definitely are concerned about that. I mean, talent is a huge driving force of innovation. And if you look at American universities, a lot of the people graduating are foreign students, are people who are not citizens and are going to be looking for visas. So I do think there is a real concern in the tech industry that if there is a major change to the status quo when it comes to skilled immigration, that the United States, at least in the short term, will not be able to make up for that and will sort of slow down when it comes to innovation.

    "article_text": "How Much Further Can the \"Magnificent Seven\" Fall? Here's What History Suggests. Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool April 2, 2025 4 min read NVDA COMP GOOG MSFT AMZN Just weeks after approaching its all-time high, the Nasdaq Composite is tumbling. As of Tuesday morning, the tech-heavy index was down by about 15% from its peak, putting it well into correction territory. Concerns about new tariffs, weakening consumer sentiment, geopolitical tensions, and a stock market that was already trading at lofty valuations have investors playing defense, selling stocks, and wondering how long this pullback will last. The members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- the much-watched group of tech megacaps comprised of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- have almost all fallen even further. Those giants are down by an average of 25% from their 2025 peaks. Only one has fallen less than the Nasdaq -- Apple. MSFT data by YCharts. Why the Magnificent Seven is getting hit harder than the overall tech sector In a market-wide sell-off, it's often the growth stocks that enter the correction carrying lofty valuations that get hit the hardest. Those tend to be the stocks that were among the biggest winners in the preceding bull market, and investors' fears around a weakening economy and a bear market tend to prompt profit-taking. Additionally, those big gainers often have cyclical exposure, and when the macroeconomic headwinds start to pick up, they are apt to be viewed as having become overvalued. While investors have grouped these seven tech stocks together due to their massive sizes and influence on the market as a whole, their businesses are quite different from one another, and they mostly operate in different subsectors of the tech industry. Therefore, they have differing levels of sensitivity to things like tariffs or inflation. As this correction progresses, it makes sense to look back on recent history to see what investors should expect. What history shows about stock market sell-offs and the Magnificent Seven The last major sell-off in the tech sector and the broad market came in 2022 after the economic reopening sent a number of tech stocks plunging as investors realized that factors that supported their excess growth through the pandemic were temporary. Revenue slowed dramatically at a number of big tech companies, including Amazon, which saw its e-commerce and cloud computing business fade, and Alphabet and Meta Platforms, whose digital advertising businesses decelerated as consumers shifted more of their shopping back to brick-and-mortar commerce and brand owners slashed their marketing budgets in fear of a potential recession. Story Continues The Magnificent Seven stocks all fell sharply during that period. MSFT data by YCharts. Four of them -- Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla -- saw tumbles of 50% or more at one point from where they were at the start of 2022, while Microsoft and Apple slid more than 25%, and Alphabet was down by more than 40%. Again, five of the seven had noticeably worse performances than the overall Nasdaq Composite, though that makes sense as these stocks were generally big gainers during the pandemic. The lesson for investors Any stock can head lower at any time. There's always room for the news to get worse, or for an unforeseen event to occur. In the current sell-off, it's certainly possible that any of the Magnificent Seven stocks could fall by 50% or more. If signs of a recession start to mount, a steeper market sell-off is likely, and it will worsen once the economic headwinds start showing up in earnings reports. However, the more important lesson to take away here isn't that bear markets can be deep. It's that elite companies almost always rebound from these temporary shocks. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks rebounded from their 2022 plunges to set all-time highs in 2023 and 2024, and as a whole, they greatly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite during those two years, paying off for investors who held on through the bear market. While it's nerve-wracking for investors to watch the value of their stocks continue to fall, broadly speaking, staying the course is the best action to take. No one knows how long this drawdown will go on nor how deep it will be at its nadir, but the shares of high-quality businesses are likely to return to new all-time highs in the next bull market and continue to reward long-term investors.

Maham Fatima March 31, 2025 4 min read EXFY We recently published a list of 13 Best Technology Penny Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Expensify Inc. (NASDAQ:EXFY) stands against other best technology penny stocks to buy right now. Marta Norton, the chief investment strategist at Empower, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on March 26 to express her bullish outlook on small caps and emphasize that the market’s short-term trajectory depends on upcoming tariff decisions. The question is whether tariffs are short-term and less disruptive negotiating tools, or a disruptive and longer-lasting precursor to a shift in global trade that could address the trade deficit, and create extra revenue for the federal government. Norton explained that tariffs initially affect earnings and are then followed by the companies’ attempts to pass increased costs to consumers. However, this usually doesn’t happen due to demand elasticity and the general nature of consumers. Sectors like tech show minimal earnings revisions despite the potential cost and revenue impacts that come from retaliatory measures. Norton advised investors to go for a balanced approach in 2025 and stated that there aren’t many areas where you can move in right now, but small caps are an exception to this sentiment. Small-cap stocks have transitioned from relatively cheap to absolutely cheap very recently. While small caps exhibit economic sensitivity, adding positions in them is relatively safer. Later, on March 29, Tony Wang, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, joined ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ on CNBC to talk about the volatility in tech, and whether it’s a time for heightened caution or not. Wang noted that this volatility is more likely a buying opportunity than not. He observed that growth and momentum in the tech sector have been high in the past few years. The tech sector in particular recently saw two years of strong growth. He thinks that valuations haven’t yet reached capitulation levels.

    "article_text": "Is Marqeta Inc. (MQ) the Best Technology Penny Stock to Buy Right Now? Maham Fatima March 31, 2025 4 min read MQ We recently published a list of 13 Best Technology Penny Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marqeta Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ) stands against other best technology penny stocks to buy right now. Marta Norton, the chief investment strategist at Empower, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on March 26 to express her bullish outlook on small caps and emphasize that the market’s short-term trajectory depends on upcoming tariff decisions. The question is whether tariffs are short-term and less disruptive negotiating tools, or a disruptive and longer-lasting precursor to a shift in global trade that could address the trade deficit, and create extra revenue for the federal government. Norton explained that tariffs initially affect earnings and are then followed by the companies’ attempts to pass increased costs to consumers. However, this usually doesn’t happen due to demand elasticity and the general nature of consumers. Sectors like tech show minimal earnings revisions despite the potential cost and revenue impacts that come from retaliatory measures. Norton advised investors to go for a balanced approach in 2025 and stated that there aren’t many areas where you can move in right now, but small caps are an exception to this sentiment. Small-cap stocks have transitioned from relatively cheap to absolutely cheap very recently. While small caps exhibit economic sensitivity, adding positions in them is relatively safer. Later, on March 29, Tony Wang, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, joined ‘Closing Bell Overtime’ on CNBC to talk about the volatility in tech, and whether it’s a time for heightened caution or not. Wang noted that this volatility is more likely a buying opportunity than not. He observed that growth and momentum in the tech sector have been high in the past few years. The tech sector in particular recently saw two years of strong growth. He thinks that valuations haven’t yet reached capitulation levels. Our Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top technology penny stocks that were trading under $5 as of March 28. We then selected the 13 technology stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

    "article_text": "There is an air of capitulation in financial markets ahead of the April 2nd reciprocal tariff announcement from the US. Global stocks are all in the red, the Eurostoxx 50 index is down by 1.7%, and all sectors are in the red. The biggest decline is for industrial stocks and consumer discretionary, followed by the financial sector. Reciprocal tariff fears are infecting the whole stock market, even defensive sectors like energy and utilities are lower at the start of the week, which is a sign that investors are cutting their positions sharply and choosing to pause ahead of this week’s tariff announcements. US stocks have also plunged at the open on Monday and the S&P 500 is now in correction territory, dipping 10% from its peak in mid- February. Tarif fears have deepened over the weekend, there has been no let up from President Trump who said that no country would be able to avoid his reciprocal tariffs. This dashed any hopes for a last-minute reprieve. There is no where to hide in the stock market, as equities get caught up in the tariff headwinds, which is not helped by the fact that it is the last trading day of Q1. Is Gold telling us that stocks have gone too far? It is worth noting that as the US trading session gets under way, the gold price is giving back some earlier gains. Although gold remains above $3,100 per ounce, it is giving back earlier gains. This could be a sign that the sell off is overdone. We will be watching to see if this is a sign that risk sentiment is recovering now that the S&P 500 has reached correction territory. A secular shift away from US equities Although today’s sell off appears to be indiscriminate, there could be some divergences in stock market performance in the coming weeks. The CFTC positioning data last week was enlightening about investor trends. There were further declines in the net long positions in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq last week, as investors further cut their exposure to the US. President Trump may be labeling April 2nd as liberation day; however, a protectionist US could find itself increasingly isolated on the world stage with few friends. This existential threat is causing investors to trim their exposures to the US. The $5 trillion that has been wiped off of the S&P 500 so far this year, could be a sign of a secular shift away from the US that may seep into Q2. This means that US stocks may continue to underperform European indices as we move through the year. The case for continued European outperformance For now, the selloff in European stocks has spared no one. German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall is one of the weakest performers on the Dax so far on Monday. There is no fundamental reason for Rheinmetall to sell off, as it is less exposed to US tariffs compared to other German companies. However, the fact that it has also joined in with the sell off suggests that the move in markets on Monday is partly down to stock traders reducing their exposure to risk ahead of Q2. It could also be a sign of panic in the markets, whereby stocks are being sold indiscriminately. We think that this is only a mild panic. We would look for a relief bounce if tariffs announced on Wednesday are not as bad as feared. However, because reciprocal tariffs are a big ‘known unknown’ risk for financial markets, we do not expect any recovery rally in risk assets until it is clear what the reciprocal tariffs are, and what products and countries will be impacted. European banks and finance stocks are taking a knock on Monday, however, this sector still rallied to a record high this year and has outperformed the US banking index for the first time in 12m months, as you can see below. This could be a sign that key European sectors will continue to outperform their US peers for the medium term. Chart 1: Eurostoxx finance index and the KBW US banks index, normalised to show how they move together over the past 12 months. Source: XTB and Bloomberg The tech sector The sell off in US stocks has been led by the tech sector. Netflix, Tesla, Meta and CrowdStrike are some of the weakest performers on the S&P 500 so far on Monday. Nvidia is down 5%, as it is exposed to tariffs on chip exports, particularly any tariffs that are applied to Taiwan, where TSMC, the manufacturer of Nvidia’s chips is based. Although TSMC has pledged hundreds of billions of investments into the US, at this stage it is not clear that is enough to get a tariff exemption from President Trump. If TSMC is excluded from tariffs later this week, then we could see a sharp reversal in Nvidia’s share price. For now, the tech sector is coming under intense pressure and is the second weakest sector on the S&P 500 at the start of the week. Although the US stock market sell off has lost some momentum as we move through Monday, without the tech sector, it is hard to see the S&P 500 bounce even after the sharp sell off in recent weeks.

    "article_text": "Bengaluru techie compares the skyrocketing rent prices to the contrasting salary hike. Bengaluru , often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in rent prices over the past few years. The city, home to a thriving tech industry, continues to attract professionals from across the country. However, as demand for housing rises, rental prices have also escalated, often outpacing the modest salary hikes that employees receive. The contrast between increasing living costs and relatively stagnant wage growth is becoming a growing concern for residents, especially those in the tech sector. In a recent tweet, Ray, a software engineer based in Bengaluru, humorously highlighted the struggle many are facing. He shared, \"Salary hike I received was 7.5%, meanwhile BLR landlord increased the rent by 10%. If this goes on, someday my rent will become more than salary.\" While salary hikes, particularly in the tech industry, are common, they often fail to keep up with the rising rent prices, leaving employees feeling the pressure of higher living expenses. Ray’s tweet captures the growing frustration of those trying to balance their income and accommodation costs in the city. Internet reacts A chartered accountant (CA) expressed their frustration, pointing out how salary growth feels insignificant compared to the sharp rise in living expenses. They highlighted that a 7.5% salary hike seems good until it’s overshadowed by increases in other costs such as electricity (12%), rent (10%), milk (15%), and ultimately a reduction in savings. The user called it not just inflation but \" lifestyle taxation without legislation,\" implying that someday, landlords might end up richer from employees’ salaries than the employees themselves. Other individuals shared similar sentiments, with one noting that getting a job in Bengaluru has become less and less profitable. Another pointed out that for many IT employees in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, nearly half their salary goes into paying rent, while the other half is consumed by taxes. A different chartered accountant also shared an optimistic perspective, noting that as one progresses in life and wealth, even a small percentage increase in income would be enough to handle the rising costs, provided their income or assets grow significantly.
