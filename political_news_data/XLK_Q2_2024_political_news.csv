Additionally, Core PCE is a key economic indicator the Federal Reserve uses to gauge inflation by measuring the average change in these consumer goods prices when excluding volatile items like food and energy. With Core PCE being the Fed's preferred inflationary measure, this reading optimistically cooled to a 0.1% uptick in May compared to a 0.3% increase in April. Year over year, Core PCE rose by 2.6% which Yahoo Finance points out was the slowest annual gain in three years. Although this is still above the Fed’s preferred target of a 2% annual inflation rate, May’s Core PCE data is a positive sign for the economy and stocks. Considering last month’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a cooler print as well, here are three stocks investors may want to consider on the prospects of a more favorable operating environment. Yahoo Finance Image Source: Yahoo Finance Nvidia NVDA Easing inflation is crucial to the tech sector regarding internal operating costs and the willingness of not only consumers but also businesses to spend on technology which in many instances can be deemed non-essential despite its clear importance. Perhaps broader spending on artificial intelligence continues to increase and keeps Nvidia’s stock attractive as the leader in producing AI chips. Tracking Nvidia’s performance since its 10-1 stock split on June 10, NVDA is only up +2% but had already more than doubled this year beforehand with a very positive trend of earnings estimate revisions suggesting more upside. Correlating with such, the chip giant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) amid what continues to be captivating growth on its top and bottom lines. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Amazon AMZN Outside of the tech sector, the obvious beneficiaries of a more stable inflationary environment are consumer retail-driven companies and no one stands out more in this regard than e-commerce giant Amazon. The market is suggesting this as well as Amazon’s stock spiked +10% this month and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with gains already at +27% for the year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bank of America BAC Although banks can benefit from a high inflationary environment higher loan volumes and net inflows from depsits look plausible in both commercial and consumer segments if reseeding PCE and better-than-expected CPI data were to continue. Story Continues Furthermore, one bank that excels in its use of technology and can benefit from the perceived notion of lower technology costs is Bank of America which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Bank of America’s attractive price tag may also interest investors as its stock costs less than many of the other big banks at just under $40 while its forward P/E of 12.1X is on par with most of its peers. While Bank of America has traded at sharper P/E discounts in the past it's noteworthy that earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 are slightly up over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BAC also has a 2.45% annual dividend yield that only trails Citigroup’s C 3.44% out of the big four domestic banks as this edges Wells Fargo’s WFC 2.44% and JPMorgan’s JPM 2.31%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Final Thought Rounding out Q2, reseeding core PCE is a good sign for businesses and the broader economy with Nvidia, Amazon, and Bank of America being three stocks to keep an eye on next quarter.

Bill Gates and Warren Buffett Team Up to Transform Nuclear Power Oil Price ^ | 06/27/2024 | Haley Zaremba Posted on 06/27/2024 9:14:55 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Bill Gates is pledging billions to promote next-generation nuclear power through TerraPower, focusing on innovations that could make nuclear a key player in global decarbonization. Increasing energy demands from the AI sector prompt tech leaders like Sam Altman and Bill Gates to advocate for nuclear power as a sustainable solution. Innovations in nuclear technology, including smaller, more standardized reactors, aim to reduce construction costs and compete with natural gas. Bill Gates is ready to sink billions into getting next-generation nuclear energy off the ground in the United States. The world’s sixth richest man has been a staunch nuclear supporter for years now, and has already sunk over a billion dollars of his own money into his innovative nuclear power start-up TerraPower LLC. But according to Gates, that cool billion is just the beginning. “I put in over a billion, and I’ll put in billions more,” Gates was recently quoted by Bloomberg. Nuclear power has been gaining traction around the globe as a viable option for national and private decarbonization strategies. Nuclear advocates argue that we can no longer afford to ignore nuclear’s immense clean energy potential, as it is a proven technology with plenty of existing infrastructure, legal precedent and huge output capacity. While it is not considered to be a renewable energy, nuclear energy emits zero carbon emissions and could be a key part of a viable pathway to meeting global emissions targets. Finding new ways to drum up a whole lot of clean energy output in a hurry has become increasingly urgent as the tech sector, and Artificial Intelligence in particular , suck up rapidly increasingly colossal amounts of energy.

Black and Indigenous people, non-permanent residents also facing big disparities, census data shows Sheena Goodyear · CBC Radio · Posted: Jun 21, 2024 6:34 PM EDT | Last Updated: June 21, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 6 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. A new report has found the pay gap between women in men in Canada's tech industry is only getting bigger. (Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock) Social Sharing As It Happens 6:45 The wage gap for women in Canada's tech sector is only getting worse: report When Viet Vu first calculated the gender pay gap for women in the Canadian tech industry, he was blown away. Despite recent efforts to boost equity and diversity in the field, the pay gap between men and women tripled over five years between 2015 and 2021, according to a new report from Toronto Metropolitan University. As of 2021, the average woman in the industry was making roughly $20,000 less than her male counterpart, up from $7,200 five years prior. ""I thought that I had made a coding error,"" Vu, the report's co-author, told As It Happens host Nil Köksal. ""I had to check the number again and again."" Vu is the acting director of The Dais, a public policy organization at the Toronto university behind the new report called "" Canada's Got Tech Talent ,"" which is based on Canadian Census data. While the report found increased representation for immigrants and racialized groups in Canada, it also found continued salary disparities for Black and Indigenous workers, several other visible minority groups, and non-permanent residents. Diversity initiatives are not enough The report found that, even when factoring in things such as switching jobs and having kids, the wage gap persisted. Marissa McNeelands, the chief executive and co-founder of women's tech collective Toast, says that proves the only viable explanation is that ""the people in power controlling salary decisions are letting women get paid less."" The findings did not come as a shock to Saadia Muzaffar, founder of TGC, a Canadian non-profit that advocates for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In fact, she says TGC's own data over the last seven years show the same pay disparity. And it's one that's even more stark for women who also belong to other marginalized identities, she said. ""What this shows us is that while we can roll out DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] initiatives and advocacy campaigns to address the skewed worker demographics in STEM, if these efforts are not firmly tethered to accountability measures … we will not make the progress we claim we want,"" Muzaffar told CBC in an email. Saadia Muzaffar, founder of TGC, a non-profit that advocates for women science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). (saadiam.com) By accountability measures, she means things like pay transparency, and strategies that focus not not just on hiring underrepresented people, but also keeping them around — and promoting them. ""DEI efforts can mean that experienced talent, particularly if they are immigrants, get brought into entry-level jobs and then get stuck there,"" she said. Muzaffar says the majority of women in STEM   — 52 per cent — are immigrants . But those same women face worse outcomes for employment and salary. ""Imagine our largest talent pool for in-demand innovation sector jobs, facing the worst outcomes across the board? A bad deal for all involved, including employers and the Canadian economy,"" she said. Immigrants, overall, make up 44 per cent of the tech industry, according to the report, and earn an average salary of $88,000, just slightly below non-immigrants at $89,800. But non-permanent residents, it found, are lagging at $52,000. Black, Indigenous people workers paid less When it comes to race, Vu says the picture becomes more complicated. ""If you look at the overall representation of the tech sector in employing people with visible minority identities, it's actually doing really great. There are more tech workers with visible minority identities who work in tech than outside of tech,"" he said. But, he says, there are stark differences within that broad category. With tech incubators bringing investment and inspiration, Black entrepreneurs feel they can 'change the world' Pay gap between men and women starts right out of the gate for college, university grads The report defines ""visible minority identities"" as South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean, and Japanese. Overall, workers in those groups made an average of $78,800 a year in Canada in 2021 compared with $93,000 for those not considered to be part of a visible minority group. Arab Canadian workers had an average salary of $98,581, more than any other group, including non-minorities. Japanese and Chinese Canadians were not far behind, at $92,082 and $91,525, respectively. Viet Vu is the acting director of the Dais, a public policy organization at Toronto Metropolitan University. (Submitted by Viet Vu) But Black workers, Vu said, ""are not doing so great in tech right now."" Black workers had an average salary of $70,955 in 2021. That's up from $63,000 in 2016, but still accounts for the largest pay gap among the identified minority groups. The average salary for an Indigenous person in tech was $72,000. That's $14,000 less than non-Indigenous tech workers. Indigenous people were also hugely underrepresented in the field. While 4.8 per cent of Canadians work in tech, only 1.4 per cent of Indigenous people in Canada have careers in the industry. What are the solutions? Vu says he hopes people don't take away from this report that tech is an industry for marginalized people to avoid, or that diversity initiatives are a waste of time. ""Often these initiatives are led by the people who are underrepresented themselves in the tech sector,"" he said. ""And quite frankly, they're always going to be outnumbered. And if we are to solve this example with a gender issue, men in the tech sector absolutely must play a crucial role."" Women-led startups get much less funding than men. Female investors hope to change that Video This Black mother-daughter team is being recognized for their contributions to tech These programs also need to be paired with practical measures, he said, like gender-blind parental benefits, and access to childcare. Putting in the work to narrow these gaps, he says, is well worth the effort. ""What I often tell men in the tech sector is: 'Guess what? You're losing out on an opportunity to work with some of the most brilliant minds in the country by basically making it such an alienating space,'"" he said. ""And so actually enjoying an inclusive workspace isn't actually about doing anyone any favour. It's actually creating opportunities."" With files from The Canadian Press.

Chipmakers fell, with Nvidia, Qualcomm, Micron Technology and On Semiconductor all moving lower. Gilead Sciences jumped after it announced tests of its HIV prevention drug proved 100% effective in tests on women. Major U.S. equities were mixed on Thursday as investors drew back from Nvidia ( NVDA ) and several other chipmakers to send the tech sector lower After briefly crossing the 5,500 level for the first time , the S&P 500 moved lower by 0.3% to step back from its record high. Nasdaq dropped lower by 0.8% on the tech turndown, while the Dow jumped 0.8%. Shares of Gilead Sciences ( GILD ) soared 8.5% after the company announced that tests of its HIV prevention drug proved 100% effective in women in trials. The results were so successful that an independent monitoring committee recommended expanding testing of the drug called “lenacapavir."" More trials are needed before it can apply for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, including testing on men. Consulting firm Accenture ( ACN ) stock was 7.3% higher after it reported a jump in bookings related to its artificial intelligence (AI) products. Accenture beat its profit expectations despite its revenue declining from its year-ago levels. Electronic equipment supplier Jabil ( JBL ) moved lower by more than 11.4% after company executives discussed softness in several of its markets during a call on its quarterly results. Jabil gets nearly a fifth of its revenue from Apple ( AAPL ), so its results can give investors an indicator of the iPhone maker’s performance. Several chipmakers declined amid a pullback in the tech sector , including a decline of more than 3% by Nvidia. Qualcomm ( QCOM ), Micron Technology ( MU ), Microchip Technology ( MCHP ) and Western Digital Corp ( WDC ) each dropped around 5%, while ON Semiconductor ( ON ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) moved lower by about 4%. While other tech firms struggled, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) jumped by more than 4% after Piper Sandler analysts moved the company to “top pick” status on the strength of its AI chip strategy.

Even when you've settled on a specific sector or industry, picking stocks within those can be tedious. Thankfully, you don't have to spend time researching and picking individual stocks; you could invest in an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) that provides broad exposure to the sector or industry you're interested in. The tech sector has often been the most popular part of the stock market -- and the most rewarding -- for investors over the past couple of decades. If you have $500 available to invest (meaning you have an emergency fund saved and high-interest debt paid down) and want exposure to some of the world's top tech companies , the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ 0.27% ) is a great option. Expand NASDAQ : QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Today's Change ( -0.27 %) $ -1.66 Current Price $ 621.57 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 617.52 - $ 622.72 52wk Range $ 402.39 - $ 637.01 Volume 45M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A A tech ETF in its own right The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF mirrors the Nasdaq-100 , an index that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Although it's not a pure tech ETF, the tech sector makes up around 59% of the fund and contains many of the world's most important tech companies. Here are the ETF's top 10 holdings, which include the "" Magnificent Seven "" (as of March 31). Microsoft : 8.75% Apple : 7.41% Nvidia : 6.32% Amazon : 5.25% Meta Platforms : 4.76% Broadcom : 4.44% Alphabet (Class A): 2.49% Alphabet (Class C): 2.42% Tesla : 2.37% Costco Wholesale : 2.35% The ETF is in a nice sweet spot -- not quite as broad as the Nasdaq Composite Index (which contains over 3,000 companies), but broad enough to cover virtually all areas of the tech industry. Its tech companies are involved in software, semiconductors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence , and dozens of other industries poised to drive growth. An inexpensive way to get exposure to top tech companies The ETF's expense ratio is 0.20%, which works out to $1 annually per $500 invested. It's not as cheap as some popular S&P 500 ETFs , which could have expense ratios as low as 0.03%, but it's still a lower-cost option than many other comparable ETFs. An ETF's expense ratio may seem like a small detail that can be ignored, but the smallest differences on paper can equal a decent amount of money in real life. For example, imagine you invest $500 monthly into two ETFs that average 10% annual returns over 20 years. Below is how your investment totals would differ between 0.20% and 0.40% expense ratios: Expense Ratio Amount Paid in Fees Ending Investment Total 0.20% $7,700 $335,900 0.40% $15,200 $328,400 Calculations by author. Figures rounded to the nearest hundred. Even a slight 0.20% difference equaled thousands more paid in fees over time. Don't overlook ETF expense ratios; they matter. The ETF has a history of market-beating results The ETF is up close to 1,000% since its March 1999 inception, with many of those gains coming in the last decade. In that span, it has considerably outperformed the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. A $500 investment at its inception would be worth close to $5,500 today. QQQ Total Return Level data by YCharts An ETF returning close to 19% in a single year is impressive in itself, but averaging that over a decade is a testament to the consistency and resilience of the companies leading the way. Past results don't guarantee future performance, but for the sake of illustration, let's assume the ETF averages more modest 15% annual returns over the next decade. A $500 investment now could be worth close to $2,000 after fees. You should never invest in a stock assuming you can predict its performance, because you can't.

TORONTO – The gender pay gap in Canada’s tech sector almost tripled between 2016 and 2021, amounting to the average salary of a woman in the industry being about $20,000 less than her male counterpart, according to a new report. The report called “Canada’s Got Tech Talent” was released Thursday by researchers at The Dais, a public policy organization based at Toronto Metropolitan University. Among the report’s key findings was data revealing the average female tech worker was making $71,400 in 2021 compared with $91,000 earned by their male counterpart. The numbers indicate the gender pay gap among tech workers has widened significantly since 2016, when men earned $7,200 more than women. A new study shows the gender pay gap in Canada's tech sector almost tripled between 2016 and 2021. A man walks though a downtown Toronto office building with other buildings reflected in a window in this June 11, 2019 photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graeme Roy Viet Vu, The Dais’s acting director of policy and research, said the increase surprised him given the attention that has been paid to equity, diversity and inclusion in recent years. While everything from pay associated with remote work to seniority can shape the gap, he said a “peculiar” trend also contributed to the figures. Vu said women in tech who were earning within the 60th to the 80th percentile, such as senior people who are not yet at the executive level, didn’t experience any wage growth over those five years. However, men in the same range saw their earnings jump and those in the higher groups received hourly wage increases of $15 more than women received. “This is a fascinating thing because we’ve controlled for so many of these usual suspects, whether that be a new child that arrived or also things like how often people switched jobs,” Vu said. Because the study controlled for all the common arguments Marissa McNeelands hears for why the gender pay gap still exists, the chief executive and co-founder of women’s tech collective Toast said the report proves “the people in power controlling salary decisions are letting women get paid less.” Her fellow co-founder April Hicke added the results also reflect how much “performative allyship” permeates the industry and the vast amount of work still to be done to bring parity to the sector. Women were not the only group of tech workers to experience a pay gap. When researchers looked at the earnings of visible-minority tech workers, they found those in the group made an average of $78,800 a year in Canada in 2021 compared with $93,000 for those not considered to be part of a visible minority group. The lowest paid were Black tech workers, who earned $70,955 on average, and Filipino workers who made $73,079. “For Black tech workers, this is a sad news story where we found that in 2016, the pay gap was about $16,000. Now it’s actually about $22,000,” Vu said. Arab tech workers, who had an average salary of $98,581, however, outearned even those not from visible minority groups. Looking at trends among Indigenous tech workers, researchers found the average salary was $14,000 less than non-Indigenous counterparts making $86,800. The research The Dais published is based on census data concluding Canadian tech workers earn $40,000 more per year than workers employed in other fields. However, those behind the study say Canadian tech workers still make 46 per cent less on average than Americans. The study also took a peek at capital gains among Canadian tech workers. The measure has been in the spotlight since April, when the federal government’s budget proposed increasing the “inclusion rate” from one-half to two-thirds for people who see more than $250,000 in capital gains in a year. The Dais’s research suggests the median Canadian tech worker has $84,000 in equity gross value that has not yet been sold and that 1,960 tech workers declared more than $250,000 in capital gains in 2021. Based on those numbers, the report said 0.20 per cent of tech workers would be affected by the change, compared with 0.15 per cent of non-tech workers. “A couple of percentage points change or even like a 10 to 20 per cent point change in the tax system is likely not going to fix that 50 per cent pay gap … with the States,” Vu said. The government estimated the increase would only impact the wealthiest 0.13 per cent and result in $19.3 billion in revenue over the next five years. However, the prominent members of the tech industry, including the leaders of Shopify Inc. have railed against the changes. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.

The veteran strategist warned of a veteran backdrop for stocks. The market could see its first ""crack on the ice"" in the tech sector, he warned. The stock market is in for a correction, as a trio of unfavorable factors will weigh on equity prices, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research. The Wall Street veteran pointed to the strong performance of stocks so far this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% in 2024. However, the benchmark index is poised to dip 5% , he predicted, thanks to the bearish setup in interest rates, inflation, and stock valuations. Inflation is declining but is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, leading central bankers to project just one rate cut by the end of the year. Higher rates have triggered the longest-ever inversion of the 2-10 Treasury yield curve , the bond market's famous gauge of a coming recession. The indicator, which flashes when the 2-year yield surpasses the 10-year yield, has been a reliable recession signal throughout history, and economists have said that this time likely won't be different. Stock valuations are also high by historical standards, which hints at future downside. The S&P 500 is priced at a 32% premium compared to its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last 20 years, Stovall noted. Tech stocks, which have dominated the market in recent years, are trading at a 68% premium. ""I think we're really stretched and we got to see some upward revisions to earnings estimates, I think, in order to justify that,"" Stovall said in a recent interview with CNBC . Stocks could see their first ""crack in the ice"" in the tech sector, he added, pointing to lofty valuations among mega-cap tech stocks. ""It's only been tech that's been outperforming the market. I sort of feel this is a jumbo jet that's flying on one engine, and you wonder how long it will stay aloft,"" he warned. Other forecasters have warned of limited upside to the market as stocks — particularly tech stocks — continue to climb higher. According to one valuation metric, the stock market looks to be the most overvalued since 1929, which could pave the way to a steep correction , elite investor John Hussman warned.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/19/adobe-broadcom-tech-sector-buy-growth-stock/,,Adobe and Broadcom Results Look Like Great News for the Rest of the Tech Sector,20240619T123000Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780779/gettyimages-1289228163-1200x675-128554e.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"The current technology sector rally has been largely driven by Apple , Microsoft , and the semiconductor industry. Broadly speaking, the software industry has been lagging behind. However, Adobe 's ( ADBE +1.33% ) latest quarterly results show that its artificial intelligence (AI) investments are paying off. Meanwhile, Broadcom ( AVGO 1.79% ) is on track to generate over $50 billion in revenue this fiscal year -- a milestone for the chip company. And the things that are going right for Adobe and Broadcom show why the technology sector deserves its premium valuation. Image source: Getty Images. Adobe is justifying increased AI spending After releasing downbeat full-year guidance in its fiscal first-quarter report , Adobe surprised investors by raising its guidance after delivering blowout fiscal second-quarter earnings. For the period, which ended May 31, the company announced solid results across its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud segments, especially with enterprise customers. Adobe and other enterprise software companies have been investing heavily in AI . But so far, their results haven't been that great. Salesforce shares fell hard after it published its latest quarterly report, which showed growth stalling as its expenses mounted. Adobe's latest report changed the narrative for enterprise software companies and proved that these investments can pay off in time. However, Adobe's growth is still far from rapid. Its updated fiscal 2024 guidance calls for $21.40 billion to $21.50 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $18 to $18.20. For context, in its fiscal 2023, it brought in $19.41 billion in revenue and $16.07 in non-GAAP EPS. If it hits the midpoint of its guidance ranges, that will amount to just 10.5% revenue growth and 12.6% EPS growth. There's an old saying: ""When there's a gold rush, sell picks and shovels."" That advice certainly applies in the tech sector right now. There are more reliable profits to be made in selling tools to the prospectors than there are in digging for gold. In this case, it's easier to mint cash by selling high-powered chips to power AI systems than it is to get rich with AI services. Adobe and its software peers are pouring money into AI investments in the hope of striking gold. Adobe's innovative product developments and improving financials indicate that it is on the right track, but it is still far from striking gold with AI. Expand NASDAQ : ADBE Adobe Today's Change ( 1.33 %) $ 4.37 Current Price $ 333.22 Key Data Points Market Cap $138B Day's Range $ 329.13 - $ 334.00 52wk Range $ 323.03 - $ 557.90 Volume 2.8M Avg Vol 4.3M Gross Margin 88.43 % Dividend Yield N/A Despite a four-fold surge in three years, Broadcom isn't overpriced Broadcom is a perfect example of the power of a ""pick-and-shovel model"" during a gold rush. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ended May 5), Broadcom's revenue hit a record $12.49 billion, $3.1 billion of which was related to AI products. For its full fiscal year, Broadcom is guiding for $51 billion in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $31.1 billion. In its fiscal 2023, it brought in $35.8 billion in revenue -- so it's projecting a top-line increase of 42.4%. However, a lot of that is due to its $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which it completed in November. The infrastructure and software solutions company has seen its market cap more than quadruple over the last three years to more than $800 billion. That makes Broadcom the ninth most valuable company in the S&P 500 -- behind Eli Lilly and ahead of JPMorgan Chase . Even after that run-up, Broadcom isn't a terribly expensive stock. Analysts' consensus estimates for its EPS are $47.30 for its fiscal 2024 and $58.87 for its fiscal 2025. That gives it a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.5 for fiscal 2025. That's not a bad price for a stock that is up a ton over a short period of time. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Broadcom's results could fall badly short of expectations if client spending slows. Broadcom has announced a 10-for-1 stock split that is scheduled to take effect on July 15. Companies' share prices often pop following splits -- case and point, leading AI chipmaker Nvidia surged shortly after its recent split. Broadcom's stock split will allow investors to buy a full share for around a tenth of the $1,735 that it currently trades for, which will make the stock more liquid, and more accessible to small investors who might not have access to fractional share trading. Still, investing in a company just because it is splitting its stock is a bad idea. A split does nothing to fundamentally change the value of the underlying business. However, Broadcom's strong results and guidance are important for the wider tech sector because they showcase the depth and breadth of AI-driven value creation. The company's Ethernet networking switches and AI accelerators for hyperscale customers are driving its AI revenue -- which is now expected to be $11 billion in fiscal 2024. That's more than the entire company's top line less than a decade ago. Broadcom makes tons of storage and system products, wireless and wired connectivity solutions, fiber optic solutions, cable modems, software and cybersecurity products, and more. Its broad-based portfolio of semiconductor and infrastructure solutions makes it a good bellwether for the broader industry -- perhaps an even better one than Nvidia. So when Broadcom's core business and AI growth are both doing well, it's a great sign that conditions are strong across the semiconductor industry. Expand NASDAQ : AVGO Broadcom Today's Change ( -1.79 %) $ -6.43 Current Price $ 351.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $1692B Day's Range $ 349.67 - $ 361.88 52wk Range $ 138.10 - $ 386.48 Volume 16M Avg Vol 23M Gross Margin 63.13 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % The best way to approach the tech sector The tech sector is one of the most uniquely diversified sectors in the market. There are the integrated majors like Apple and Microsoft. Then there are the software giants, cloud infrastructure companies, semiconductor designers and manufacturers, electronic parts and components suppliers, and more. Which of those subgroups is leading the way for the sector can change based on myriad factors, such as valuation, growth, or the cyclicality of the business cycle. Now that the semiconductor industry has rallied so much in such a short period of time, some investors may be inclined to sell tech stocks in search of other opportunities. But some pockets of the sector, like enterprise software, have lagged behind, and they still have the opportunity to make up that ground. Instead of betting on a particular tech industry segment or company, some investors may prefer to put their money into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF . Its expense ratio is just 0.1% and it provides diversified exposure to the entire sector , so it's a low-cost way to bet on a sustained gold rush in AI rather than choosing a particular supplier of ""picks and shovels"" like Broadcom or a specific ""miner"" like Adobe. Ultimately, the sector's performance heavily depends on Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia since they all sport market caps over $3 trillion. Strong results and upbeat guidance from industry leaders like Adobe and Broadcom indicate that the sector isn't overextended and could still be a good value. Aside from buying an ETF, the best way to approach the tech sector is by investing in companies you believe can compound their earnings growth over the long term rather than beat expectations for a quarter or two. The higher the expectations built into a stock's price, the more room there is for disappointment to send it tumbling. Maintaining a time horizon of at least three to five years will help ensure your priorities align with an investment thesis rather than getting too caught up in the market's noise."

The sector’s contribution to GDP in the fiscal quarter ending June is projected to be just Rs258.3 billion. Based on the report’s analysis of data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the sector’s GDP contribution is projected to decline by 3.02 per cent in FY2023-24 overall. This is the second consecutive fiscal year the sector has contracted. Notably, the drop is much sharper this year after a more modest 0.8 per cent fall off in FY2022-23. This decline comes after a decade as the fastest growing broad sector in the economy, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of over 6.0 per cent between FY2014-15 and FY2023-24. Often used as a proxy for the tech sector, information and communications also includes telecommunications and broadcasting and publishing. According to the report, the current slowdown extends to tech as well -- with ICT exports rising by just 2.5 per cent in 2023 to $2.72 billion. This is the slowest rate of increase since 2015 and the second year in a row ICT exports growth has been in the single digits. Pakistan’s ICT exports also remain highly concentrated, with the UAE and US accounting for almost 74 per cent of the country’s ICT exports. Talking to The News, Data Darbar co-founder Mutaher Khan says that, while there has been a global slowdown in IT, this should not have an outsized impact on Pakistan’s tech sector given the country’s relatively small footprint in the global market. Instead, he points to the uncertainty in the rupee since May 2022 that has led to more money being parked outside the country which translates into lower export figures. Khan also points to a stagnation in terms of the supply of IT and other technical graduates in Pakistan. “The entry of technical people into the market is no longer growing as fast and the supply of the universities is roughly where it was three years ago”, he adds, highlighting the lack of growth in terms of those with the required skills. A post-budget press release by the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) also highlighted the skills deficit in the tech sector. The higher income tax burden on the salaried class “will further fuel the brain drain of the skilled workforce from the IT industry of Pakistan”, explained P@SHA, its Chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan saying that the IT industry is already grappling with a lack of skilled and highly-skilled workforce. He added that “the government should have given a special package to the human resource pool to enable IT companies [to] continue with the momentum of double-digit growth in IT exports”. In terms of what the government can do to help the sector, Mutaher points towards facilitating access to hardware instead of making devices more expensive through additional taxes, allowing export-oriented companies complete retention for forex and easing the repatriation process and ensuring connectivity by not throttling internet speeds and encouraging investments.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/16/apple-oracle-vanguard-fund-technology-sector/,,Apple and Oracle Helped Propel These 3 Vanguard ETFs to All - Time Highs . Here My Favorite to Buy Now . ,20240616T191500Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780528/gettyimages-1448152453-1200x675-128554e.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"Apple ( AAPL +2.12% ) and Oracle ( ORCL 2.05% ) blasted to all-time highs on Wednesday. Apple is up over 14% in the last month -- the recent rally primarily fueled by a positive response to its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple is integrating artificial intelligence (AI) across several key product categories. Meanwhile, Oracle is up 19% in the last month, getting an additional boost from its recent financial results and guidance. Since Oracle is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, you won't find it in the Nasdaq Composite or Nasdaq-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But you will find both Apple and Oracle in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( VTI +0.24% ) , the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO +0.23% ) , and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) . Here's a primer on each fund, why all three funds just hit all-time highs, and the best one to buy now. Image source: Getty Images. Diversified exposure The Total Stock Market ETF and S&P 500 ETF are the two largest Vanguard ETFs -- both featuring over $1 trillion in net assets. Both funds have 0.03% expense ratios -- or $3 in annual fees per $10,000 invested. The low cost and simplicity of these funds make them great choices for folks looking for a passive yet effective way to mirror the broader market's performance. The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has 3,719 holdings compared to 504 holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. However, the largest companies are so valuable that the S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of the market cap of the U.S. stock market. This dynamic makes the performance of the two ETFs very similar. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will generally do better than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if mega-cap and large-cap stocks are outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The last 18 months or so is a great example of what you can expect when megacaps are leading the market higher. MGK data by YCharts . As you can see in the chart, mega-cap growth has crushed the S&P 500, while mega-cap stocks have done well, while mid and small caps have done poorly. But even under those circumstances, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has only outperformed the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF by a couple of percentage points. So despite the significant difference in quantity of holdings between the two funds, both perform practically the same because the S&P 500 makes up such a large share of the broader market. An inexpensive way to invest in the hottest stock market sector The simplest way to invest in companies like Apple and Oracle without racking up large fees is through the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. It has a higher expense ratio at 0.1% compared to 0.03% for the larger Vanguard funds. But that's only a $7 difference per $10,000 invested. The tech sector is chock-full of high-octane growth stocks -- including the three most valuable companies in the world -- Apple, Microsoft ( MSFT +0.53% ) , and Nvidia ( NVDA 3.06% ) . But it also includes more pick-and-shovel plays -- like materials and component suppliers. Still, the fund is basically going to boom or bust according to the performance of its three largest holdings and the two largest industries, semiconductors and software. The semiconductor industry has been a huge winner from the AI-induced run-up in the market. The two best examples are Nvidia, which became the third company valued at over $3 trillion, and Broadcom , which surpassed $800 billion in market cap on Friday after blowing earnings expectations out of the water. With the tech sector contributing 30.6% of the S&P 500 and the semiconductor industry comprising 27.6% of the tech sector, some simple math tells us that the industry now makes up a whopping 8.5% or so of the entire S&P 500. For context, that means the semiconductor industry has about the same weighting as the entire industrial sector or energy, utilities, and materials combined . The tech sector includes companies that provide the computing power needed to run complex AI models, as well as companies that are investing in ways to apply AI for enterprises and consumers. For that reason, it stands out as the best sector to invest in if you want exposure to the growing trend . A well-deserved premium valuation The danger of buying red-hot tech stocks right now is valuation. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a 42.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Earnings growth has been strong, but many of the gains have been due to a valuation expansion. Apple's P/E ratio is up to 33.2 compared to its three-year median of 28.1. Microsoft has a 38.2 P/E, while its three-year median is 33.3. Oracle's P/E is 37 compared to a three-year median of 30.2. The list goes on and on. Over the long term, tech companies are perfectly positioned to deploy capital toward high-margin opportunities that lead to earnings growth. The sector is admittedly a little overextended at this point from a valuation standpoint, but it still has what it takes to be a good investment. And for that reason, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a better buy than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if you have a high risk tolerance."

Currently, the filing date of the printed publication is typically the prevailing consideration. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Samsung, and various tech industry groups, including the High Tech Inventors Alliance, are encouraging the Federal Circuit to dismiss Lynk Labs' assertion. Some opponents argue that focusing solely on the publication date could potentially exclude up to 18 months' worth of prior art from the scope of review. If the Federal Circuit sides with Lynk Labs, it could significantly impact the practice of inter partes reviews, with further implications for patent law and innovation. It's crucial to monitor the outcome of this debate, as it may influence the way patent applications are evaluated in the future. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Samsung and several tech industry groups, including the HTIA, have urged the Federal Circuit to reject Lynk Labs' argument that patent applications can only be used to invalidate patents in inter partes reviews based on their publication date, saying the filing date is what counts. www.law360.com/...

Raspberry Pi’s shares jumped on Tuesday morning (Raspberry Pi/PA) PA Media Alex Daniel 11 June 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . UK budget computer firm Raspberry Pi’s shares soared as much as 40% on Tuesday morning after its initial public offering (IPO). Raspberry Pi’s shares hit 392p in early trading, above its IPO price of 280p, which was announced before markets opened. The IPO terms suggested a valuation of £541.6 million, the company said in a stock market update. Raspberry Pi said the listing would raise £166 million. Shares began trading in “conditional dealing”, where institutional investors and those on the London Stock Exchange on June 11, with a full open trade due to begin on Friday. Eben Upton, chief executive of Raspberry Pi, said: “The quality of the interactions during the marketing process has underlined our belief that London has the right calibre and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi. “The reaction that we have received is a reflection of the world-class team that we have assembled and the strength of the loyal community with whom we have grown.” The IPO has been hyped as a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad. Paddy Power-owner Flutter has moved its main stock market listing to New York while German-owned Tui approved a plan to delist from London in February, and in another blow UK chip maker Arm Holdings chose Wall Street over London for its stock market return. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said the listing was a “warm welcome” from investors. She added: “This is a sign that there is life in the London stock market, and companies can derive value from listing in London. “It is also a decent payday for the company’s founders and directors. “While the value PC maker has a small listing, especially compared to some of the tech giants in the US, it is a company with links to its bigger brothers and sisters in the tech sector, and prior to listing it had recently secured funding from Sony – and Arm is one of its cornerstone investors.” Read More Ireland’s competition watchdog to investigate Ticketmaster Oasis ticket sales Man who tried to smuggle migrants crammed in motorhome seat compartments jailed PM attends small boats summit as Home Secretary insists progress is being made Save £20 per person on autumn and Christmas days out by steam It comes amid reports that Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is also preparing to file for a listing in London. Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy 35 million US dollars (£27.5 million) and 20 million US dollars (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the IPO plans. Raspberry Pi said it would use cash from the equity raised for engineering projects, improving its supply chain, and other general corporate purposes. Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008 before releasing its first product in 2012. It has since sold more than 60 million of its single board computers alone. The group’s products are sold across more than 70 countries worldwide. It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation – a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people. As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around 50 million US dollars (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group. Raspberry Pi reported revenues of 265.8 million US dollars (£211.1 million) in 2023, with operating profits of 37.5 million US dollars (£29.8 million).

The company successfully underwent a 10-for-1 stock split, and shares are now trading at a lower level. For retail investors, this will likely be a tempting opportunity to acquire shares. Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Today marks a key event that many investors have been waiting for. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), the artificial intelligence ( AI ) leader dominating the tech sector, begins trading on a split-adjusted basis . After weeks of anticipation, NVDA stock now trades at a much lower price. As of this writing, it is trading at $120 per share after closing out trading last week at more than $1200. Investors who held shares last week have seen their holdings increase, as the company has issued 10 shares for each previous one. They haven’t lost money, but they stand to make more when the new stock returns to its previous levels. NVDA on a Post-Split Basis NVDA stock dipped slightly in pre-market trading today. While it is currently still down, the stock is likely to pick up momentum soon. For anyone who didn’t purchase Nvidia prior to the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, which sent it soaring, this is a chance to add it to their portfolio. Companies enact stock splits to organically lower share prices to make them more accessible to new investors, and there is likely no shortage of people who want to acquire NVDA stock. One interesting factor to consider is that NVDA stock traded at $120 per share less than two years ago. In October 2022, before OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and sent AI stocks into new territory, it hovered right around that price. Since then, the tech sector leader has enjoyed a 900% growth rate, dominating markets and ushering in a new wave of industry. And plenty of experts believe it will continue rising from here. As MarketWatch reports : “For investors who think Nvidia already rules the S&P 500 SPX , Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis outlined a path for the stock to become even more dominant within the index. Nvidia has a similar weighting to Apple Inc. within the S&P 500, at around 6% to 7%, he flagged. But Lipacis thinks Nvidia’s weighting could grow to 10% to 15% as the market is still in the midst of a transition into a new computing era.” Analysts Remain Bullish on NVDA Stock Other Wall Street firms remain as bullish on NVDA stock as ever. Just today, analysts from both Barclays and Susquehanna raised their price targets, while one from TD Cowen updated his “buy” rating. The stock still receives a “strong buy consensus” on TipRanks, with 37 out of 40 analysts calling it a “buy.” Even while short bets on Nvidia stock increased ahead of the stock split, most experts clearly aren’t worried about the company’s growth prospects as it adjusts to trading on a split-adjusted basis.

Fitch was named a defendant in a lawsuit filed Friday, June 7, 2024, in federal court over a new Mississippi law requiring users of websites and other digital services to register their age. The suit by the tech industry group NetChoice contends the law will unconstitutionally limit access to online speech for minors and adults. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) JACKSON, Mississippi: A new Mississippi law requiring users of websites and other digital services to verify their age will unconstitutionally limit access to online speech for minors and adults, a tech industry group says in a lawsuit filed Friday. Advt Legislators said the new law is designed to protect children from sexually explicit material. The measure passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate without opposition from either party. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed it April 30, and it is set to become law July 1. The lawsuit challenging the new Mississippi law was filed in federal court in Jackson by NetChoice , whose members include Google , which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. NetChoice has persuaded judges to block similar laws in other states, including Arkansas, California and Ohio. The Mississippi law ""mandates that minors and adults alike verify their ages - which may include handing over personal information or identification that many are unwilling or unable to provide - as a precondition to access and engage in protected speech,"" the lawsuit says. ""Such requirements abridge the freedom of speech and thus violate the First Amendment."" The lawsuit also says the Mississippi law would replace websites' voluntary content-moderation efforts with state-mandated censorship. ""Furthermore, the broad, subjective, and vague categories of speech that the Act requires websites to monitor and censor could reach everything from classic literature, such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'The Bell Jar,' to modern media like pop songs by Taylor Swift,"" the lawsuit says. Advt Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch is the defendant named in the lawsuit. The attorney general's office does not comment on active litigation but ""looks forward to defending the State's law that gives parents the help they need to protect their children online,"" communications director MaryAsa Lee said. Utah is among the states sued by NetChoice over laws that imposed strict limits for children seeking access to social media. In March, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed revisions to the Utah laws. The new laws require social media companies to verify their users' ages and disable certain features on accounts owned by Utah youths. Utah legislators also removed a requirement that parents consent to their child opening an account after many raised concerns that they would need to enter data that could compromise their online security.

Speaking with the Stabroek Business from the company’s multistoried complex on Tuesday, Starr President, Mike Mohan. unveiled plans that are now in train to retain the company’s long-term interest in directly serving the local tech industry, whilst directing its attention to other entrepreneurial opportunities to fit in with what he sees as the direction in which the local economy is heading. Starr’s new focus is centered on providing various forms of support, including accommodation in the Starr Complex and access to the conveniences that it offers, according to Mohan. Starr Computers President Mike Mohan While a visit by Stabroek Business on Wednesday to the company’s Brickdam business premises revealed that Starr has retained and even extended the extent of the range of goods and services which it provides to the information technology sector, an interview with Mohan revealed that the company’s Brickdam complex is undergoing physical adjustments in line with the management’s decision to expand its suite of services in order to render the company adaptable to the interests of would-be investors. During last Thursday’s interview, Mohan named a highly visible US technology company which he is seeking to ‘entice’ into utilizing the physical space and operating conveniences currently being offered at the Brickdam complex. During the interview Mohan told the Stabroek Business that while Star remains committed to the growth of the information technology sector in Guyana, and particularly to the development of IT as a discipline in the school system, the company was seeking to accomplish this goal whilst seeking to respond to the transformations which Guyana is now experiencing, including those that offered new opportunities and new income streams to investors. Mohan told the Stabroek Business that from his vantage point in the United States, he had been “monitoring closely” some of the responses of would-be investors and has decided that both Starr and its multi—storied Brick-dam complex can help ‘fit in’ with Guyana’s investment objectives. The move, according to Mohan, is designed to allow Starr Computers to remain aligned to its original business model whilst following what he sees as the direction in which the company is heading. From the Guyanese businessman’s vantage point in the United States, he has been monitoring the flood on investor interest in Guyana and has decided that a complex that currently houses his own company can become a focal point for expatriate businesses wishing to pay an interest in the investment opportunities that exist here."

Yesterday, Nvidia surpassed Apple’s ( APPL ) market capitalization, topping $3 trillion. This means NVDA stock currently only lags behind Microsoft ( MSFT ), which it could catch up to soon. Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Yesterday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) achieved yet another milestone. The semiconductor and artificial intelligence ( AI ) leader surpassed one of the tech sector’s biggest names on the market capitalization list, blowing past Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) this week. With NVDA stock continuing its winning streak, Nvidia touched a market cap of $3 trillion, ultimately reaching $3.005 trillion earlier today. At $3.002 trillion, Apple was just below it, although Nvidia is now back at $2.98 trillion as of this writing. Meanwhile, both tech giants still trail Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and its market cap of $3.14 trillion. At this point, it seems as though Nvidia can’t be stopped. What’s more, with its upcoming 10-for-1 stock split, interest in NVDA stock will likely keep rising as investors rush to pile into the AI breakout sensation. What’s Happening With NVDA Stock? Even after yesterday’s good news, NVDA stock slipped into the red this morning, now down about 1%. Still, Nvidia has performed extremely well over the past month, rising above the $1,200 mark with gains of more than 30%. As CNBC reports, this type of growth shows that investors are becoming more and more comfortable with Nvidia’s growth prospects. NVDA stock has demonstrated an impressive ability to climb through volatile economic conditions throughout the past year. But now it is becoming clear that the AI leader can continue to dominate the booming market by making sales to a “handful of cloud companies.” Indeed, even Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk expects to make a large chip order from Nvidia later this year. Nvidia stock has shown that it can become even more valuable than many of the tech sector’s biggest names. The upcoming NVDA stock split is likely to spur even more growth . Per InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto: “Of course, with this intense performance comes the reality that the per-share price is too expensive for retail investors lacking access to fractional ownership capabilities. By splitting NVDA stock, nothing fundamentally changes in terms of the action itself. However, the move dilutes the share pool to make each unit cheaper, thus enhancing accessibility . This, in turn, may cause retail investors on the sidelines to jump in.” As it stands, Nvidia essentially has one more name to pass before it becomes the world’s most valuable company. The stock split could help it accomplish just that. And even if it doesn’t, Nvidia could still reach that milestone this year given its current growth trajectory.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) After investors flocked to tech companies during the acute phase of the pandemic, the stay-at-home economy began to open up. And as inflation reached historic levels, the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign initially squeezed the tech sector, prompting mass layoffs and a brutal period of financial bloodletting. But the enthusiasm around AI's potential has reinvigorated the tech sector, providing Ashkenazi with immense opportunities and challenges. While Google was seen by many to have been caught flat-footed after the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the company has gone on to unveil a slew of AI services for businesses and consumers. But there have been missteps. Several of the company’s newest AI features were deficient , providing fodder for competitors and critics of the company’s haphazard rollout. At a crucial promotion last year, Google’s chatbot Bard shared incorrect information about a NASA space telescope, leading to a $100 billion loss in the market value of the company. A year later, users of Bard’s successor, Gemini, discovered that the image generation tool created inaccurate or unexpected results of historical figures. And last month, after Google unveiled AI Overviews, a new search tool that gives users AI-generated answers to search results, the service gave users incorrect or absurd results in response to some queries. A key challenge for Ashkenazi will be monetizing these and other AI tools while safeguarding Google’s legacy search business, which may itself be threatened by users increasingly turning to AI services. Despite the recent blunders, many view Google as well positioned to capitalize on the AI transition. The company posted standout quarterly results in April and further incentivized shareholders with the double whammy of a new cash dividend and a massive stock repurchase program. Shares are up more than 25% for the year. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban .

Australian shares snapped a three-day losing streak on Friday, sending the S & P/ASX 200 up 1 per cent, or 73.5 points, to 7701.7 points. For the week, the benchmark index finished down 0.3 per cent as investors sold equities after hotter-than-expected inflation data for April pushed back the timeline for when the Reserve Bank may start cutting interest rates. On Wall Street overnight the Nasdaq index retreated 1.1 per cent after enterprise software giant and Slack-owner Salesforce plummeted 19.7 per cent on its trading update. The yield on one-year Australian bonds added 4 basis points to 4.45 per cent over the session and has added 12 basis points since Wednesday. On Friday night AEST the US personal income, spending and price report is expected to influence the direction of sharemarkets next week as a key signpost for the future direction of US interest rates. Economists expect the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation – will rise 0.2 per cent in April. Stocks in focus On the ASX every sector finished higher, except the interest rate sensitive property sector which lost 0.2 per cent. The best-performing sector on the day was consumer staples, boosted by a 2.8 per cent rise for Treasury Wine estates to $11.33. Bega Cheese surged 6.2 per cent to $4.46 and Woolworth rose 2 per cent to $31.60. The big four banks also finished higher with Commonwealth Bank rallying 1.3 per cent, to 119.54 and ANZ climbing 1.2 per cent to $28.25. Westpac and National Australia Bank rose less than 1 per cent. The best-performing stock on the benchmark index was Telix Pharmaceuticals. It jumped 15.3 per cent to $18.15 after broker Wilsons issued a positive note on the business and its latest clinical trial results. The biotech sensation has climbed around 1380 per cent in five years to a $5.4 billion valuation.

The S&P/TSX composite index was up 173.73 points at 22,071.71, driven by gains in the financial sector, which climbed 1.89 per cent in the day’s trading. The big winners were Royal Bank — which closed up 5.19 per cent after announcing a dividend hike and share buyback plan in the wake of the successful close of its HSBC Canada acquisition – and CIBC, which gained 7.01 per cent after reporting a second-quarter profit of $1.75 billion, up from $1.69 billion in the same quarter last year. South of the border, it was a different story. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 330.06 points at 38,111.48, while the S&P 500 index was down 31.47 points at 5,235.48. The Nasdaq composite closed down 183.50 points at 16,737.08. Story continues below advertisement The declines were largely the result of losses in the tech sector.

Markets are keenly watching for any signs that could indicate the U.S. Federal Reserve might be getting ready to cut interest rates. Story continues below advertisement While Thursday’s report could be interpreted as evidence in that direction, Gardner said investors are more interested in a different U.S. government report — one that the Federal Reserve prefers to use to measure inflation — set to be released Friday.

While summer is typically a quieter time for stock markets, Gardner said the unusual lack of volatility on the TSX so far this year makes her wonder if the market could be headed for a bit of summer-time choppiness. In the meantime, she said there are still pockets of opportunity out there for savvy investors. “The S&P is still 1.3 per cent below its peak, while the TSX is 1.88 per cent below its peak. So there’s still some room to run, and we are still more bullish than bearish on the stock market,” Gardner said.

Millennial workforce. (Credit: Unsplash/Austin Distel) This article is the sixth installment of the VICI Report , a comprehensive multi-part series exploring the sophisticated use of technology in political operations. This series aims to uncover the processes, mechanisms, tools, and technologies used by Democrats to master our political processes and to develop strategies that answer and ultimately defeat their manipulations in 2024 and beyond. Advertisement Read the previous article in this series, Democrats Collude with Big Tech , which explores how Big Tech put their thumb on the scale for Democrats, or start from the beginning of our series . The concept of the ""Long March Through the Institutions,"" as first promoted by the Frankfurt School of neo-communist philosophers , has profoundly influenced the tech industry, shaping its culture and political leanings. Alongside it, Critical Theory, with its roots in Marxist philosophy, emphasizes the ""deconstruction"" (e.g., destruction) of society and culture as a mechanism to build power structures in their image. This ideology found fertile ground in academic institutions and gradually permeated various sectors, including media, education, and technology, through the Long March strategy. This deliberate and gradual infiltration aimed to reshape these institutions from within, embedding progressive and leftist ideologies at their core. Today, the tech industry reflects the culmination of this decades-long process. Major technology companies are not only at the forefront of innovation but also at the center of cultural and political activism. The infusion of these ideological principles has led to a workforce that is almost completely aligned with leftist extremism, influencing corporate policies and practices. This shift has significant implications for society, as the tech industry wields considerable power over information dissemination, public discourse, and digital engagement. This Long March has effectively transformed the tech industry into a powerful and dangerous vehicle for promoting and advancing ""progressive"" agendas, highlighting the enduring impact of Critical Theory on contemporary institutions. Millennial Professionals Swing Hard Left The political orientation of college graduates, particularly those entering the tech industry, has shifted dramatically to the left over the past few decades. This shift is a direct result of the pervasive influence of leftist ideologies in higher education. Academic institutions have become breeding grounds for extremist and violent thought, indoctrinating students with Critical Theory and other Marxist philosophies. These young graduates, armed with their activist zeal, carry these ideologies into the workforce, significantly impacting the professional culture of every tech company. Advertisement As millennials infiltrated the tech industry, they brought with them this fervent commitment to ""progressive"" causes. This never-before-seen demographic shift has translated into a new form of corporate activism, where tech companies are not merely businesses but also platforms for advancing leftist agendas. Supposedly professionals, these activists leverage their positions to influence corporate policies, push for ""diversity and inclusion"" initiatives, advocate for ""social justice"" issues, and fanatically agitate against Christians, conservatives, and the traditionally minded . The result is a tech industry that is increasingly aligned with radical extremist values, using its vast resources and influence to reshape society according to these principles. This infiltration and subsequent transformation of the tech industry underscore the success of the Long March through the Institutions. The process of deliberate and strategic embedding of leftist ideologies within academic and corporate structures has effectively turned the tech sector into a powerful tool for promoting and enforcing a progressive agenda. The impact of this shift is severe, as the tech industry controls much of the information flow and digital infrastructure that shapes modern life. The alignment of these companies with radical leftist values poses a significant threat to traditional societal norms and the principles of free and fair discourse. Avocado Toast and Intra-Corporate Activism The stereotype of the entitled tech worker—transitioning seamlessly from a sheltered, theory-laden college environment to an equally insulated tech job—highlights a cultural bubble that profoundly influences political and corporate activism. These workers, rightly caricatured as enjoying luxuries like ""avocado toast,"" are emblematic of a generation disconnected from the gritty realities of broader society. This cultural bubble fosters a sense of moral superiority and an urgency to advocate for extremist causes, often without regard for the real-world implications. This new workforce has initiated significant university-style protest movements even within tech companies, leveraging their positions to push for a variety of causes. These internal activists advocate for flagrantly discriminatory race and gender initiatives, fealty to the climate hoax, and ""woke"" social justice, often influencing corporate policies from within. The demands of these employees have led to tech companies adopting increasingly left-wing stances on various issues, reflecting the ideological leanings of their millennial workforce. Advertisement The cultural symbol of ""avocado toast"" juxtaposes the millennial lifestyle choices against their substantial influence in tech and corporate environments. While seemingly trivial, this symbol represents a broader trend of entitlement and detachment from the practicalities of everyday life. This detachment enables a fervent push for absurd policies within corporations, driven by idealistic but often impractical notions. Intra-corporate activism, a totally new phenomenon, has transformed the tech industry into a battleground for ideological influence. Employees use their positions to campaign for policy changes, organize walkouts , and pressure executives to adopt radical policies. This activism extends beyond workplace issues, as tech employees increasingly demand that their companies take public stances on political and social issues. The influence of these internal movements is substantial. Tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have made significant and famous policy shifts in response to employee activism, affecting everything from corporate governance to product development as well as forcing out anyone who even questions them. These changes, driven by a workforce steeped in this ideology, illustrate the culmination of the processes and mechanisms of the Long March through the Institutions. The tech industry's alignment with leftist values, shaped by millennial intra-corporate activism, poses a challenge to traditional norms and has a far-reaching impact on society. Effective Altruism Effective Altruism (EA) is a philosophical movement that has gained significant traction within the tech industry. Fringe outside of tech, EA claims a starkly utilitarian approach, claiming to measure the ""most good"" through quantifiable impacts. This philosophy aims to optimize the allocation of resources to achieve the greatest possible positive effect, often through data-driven and analytical methods. However, critics argue that this reductionist view oversimplifies complex human experiences, reducing them to mere data points and neglecting the deeper ethical considerations involved. EA seamlessly aligns with the millennial extremist ethos prevalent in Silicon Valley. The movement promotes a narrative that complex societal issues can be ""solved"" through technological and algorithmic methods. This perspective often overlooks the nuanced and multifaceted nature of social problems, advocating for solutions that prioritize efficiency and scalability over ethical and moral considerations. The tech industry's embrace of EA reflects its broader ideological leanings, where leftist values are intertwined with a belief in the power of technology to effect positive change. Advertisement The movement's credibility faced significant scrutiny with the FTX scandal. FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange led by EA proponent Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed amidst severe financial misconduct . This scandal highlighted the potential for EA's methods to disguise high-risk behaviors with a veneer of philanthropy. The incident challenged the integrity of EA's ethical claims and underscored the dangers of presenting an overly utilitarian approach to complex issues. Critics argue that EA's methods are in line with the neo-communist teachings of Critical Theory, which prioritize ideological goals over practical outcomes. Additionally, the World Economic Forum (WEF) heavily promotes EA-style philosophies through their ""Systems Leadership"" initiative . This initiative advocates for comprehensive approaches to global challenges, emphasizing systemic changes and collective action, which align closely with the purported principles of Effective Altruism. The WEF's endorsement and promotion of these ideas further embed EA principles within influential global platforms, amplifying their impact and reach. Effective Altruism intersects with extreme left ideologies under the guise of rational and neutral activism. By using ""process mastery"" and sophisticated data analytics, EA proponents push agendas as fronts for deeper political motives and social engineering. The movement's focus on measurable impacts and cost-effectiveness often masks its underlying ideological objectives, raising concerns about the true nature of its intentions. Cancel, by Any Means Necessary The adoption of extreme measures in political and corporate strategies has become increasingly prevalent. This approach, characterized by the willingness to employ any tactic necessary to achieve specific goals, raises significant ethical questions. The mantra of ""by any means necessary"" reflects a broader trend within these movements and the tech industry, where ends often justify means, regardless of the consequences. This mindset has led to a series of actions and policies that prioritize ideological victories over ethical considerations and social cohesion. One of the most prominent manifestations of this approach is the rise of Cancel Culture. Cancel Culture involves the systematic targeting and silencing of individuals or organizations that express views contrary to progressive orthodoxy . This tactic often includes public shaming, boycotts, and efforts to remove the targeted individuals from their professional positions or social platforms. Within the tech industry, Cancel Culture has been used as a powerful tool to enforce ideological conformity and suppress dissenting opinions. The tech giants, with their control over major social media and information platforms, play a crucial role in perpetuating Cancel Culture, effectively controlling the narrative and shaping public discourse. Advertisement The rhetoric and practices associated with Cancel Culture have significant polarizing effects on public opinion. By demonizing and deplatforming those who hold contrary views, Cancel Culture fosters a climate of fear and self-censorship. Individuals and organizations become hesitant to express opinions that might attract backlash, leading to a homogenization of viewpoints and stifling of open debate. This polarization exacerbates societal and political divisions as groups retreat into echo chambers and become increasingly hostile to opposing perspectives. The adoption of such extreme measures has profound implications for both political and corporate strategies. In politics, the willingness to engage in smear campaigns, misinformation, and outright deception has undermined public trust in democratic institutions and electoral processes. The tech industry's complicity in these tactics, through selective enforcement of content policies and biased moderation practices, further erodes confidence in the neutrality and fairness of digital platforms. In the corporate world, intra-corporate activism driven by radical ideologies has led to significant changes in company policies and cultures. Companies increasingly take public stances on controversial social and political issues, often bowing to the demands of a vocal minority within their workforce. This trend not only disrupts internal cohesion but also alienates segments of their customer base, creating additional divisions. The embrace of ""by any means necessary"" strategies reflects a broader ideological shift driven by the Long March through the Institutions. This shift prioritizes ideological purity and the advancement of progressive agendas over traditional values of free speech, ethical behavior, and democratic engagement. The result is a more divided, polarized, and intolerant society, where power is concentrated in the hands of those who control the narrative and wield the tools of Cancel Culture. Conclusion The evolution of technology in politics has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of electoral strategies and political engagement. From the early days of Tammany Hall and the professionalization of political processes, to the sophisticated digital campaigns of today, the integration of technological advancements has been pivotal in transforming how political power is acquired and maintained. Advertisement In the 19th century, machine politics, epitomized by Tammany Hall, utilized rudimentary tactics like ballot stuffing and voter intimidation to manipulate electoral outcomes. As political processes became more professionalized, the Progressive Era brought about refined strategies that integrated union activism and criminal elements to control political operations. This era laid the groundwork for future technological innovations in political strategy. The late 20th century marked a significant shift with the rise of the New Right, which harnessed direct mail and data analytics to mobilize supporters and raise funds. The adoption of mainframe computers enabled more precise targeting and data processing, setting the stage for the modern era of digital campaigning. The technological prowess demonstrated by conservative movements in this period prompted Democrats to develop their own sophisticated data and technology ecosystems, leading to the formation of NGP VAN and other digital platforms. The 2008 Obama campaign exemplified the transformative power of technology in politics, with unprecedented and permanent collaboration between Democrats and major tech companies like Google and Facebook. This partnership leveraged an infusion of fanatical Millennial professionals and their intra-corporate activism with advanced data analytics and social media to a wholesale overthrow, with all implications of violence intact, of all prior paradigms of political mechanics. From machine politics to digital campaigning, the integration of technology has been a deeply critical tool for political success and cultural manipulation. As the tech industry continues to evolve, its role in shaping these landscapes must remain a critical area of focus. Sinistra Delenda Est!

Most Read from Bloomberg World’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers The Beijing-based investor plans to raise $300 million for a new US-dollar fund led by partner Samuel Huang, according to people familiar with the matter. If successful, that will mark its first major investment vehicle since early 2021. The target is preliminary, however, and could change, the people said, asking not to be named. The envisioned vehicle — while small compared to the multibillion-dollar funds of the pre-Covid boom years — underscores how investors are cautiously exploring opportunities as AI becomes the dominant theme in tech circles. It also shows how capital may be returning after US investors took flight during Beijing’s tech sector crackdown and escalating US-China tensions. Venture funding in China plummeted 40% in the first three months of this year, even with artificial intelligence bets almost doubling to $4.2 billion. Source Code’s fundraising, alongside 5Y Capital’s $700 million fund launched in 2023, will be closely watched as a gauge of appetites for renewed bets on the country’s tech sector. A Source Code spokesperson declined to comment on the fundraising. US investors, from endowments to pension funds, who bankrolled China’s internet miracle over the past decade have grown more cautious about funneling money into the country, with some withdrawing entirely. The former Sequoia China, which raised $9 billion across four funds in 2022, split off from its US operations under intense pressure from Washington lawmakers. Founded in 2014 by former Sequoia China investor Cao Yi, Source Code manages around $5 billion across its yuan and dollar funds, according to its website. The VC firm last raised $1 billion in 2021 to make bets in early- and later-stage startups. It has invested in companies like Meituan, Ke Holdings Inc. and AI chipmaker Shanghai Biren Technology Co. Cao met ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming in 2012 and Source Code started with a $5 million investment in ByteDance, which it redoubled at every opportunity, the VC founder said in a 2017 documentary about the internet firm. Story Continues Source Code has yet to distribute much of those gains to its investors, however, as there’s no indication of an imminent stock debut for the world’s most valuable startup. Source Code’s newer funds have struggled to deliver strong performance, which led Cao to cut some of his investment staff last year, the Information reported at the time.

It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. The promise of artificial intelligence is “completely being wasted”, as business models and technology sector ideology dominate, a globally renowned economist told an audience at the University of Glasgow this week. Daron Acemoglu, institute professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, highlighted the “possibility of complementing human decision-making and problem-solving” with AI. He emphasised his view that this was something digital technologies had promised 60 years ago but did not deliver. He underlined the potential to use AI to help the likes of electricians, plumbers, blue-collar workers and healthcare employees in a way which meant they could still be doing more complex tasks. READ MORE: Ian McConnell: Labour, sadly, looks quite frankly petrified on Brexit However, Mr Acemoglu declared: “That promise, in my opinion , is completely being wasted. That is not where we are headed. If you are hoping we are going to get better tools for electricians and plumbers, you have a lot of hoping to do. “We are heading in a very different [direction] because, I am going to argue, [of] business models especially in the United States and the ideology of the tech sector.” He argued that both of these factors were creating “roadblocks” and “pushing us” in the “wrong direction” when it came to the development of AI, as he delivered a lecture on “artificial intelligence and its role in the economy and society” as part of the University of Glasgow’s Adam Smith Distinguished Speaker Series. Mr Acemoglu said: “Businesses demand tools, they use tools, but at the end of the day the tools they use are very conditioned by the tech sector.” He argued that “the real way to increase productivity is not just to automate human labour”. Mr Acemoglu observed that, while “of course you are going to do that”, the key was to “use technology to complement humans”, providing “better technical expertise, new tools for humans”. READ MORE: Ian McConnell: So what's the story with Kate Forbes and business? He declared: “The real promise is in complementing the workers so they can perform new tasks.” Mr Acemoglu added: “We need to move away from an excessive focus on automation and really start viewing AI technologies as complementary to humans.” Asking “why is that not the direction we are going”, he noted that US business “wants to make money” and “the tech sector is more and more focused on finding ways of reaching human parity, which is more and more for automation"". He argued that what is being prioritised in the business and tech world is “creating other roadblocks”. READ MORE: Ian McConnell: Labour, sadly, looks quite frankly petrified on Brexit Mr Acemoglu added: “What we want from AI is more useful information but more useful information needs to be used in the right way by humans.” He argued that human knowledge was still crucial. Mr Acemoglu highlighted human creativity, and the ability to experiment and discover things, and share the knowledge. He argued that, if you did not prioritise human learning, there will be “too much conformity”. Mr Acemoglu said: “The business model is very much focused on using digital tools for cutting costs.” He declared that this situation had been exacerbated in the last two decades. Mr Acemoglu talked about the importance of “reinvigorating democracy” in the context of AI. He highlighted Taiwan as an example of a place which was a leader in both AI and democratic reform. He added: “If my vision is we need pro-worker AI tools…we can’t do that from an ivory tower. It is like saying I want to help a village in Malawi but I am not going to hear anything from Malawi.” Mr Acemoglu also said it is a “myth that AI cannot be regulated”. He noted, given the technology’s huge energy use, “you can’t do hidden AI”. He declared: “If you look at…China, I am not condoning the Chinese Government’s objectives and methods, the entire AI sector is very tightly regulated in China. They just work a lot on what the Chinese government funds, which is surveillance and facial recognition technologies.” Business Economy Industry Jobs and careers Technology Share 0 Comments Get involved with the news Send your news & photos"

Technology Uzbekistan’s Tech Transformation: An interview With Minister Sherzod Shermatov Published by Jessica Weisman-Pitts Posted on May 16, 2024 Uzbekistan’s Tech Transformation: An interview With Minister Sherzod Shermatov Sherzod Shermatov, Minister of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan In recent years, Uzbekistan has sought to transform its economy by opening its doors to international investment and pass reforms aimed at stimulating economic growth. Central to this transformation is the prioritization of the technology sector as a key driver of development. In an exclusive interview, Uzbekistan’s Minister of Development of Information Technologies and Communications, Sherzod Shermatov, sat down with Joseph Epstein, director of legislative affairs at a US-based think tank, to shed light on the rationale behind Uzbekistan’s tech-focused approach and the strategies employed to foster both domestic talent and international collaboration. Joseph Epstein: Uzbekistan has witnessed significant development in recent years, particularly in facilitating international investment. Why has the country prioritized the tech sector for growth, and what competitive markets are you targeting? Sherzod Shermatov: Uzbekistan’s focus on the tech sector stems from the urgent need to create employment opportunities, particularly considering our substantial population growth. Moreover, being a double-landlocked nation poses challenges for traditional industries, making the ICT sector a strategic choice due to its potential for job creation and talent retention. The government has fostered favorable conditions for IT companies, including tax incentives, leading to a remarkable growth in ICT exports in recent years. This growth positions Uzbekistan competitively in global markets, particularly in IT outsourcing. JE: Regarding talent acquisition, is the ministry primarily concentrating on attracting foreign tech professionals, fostering domestic talent, or both? SS: We adopt a dual approach. Uzbekistan is committed to enhancing domestic talent through reforms in educational curricula and partnerships with IT training institutions. Simultaneously, we actively attract foreign professionals through initiatives like the IT visa program, fostering a diverse and skilled workforce. JE: Which countries are the specialists predominantly originating from? SS: Initially, we saw specialists primarily from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine due to them being displaced by the conflict, but our outreach efforts have attracted talent from various countries. JE: So, you mentioned initially there were Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. They must have come following the breakout of the war in Ukraine. However, they really, it seems were able to integrate in Uzbekistan. This hasn’t been the case everywhere. SS: Yeah, definitely. Actually, there are two main core values of Uzbekistan, for the safety and security of Uzbekistan. First, we respect all the nations. We don’t put some indigenous nation as kind of superior to some other nations. We have 150 different nationalities living peacefully together. So this is one core value. It’s the way it has always been and keeps Uzbekistan safe. Second, we respect all religions. Despite being a Muslim-majority country, we are a secular state and thus see all religions as equal. So these two principles make the integration process much easier in Uzbekistan. Foreigners will feel at home when they come. JE: What have been the primary challenges in attracting foreign talent and fostering domestic tech growth? How is the government addressing these challenges? SS: The primary challenge lies in raising awareness about Uzbekistan’s opportunities. To combat this, we have launched awareness campaigns and participated in international events. Additionally, we focus on upskilling our youth through education reform and incentivizing certification and training programs. JE: What are the inherent advantages of working within Uzbekistan’s tech sector? SS: Uzbekistan offers a unique blend of affordability, safety, and a welcoming atmosphere. With its stable infrastructure and young population, Uzbekistan serves as an ideal regional hub for companies seeking growth opportunities. JE: What have been the main challenges when it comes to attracting foreigners, but also growing the tech sector domestically? And what are you guys doing to address these issues? SS: The main challenge we are currently facing is that people do not know about Uzbekistan. So in response, we have launched awareness campaigns to show the opportunities we offer. Our main message is that we help you grow your business with us. So far we have organized events in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. We have the Uzbekistan Outsourcing Conference tomorrow in New York and the next one will be in Germany. Another challenge is upskilling our youth. As I mentioned, we are doing lots of institutional changes in the school education and universities. But there are still a lot of young people who really need upskilling. So, we are very much interested in inviting training companies and even compensate workers who upskill. For instance, we offer full compensation for international language certification like TOEFL or IELTS certification. Additionally, we are fully compensating IT certification as long as it is internationally recognized. We also subsidize the training institutions when their graduates successfully enter IT outsourcing companies. For each graduate we offer $2,000 and if they are disabled then we offer $3,000. We know that our demographics are good but that we must focus on the quality of our labor to accomplish our goals. JE: How do you envision the tech sector evolving over the next five years? SS: Our 2030 strategy aims to achieve significant milestones, including $5 billion in IT exports – up from $344 million in 2023. Furthermore, we want 300,000 employed in the tech sector, and a top 30 ranking in e-government. We are committed to realizing these goals through continuous development and strategic partnerships. JE: Are there similar initiatives in neighboring countries to develop their tech sectors? SS: Yes, neighboring countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are also prioritizing the development of the tech sector. Rather than viewing them as competitors, we want to collaborate to promote Central Asia as an emerging IT hub. JE: Could you highlight successful homegrown startups in Uzbekistan’s tech ecosystem? SS: Certainly. Startups such as Iman, Don’t Waste, MyID, and Mohirdev exemplify Uzbekistan’s innovation. Initiatives like the President Tech Awards further support and recognize such endeavors. JE: Is the tech sector accessible to English-speaking populations? SS: Absolutely. We have over 5 million of our younger population who are fluent in English. JE: It has been reported Uzbekistan’s emergence as a major outsourcing destination. How has the government encouraged this development? SS: The government’s comprehensive approach, encompassing favorable taxation, infrastructure development, and international partnerships, has catalyzed Uzbekistan’s emergence as a major outsourcing destination. Continuous legislative updates and collaboration with partners like USAID and the World Bank further support sector growth. JE: Lastly, what message would you convey to digital nomads considering relocating to Uzbekistan? SS: We extend a warm invitation to digital nomads to explore Uzbekistan’s opportunities firsthand. Our commitment is clear: we facilitate business growth. For those seeking expansion in our region, Uzbekistan offers an ideal destination with its supportive ecosystem and promising prospects."

(Left to right) Taoiseach Simon Harris with IBM country manager Deborah Threadgold, IBM chief financial officer James Kavanaugh, and chief executive of IDA Ireland Michael Lohan. Thu, 16 May, 2024 - 00:00 Ronan Smyth and Cáit Caden       The country's beleaguered tech sector has been given a boost with news that 800 jobs are to be created by IBM in Cork, Dublin and Waterford. The US tech giant said the new roles will be created over the next three years at its sites in Dublin and Cork as well as at one of its subsidiaries, Red Hat, in Waterford. The company's chief financial officer, James Kavanaugh, said IBM's continued investment in Ireland is as a result of its “strong relationship” with the Government and IDA Ireland. He added that it was also a “testament to the calibre of talent here in Ireland”. The company has been operating in Ireland for 65 years and already employs roughly 3,000 people. Its current operations here are focused on technology in the financial services and healthcare sectors. Ireland is also host to IBM Research’s only facility in the EU. The new roles will be in digital sales, consulting roles, as well as research and development. IBM said they will be focused in areas such as security, automation, and cloud computing all of which it said would be underpinned by AI technology. Taoiseach Simon Harris said the announcement “not only reinforces the company’s deep-rooted commitment to Ireland” but is also set to “deliver real impact to the Irish economy through job creation and by strengthening specialist skills and expertise”. Since the end of 2022, the tech sector worldwide has been experiencing a slowdown resulting in approximately 400,000 lost jobs. Although IBM casts some positivity on the beleaguered tech sector, there are signs that it is still in the midst of a slowdown. The high interest rate environment globally continues to impact the sector as many companies pivot to investing in AI. Worldwide job losses in the sector have continued to spill over into this year with around 50,000 lay-offs announced already. The job cuts seen in the tech sector since 2022 have been made by some of the world’s largest companies, many of which — including Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Stripe — have significant operations in Ireland. Earlier this week, jobs site Indeed said it would slim down its staff numbers here by around 70 roles in the coming weeks. Despite the turmoil experienced in the tech sector, the jobs market in Ireland remains tight with unemployment at record low levels. Also, the economy remains robust delivering strong Exchequer returns, albeit with falling corporation tax receipts. Other job announcements In addition to IBM, 400 jobs have been announced at Primeline Logistic, based in Co. Meath, with another 150 jobs being created by professional services firm PwC in its Cork offices. In Meath, the new jobs are a part of the company’s plans to develop a €50m distribution facility. The supply chain company, which is Ireland’s largest independent provider of logistics services, employs around 1,100 people across its operations. It completes over 25,000 deliveries to more than 7,500 outlets each week. “We are currently recruiting for a variety of positions across IT, operations and sales for this state-of-the-art facility,” said chief people and culture officer at Primeline Nikki Mullin. The new jobs at PwC come after the company announced the opening of its Cyber Managed Services Centre located in the firm’s offices in Cork. The ramped up services and job creation comes as cyber risks continue to rise for businesses, according to the company. “At a time when disruption and uncertainty are all around us, businesses are becoming increasingly reliant on and interconnected with third parties, meaning cybersecurity supply chain risk is intensifying further,” said Leonard McAuliffe, cyber partner at PwC Ireland.

(Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) AI-generated spam posts are starting to appear on some Facebook users' accounts, making it challenging for them to tell the difference between real and fake content. Reporters at 404 Media, a tech industry website, have monitored the recent rise in AI-generated posts on Facebook. These AI-generated images are popping up on Facebook, and other social media platforms like Threads , which is owned by Meta, and LinkedIn . RELATED: Instagram labels would identify Meta AI-generated images: report News of the AI-generated posts comes several months after Meta said in February that Facebook and Instagram users would start seeing labels on AI-generated images that appear on their social media feeds as part of a tech industry plan to filter out fake posts. ""We work to reduce the spread of content that is spammy or sensational because we want users to have a good experience, which is why we offer them controls to what they see in their feed,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to FOX Television Stations. Recently, TikTok started applying similar labels to some AI-generated posts on its platform. RELATED: Meta to shield teens on Instagram, Facebook from self-harm, eating disorders content NPR reported that researchers at Georgetown and Stanford universities probed over 100 Facebook pages that regularly post AI content and learned that the social media platform recommends some of this content to users' feeds so the posts can get higher engagement. RELATED: Facebook turns 20: Here's what else was happening in 2004 The researchers also discovered that some Facebook pages are spam, posting links to websites where Meta can collect ad revenue. NPR noted that other posts are from scammers, promoting AI-generated items that don’t exist. Meta already puts an ""Imagined with AI"" label on photorealistic images made by its tool. But most of the AI-generated content on its social media services comes from other places, the Associated Press reported. Additionally, several tech industry collaborations have been working to set standards. The push for digital watermarking and labeling of AI-generated content was also part of an executive order that President Joe Biden signed in October 2023.

Despite external evidence of their competence, people experiencing this syndrome believe they do not deserve their success. See Also: Mastercard on Agentic Payments: How AI Agents, Tokenization, and Authentication Will Redefine Digital Commerce Prevalence, Gender Disparities and Underrepresentation Studies indicate that as many as 82% of individuals experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives. This includes a significant number of professionals in the high-pressure, ever-evolving tech industry. Women and minority groups in tech are particularly susceptible. Women in male-dominated fields such as technology experience higher levels of imposter syndrome, research shows. This can be attributed to societal stereotypes, a lack of female role models and the pressure to balance professional achievements with traditional family roles. Women are more likely to internalize failure and attribute their successes to external factors such as luck, rather than their abilities. This can deter them from seeking promotions or taking on challenging projects, which further entrenches gender disparities in the tech sector. Research shows that underrepresentation exacerbates feelings of not belonging and fear of exposure as a fraud. This issue is not confined to early career stages; it also affects seasoned professionals, including executives and leaders in the tech industry. Factors That Contribute to Imposter Syndrome in Tech Rapid technological change: The fast-paced nature of the tech industry requires constant learning and adaptation. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy as professionals struggle to keep up with the latest developments. High expectations and perfectionism: The tech industry often cultivates a culture of high achievement, where mistakes are highly visible and can negatively affect your career. This environment can amplify feelings of being an imposter, especially for those with perfectionist tendencies. Stereotype threat: For women and minorities, the stereotype that tech is a white male-dominated field can increase pressure to over-perform, further fueling imposter syndrome. Comparison with peers: Social media and professional networking platforms often highlight successes and milestones, which leads individuals to compare themselves unfavorably with their peers. Impact on Career Development Imposter syndrome can significantly affect career development in the tech industry. Professionals may avoid applying for jobs, promotions or new projects due to fear of failure or of being exposed as a fraud. Forbes recently reported that 75% of executive women said they experienced imposter syndrome and that it influenced their career decisions and progression. The constant self-doubt and fear of failure can also lead to burnout as individuals overwork themselves to prove their worth. This can affect mental health, causing anxiety and depression, and further impede career growth and satisfaction. Addressing Imposter Syndrome Both individuals and organizations can take steps to address and mitigate the effects of imposter syndrome in the technology sector. For Individuals Seek mentorship. Connecting with mentors who have navigated similar challenges can provide guidance and reassurance. Mentors can help validate experiences and offer strategies to combat self-doubt. Document achievements. Keeping a record of accomplishments and positive feedback can serve as a tangible reminder of one's capabilities. Reviewing these records during times of doubt can help reinforce self-worth. Engage in continuous learning. Embracing a growth mindset can shift the focus from perceived inadequacies to ongoing personal and professional development. Recognizing that learning is a continuous process can alleviate the pressure to know everything. For Organizations Promote diverse role models. Highlighting the successes of diverse employees can provide aspirational figures for underrepresented groups. This can help normalize diverse pathways to success and reduce feelings of isolation. Provide professional development. Offering workshops and training sessions on overcoming imposter syndrome can equip employees with practical tools to manage their self-doubt. These programs can also foster a supportive community where individuals feel comfortable discussing their experiences. Foster open conversations. Encouraging discussions about imposter syndrome can help normalize these feelings and reduce their stigma. Creating a safe space for employees to share their experiences can promote a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture. Imposter syndrome is a significant challenge in the technology sector. By understanding the factors that contribute to this phenomenon and implementing strategies to address it, individuals and organizations can work toward creating a more inclusive and supportive environment. This not only benefits the affected individuals but also enhances the overall diversity, innovation and productivity within the tech industry."

(Picture Credit: AP) BEIJING : Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced Tuesday a modest increase in annual revenue, as the firm pursues a major overhaul and regulatory curbs on the country's tech sector are relaxed. The Hangzhou-based company is one of the biggest players in China's tech industry, with operations expanding from retail to digital payment, artificial intelligence, and entertainment. Alibaba posted revenue of 941.2 billion yuan ($130.4 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, up 8 percent year-on-year, a statement by the firm showed. The statement also showed net income for the period stood at 71.3 billion yuan, up 9 percent year-on-year. Alibaba announced plans last year to undergo a significant restructuring that would see it split into six entities, each managed by its respective CEO and board of directors. ""During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased US$12.5 billion of shares and our board of directors has approved a US$4.0 billion dividend for fiscal year 2024,"" said Toby Xu , the group's chief financial officer. China's tech sector has suffered under a regulatory crackdown by Beijing that began in 2020, prompted in part by the government's fears that too much power and capital had been amassed by a few firms. Beijing has signaled recently that the period of intense regulatory scrutiny is winding down, as new headwinds threaten to drag on the world's second-largest economy.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/women-leaders-in-tech-outpace-men-counterparts-in-generative-ai-adoption-302144118.html,,Women Leaders in Tech Outpace Men Counterparts in Generative AI Adoption,20240514T050000Z,,prnewswire.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech industry,"Boston Consulting Group Study Reveals 68% of Women in the Tech Industry Say They Use a GenAI Tool at Work More Than Once a Week, Compared with 66% of Men, with Notable Variations Across Seniority and Roles BOSTON , May 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Generative AI (GenAI) is proliferating rapidly in the workplace and while women have historically been less likely to adopt new technologies than men have (especially in the early days), a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) released today finds that women are generally on par with—or in some cases even slightly outpacing—men peers in terms of GenAI adoption, with notable variations across seniority levels and job functions. The report, titled Women Leaders Are Paving the Way in GenAI , draws on data from a global survey of more than 6,500 women and men employees across Germany , India , Japan , the US, and the United Kingdom . These participants span four seniority levels and eight functions within the technology industry. "" Fewer than 30% of middle managers and senior leaders in tech today are women,"" said Maria Barisano , a managing director and partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report. ""GenAI presents a unique opportunity to narrow the gender gap in the tech industry, but it requires proactive actions from both companies and the women employed by them."" Notable Variations in GenAI Usage Across Seniority Levels and Job Functions According to the survey, 68% of women in the tech industry said they use a GenAI tool at work more than once a week, compared with 66% of men. Senior women in technical functions (engineering, IT, customer support, sales, and marketing) are ahead of their men counterparts in adopting GenAI. These senior individual contributors (ICs), junior managers, and senior managers lead their men peers by an average of 14 percentage points. Women senior managers in nontechnical functions (human resources, legal, and finance) are trailing their men peers by only 2 percentage points, while women junior managers and senior ICs are behind by 5 percentage points and 12 percentage points, respectively. Junior women in technical roles lag their male counterparts by an average of 7 percentage points, a disparity that could exacerbate existing pipeline challenges in numerous tech companies. Those in nontechnical functions lag the most in adoption, at 21 percentage points, increasing the risk of losing gains in representation as GenAI continues to affect roles and career success. Three Key Attributes Driving the Gender Difference in GenAI Adoption Although men and women have similar levels of trust in GenAI tools to meet their objectives, and feel equally competent using them, the report identifies three significant factors that contribute to gender disparities in the adoption of GenAI. Awareness of GenAI's Criticality. Compared with men, senior women are similarly or even more aware of the potential impact of GenAI on job success, while junior women are less aware. Junior women are behind their men peers in both function types (15 percentage points behind in technical functions and 17 percentage points behind in nontechnical functions) and they trail senior women as well, by 24 percentage points and 31 percentage points in technical and nontechnical functions, respectively. By comparison, junior men in technical functions are on a par with senior men in those functions and only 13 percentage points behind senior men in nontechnical functions. This gap in awareness may be because junior women do not have the same access as junior men to the networks and discussions where GenAI strategy is formed and they are not equally represented in GenAI pilots and initiatives. Confidence in GenAI Skills. Senior women in nontechnical functions lag their men peers by 8 percentage points, and junior women in all functions are behind—by 7 percentage points in technical functions and 11 percentage points in nontechnical functions. This lack of confidence is the only attribute in the research that explains why senior women in nontechnical functions who are aware enough and senior enough to understand that GenAI will be critical to their future success, lag their men colleagues in GenAI adoption. While there may be several reasons for junior women's lack of confidence in their GenAI skills, research has shown that perception and exposure challenges exist for women in arenas largely occupied by men. Tolerance for Risk. Senior women report a risk tolerance equal to or greater than their men peers in both technical and nontechnical functions, while junior women lag relative to their men peers (by 9 percentage points in technical functions and 16 percentage points in nontechnical functions). Senior women, having overcome numerous obstacles to reach their current positions, have developed the ability to take risks crucial for success. Conversely, junior women in technical roles often feel less free to experiment, especially with emerging technologies, due to their relatively lower levels of experience and authority. Reducing the Gender Gap in the Tech Industry Companies that are ready to pilot and scale GenAI can reduce the gender gap in the tech industry by tackling the three root causes of gender differences. This can be done through leadership advocacy and change management, targeted upskilling programs, a robust pilot design and clear responsible AI policies, and proactive career management. In addition, women can capture GenAI's possibilities by proactively engaging and experimenting with the technology. ""Now, more than ever, companies must be hyper-focused on enacting measures that increase equity in GenAI's adoption but also support all employees' adoption of GenAI,"" said Neveen Awad , a managing director and partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report. ""They can begin to reduce gender gaps and generate outsize impact today by targeting their actions to individual cohorts.""

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways SAN FRANCISCO — President Joe Biden is shoring up his support among tech industry Democrats, some of whom are setting aside their reluctance about a second term to focus instead on preventing a second term for former President Donald Trump. Biden swung through the wealthy enclaves of Northern California on Friday to raise money for his re-election campaign, giving him a chance to meet face-to-face with some of the Democratic Party’s wealthiest donors and key allies in the business community. While the tech industry has always leaned left compared with other sectors of the economy, several vocal tech billionaires including Tesla CEO Elon Musk have shifted their politics to the right in recent years. That has left an impression that all of Silicon Valley may have moved with them into conservative territory, but the available evidence suggests otherwise: The tech sector is breaking for Democrats as clearly as ever this year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement And although some tech executives and investors sought a few months ago to unseat Biden as the Democratic nominee, pushing for an alternative such as Rep. Dean Phillips, of Minnesota, many of the skeptics are now firmly supporting Biden as their only reasonable option, according to two tech industry figures who have raised money for Democrats and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private funding efforts. Biden has never been the tech industry’s favorite politician, and the three-plus years of his presidency thus far have been rocky in large part because of his stances on regulation. He has pushed an aggressive antitrust agenda including against Big Tech , signed a law to potentially ban TikTok and sided with unionized autoworkers over Musk, alienating the Tesla chief and some of Musk’s friends. But some in tech also say that Biden has been helpful to the industry, including by bringing microchip manufacturing back to U.S. shores , and they say there’s fear that a second Trump term could bring its own disruptions, from potential tariffs to the threat of political violence . It was always likely that the tech industry overall would coalesce around Biden in the end because it’s liberal on so many other issues, such as abortion rights, said Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Political science research generally shows that people come home in the end,” he said. “People can be discontent in May and June, but when it comes to October and November, people will realize these are the only choices.” In a 2017 paper , Malhotra and two co-authors did a survey that found elite tech entrepreneurs have a unique mix of views compared to other political donors or rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans. They’re skeptical of government regulation, but they favor higher taxes for redistribution, and they’re predisposed toward racial tolerance and other liberal social values. Malhotra said that tech progressives have failed to push the Biden administration to the right on regulation, but they can still find common ground elsewhere. “These are typically very center-left people, and I think the message he will likely deliver is the message that will resonate with them: Political institutions are on the ballot, liberalism and liberal values are on the ballot, democracy is on the ballot,” he said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One of Biden’s tech backers echoed those sentiments. Vinod Khosla, a billionaire investor in companies such as DoorDash, was scheduled to host one of Biden’s San Francisco-area fundraisers Friday and said that democracy was top of mind for him. “My message to the general public is that I’m a huge supporter of President Biden and we have to absolutely at any cost make sure that that donkey’s rump, Trump, doesn’t get elected and destroy democracy,” Khosla said on stage at a Bloomberg News event Thursday. A second fundraiser Friday in Palo Alto was scheduled to feature various tech figures including Marissa Mayer, former CEO of Yahoo, according to an invitation published by Puck News. Those funders are in addition to other big tech-industry names who’ve already given to Biden this election cycle, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Tesla investor Steve Westly and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Campaign finance data indicates that the tech industry remains broadly pro-Democrat. Tech employees, political action committees and outside groups have so far given to Democratic candidates over Republicans by a margin of more than 4 to 1 this election cycle, with much of the fundraising still to come, according to the transparency organization OpenSecrets . The contrarians have sometimes been louder than the tech progressives. Musk, with 182 million followers on his social media app X, has said he won’t vote for Biden this year and in March met Trump in Florida, although Musk hasn’t said how he’ll vote. Close allies of Musk including David Sacks, a former donor to Democrat Hillary Clinton, have been unrelenting in their criticism of Biden, and Sacks attended a Trump fundraiser in March, according to Punchbowl News . But explicit support for Trump is difficult to find in the tech world. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who was nearly alone among major tech figures in endorsing Trump in 2016, told The Atlantic last year that he was stepping away from politics and would not be giving money to Trump or any other politician this cycle. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, often listed among the wealthiest people in the world, supported the presidential campaign of Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and has urged Trump to pick Scott as his running mate, Puck News reported . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting limited support in the tech industry. Last year he won the endorsement of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and in March, Kennedy chose as his running mate Nicole Shanahan, a Bay Area attorney and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning tech industry group, said that Biden may suffer from comparisons to former President Barack Obama, who was widely embraced in Silicon Valley. Obama was treated as a star when he visited Google’s headquarters as a candidate in 2007. “Many people in tech saw themselves in President Obama, and I think that in some ways Obama’s support in tech was almost the high water mark for any politician in tech,” Kovacevich said. “There are plenty of people in tech who wish that Biden took a different approach toward the tech industry, was more of a tech champion, and are disappointed that he hasn’t been, but I don’t see a lot of people embracing Trump as a result of it,” he said.

(NYSE: PLTR ) CEO Alex Karp made a bold assertion that the company has no competitors in the U.S. commercial and government sectors. What Happened: Karp, during the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, dismissed the notion of any competitors in the U.S. commercial and government markets. He stated that potential rivals are merely trying to replicate Palantir’s unique capabilities but are not on the same level as Palantir. “I don’t believe we have competitors. So, I don’t believe in the U.S. commercial market we have competition. I don’t believe in the U.S. government market we have competition,” Karp said. “In order to actually make AI work, you need an ontology. No one has an ontology,” Karp stated. “You’d have to actually understand what is special about the software infrastructure of having the combination of Apollo, Foundry, and the ontology. And then you would have to build on top of it.” Karp attributed this claim to the company’s proprietary technologies, including its ontology knowledge management system, Foundry data operating platform, and Apollo artificial intelligence platform, which he believes gives Palantir an insurmountable competitive edge. See Also: Once Vehicles For Republican Presidents To Connect With Southern Whites, Motor Sports Are Shifting Away From Trump The CEO dismissed potential rivals as simply attempting to replicate Palantir’s unique capabilities, like “the Palantir of Iowa or the Palantir of Harvard or the Palantir of Uruguay, but they’re not Palantir.” He also pointed out that replicating this “special” infrastructure from scratch “is going to take a long time” for competitors to achieve. Why It Matters: The recent assertion by Karp is in line with his previous statements about the company’s unique position in the tech industry. Just days before the earnings call, Karp spoke about the American tech industry’s uncanny ability to include any personality during a Capitol Hill forum. He stated that as long as the individual is delivering results, “nobody in tech cares.” However, Karp’s confidence has also sparked controversy. During the same Capitol Hill forum, he made some controversial remarks , including joking about drone-striking his business rivals and suggesting that protesters be sent to North Korea. The forum, organized by Jacob Helberg, a senior adviser to Karp, was intended to foster a connection between the tech industry and Congress. Palantir’s financials seem to back up Karp’s confidence for now. Along with the surging U.S. commercial growth, the company raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $2.677 billion to $2.689 billion. It also marked the sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with $106 million in net income.

The Wayve deal announced today marks Europe’s largest ever AI venture round and adds to the momentum. Wayve is a poster child for British tech and firmly puts the UK on the global AI map. These moments deserve to be celebrated. The deal offers a blueprint for how the UK can further win in the industries of tomorrow. Wayve has got to this critical stage on its journey partly due to its London/Cambridge base. The benefits have included access to trained talent, smart skilled immigration policies, access to capital (from local seed investors, including our own Firstminute Capital), support from serial entrepreneurs, quality local founder events, corporate start-up partnerships, agile regulation and a supportive government. Our top universities increasingly foster an environment that encourages innovation, as shown by two recent spin-out success stories: Wayve, born out of Cambridge ; and Onfido, which recently produced with an 80-times return for the Oxford Seed Fund. Funds like the Creator Fund, our UK “dorm room fund”, look well placed to back the next student-led successes. The UK talent density is further enhanced by global AI tech titans training up talent in the UK. These companies include Google, Microsoft, Meta, Anthropic, Cohere, and OpenAI (the first two of which have British founders leading their AI efforts). This confluence is further amplified by geographic clusters like King’s Cross (home to the Francis Crick Institute, Wayve and Google DeepMind). Advertisement Partnerships between established corporations and start-ups are key. Wayve’s early collaborations with Ocado, DPD, and Asda provided crucial data to train their algorithms. We have world-class corporates and brands here, many of whom want to partner with cutting-edge startups. We should find ways to make it easier to forge these connections. In this case, I was lucky enough to broker a key relationship between Ocado and Wayve . A supportive government and a tech savvy prime minister have also helped this story. For Wayve, a pivotal moment came when the government announced that an automated vehicles bill would be recommended, enabling the safe commercial deployment of their technology. This is a catalyst in the advancement of novel fields like robotics. The drone industry is making similar regulatory progress. In fintech, regulatory sandboxes and open-banking were critical in the success of disruptors like Wise and Revolut, which likely wouldn’t have existed without them. And there is more progress planned as the London Stock Exchange recently announced the Pisces initiative which will be the first regulated crossover market between private and public markets and will help improve liquidity in the shares of these businesses. So where do we go from here? I believe we have an opportunity to capitalise on this moment and make it more of a movement, embracing the industries of the future (whether AI, robotics, quantum computing, defence tech or biotech) to make the UK a global hotspot. But that’s not to say there aren’t hurdles. One is the lack of later-stage funding and the absence of a robust public market. Another is a proposed tax policy change that may drive away our most successful founders and investors. I hope that Wayve acts as a beacon to other international founders, to show how a once contrarian approach can attract the world’s best brains and capital, and how the UK can focus on technology opportunities and encourage broader entrepreneurship across the country to drive more growth.

The seemingly large-scale departure comes amidst tech sector layoffs and poor-performing stock, with many workers fed up of the long hours and high-pressure environments, a report by the South China Morning Post claims. The move, which is also being echoed around the world amid ongoing layoffs, signals a major shift away from the previous perception that working in tech offers huge wealth potential compared with the amount of work. Chinese tech workers are leaving Big Tech The SCMP gives examples of some workers who represent the shift, including Zoe Du, who left TikTok parent company Byte Dance in 2020 during a period in which the Chinese government started to clamp down on monopolistic practices in the tech sector. Du noted that China’s Big Tech is “less thriving than a few years ago”, adding that at least 70% of her former colleagues have copied her resignation to start their own ventures. At the end of 2023, Baidu, Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, collectively known as China’s ‘BAT,’ had a little under 365,000 employees, marking a drop of around 25,000, or 6.4%. Du’s new company, founded in 2021, managed an annual income of around $1.4 million last year with just eight employees, indicating that startups are now more lucrative than Big Tech. Are you a pro?

More broadly, layoffs have affected around 80,000 tech workers this year to date (via layoffs.fyi ), down on the 263,000 layoffs for 2023 as a whole. While many of these workers have also gone on to explore their own ventures, the figures don’t take into account those who have decided to leave.

In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in Indian leaders taking the reins of major global tech companies. From Sundar Pichai at Google to Satya Nadella at Microsoft, and now Arvind Krishna at IBM , the presence of Indians in top positions is remarkable and that's why Indians play a big role in Silicon Valley 's success . And In a recent interview with PTI , the CEO of the Silicon Valley Central Chamber of Commerce said, that Indians are one of the largest leaders of innovation in Silicon Valley and America's tech industry cannot survive without them. ""I don't have the new figures, but what matters is that we (Indians) are such impactful contributors,"" Harbir K Bhatia told PTI. ( Image credit : US Tech Industry Can't Survive Without Indians: SVC Chamber Of Commerce CEO | Unsplash ) Indians are leading the way in innovation in Silicon Valley ""Indians are leading the way in innovation in Silicon Valley. At one point, 40 per cent of Silicon Valley CEOs or founders were from South Asia or India. That's significant,"" she said. Based in Santa Clara, at the heart of Silicon Valley, the Chamber of Commerce consists of visionary business leaders from various cities who help shape the area's future. ""Here you can be yourself and be creative without worrying about your skin colour, religion, caste, or culture,"" she said. ALSO READ: US Banking Giant First Citizens Bank Agrees To Buy Collapsed Silicon Valley Bank Indians are leading major corporations Bhatia noted that Indians are leading major corporations like Google, YouTube, Google Foundation, and Microsoft. ""They're either at the CXO level or they're CEOs. That's not by chance,"" she said. Indians bring strong values like hard work and productivity to their work, she added. ""If you get a 98 per cent in school, your parents will ask why you didn't get 100 per cent. That's our culture. It's never enough, and that aspiration is what sets us apart,"" she said. While acknowledging that other ethnicities share similar values, Bhatia emphasized that this drive is integral to Indian culture. 'Jugaad' mentality Talking about the Indian approach to problem-solving, she praised the ' jugaad ' mentality, known for its frugal and flexible approach. ""When there's a problem, put an Indian on it, and you'll find a solution,"" she said. Regarding Silicon Valley's relationship with India, she highlighted India's role in the industry's success. ""Outsourcing to India is still a major part of the tech industry. The three-to-one model, where one American employee costs as much as three employees in India, helps tech companies thrive in the US,"" she explained. Indians bring valuable skills to various professions, from tech to farming to healthcare, she concluded.

They're a great place for new investors to start. Meanwhile, a seasoned investor can often find an ETF that helps them round out their portfolio or boost their returns. So, let's have a look at three technology ETFs that I think are worth consideration for growth-oriented investors. Image source: Getty Images. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund First up is the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK 0.85% ) . This ETF is one of the largest tech-sector ETFs in the world, with over $65 billion in net assets. What's more, with a track record dating back to the 1990s, this is one of the oldest tech ETFs around.

However, potential investors need to note how top-heavy those holdings are; Microsoft and Apple alone account for 42% of the fund's overall holdings. Company Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Microsoft MSFT 22.9% Apple AAPL 19.3% Broadcom AVGO 4.5% Nvidia NVDA 4.5% Advanced Micro Devices AMD 3.1% Salesforce CRM 3.1% Adobe ADBE 2.4% Accenture ACN 2.3% Cisco Systems CSCO 2.1% Oracle ORCL 2.1% Turning to performance, the fund has generated an amazing 20.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last decade, easily outpacing the S&P 500 's 12.5% CAGR over the same period. Moreover, the fund's expense ratio of 0.09% is great. It's one of the lowest expense ratios available for a sector-focused ETF, and it means investors will pay only $9 per year for every $10,000 invested in the fund. VanEck Semiconductor ETF Next up is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF ( SMH 2.16% ) . As the name implies, this fund focuses on all facets of the semiconductor sector, including chip designers, manufacturers, and foundries. Expand NASDAQ : SMH VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF Today's Change ( -2.16 %) $ -7.74 Current Price $ 351.05 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 349.74 - $ 356.04 52wk Range $ 170.11 - $ 372.78 Volume 7.7M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A With semiconductors now appearing in more places than ever -- your smartphone, your car, perhaps even your refrigerator -- it's been a great time to own semiconductor stocks .

Turning to costs, investors in the fund are assessed an expense ratio of 0.35%. While that's not terrible, it's also not the lowest fee around for tech-sector ETFs. In other words, you do pay up for quality when it comes to this ETF. Invesco QQQ Trust Last is the Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ 0.27% ) . Now, strictly speaking, this fund is not a pure tech ETF; its holdings include stocks like Costco , PepsiCo , and Marriott International .

Moreover, this fund, also known as ""the QQQs,"" is one of my favorite ETFs. Here's why: It's loaded with great tech stocks. It's diverse but not over-diversified. The reason why it's not over-diversified is that the fund tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. That index comprises non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange, weighted by market cap, with some modifications. In other words, it's similar to the S&P 500 index but a little smaller, with a higher concentration of tech stocks and no financial stocks. Top holdings include many of the Magnificent Seven, among others: Company Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Microsoft MSFT 8.8% Apple AAPL 7.6% Nvidia NVDA 5.8% Alphabet GOOG/GOOGL 5.4% Amazon AMZN 5.3% Meta Platforms META 5% Broadcom AVGO 4.4% Tesla TSLA 2.4% Costco COST 2.3% Advanced Micro Devices AMD 1.8% In terms of performance, the fund has delivered an 18.4% CAGR over the last ten years, which far outpaces the returns of the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000. QQQ Total Return Level data by YCharts . Last, its expense ratio is reasonable: 0.20% -- meaning investors pay $20 per year for every $10,000 invested. To sum up, each of these tech-oriented ETFs offers something unique, but they are all worth considering for growth-seeking investors."

What can it do? This article is more than 1 year old Age verification technology and a ‘tech tax’ are among the proposals to address misinformation and misogynist content Get our morning and afternoon news emails , free app or daily news podcast The Albanese government says “doing nothing is not an option” in the face of the online harms highlighted by April’s Sydney stabbings and the crisis of violence against women. But after saying it would do something , determining exactly what the government will actually do to further regulate the big tech and social media space is still an open question. It’s never too early to chat to your kids about online safety | Sarah Ayoub Read more The federal government has numerous reviews, consultations and processes ongoing in various parts of the tech sector – some likely to come back and be resolved in coming weeks, others with results not expected until much later in the year. As the government considers how to address online misinformation and misogynist violent content, it has a plethora of recent suggestions about what could be done. Here are some avenues of tech reform the federal government could pursue. 1. Age assurance technology In its announcements on men’s violence on Wednesday , the government said it would provide budget funding for an age assurance technology pilot “to protect children from harmful content, like pornography and other age-restricted online services”. “The pilot will identify available age assurance products to protect children from online harm, and test their efficacy, including in relation to privacy and security,” it said. The idea has been mooted for some time, but previously rebuffed by the government. In a March 2023 report, the eSafety commissioner suggested a “roadmap on age verification”, including measures to prevent harm from pornography to children. In an August 2023 response, the government did not take up the call, saying age verification technology was “immature, but developing” at the time. The response said any such program must work reliably without circumvention, be able to be comprehensively implemented including where such content is hosted outside Australia and balance privacy and security risks while not introducing further privacy risks. “Age assurance technologies cannot yet meet all these requirements,” the government response read, noting that a decision to mandate age assurance “is not ready to be taken”. Wednesday’s pilot study announcement will “identify available products” and whether it now is able to be implemented. A key sticking point would be how much personal data, such as identity documents, a person would have to supply – either to online platforms, third-party platforms or a centralised government database – to verify their age. 2. Misinformation code The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, on Tuesday said the government would introduce its contentious bill on online misinformation “later this year”. The bill – released as a draft last year but withdrawn after a backlash over free speech – was the first remedy raised by the Albanese government after harmful misinformation spread online following the Bondi Junction and Wakeley stabbings. Rowland said the government was having “constructive consultations with a number of parties” ahead of releasing the updated draft bill. “I think more than ever, the events that have gone on in terms of the stabbings in Bondi but also in western Sydney have highlighted how important it is to hold the platforms to account for their systems and processes that should address the spread of harmful misinformation,” she said. Soon after the Wakeley and Bondi Junction stabbings, Rowland told the Nine newspapers “doing nothing is not an option for any responsible government”. 3. News media bargaining code The government is under pressure to designate Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, TikTok and X under the news media bargaining code, which would compel those social media companies to negotiate deals with mainstream media outlets for the benefit they derive from news content on their platforms. The Greens’ communications spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says the government should designate the platforms. The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is awaiting advice from Treasury and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) about the effect of changes on news outlets and the social platforms. Jones said social media companies had a “social responsibility”, including to carrying news on their platforms. He added it would be “anti-democratic” if Facebook, for instance, repeated its 2021 behaviour in entirely removing news content during negotiations. 4. Regulate algorithms and recommender engines Several government processes looking at online reform have raised concerns about how social media algorithms serve harmful or violent content to users. A meeting of the online harm ministers criticised “algorithmic recommender systems that push content from ‘influencers’ who perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and condone violence against women” – while the terms of reference for the Online Safety Act review lists recommendation engines among the “harms raised by a range of emerging technologies”, alongside artificial intelligence and end-to-end encryption. Recommendation engines are central to the personalisation of online content. Guardian Australia understands the government is considering whether reforms to the Online Safety Act and the eSafety commissioner’s powers could compel social media platforms to block young people from seeing harmful or violent content. 5. Further limits on online abuse The eSafety review also raised the prospect of amending regulations around cyberbullying of children, non-consensual sharing of intimate images, cyber abuse of adults, or changing rules around material that depicts abhorrent violent conduct. After the Wakeley church stabbing, and the eSafety commissioner’s federal court action against X for hosting footage of the attack, the government is expected to closely consider whether those rules are fit for purpose. 6. A digital ‘coordination body’ Stepping into more novel approaches, a 2023 report of the Senate economics committee looking at the influence of global digital platforms received submissions suggesting a kind of overarching regulator for the tech space. Chaired by the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, the report recommended the federal government “establish a digital platforms coordination body”, raising concerns about “fragmentation” and overlap between current regulatory schemes, some with “competing priorities”. The report noted Greens senator David Shoebridge’s complaint that there was “no lead agency” in many areas. Some submissions called for greater resourcing of existing regulators such as the ACCC or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Others called for a new regulator with specific digital expertise, or a new parliamentary committee dedicated to online issues. The government response to the committee view noted ongoing work to strengthen existing processes. 7. A ‘tech tax’ To further regulate the online platforms, Hanson-Young has also called on the government to “tax them properly”, as well as setting up new rules for owners. “Comprehensive media reform is needed to ensure we have media regulation that is fit for purpose and covers both the tech giants and modern media corporations. A ‘fit and proper person test’ should be enforced for large media proprietors and social media giants,” she said recently. There have been suggestions higher taxes could be used to directly fund public interest journalism. The Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D) thinktank recently put forward a new digital platform tax , to fund news media to confront the “rising tide of misinformation and disinformation”.

Read our privacy notice . Shoreditch was once touted as London’s answer to Silicon Valley, so how has it fared over the last 15 years, and is it still the heart of London’s tech scene? It has now been 15 years since the phenomenon of small tech firms clustering around the Old Street Roundabout first began to attract the attention of the real estate industry. In 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to transform the area between Shoreditch and the Olympic Park into one of the “world’s great technology centres”, which sparked the creation of the Tech City initiative, with estimates suggesting that the number of tech start-ups increased from 85 to 5,000 in just two years. The area around Old Street Underground station acquired the nickname ‘ Silicon Roundabout ’, reflecting the grand plans for the area, and Google opened an incubator hub to ensure it identified and captured the best talent. However, Google shuttered its Shoreditch campus after Covid-19, which operated at a loss since its inception, suggesting it wanted to focus on start-ups across the UK. Also, TechHub, one of the area’s first dedicated coworking spaces, closed in 2020 citing unmanageable rent increases and falling demand related to the pandemic. So, with the pandemic behind us and the recovery under way, has Shoreditch lived up to the hype and has it become the tech hub that Cameron’s government had imagined? While the area experienced the anticipated rush of activity from London’s developers, construction has fallen away sharply in the last five years. After the announcement of the Tech City initiative, plans were laid for several large office schemes, and in the period between 2014 and 2018, almost 3 million square feet of new and refurbished office space was built. However, developers have pivoted away from offices to other sectors. In the five years to 2023, there has been only half of that amount delivered into the market, more than a third of which is vacant, significantly higher than the figure of just over 20% for Central London. This would normally suggest weakening tenant demand, particularly set against the narrative of London’s largest tech firms off-loading excess space. Demand has certainly increased over the last 15 years, although not at a noticeably greater rate than the rest of London. The area has, however, experienced significantly stronger net absorption. Since 2009, the area surrounding the Old Street Roundabout has gained around five times more demand than it has lost, compared to about half that rate across London. This has translated into healthy rental growth, particularly for 4 & 5-Star rated buildings, with the area outperforming the rest of London. Rents for good quality space around the Old Street Roundabout have increased by 70% in the last 15 years, while the same grade of buildings in the wider London market have seen rents grow by over 60%. While this increase is good news for landlords, there have been concerns that it may have priced out some of its most loyal occupiers. Demand from tech sector tenants has, however, remained solid. While the bulk of leasing activity in terms of absolute volumes has been from the financial and legal sectors, concentrated primarily towards Finsbury Square and the area to the north of Liverpool Street station, the tech sector has certainly increased its presence. When take-up is analysed against 2009 levels, tech outperforms most other sectors, and more recently tech businesses have been paying some of the highest rents such as cloud banking firm nCino which paid £75 per square foot for 18,000 square feet in 19 Crown Place in December. However, the top-performing sector by some margin is serviced office and co-working, which has led the way in terms of acquiring space. Last month Knotel paid more than £80 per square foot for 27,000 square feet at Hylo. The success of flexible workspace in an area so closely associated with the tech sector is unsurprising given that 60% of UK startups fail within the first three years and will often be less willing to enter into a traditional lease agreement. One of the themes of the last decade has been the erosion of London’s submarket boundaries as clustering becomes less important to business in the digital age. There are now few businesses which will concentrate a search on a relatively small geography, particularly when access to amenities and transport have become increasingly important for staff attraction and retention. However, for the tech sector at least, Silicon Roundabout appears to still be its spiritual home.

Microsoft is the only buy if investors must dabble in the tech sector, he said. Gross also questioned the rationale for owning bonds. Yields spiked Thursday after the GDP report. Bill Gross says investors should avoid tech stocks. In a post on X , the ""bond king"" said, ""Stick to value stocks, avoid tech for now."" His message comes as a weaker-than-expected GDP report also showed that consumer prices remained high in the first quarter. Bond yields jumped on the data, and the tech sector dropped, with the Nasdaq Composite down more than 1% Thursday afternoon. Gross said that if investors have to dabble in tech, go with Microsoft: ""MSFT best in tech if you must."" Expectations for the tech titan's earnings after the bell on Thursday are high as Wall Street eyes momentum in its Azure, Copilot, and office 365 units . Gross also questioned owning bonds, with the 10-year above 4.7% on Thursday after the GDP report. The billionaire investor said he owns stock in Western Midstream Partners and energy infrastructure firm MPLX. Bill Gross has been cool on the AI craze that's gripped Wall Street. He previously told investors that the AI frenzy is showing signs of "" excessive exuberance ."" The stock market has had its worst month of the year in April. Another hot inflation print in March has prompted a reappraisal of the Federal Reserve's path of monetary policy, with Wall Street dialing down expectations for rate cuts. Tech earnings haven't been enough to kickstart a new rally. Tesla reported dismal results but the stock rose on plans for a cheaper vehicle model in the works. Meta, however, disappointed investors with weak guidance in its earnings report on Wednesday. The stock sold off sharply, down by over 10% late Thursday, helping to drag the tech sector lower.

But once in their 30s many women find themselves squeezed out of promotion opportunities. Photo / Getty Images A study of 200 women working in the tech sector has found they face issues including “microaggression” and difficulty gaining promotions - even if technology firms have got more balanced in recruiting grads. The research, conducted by Meena Satishkumar, founder of new non-profit Tech Beyond Gender, found: 48 per cent said they faced situations where gender influenced their opportunities for career advancement; 7 per cent said their gender had significantly limited their opportunities; 48 per cent had encountered “gender-related microaggression”. The study defines “microaggression” as “a subtle, often unintentional, and indirect form of discrimination or bias that communicates derogatory or negative messages to individuals based on their gender or personal characteristics”. From her own experience working in senior tech roles in banking, and interviews with the 200 women surveyed, Satishkumar told the Herald that tech had balanced recruitment out of universities. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But once women and gender minorities got into their 30s, training, networking and mentoring opportunities could be harder to access than male colleagues. “And if you do get to a conference, there are few opportunities for women to present.” The net result was that there were few female candidates for senior tech roles like principal engineer or solution architect. “We have to stop the leaky pipe,” she said. There needed to be sensitivity training, and organisations had to stop being shy of discussing the issue, she said. There also needed to be more mentoring and training opportunities for women and gender minorities. Challenges, but improving A major survey of New Zealand’s tech workforce, carried out by MBIE and NZTech in the midst of the pandemic, found major diversity challenges. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Only 27 per cent of the IT workforce is female, only 4 per cent Māori, and only 2.8 per cent Pacific people. A restricted pool of candidates was exacerbating a skills squeeze. Some areas of tech are particularly challenged. A 2023 NZ Game Developers Association member survey found video game makers had just 22 per cent female staff. This week, NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller - whose organisation counts most tech firms in New Zealand among its members - said “the tech sector is very aware of its diversity challenge”. Things were heading in the right direction. “Back at the turn of the century it was estimated that only 20 per cent of the tech workforce were female. By 2017 this had improved to 27 per cent of the workforce, and the 2022 survey saw a further improvement to 29 per cent.” Muller said efforts to monitor and improve diversity had been ramped up. NZTech has created an equity, diversity and inclusion board, which is helping tech firms assess their current environment so they can actively work on improvements. “The sector also struggles with diversity from a Māori and Pacific peoples perspective and fortunately a number of great initiatives have emerged which are making a positive change, including Te Matarau, Te Hapori Matihiko, Sisters in Tech and Fibre Fale,” Muller said. NZTech is also undertaking research with Unlock Innovation on the opportunities and challenges for the neurodiverse in tech. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “Ultimately, this is a large complex problem that needs to change, but it is exciting to see so many people doing so many positive things to help create a better tech sector for all New Zealanders,” Muller said. More women, more profit TechWomen executive director Yvonne Gill said Satishkumar’s research was “a really useful addition to the understanding of the challenge”. Her group, whose executive team is drawn from AWS, Datacom, Microsoft and others, holds an annual ShadowTech day for young girls to spend a day with Tech Women to see first-hand what a tech role is like. To support women already in tech roles, it runs a large mentoring programme. Shadowing “The TechWomen community now consists of almost 1000 women and men who are doing their part to help make the tech sector better for everyone,” Gill said. “We have more than 900 young women each year take part in ShadowTech to be inspired to study for a tech career, so it is vitally important that we continue to work on improvements at a company level so when they arrive they have a great experience.” TechWomen also runs a programme called Mentoring Circles for experienced tech women to help each other, and help their companies improve diversity. “Our next mission is to show the economic benefit from a more diverse tech team to create even more motivation for change,” Gill said. “Internationally it is estimated that firms with gender balance in their senior teams are 42 per cent more profitable.” Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

Advertisement ""After the call,"" Zelensky stated, ""all the dots have been dotted in the agreements on ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) for Ukraine."" While the agreements signed with NATO countries like Britain, France, and Germany are not mutual defense pacts, they hold significant symbolic importance. They demonstrate the West's commitment to supporting Ukraine militarily, politically, and financially in the face of the ongoing Russian invasion, now in its third year. These longer-range missiles, with a maximum range of around 300 kilometers (190 miles), were first delivered to Ukraine last year. The agreement is seen as a significant enhancement of Kyiv's battlefield capabilities. Other Topics of Interest Legal Shield for Foreign Fighters: Russia a Hideout for International Criminals?

Previously, the versions of ATACMS supplied to Ukraine had a range capped at 165 kilometers, due to concerns about supplying powerful weapons that could potentially reach deeper into Russian territory.

The gains followed a drop in markets on Friday following tensions in the region. The healthcare sector led the way with the highest gains, while energy fared the worst. The top movers were South32 and Seek, and the worst performers were Bellevue Gold and Regis Resources.

N By Nadia Daly The price of gold has surged and international experts believe prices could more than triple by the end of the current cycle. Why? Well there are a number of reasons but as ABC reporters Tara de Landgrafft, Jarrod Lucas, and Nadia Mitsopoulos explain, gold is touted as the ultimate store of value and in periods of global turmoil, prices have typically gone up. Private wealth investor Phil George said: ""Gold is a safe haven that investors will gravitate to during times of uncertainty"" Amid rising interest rates, an upcoming US presidential election and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — all of which have come hot on the heels of a global pandemic — and it is fair to say there is no shortage of global uncertainty. Take a closer look at what's driving demand for gold: Key Event 22 Apr 2024, 4:56am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 4:56am Federal environmental assessments under the spotlight N By Nadia Daly Korean owned energy company Ark Energy has announced it has withdrawn its proposal for a major wind farm project. The company said it had received information that the Wooroora Station wind farm project — which had been in the federal environmental assessment process for almost three years – was unlikely to be given the green light. Loading It's thrown a spotlight on federal environmental laws which the Clean Energy Investor Group has called the ""single biggest challenge for delivering renewable energy projects"" in Australia, as national regional affairs reporter Jane Norman explains in this in-depth article: 22 Apr 2024, 4:20am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 4:20am When will interest rates start to go down? N By Nadia Daly That's the question everyone wants a concrete answer to. Researchers at HSBC say four things need to happen in order for central banks to start cutting, in order of priority: sub-trend GDP growth, rising unemployment rates towards or above 'equilibrium', wage growth falling towards 3.5%, and core inflation below 3% and on a path to 2%. The latest US CPI data means the timing of a rate cut is a little uncertain and faces possible delay there. But HSBC predicts the three major central banks will still cut rates from June: the ECB on 6 June, the Fed on 12 June and the BoE on 20 June. They forecast all three will then cut by 25 basis points per quarter. Though the analysts note there is some variance in their predictions for each central bank: ""For the Fed, stalling disinflation risks are pushing rate cuts past June. ""The ECB's guidance suggests that a June cut is still virtually nailed on, while there's a debate on a second cut in July. ""For the BoE, our conviction in the prospect of cuts lies somewhere in between."" Key Event 22 Apr 2024, 3:56am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 3:56am Star wants to change its ""customer is always right"" culture N By Nadia Daly A top executive at Star Entertainment says the casino group is ""on a journey"" to change its culture where until now the customer has ""always been right"". Star is facing a fresh inquiry into its suitability to hold a casino licence in Sydney after an earlier probe found the company wasn't moving quickly enough to resolve ethical and legal concerns about the business. The ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan is covering the Star inquiry and filed this report earlier today: 22 Apr 2024, 3:39am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 3:39am A fix coming for tragic ACBF/Youpla scandal that took millions from vulnerable Indigenous communities D By Daniel Ziffer One of the (many) scandals uncovered by the Banking Royal Commission was the ACBF or Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund — a funeral insurer that sold to Indigenous customers. It wasn't Aboriginal. It didn't benefit the community. Worse, the product played on people's fears about about the substantial costs of 'sorry business' in many communities — where family come from far away and stay for extended periods. But the 'insurance' didn't cover those costs, just the bare costs of a funeral, like a casket. As a result people were paying thousands and thousands more than they could ever claim. Media have been trying to hold ACBF to account for a long time. The royal commission kicked that along. The company re-branded as Youpla but fell over after it was barred from taking on new customers. The good news — among the bad — is that the federal government has stepped in. A new tender from the National Indigenous Australians Agency seeks the provision of Funeral Bonds for the Youpla Support Program ""The National Indigenous Australians Agency (the Agency) is publishing an open tender for the provision of a single, simple, low-risk funeral bond product for former policy holders of the Youpla Group as part of the Youpla Support Program (YSP). ""The YSP will provide a resolution payment to people who held a funeral insurance policy with the Youpla Group (also known as the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund) that was active anytime on or after 1 August 2015. Estimates based on available data indicate that approximately 13,700 persons held policies during this period. ""The program commences on 1 July 2024. Applications close on 30 June 2026."" The successful tenderer has to be able to demonstrate the capacity to provide the funeral bonds in a culturally appropriate manner and get to the remote and regional areas where many policy holders live. 22 Apr 2024, 2:46am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 2:46am Market snapshot N By Nadia Daly ASX 200: +1.3% to 7644 points (live values below) Australian dollar: +0.47% at 64.47 US cents Nikkei: +0.82% to 37,375 points Hang Seng: +2.45% to 16,628 points Shanghai: +0.25% to 3072 points Spot gold: -0.65% to $US2374/ounce Brent crude: -0.63% to $US86,73/barrel Bitcoin: +1.05% to $US64,739 Prices current around 12:40pm AEDT.

Key Event 22 Apr 2024, 1:52am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 1:52am TikTok voices free speech concerns as US bill to ban it passes House N By Nadia Daly The battle over social media platform TikTok continues in the US, where lawmakers are debating a bill to ban the app if the Chinese owner ByteDance doesn't sell its stake within a year. The House of Representatives passed legislation in favour of the ban this weekend by a margin of 360 to 58. It now moves to the Senate where it could be taken up for a vote in the coming days. President Joe Biden has previously said he would sign the legislation. TikTok sees the ban as censorship, saying it would: ""Trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans."" There is broad bipartisan support for the ban with proponents concerned the app poses national security risks because China could compel the company to share the data of its 170 million US users. TikTok insists it has never shared US data and never would. Key Event 22 Apr 2024, 1:30am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 1:30am NSW set to lose AAA credit rating with tough budget on the cards for June N By Nadia Daly Some news from our friends in NSW where the state government is preparing to hand down its budget in a few months.

Live updates on the major ASX indices: Key Event 22 Apr 2024, 12:55am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 12:55am ASX jumps more than 1 per cent amid broad-based gains M By Michael Janda The Australian share market has brushed off any US tech sector worries, with the ASX 200 index jumping 1.25% to 7,662 points in the first 45 minutes of trade. The gains have been broad based, with only energy and the one-company education sectors in the red. Healthcare has been the early leader, up 1.8%, with consumer non-cyclicals, industrials and financials also slightly beating the broader market. The top performing stock has been miner South32, up 5.2% to $3.555 on its latest quarterly production update. Iluka Resources and Nickel Industries were also strongly higher in early trade. ASX 200 top movers around 10:45am AEST. (Refinitiv) Energy producers dominated the bottom movers , as Israel's relatively limited strike on Iran reduced the risk of a widening Middle East conflict and disruptions to oil and gas supplies from the region. Brent crude was down at $US86.83 , having passed $US90 a barrel at times on Friday when there were concerns a more significant Israeli strike on Iranian soil was underway. ASX 200 bottom movers around 10:45am AEST. (Refinitiv) 22 Apr 2024, 12:11am Mon 22 Apr 2024 at 12:11am Could the ASX hit 8,300 by year-end? M By Michael Janda So new week what's in store for us markets are ok gold is very shiny so far so good what do you recon Michael - Rob Hi Rob, great question, but I'd generally rather stay away from making predictions on markets, as they could be misinterpreted by some as financial advice. However, I just received this interesting forecast from VanEck portfolio manager Cameron McCormack , who reckons the ASX 200 could finish the year at 8,300 — up from the current levels around 7,600. "" We see Australian mid-caps as being the star performer this year, outperforming the S & P/ASX 200,"" he tips. ""Smaller companies offer more upside potential through market share expansion and have historically outperformed in prolonged market recoveries. Valuations are attractive with 12 month forward price to earnings below the historical average. Mid-caps also reported the highest upside price target revisions during the February earnings season."" However, he's not such a fan of the banking sector, especially at current share prices. ""The market seems to be pricing a dream scenario for the banks, despite the risks of a flare-up in mortgage stress in a prolonged higher interest rate environment,"" he warns. "" Australia's banks are overvalued. Valuations are stretched and are the most expensive globally. Australia's banking sector is vulnerable to a correction and investors should be wary if they are overexposed."" Mr McCormack is also upbeat on commercial and office real estate, with many trading at low valuations due to the work-from-home trend continuing post-COVID. He thinks office occupancy rates are stabilising and may turn around. ""A paradoxical dynamic is likely where Australia records a soft landing but mortgage stress increases as rates stay higher for longer, further squeezing household budgets,"" he continues. ""However, Australia's migration surge will support retail spending and therefore consumer discretionary names such as Wesfarmers, JB HiFi and Super Retail Group . The sector reported strong net beats during the February earnings season and we anticipate this to continue."" And, Rob, as for gold, Mr McCormack is again bullish. "" We see gold going to US$2,600. Meanwhile, gold miners trading are at a 50% discount to gold, presenting a strong value opportunity ,"" he writes. ""Persistent inflation, potential bumpy economic path and heightened geo-political tensions could serve as a tailwind for gold miners."" Of course, this is just the view of one analyst and there will be plenty of others out there with very different opinions. 21 Apr 2024, 11:55pm Sun 21 Apr 2024 at 11:55pm Market snapshot M By Michael Janda ASX 200 futures: +0.4% to 7,621 points Australian dollar: +0.1% at 64.25 US cents S & P 500 (Friday): -0.9% to 4,967 points Nasdaq (Friday): -2.1% to 15,282 points FTSE (Friday): +0.2% to 7,896 points EuroStoxx (Friday): -0.1% to 499 points Spot gold: -0.2% to $US2,386/ounce Brent crude: -0.2% to $US87.12/barrel Iron ore (Friday): -0.8% to $US115.90/tonne Bitcoin: +1.3% to $US64,914 Prices current around 9:50am AEDT. Live updates on the major ASX indices: Key Event 21 Apr 2024, 11:12pm Sun 21 Apr 2024 at 11:12pm Nvidia's 10 per cent slump leads Nasdaq lower, but ASX set for gains M By Michael Janda Once again, the lack of a meaningful tech sector on the Australian share market looks set to insulate us from a major sell-off (just as it meant we missed out on the best of the tech boom run-up). The ASX SPI 200 futures are up 0.4% to 7,621 points . That's a partial rebound from Friday's fall, which was triggered by the initial reports of Israel's retaliatory strike for Iran's retaliatory strike, now that it appears Israel took a very limited response. However, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% on Friday , a substantial dive for some big names in the tech sector dragged the S & P 500 down 0.9% and saw a much bigger slump on the Nasdaq . ""Friday's 2% NASDAQ fall was led by a 10% fall in Nvidia's share price — albeit they don't report until late May — and 4% for Meta who, together with Tesla, Alphabet and Microsoft, report this week, also IBM, Intel, et al),"" writes NAB's head of FX strategy Ray Attrill. ""This has put a S & P500 re-weighted Mag[nificent]-7 index more than 8% off its 11 April highs. "" Tesla was off another 2% Friday to be 44% down from its start of year highs , to be danger of losing its membership of the Mag-7 club, in which respect news Sunday that Tesla is cutting the price of its revamped Model 3 by 5.7% may or may not please investors today. "" On the week, the NASDAQ is down 5.5% , losses only exceeded by the Nikkei (-6.2%) with the S & P500 off 3% on the week and the Shanghai 300 the only major index to have an 'up' week (1.9%)."" The volatility index is also slightly elevated, which isn't surprising given both the continuing tensions in the Middle East and the diminishing prospects of rate cuts soon. In times of volatility, it's best to be caffeinated (and to follow the ABC News markets blog). Loading"

Buy This Outstanding Vanguard ETF Instead . ,20240420T140000Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/771270/vanguard-etf-vgt-stock-investing-money.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"It's hard to find a stock that's performed better than Nvidia over the last five years. Since 2019, its stock has turned in a mind-boggling 79% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). That means that $10,000 invested five years ago would be worth $187,000 today. Unfortunately, there's no way to go back in time. So, what can investors do today to recreate some of that Nvidia lightning in a bottle? One way -- at least in part -- might be to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on the tech sector. So let's look today at the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) . Image source: Getty Images. What is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF? First things first. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is an exchange-traded fund, which means it is a tradeable basket of stocks focused on the tech sector. Top holdings include Microsoft , Apple , Broadcom , and, yes, Nvidia. Expand NYSEMKT : VGT Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF Today's Change ( -0.91 %) $ -7.07 Current Price $ 773.30 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 768.09 - $ 776.20 52wk Range $ 451.00 - $ 806.99 Volume 493K Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A Company Name Symbol Percentage of Assets Microsoft MSFT 18.3% Apple AAPL 15.4% Nvidia NVDA 11.8% Broadcom AVGO 4.2% Salesforce CRM 2.1% Advanced Micro Devices AMD 2.1% Adobe ADBE 1.7% Accenture ACN 1.6% Oracle ORCL 1.5% Cisco Systems CSCO 1.5% One important aspect of the fund is that it is an index ETF, meaning that it is not actively managed. Instead, the fund seeks to replicate the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Information Technology 25/50 Index -- a basket of small, medium, and large tech sector stocks. Thanks to this design, the fund's costs remain low, and, as a result, the fund's expense ratio is miniscule: 0.1%. That means for every $10,000 invested in the fund, investors pay only $10 a year in fees. Why is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF a smart investment? In general, ETFs can be a smart choice for most investors thanks to their built-in diversification. And in the case of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, investors gain exposure to a broad array of tech stocks for a minimal fee. Granted, the fund is top-heavy, with roughly 45% of its holdings concentrated in Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. However, that may not necessarily be a bad thing. Over the past five years, each of those stocks has walloped the S&P 500 . NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts In any event, holding shares of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a way for investors to gain exposure to Nvidia while not owning Nvidia shares outright. That can be useful, particularly if investors want to lessen portfolio volatility. Furthermore, since the fund owns hundreds of stocks, including small caps, there is upside potential, particularly if one of those small-cap stocks turns into the ""next Nvidia."" Finally, there is the passive income. True, the fund's dividend yield is meager: a mere 0.7%. However, that is more dividend income than an investor would get by owning Nvidia shares alone, which have a dividend yield of only 0.2%. Is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF a buy now? The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a well-constructed, affordable ETF that is a smart buy for many investors. That said, it's not for every portfolio. In particular, its high concentration of tech stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in particular -- make it unsuitable for investors with outsize exposure to those stocks already. Moreover, given the fund's undersize dividend yield, income-seeking investors would be wise to look elsewhere. However, for those looking for a tech-centered ETF with a low expense ratio, this fund is one to keep in mind. Indeed, it could be an excellent vehicle for investors who may have missed out on Nvidia's incredible five-year run but don't want to miss out on the next great tech stock."

AFP via Getty Images News that Women Who Code—a non-profit organization dedicated to building community for women in the tech sector—is shutting its doors has prompted fears of progress toward gender equality reversing in an industry still blighted by sexism. According to its website , Women Who Code most recently had 360,000 people in its community, across 145 countries. On social media, those affiliated with the organization expressed shock, disbelief and sadness at the closure. Many paid tribute to the group by sharing anecdotes of how it had in recent years helped them to persevere in the sector. In a press release, Women Who Code attributed its decision to shutter to a lack of funding. “This decision has not been made lightly,” the organization wrote. “It only comes after careful consideration of all options and is due to factors that have materially impacted our funding sources—funds that were critical to continuing our programming and delivering on our mission.” Women Who Code , according to its website, was initially founded as a community group in 2011 by a small team of engineers in San Francisco. Its mission was to give women the chance to connect and support each other as they collectively navigate the tech industry—a space in which men still outnumber women, especially in senior positions. In 2013, Women Who Code, Inc., was registered as a non-profit organization in California. Five years later it moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. Women held just 35% of tech jobs in the U.S. at the end of 2023, according to the WomenTech Network . A McKinsey report published last year showed that while women earn about half of science and engineering degrees, they make up less than 20 percent of people employed in these fields. The report also found that in tech roles, only 52 women are promoted to manager for every 100 men. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor ‘The Value of Networking’ As women took to social media to bemoan the closure of Women Who Code, employment experts and other advocates of gender equality in the industry also expressed concerns that women in tech industry might be losing an important resource. “The value of networking organizations for underrepresented groups has been very well established,” said Portia Hickey, an organizational psychologist based in the U.K. “These networks are important as they provide role models for women and other under-represented groups. Role models are incredibly powerful, not only because they show that it is possible to be female and have a successful career in tech, but also behavioral modeling of how to be successful—sharing strategies for how to tackle various aspects of being a woman in tech,” she added. “Through these networks one person can inspire a great many people and they really have the potential to lead to a meaningful increase in representation,” she said. Riaz Moola, founder and chief executive officer of HyperionDev , an online coding bootcamp, agreed that the closure deals a blow to efforts to make the sector more inclusive. “This situation highlights that getting more women into tech roles remains a systemic issue that requires multi-pronged efforts from organizations, companies, and educational institutions,” he said. He noted however, that investors should not be discouraged from investing in initiatives like Women Who Code, “as in the long term, diversity in the tech industry must be a given.” Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust , added 0.5% while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Indus0.5%trial Average ETF Trust gained 0.8%. QQQ, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust which mirrors the Nasdaq, rose 0.3% as investors looked ahead to tech earnings. Investors are looking to the tech sector today for optimism. Netflix is the first of the megacap (companies with a market capitalization of roughly $200 billion or more) technology companies set to report first quarter corporate earnings after the bell. Tech companies have led the markets this year despite a higher-for-longer rate environment that typically keeps them under pressure. XLK, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (which despite not holding Netflix remains a tech sector barometer), fluctuated between higher and lower ahead of Netflix's earnings. The fund is up 5% for the year, and a whopping 37% since last year. XLG, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF which holds Netflix in its fund, jumped nearly half a percentage point on Thursday morning. XLK 1-Year Chart Source: etf.com SQQQ, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ —which bets that tech stock prices will drop—was in the red ahead of tech earnings, sinking about a half-percentage point.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> Here are the key points: We are off to a good start in the Q1 earnings season, with the earnings growth pace modestly accelerating from the trend line of the last few quarters, though revenue growth remains on a decelerating trend, and positive surprises are tracking below historical average levels. Importantly, earnings estimates are going up. Total earnings for the 48 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +9.5% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 77.1% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. The earnings growth pace for these 48 index members represents an acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods, though the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking modestly below the 12-quarter averages for this group of 48 index members. For the Finance sector, we now have Q1 results for 39.7% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance companies are up +4.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and the same proportion beating revenue estimates. A notable favorable development on the earnings front is signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend, with estimates in the aggregate starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates. This new development has roughly coincided with the start of the Q1 earnings season. That said, a number of sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates relative to what was expected at the start of the year. The Energy sector is now enjoying favorable estimate revisions as well, as you can see in the revisions charts for Exxon XOM and Chevron CVX below. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Chevron’s current full-year 2024 EPS estimate of $13.56 is down from $15.28 at the end of 2023, but it is up from $13.04 at the end of March 2024. As with Chevron, estimates for Exxon have been going up as well, with the oil major’s $9.70 EPS estimate up +6.5% over the last two weeks. Unlike the Energy sector, whose revisions trend has just turned positive, the Tech sector has been enjoying a favorable revisions trend for some time now. The chart below shows how the aggregate full-year earnings estimate for the sector has evolved over the past year. Story Continues Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The chart below shows how S&P 500 aggregate earnings estimates for full-year 2024 have evolved. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Below, we show the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research A big part of this year’s earnings growth is expected to come from margins reversing last year’s declines and starting to expand again. The expectation is that aggregate net margins this year get back to the 2022 level, with the Tech sector driving most of the gains. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The fact Ireland is only one of two countries in the EU27 that does not legally compel companies to engage in collective bargaining mean union busting practices are commonplace, Communications Workers Union (CWU) conference in Galway heard today. This is a modern country in the EU and we put ourselves forward on the world stage as progressive but when it comes to our workers we are not what we claim to be, attendees were told. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - April 17th Fionnuala Ni Bhrogain, head of organising and campaigning at the CWU, told the Irish Independent that many multinationals, including tech giants, have based their European operations in Ireland because, legally, they don’t have to recognise unions. “There is a spectrum of union busting before being a worker is sacked (for trade union organising). This includes everything from having your hours reduced, being isolated or even being called out in meetings and being denied training. “We also have contractual non-disclosure agreements, which require workers not to talk about pay with each other or with trade unions. “Certainly in redundancies in the tech sector, we are trying to support workers who are asking to be represented in their individual meetings and they are being told you can’t have union representation in your meetings. “Even when we look after them in an unfair dismissals claim and we win, they are still out of work and the union campaign is killed because other workers see what happens. “In the tech sector, workers will receive an email that there will be hundreds of lay-offs and you need to elect amongst your peers someone who will go and negotiate on your behalf. “This happened to 890 staff at Accenture, they had no trade union representatives whatsoever. “So you have experienced senior management teams on one side of the table and someone who was elected a few days before to represent hundreds of their colleagues. “Without the collective power of a trade union behind them, they can’t effect any change on the consultation process. “They are told what the redundancy package is, they go through the motions of the process and they are gone. “Up until the pandemic and the changes that came in the world of work and then mass layoffs, a lot of the workers in tech sector believed genuinely they were in good employment and had direct engagement with management. “But they have increasingly become aware that when the rubber hits the road and real issues are at stake and they want to be represented collectively that they cannot exercise that right in Ireland at all. “And the multinational companies are based her primarily for that reason. They know they can come to Ireland for that reason that they will not be compelled to collectively bargain with a union. “We are one of only two countries in the EU 27 where there is no right to collective bargaining in Ireland. An employer still has a veto. We can go all the way to the Labour Court with a group of workers and an employer can say, No, we won’t attend. “Even if 100pc of their workers have memberships with that union, they can still say no to collective bargaining. “The workers in the 999 call answering service, which is a state contract, have been fighting for years and BT and will collectively bargain with their workers in the North of Ireland because the legislation requires it but in the Republic of Ireland where they are not legally required, they simply say no.” Why you can Trust the Irish Independent: Learn about Editorial Guidelines and AI Use Latest Irish News latest | Catherine Connolly vows all voices will be ‘heard and valued’ as she becomes 10th president Catherine Connolly ‘humbly and proudly' becomes the 10th president of Ireland Mary Regan: Catherine Connolly puts political leaders on notice that she won’t shy away from using her voice In pictures: Catherine Connolly officially becomes Ireland’s tenth president at Dublin Castle ceremony Nurse admits misconduct over taking photo of organ retrieval surgery and posting it on social media Man (38) admits manslaughter of grandmother who was dragged down stairs Five gardaí attempted to quash road traffic offences for motorists, trial told GP guilty of professional misconduct after failing to spot meningitis in baby Man (55) pleads not guilty by reason of insanity to murder of mother in Kerry Stepmother accused of child’s murder changes plea to guilty on fourth day of trial Show more Top Stories Politics Mary Regan: Catherine Connolly puts political leaders on notice that she won’t shy away from using her voice Celebrity News Dónal Lynch: It’s time to get Tubs in from the wilderness.

ETFs usually represent a specific sector or theme in the stock market, and they are typically actively managed, which means a team of experts will adjust the portfolio as necessary. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) manages a $4.3 billion portfolio filled with the world's leading technology stocks, including those driving the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Image source: Getty Images. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector (IGM) ETF just completed a stock split The IGM ETF has generated a compound annual return of 19.7% over the last 10 years, which crushes the 12.8% annual return of the S&P 500 index. It's also better than the 18.6% annual gain in the Nasdaq-100 technology index. The ETF soared as high as $512 per share in March, which is a large outlay for most retail investors. To solve that problem, iShares executed a 6-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation sixfold and reduced the price per share by a proportional amount (to around $85 as of this writing). The split doesn't change the value of the ETF or any of its underlying holdings, but it does make it accessible to a wider investor base. That spells opportunity, because IGM's momentum will likely continue thanks to tailwinds like AI. Here's how it could turn an investment of $500 per month into $1 million over the long term, thanks to top holdings like Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . The world's top tech stocks, all in one ETF The technology sector grows broader each year thanks to innovative companies digitizing our economy. Smartphones, semiconductors, cloud computing, streaming, cybersecurity, software, and AI are just a few subsegments under the tech umbrella. AI is particularly important right now because of its potential to make individuals and businesses more productive. AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can generate text content, images, videos, and even computer code. The data center and semiconductor hardware underpinning those applications are also driving a flurry of innovation. All up, Wall Street thinks the AI industry could add somewhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy within a decade. The IGM ETF is a great bet if those projections prove accurate. It holds 287 different tech stocks, but it's heavily weighted toward its top five positions, which account for 40.3% of the total value of its portfolio: Story Continues Stock IGM ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Apple 9.03% 2. Microsoft 8.92% 3. Meta Platforms 8.64% 4. Nvidia 8.23% 5. Alphabet 5.51% Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 12, 2024, and are subject to change. With 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, Apple could become more central to how users access AI. The company is developing its own AI chips for the iPhone, and it's also in talks with AI leaders like Alphabet's Google and OpenAI to make their chatbots the default option on each of its devices. Microsoft, on the other hand, is already at the front of the AI pack thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI last year. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms also use AI in several ways. The technology powers its content recommendation engine to feed users more of the posts they enjoy viewing, and it also helps businesses craft more engaging ads. Plus, Meta continues to develop one of the world's largest open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which could lead to several exciting new features on Facebook and Instagram in the future. Nvidia needs little introduction. It makes the most powerful data center chips for AI workloads, and it's now the third-largest company in the world. Alphabet is also making strides in AI, with its latest Gemini models outperforming OpenAI's GPT-4 models by most benchmarks. Outside of the IGM ETF's top five holdings, it owns a stake in a number of other exciting tech companies like Netflix , Advanced Micro Devices , Oracle , and Micron Technology . Turning $500 per month into $1 million The IGM ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 10.6% since it was established in 2001. The proliferation of technologies like the smartphone, cloud computing, and AI have driven a much stronger 19.7% annual return over the last 10 years. The table below shows the potential returns an investor could earn by investing $500 in the ETF every month over 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years under three scenarios: The ETF continues to return 10.6% each year over the long term. The ETF delivers an average annual gain of 15.2% (midpoint of scenarios 1 and 3). The ETF maintains its 10-year average annual return of 19.7%. Monthly Investment Compound Annual Return Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 10.6% $107,453 $414,727 $1,297,516 $500 15.2% $141,558 $780,382 $3,673,479 $500 19.7% $188,002 $1,511,184 $10,848,739 Calculations by author. A monthly investment of $500 for 30 years would lead to a balance of almost $1.3 million, even with an average annual return of just 10.6%. Considering the AI industry is still in its infancy -- with trillions of dollars in estimated potential yet to be unlocked -- there is a good possibility the IGM ETF will deliver a long-term average annual return more reflective of scenarios 2 and 3. However, no investment is risk-free, not even an ETF with 287 different holdings. If AI fails to live up to the hype, many of the stocks in IGM's portfolio could deliver negative returns for a period of time, which will drag down the overall performance of the ETF. Therefore, it's a good idea to own this ETF as part of a balanced portfolio. Should you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF right now?

The Big Apple posted a 3.6% net gain in tech talent, meaning more workers relocated to the city than left to pursue opportunities, according to an analysis released by venture capital firm SignalFire. The gain was the largest of any city in the country, with New York “claiming 15% of all people who moved” for tech jobs, SignalFire researchers Asher Bantock and Heather Doshay wrote in the report released Monday. That’s despite the fact that New York City has one of the highest costs of living in the country. New York City is in the midst of a tech talent boom, according to SignalFire. Friends Stock – stock.adobe.com “Anecdotally, we hear movers reference the ‘energy’ of the city – both professionally and socially,” Doshay told The Post. “You would think people moving from high-cost-of-living cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Boston would disperse to lower-cost-of-living metro areas – and in many cases they are with moves to places like Austin,” Doshay added. “But for a lot of tech professionals, they don’t want to sacrifice perceived career and social opportunities at any cost.” The study was based on a set of LinkedIn data that tracked approximately 57,000 relocating employees at a selection of the largest tech companies and some private firms. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the data. New York beat out other top contenders such as Austin, Texas, which posted a net gain of 1.4%, and Los Angeles at 0.6%. Other cities that experienced net-positive tech relocations included Denver, San Diego and Miami. Meanwhile, traditional Big Tech hubs were saw an exodus of tech workers. That included San Francisco, which experienced a net loss of 3.7% among relocating tech industry staffers, and Seattle, which took a 2.3% hit. Tech workers who left the San Francisco Bay Area were most likely to move to New York City, the analysis showed. New York City gained the largest share of relocating tech workers. ImageFlow – stock.adobe.com Despite a net outflow of tech workers, a SignalFire representative noted that San Francisco remains the national leader in tech industry talent – especially as the artificial intelligence boom gets underway. San Francisco also had the highest share of employees who work in AI or machine-learning among the top 10 metro areas measured in SignalFire’s report, followed by Seattle and New York City. Despite the outflows, San Francisco’s total tech headcount is still growing as workers from outside the industry switch career paths, according to SignalFire. “San Francisco remains the leader in terms of tech talent concentration, but New York is clearly gaining ground,” Doshay added. New York attracted more talent even as the tech industry saw a wave of job cuts last year , with industry giants such as Amazon, Google and Meta among the firms that conducted layoffs."

According to a survey carried out by the Kent A. Clark Center for Global Markets of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, only 2% of those polled said they strongly agreed with the fact that the European legislation could substantially put European tech companies at a disadvantage compared to their competitors, while 16% said they disagreed with this forecast. Uncertainty however prevailed, with 31% of those interviewed saying they were undecided about the impact which the AI Act could have on the European tech sector and 35% failing to provide an answer. Economist Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, for instance, stressed how ""the complexity of tasks necessary to satisfy the regulation"", a huge framework of rules on artificial intelligence, could lead some companies to ""move out of the EU"". On the other hand, Jan Eeckhout, a professor at Barcelona's Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) said the so-called 'Brussels effect' could instead push tech companies to ""adopt the EU's regulation at a global level"". Experts also had a more positive opinion on the impact the AI Act could have on research and innovation. A reported 24% of those polled said they believe the European legislation could strengthen research and innovation, while 6% disagreed with such a forecast and 2% strongly disagreed. About 22% were undecided while the percentage of those who didn't respond remained unvaried, the poll found. Among sceptics, British economist Franklin Allen of Imperial College London said it is ""very difficult to write a clear ensemble of rules for something as new and dynamic as AI"". Chicago Booth professor Christian Leuz, instead, thought the new system of rules on AI ""limits some developments and innovations, which can be adequate depending on externalities and risks"".

And while debates about Nvidia versus Advanced Micro Devices , or Intel over Qualcomm , or Amazon compared to Microsoft are certainly worth having, there's a far simpler way to invest in AI: exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLK 0.85% ) , Invesco QQQ ETF ( QQQ 0.27% ) , and the iShares Semiconductor ETF ( SOXX 2.27% ) are all worthy foundational holdings for unlocking baseline exposure to AI stocks. Here's a breakdown of each ETF to help you determine which is best for you. Image source: Getty Images. The perfect ETF for letting winners run With $65.4 billion in net assets, the Technology Select Sector SPDR is one of the most common, simplest, and least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector. As of April 4, 40.1% of the fund was in software companies; 26.7% was in semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies; 21.2% in technology hardware, storage, and peripherals; 5.4% in IT services; 3.8% was allocated in communication equipment companies, and 2.9% in electronic equipment instruments and components companies. However, a lot of the ETF is concentrated in just a few companies. Microsoft and Apple make up 42.8% of the entire fund, with Nvidia, Broadcom , and AMD dominating the semiconductor allocation with 11.9% of the fund's total weighting. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is a bet that today's top tech companies will also be the future leaders in AI. This has so far been a winning strategy because the tech leaders have the deep pockets, personnel, and innovation pipelines to make mistakes and capitalize on opportunities . The fund is exposed to smaller, disruptive players taking market share from the current front-runners. It is also vulnerable to an overall valuation correction in the tech sector. The fund's 39.1 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a considerable premium to the S&P 500's 28.3 P/E. However, the tech sector has a track record of growing into a lofty multiple. With just a 0.09% expense ratio, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund stands out as a good choice for investors looking for widespread exposure to AI from leading tech companies rather than picking a single winner. Expand NYSEMKT : XLK Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund Today's Change ( -0.85 %) $ -2.52 Current Price $ 293.01 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 291.06 - $ 294.11 52wk Range $ 172.45 - $ 305.99 Volume 7.4M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A Expanding beyond tech The Invesco QQQ ETF is massive, with $259.3 billion in net assets. It mirrors the performance of the Nasdaq 100, which consists of the 100 largest companies by market cap in the Nasdaq Composite . There is some crossover with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. But the key difference is that the Invesco QQQ isn't limited to the tech sector; it is also less top-heavy in just a few holdings. For example, Microsoft and Apple are the highest-weighted stocks in this ETF -- just like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. But their combined weighing is just 16.3% in the Invesco QQQ. The Invesco QQQ has less exposure to the tech sector and less emphasis on the semiconductor industry, but it does have far more diversification. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund excludes companies like Amazon, Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Tesla , and others because they are in non-tech sectors like consumer discretionary and communications. A downside of the Invesco QQQ is that it includes a lot of companies that have little to do with AI. The ninth-largest holding in the fund is Costco Wholesale . PepsiCo isn't far behind as the 12th largest. This ETF isn't targeting a special theme; it is simply looking at the largest companies in the Nasdaq Composite no matter the industry. It's a good starting point if you are looking for diversification and a growth focus, but it might not be well suited for investors who are specifically targeting an AI financial product. Expand NASDAQ : QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Today's Change ( -0.27 %) $ -1.66 Current Price $ 621.57 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 617.52 - $ 622.72 52wk Range $ 402.39 - $ 637.01 Volume 45M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A Investing in AI through the semiconductor industry The iShares Semiconductor ETF is a good fit for investors who want to target AI investment specifically through the lens of chip stocks. The demand for computational power is on the rise due to the needs of complex AI models. Nvidia is supplying processing power through its data center business. AMD is competing with Nvidia in the GPU market and is making CPUs for AI-enabled PCs. Taiwan Semiconductor helps manufacture chips for top players like Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Intel. Broadcom makes networking chips that allow AI components to work together . The advantage of the iShares Semiconductor ETF is that it is a direct way to invest in this need for more computing power from various markets. The ETF is surprisingly diversified. For example, Nvidia is the largest holding at 8.6%, but the top 10 holdings in the ETF make up 57.4%. With 30 total holdings, that means the bottom 20 make up 42.6% of the fund -- which is much more balanced compared to the other ETFs in this article. The iShares ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio, so it's higher than 0.2% from the Invesco QQQ and 0.09% from the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. But if most of your AI interests are in the chip space, this ETF is one of the best options out there. Expand NASDAQ : SOXX iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF Today's Change ( -2.27 %) $ -6.85 Current Price $ 295.15 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 294.69 - $ 300.02 52wk Range $ 148.31 - $ 312.79 Volume 5.9M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A Using AI ETFs to your advantage Each of these ETFs offers unique ways to invest in AI, but it's important to use ETFs in a way that fits your portfolio's allocation. For example, if you are satisfied with your existing positions in Microsoft and Apple, then you probably wouldn't want to invest in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund since over 40 cents of every dollar invested goes into those two stocks. Understanding the composition of an ETF can help you avoid accidentally overexposing your portfolio to a particular theme or company. Perhaps the simplest reason to choose an ETF over an individual stock is because you aren't as familiar with the industry or don't have high conviction in one name over another. In that case, ETFs do an excellent job of giving you skin in the game through a passive approach."

They often rely on outsourcing work in Israel [Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty Images] By Al Jazeera Staff Published On 13 Apr 2024 13 Apr 2024 Click here to share on social media share2 Share facebook twitter whatsapp copylink Save Ramallah, occupied West Bank – In early March, a Uruguayan e-commerce company sent Marwan Khanfar and others a message on Slack. “Good morning [company] team, I hope you have had an amazing weekend,” the message began. “Unfortunately, due to concerns regarding political stability and compliance with legal regulations,” it continued, “it will not be possible to directly hire employees residing in Palestine from now on.” Recommended Stories list of 3 items list 1 of 3 What will the future bring between Hezbollah and Israel? list 2 of 3 Will ultra-Orthodox Jews have to enlist in the Israeli army? list 3 of 3 Has the war on Gaza hurt Israel’s economy? end of list The company said the only exceptions would be made for “temporary consultants” providing their services through a third party, though the 10 percent fees the third party charges would not be covered. In this instance at least, Khanfar managed to keep his own personal services under contract. However, a tech outsourcing company that he is the founder and CEO of, Corals, lost out on additional employment that had been discussed — only the latest contract his company had missed out on since the war in Gaza began in October. Corals lost three contracts that month, comprising almost 60 percent of the revenue it previously generated. Khanfar estimates he has lost approximately $15,000 each month – a significant blow to his small business employing 12 people. Serving coffee in his small Ramallah office, Khanfar, a happy-go-lucky sort of man even in these grave times, was incredulous at how abruptly years-long relationships could vanish. To self-fund his outsourcing company, which specialises in web development for e-commerce applications, he would work nights as the director of technology for a United States-based company. He says he was the first employee hired there 12 years ago. Advertisement Despite there being no performance issues ever communicated, a week after Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, he says the company hired an outside firm to “audit” his access to the company’s platform and infrastructure. Then, in December, the company silently removed him from their “leadership” page on the company website. In late February, they sent him a terse email informing him that his position as director of IT would be removed due to “corporate restructuring”, and he lost his job. Khanfar says they hired a new person performing the same functions immediately afterwards. “Everything was a complete shock,” said Khanfar. “The work I’d done, the relationships I built — gone.” Going back is impossible Before Israel’s war on Gaza, which followed Hamas’s October 7 attack, the growing Palestinian IT sector held a special position in the Palestinian economy, offering jobs for young graduates who could not otherwise find them, and an economic bridge beyond the separation wall. “The tech industry, we’re kind of able to bypass a lot of these restrictions that are imposed on us by the occupation,” said Jafar Shunnar, co-founder of TAP, a Dutch-Palestinian upskilling and job placement programme for Palestinians. According to a report published in February by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Palestinian information and communications technology sector contributes to about four percent of Palestine’s gross domestic product, or $651m, with 9,000 Palestinians employed in jobs providing higher salaries than they otherwise could obtain. While limitations imposed by military restrictions – including restricted importation of technical hardware or the availability of 3G internet only – still impacted the occupied West Bank, the fledgling sector often adapted its services and products to the circumstances. In Gaza especially, tech was one of the economic bright spots before the war due to the large amount of “tech talent” that could remotely work for companies in the West Bank and abroad from the besieged enclave. However, with a very small market not conducive to achieving sustainable economies of scale, about 80 percent of the Palestinian tech sector is geared towards outsourcing services for companies elsewhere, according to USAID. And especially in regards to some of the largest Palestinian outsourcing companies, the “multinational corporations” they did work for were, to a large degree, Israeli tech companies or the offices of big tech firms in Tel Aviv. Advertisement This open secret of Palestinian tech – that many of these companies were doing outsourcing work for companies in Israel, one of the strongest tech sectors in the world — produced economic benefits but also dynamics similar to other work sectors, where cheaper Palestinian labour was imported for use in the Israeli market. “Most of the good talent are working with multinational offices of the Israeli sector,” explained Sari Taha, 35, co-founder of Momentum Labs, a Ramallah-based startup studio and consultancy firm. “But this creates dependency on the market that might be a pressure point to maintain [the] political status quo.” Then, everything changed following October 7. Almost immediately afterwards, many of these Palestinian tech companies were informed — often through brief emails — that their contracts with Israeli companies were suspended or terminated. Those in the sector describe “tense” and “deeply uncomfortable” conversations with Israeli counterparts. “Palestinians I knew working for Israeli companies used to say that the politics did not affect the day-to-day work between the Palestinian teams and the Israeli teams,” said Taha, a Palestinian Jerusalemite who previously worked for an Arab venture capital firm in Tel Aviv before shifting his focus to developing the Palestinian sector. “But [considering] the magnitude of what is happening right now, I think on both sides, the Israelis and Palestinians, it’s very difficult to maintain this kind of communication.” Out of need for skilled labour, some of the Israeli companies have started to revive certain contracts with Palestinian firms, hiring fewer numbers than before. But those in the Palestinian tech sector are discussing the severe disruption in Israeli contracts as a wake-up call. “IT companies cannot stay dependent on the Israeli market,” said Alaa Zaineh, 35, a Ramallah-based trade and development expert for the representative office of the Netherlands, one of the leading foreign donors to the Palestinian tech sector. “There needs to be real investment and real focus on getting more business from other international countries, European countries, the US, Canada, so that if anything happens, you diversify your risk.” The kind of change this would entail would be arduous, but a change that stakeholders now believe is necessary in a business sense. “There needs to be different conversations, different frameworks, different everything, because going back is impossible,” said Taha. “Living in this uncertainty is impossible and is not economical and nobody wants it.” Tricky transitions Efforts to shift away from a tech sector dependent on Israel and towards a self-sustaining sector – either through homegrown products and services or working with non-Israeli companies abroad – are made more difficult by the current circumstances. As the war and its massive economic damage enter their seventh month, Palestinian startups, numbering around 200, are buckling under enormous strain. Tareq Abu Yousef, 26, is the co-founder of Turqat, a startup that provides roadside assistance services in the West Bank through an app. In spite of settler attacks and unpredictable road closures, the company reported only a small dip in revenue in the first two months of the war. “Palestinians don’t have a sense of urgency in cases like this because we think everything is temporary, and nothing is permanent,” said Abu Yousef. Advertisement As the war persisted, however, issues mounted. Sometimes, Turqat couldn’t provide services to areas due to road closures. Unpredictable GPS spoofing carried out by the army occasionally makes it impossible for them to locate customers, forcing them to revert to making phone calls to help customers at a slower speed. And now, Turqat is experiencing revenue losses of up to 60 percent, according to Abu Yousef. “The people’s basic needs like shelter, water and food are not being met because of the economic crisis that Palestine is going through because of the war,” explained Abu Yousef. “So people are moving less because they don’t have money for gas, and they aren’t using our service because they are prioritising other needs.” Similar issues are described by startups across the sector, whether it be for e-commerce services or making salon appointments. Though Abu Yousef says a grant received just before the war has kept the company on solid economic footing, the same can’t be said for other startups, which are unable to receive more funding from skittish foreign investors in these times. Likewise, some complain that the donor class – already busy trying to secure humanitarian aid for Gaza – has been slow to adapt their approach to the rapidly changing situation. A few initiatives have begun to support the tech sector. The Intersect Innovation Hub, with support from the Bank of Palestine, recently launched the RISE Palestine initiative to support the tech sector, aiming to raise $3.5m in donations to support Palestinian tech startups and freelancers who are struggling in the current circumstances, with the bank committing $150,000 to the cause. And with the Gazan sector all but decimated now, some foreign donors who had supported Gaza’s once-resilient tech sector – such as the Netherlands – are now shifting more of their resources to the West Bank, at least until the situation allows for re-engagement with Gaza. Such shifts are taking place as some West Bank companies sought to — temporarily — take up the contracts of Gaza-based companies that are rendered nonfunctional under the present circumstances. But such a transition proved tricky, and had very limited success. From a price perspective, Gazan outsourcing labour is far more competitive in the international market than labour in the West Bank. An outsourcing company in Gaza, for instance, may charge a foreign company only $3 or $4 per hour for each worker employed on a project, while the rate from West Bank companies is more like $20 per worker per hour, reflecting the economic ties to the Israeli economy and the generally higher costs of living. At the same time, the decimation of Gaza and its tech sector has created labour issues for West Bank companies themselves, as they sometimes employed a significant number of Gazan programmers – a rare example of economic partnership across the long-standing Israeli blockade that separated Gaza from Israel as well as the West Bank. A ‘reputation risk’ The potential “decoupling” of the Israeli and Palestinian tech sectors comes with the pain of losing the money that had been coming in from the powerhouse Israeli tech sector – which itself saw a 74 percent drop in venture capitalist investments in 2023 compared to the year before, according to recent Israeli sector estimates. How to enable a transition towards other models – whether it be creating startups that treat the West Bank as “testing grounds” before exporting their products to larger markets abroad, like Turqat’s vision; or empowering tech talent to work remotely for foreign companies; or emphasising outsourcing with countries elsewhere, like Khanfar – continues to be debated among stakeholders. Advertisement In looking outwards, companies abroad find it hard to trust Palestinian companies during these fraught times. Company executives and sector leaders say Palestinian companies and workers are now being deemed a “reputation risk” by foreign companies. Palestinian outsourcing companies report facing constant questions from foreign employers regarding whether they can trust Palestinians to fulfill the services required — or if they’ll even have reliable electricity and internet, a relative non-issue in the West Bank. Since the war, Khanfar has been asked by prospective clients “whether Palestine is in Gaza”, or what he would do “if what happened in Gaza happened in the West Bank”. In addition, companies, including Khanfar’s, report having wire transfers from countries like Saudi Arabia suddenly being blocked by banks wary of doing business with Palestinians. All of this is putting further strain on Khanfar, who says his “main responsibility” is having work for his employees at Corals. Layoffs have already started in other Palestinian tech companies, with some opting for reduced salaries. “I feel frustrated,” said Khanfar. “I feel like we’re always blamed and punished just for being Palestinian.” In contrast to the outsourcing company approach, Jafar Shunnar believes remote work is the way forward for Palestinian tech. Shunnar’s TAP programme has been a leader in upskilling young tech talent in the Palestinian sector and helping them find remote jobs with foreign companies. Shunnar’s view is that remote work will provide high salaries to the Palestinian economy while endowing Palestinians with the knowledge and skills to eventually develop products and services of their own. But perceptions abroad pose challenges nonetheless. Shunnar described attending the LEAP conference in Riyadh in February, seeking to forge connections and pipelines for Palestinian tech employment. In one instance, he spoke with a tech company that had employed 15 Gazans before the war. “While they sympathise with them, they still have a business to run,” said Shunnar. “So we have to put more effort to explain that the West Bank itself is relatively stable…and kind of convince them to still work with us.” Other foreign companies already employing Palestinians said they were seeking to “diversify” their human resources to minimise risk. “What’s dangerous is not ‘I don’t like the Palestinians,’” said Shunnar. “We can live with that because there are many people who sympathise with the Palestinians. What I’m more concerned about is when someone wants to hire a Palestinian but they’re worried about the stability – because that basically renders us useless.” ‘Where are you from?’ For years, the Palestinian tech sector was cautious to avoid mention of politics in day-to-day affairs — in part to keep relations with Israeli tech companies intact, and also to emphasise the quality of the services offered. However, with the war having such an impact on so many West Bank contracts not necessarily due to substantive changes but due to perceptions – or, in the Israeli case, politics – the sector is acknowledging the role politics plays more than it previously liked to admit. “Decisions are based on politics, so we can’t just stand aside and let ourselves lose contracts because we’re Palestinian,” said Khanfar. “No, we really need support from different countries, and especially from the Arab countries, from the Gulf countries.” But Khanfar’s struggles over these past few months have led him and others to question their future running a Palestinian enterprise. Khanfar, who has Jordanian citizenship, is weighing whether to open an office in Jordan or the United Arab Emirates, where his brother is. Many other Palestinian companies are considering relocating operations as well, with a couple already reportedly making the decision. If the situation persists for months more, layoffs and closures are expected to ratchet up further, and an exodus may be forthcoming. “When someone tries to ask me, ‘Where are you from?’ I feel like I cannot really say I am from Palestine,” said Khanfar. “I know it would be just so much easier to say I’m from Jordan, and they can do the wire transfer there. “When I say I’m from Palestine, I’m not saying something wrong. I shouldn’t be punished by not being hired because of where I’m from,” he continued. “But that’s what it feels like.”"

Amidst the rapid pace of change, many aspire to greatness and strive for sustainability and generational wealth, though this goal may seem elusive for some. Recent statistics shed light on the economic landscape: while millionaires represent less than 9% of the US population, over 37.9 million Americans live in poverty, with over 22 million millionaires and approximately 735 billionaires in the country. Despite these glaring disparities, opportunities for attaining wealth and sustainability flourish for those armed with the right mindset, goals, and determination. Mogul Dr. Tunji aptly emphasizes that wealth transcends mere financial gain; it serves as a testament to the impact and legacy one can forge in the world. In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Rachel Rodgers, the founder of Hello Seven , an acclaimed company dedicated to empowering women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA individuals to build seven-figure businesses and establish generational wealth, underscores the importance of rewiring our mindset to expect abundance. She stresses the necessity of cultivating millionaire habits even before attaining that financial milestone, advocating for conscientiously monitoring and adjusting our thoughts as a daily practice. Rodgers emphasizes the critical role of embracing a growth-oriented mindset, where individuals actively challenge limiting beliefs and envision their potential for success. In today's ever-evolving landscape, both individuals and businesses are keen on building wealth and ensuring sustainability. Here are seven essential tips that can help individuals navigate and thrive in this dynamic environment: Financial Literacy: Educate yourself about financial concepts, investment strategies, and economic trends. Understanding the fundamentals of personal finance and wealth management is crucial for making informed decisions that align with your long-term goals. Diversify Investments: Spread your investments across different asset class, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Diversification helps mitigate risk and enhances the potential for stable returns over time, even during market fluctuations. Embrace Sustainable Practices: Incorporate sustainability into your financial strategy by investing in environmentally responsible companies, green technologies, and socially conscious funds. Supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability aligns with ethical values and positions your portfolio for long-term growth in a changing world. Build Multiple Streams of Income: Explore opportunities to generate income from various sources beyond traditional employment . Whether through freelancing, passive income streams, rental properties, or entrepreneurial ventures, diversifying your income sources provides resilience against economic uncertainties and accelerates wealth accumulation. Prioritize Savings and Budgeting: Cultivate disciplined saving habits and create a realistic budget to manage your expenses efficiently. Consistently setting aside a portion of your income for savings and investments establishes a financial safety net and enables you to pursue future opportunities confidently. Stay Agile and Adaptive: Remain flexible and adaptable in response to shifting market conditions and technological advancements. Continuously evaluate and adjust your financial strategy to capitalize on emerging opportunities while mitigating potential risks. Invest in Personal Development: Invest in yourself through ongoing learning, skill development, and personal growth initiatives. Enhancing your knowledge, honing your skills, and cultivating a growth mindset enrich your life and increase your earning potential and resilience in the face of economic challenges. By embracing these strategies, you can solidify your financial footing, weather market turbulence, and steer a course toward enduring wealth in today's dynamic economy. According to Ben Spiegel, Founder & General Partner of Redwood Capital Advisors , in our increasingly transparent world, it's imperative to pinpoint a niche where you can gain a competitive edge. However, the path to wealth is a marathon requiring patience, discipline, and strategic foresight, yet the rewards of financial stability and abundance justify the endeavor. Spiegel underscores the importance of recognizing that your net worth is intricately tied to your network; thus, cultivating robust relationships is paramount. Moreover, as highlighted in a recent Harvard Business Review article, adapting to the ever-changing economic landscape is imperative for fostering wealth and resilience. With technological breakthroughs, globalization, and evolving consumer preferences reshaping industries, individuals must embrace innovation and agility. Investing in ongoing education and acquiring new skills is essential to remain competitive and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Additionally, fostering a strong support network and seeking mentorship can provide invaluable guidance and encouragement throughout the journey toward financial prosperity. Entrepreneurship: Pioneering the Path to Wealth Creation In a recent interview, Dr. Tunji Olowolafe offered invaluable insights garnered from his journey to mogul status. Apart from his prominent roles as the Managing Director and Chairman of Deux Project Limited, Dr. Olowolafe holds esteemed positions as a non-executive Director of West Power & Gas and Infracorp Nigeria, a $15 billion infrastructure investment entity co-founded by the Central Bank of Nigeria, Africa Finance Corporation, and Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority. With a multifaceted portfolio spanning across oil & gas, power, real estate, mining, and technology, Dr. Tunji Olowolafe epitomizes the transformative potential of entrepreneurship in driving economic progress. He emphasizes that amidst the pursuit of wealth and sustainability, a landscape teeming with opportunities awaits those who are primed to seize them. This endeavor demands a mindset that transcends conventional boundaries—a vision propelled by unwavering determination, strategic objectives, and an unyielding belief in one's capacity to excel.

Achieving Success Through Strategy And Impact In Today's Economy Angi Lewis Embarking on an entrepreneurial journey parallels navigating through a multifaceted landscape —abounding with challenges and opportunities. Dr. Olowolafe underscores the criticality of resilience, adaptability, and strategic thinking for emerging entrepreneurs to successfully traverse this dynamic terrain. Financial obstacles often loom large, necessitating meticulous planning, frugality, and resourcefulness. Dr. Tunji advises entrepreneurs to uphold a clear financial vision, consistently reassessing and refining strategies as their business evolves. 8 Tips For Navigating An Entrepreneurial Journey To navigate the entrepreneurial terrain effectively, Dr. Olowolafe offers eight key tips. Define Your North Star: Craft a clear vision that guides your entrepreneurial journey. Research and Understand the Terrain: Conduct thorough market analysis to identify opportunities and challenges. Pack Light but Strategically: Prioritize the development of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to test your business concept efficiently. Build a Reliable Toolkit: Assemble a strong team with diverse skills and expertise to support your venture. Embrace Adaptability: Be prepared to pivot and adjust your strategies in response to changing market dynamics. Master the Art of Networking: Forge strategic alliances and partnerships to expand your network and access valuable resources. Practice Resource Conservation: Manage finances wisely by prioritizing essential expenditures and seeking cost-effective solutions. Continuously Manage Finances Wisely: Develop a disciplined approach to financial management, including budgeting, monitoring cash flow, and seeking funding opportunities when necessary. By incorporating these best practices into their entrepreneurial endeavors, aspiring business owners can enhance their chances of success and chart a course toward building wealth and sustainability in today's economy. Achieving Wealth Through Technology: Empowering Minorities In Today’s Economy Achieving wealth and sustainability is a universal goal, yet for minorities, navigating the path to financial success often comes with unique challenges. Research from the Minneapolis Fed suggests that while today’s racial wealth gap links all the way back to unequal levels of wealth in 1870, the gap actually grew roughly 0.1% per year between 1980 and 2020. In today's economy, leveraging the tech industry can be a powerful strategy for minorities to build wealth and create sustainable prosperity.

During this time she faced significant hurdles in voicing her thoughts and opinions due to a lack of assertiveness. This posed a considerable challenge for her while seeking assistance due to the fear of being perceived as incompetent or imposing on others. This initial struggle hindered her ability to fully engage with her colleagues as well as take advantage of growth opportunities within the industry. However, over time she has been able to overcome this challenge and live to her full potential. Sabrina believes there is need for more women to join the industry due to the unique perspective that they bring to the table.

On what needs to be done to ensure more inclusivity in the tech industry, Sabrina believes that there is need for various innovative approaches. These include mentorship programs targeting women whereby mentors can provide guidance, advice, and support, helping mentees navigate challenges, set goals, and develop professionally. Networking opportunities specifically tailored for women in tech are able to provide valuable opportunities to connect with peers, share experiences, and build professional relationships. This can open doors to job opportunities, mentorship, and collaboration. There is also a need for diverse role models because representation matters, and having diverse role models in leadership positions within the tech industry can inspire and empower women to pursue their career aspirations. Lastly, she indicated that community support groups, such as Women in Tech (WIT) organizations or affinity groups within companies are also important. This is because they offer a sense of belonging and solidarity. They also provide a platform for women to share insights, seek advice, and advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. According to Sabrina, having a mentor is key if one is to progress in their career. She shared that some of the two mentors who have made an impact in her life are Joylynn Kirui who is a senior cloud security advocate at Microsoft. As well as Evelyn Kilel who is the founder of She Hacks Kenya. She indicated that the two women have demonstrated to her that indeed women too, can be very successful in the tech industry. Essentially, seeing successful women who have broken barriers and achieved their goals has motivated me to pursue my own aspirations and overcome challenges along the way. Her advice to women who would like to join the tech industry is that, they should embrace continuous learning because the tech industry is constantly evolving. They also need to develop resilience because challenges and setbacks are inevitable, but it’s how you respond to them that matters. They should not be afraid to advocate for themselves because their voice matters as such they should not hesitate to use it. They need to look for role models and mentors who inspire them and can offer guidance and advice based on their own experiences in the tech industry. Lastly, they should take pride in your accomplishments and learn to celebrate their successes along the way."

South Korea is a blossoming region, with its economy achieving rapid growth since the 1980s. The country boasts huge technological prowess, showcasing global competitiveness across diverse sectors, including mobile phones, steel production, semiconductors, automobiles, and electric vehicles. As the economy flourishes, so does its network of diplomatic ties across the globe. We recently had the pleasure of attending The South African Trade and Investment Seminar in Seoul, engaging with investors and stakeholders to discuss an optimistic economic outlook and spark valuable conversations about the long-standing relationship between South Korea and Africa. The relationship has been growing from strength to strength. South Korea is South Africa’s fourth largest trading partner in Asia, investing in key areas like energy, infrastructure, health, digital technology, and agribusiness. Preparations are even underway in Seoul for the upcoming Korea-Africa Summit set to take place in June, gathering senior officials and ambassadors for discussions on building mutually beneficial collaborations between the two regions. Despite decades of sustained growth in South Korea, reaching the next phase of economic prosperity hinges on the deepening of collaborative partnerships with other nations. Africa’s wealth of resources and potential presents promising avenues to propel Korea’s transition to the next level, offering huge opportunities for economic development. Several South Korean industries stand to gain from the mutually beneficial investment ties with Africa. The challenge is pinpointing high-yield sectors and how to inspire investor confidence between the two nations. Catalysing the high-tech industry South Korea sits at the forefront of the global digital economy, boasting a world-renowned high-tech industry. Many of the biggest names in the industry have their roots in South Korea, such as Samsung and LG Electronics. There is also a thriving community of tech startups in the region, with many entrepreneurs flocking to Korea to build on the country’s chip manufacturing capabilities, including new firms producing next-generation AI chips . However, the high-tech industry relies heavily on having a stable supply of critical minerals. Materials like lithium, cobalt, silicon, and copper play a vital role in the production of semiconductors, batteries, and electricity networks. Obtaining a reliable mineral supply is crucial to ensure the growth of the high-tech industry does not grind to a halt; however, natural resource reserves in the country are very few and far between. With its plentiful critical mineral reserves, Africa offers a promising investment opportunity for savvy Korean investors. The continent contains around 85 percent of the world's manganese, 80 percent of platinum and chromium, and 47 percent of cobalt, as well as vast deposits of lithium, phosphate, and nickel – placing it as a key force to fuel the South Korea’s high-tech industry. Driving the electric vehicle movement Another key industry that would benefit from a reliable supply of critical minerals is the electronic vehicle (EV) sector. The EV market has skyrocketed in recent years as the clean energy transition picks up pace. EV sales have more than tripled in just three years, and this market is expected to sustain steady growth as the world moves away from oil. South Korea is leading this trend in Asia, with its technological success and robust automotive industry spearheading its advancements in the EV sector. Key stakeholders in Africa are also striving to claim their stake in the rapidly growing EV market, although it remains at an earlier stage of development than its Korean counterparts. But while they are at different phases in their EV journeys, there is a real opportunity for a mutually beneficial investment relationship between South Korea and Africa to propel the industry to the next level. Firstly, Africa holds critical minerals essential for EV production and battery manufacturing. Collaborating with African nations to responsibly extract and process these resources will offer a sustainable supply chain for Korea’s automotive industry. What’s more, Africa’s urban centres are flourishing – offering a burgeoning market for EV adoption. Africa is experiencing rapid urbanisation, with cities expected to be home to 900 million more people by 2050. By investing in infrastructure development, such as EV charging points and roads, South Korean investors could tap into this vast consumer base. This could prove to be a lucrative venture for these investors, with infrastructure projects in Africa often seeing high equity returns and low default rates. Building ties through open conversations The topic of strengthening the relationship between South Korea and Africa was a key part of our discussions during our trip to Asia. However, bridging this gap requires an effort to educate Korean investors about the vast opportunities awaiting them on the continent. With the right guidance and insights, they can better navigate the intricacies and nuances of the African market, offering a perspective on risk ratings and a better understanding of its diverse business landscape. Collaborating with a strategic partner will help to pave the way for a symbiotic investment partnership that capitalises on Africa’s untapped potential, while also building investor confidence, and driving forward economic growth in Asia’s technology hub."

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. MeiMei Fox writes about aligning your career with your life purpose. Apr 10, 2024, 02:50pm EDT Share Save Comment There are fewer women in tech leadership roles today than 40 years ago. getty The tech industry bursts with innovation. It is acclaimed for its creativity and breakthrough approaches to solving age-old problems. And yet paradoxically, here in 2024, it still struggles with diversity and inclusion – especially when it comes to leadership. In fact, there is even less female representation in tech leadership roles today than there was in in the past. In 1984, 35% of tech leaders were women. In 2023, that number had slipped to 28%. These three women are powerhouses, breaking through the glass ceiling with a fierce determination to achieve much-deserved gender parity in the traditionally male-dominated tech industry: Katherine Kostereva, CEO of Creatio; Karen Baker, President of Boathouse; and Petula Lucey, Senior Vice President Global Marketing at HqO. Katherine Kostereva is the CEO of Creatio. Creatio Katherine Kostereva, CEO of Creatio Founders in the software industry are overwhelmingly male. But Creatio CEO Katherine Kostereva bootstrapped her no-code workflow and CRM automation platform for the first seven years of the company's history before raising $70 million. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor And she didn’t stop there. Creatio has experienced record growth over the past two years. Today, the company has 700 employees in seven offices, a local presence in 14 countries, and long-lasting relationships with thousands of customers and partners worldwide. “I deeply believe that the only way to excel in your career is to have it be fully aligned with your life purpose,” said Kostereva in an exclusive interview with me. “Life is too short to waste it on a career that doesn’t resonate with your passion.” Kostereva feels blessed to have found that alignment at Creatio. “We're dedicated to empowering knowledge workers without technical skills to use no-code technology to automate their workflows,” she says. “The concept of freedom and self-sufficiency, without having to rely on specialized tech skills or assistance from others, strongly resonates with me. It's incredibly fulfilling to witness Creatio spreading this freedom to people and organizations worldwide.” Challenges are opportunities, in Kostereva’s view. She believes great career opportunities exist for women in tech who are committed and ready to pursue their vision. “Fortunately, every year more women are joining the tech industry. Being among the first to adopt innovations like no-code and generative AI can help you greatly!” she advises. “It’s all about focus, resilience, and grit. If you’re truly passionate about your career, no biases can stop you.” Karen Baker is the President of Boathouse. Boathouse Karen Baker, President of Boathouse The tech industry faces stark gender disparity, with women struggling to achieve equal titles and recognition to men. This disparity becomes even more evident for women of color in tech, points out Karen Baker, the president of Boathouse. “There is a critical need for equal representation, opportunity, and inclusion.” Boathouse is an independent, full-service integrated marketing and communications agency that is driven by data, guided by analysis and strengthened by artificial intelligence. Every seven years, Baker asks herself a critical question: Is her career still aligned with her life purpose, given the new skills she has developed? As a woman in a male-dominated industry, she has noticed the glass ceiling – and she feels it is her purpose as a female leader to help raise it. “I've embraced Zig Zigler's quote, ‘Success occurs when opportunity meets preparation,’ and it has guided my path as a woman leader,” says Baker. “Over the last ten years, I have remained dedicated to attaining clients who want to tackle complex problems in order to make an impact. This keeps me dedicated to the work and feeling fulfilled.” Overcoming gender and racial bias requires a two-pronged approach, Baker feels: systemic change and embracing a growth mindset. “The tech industry must actively promote women into leadership positions, including executive and C-suite roles,” she says. “Companies need to break free from the status quo. They must adopt a ‘no box’ approach to fostering greater inclusivity.” At the same time, Baker advises, women must continue to support one another. They also must challenge narratives that restrict them from achieving full recognition for their contributions to technology. “Disrupting this narrative is crucial for achieving true equality in the industry,” she says. Petula Lucey is the Senior Vice President of Global Marketing at HqO. HqO Petula Lucey, Senior Vice President Global Marketing at HqO As the world’s leading real estate experience platform, HqO is transforming the way people experience physical space. The tech company’s platform and digital services enable real estate employees to have a more satisfying and effective experience when they are in the office working. HqO has powered 400 million square feet at over 700 properties across 32 countries, maximizing and boosting tenant and employee acquisition, retention, and engagement. Petula Lucey is the senior vice president of global marketing at HqO. Her guiding purpose is to leave a lasting positive impact on everything she touches. “This drive to influence and inspire those around me comes from a place of deep, intrinsic passion,” she said in an exclusive interview with me. “I take immense pride in channeling this enthusiasm into fostering positive change. I like to think of it as my superpower – as a mom, daughter, sister, friend, colleague, citizen and tech executive.” Women in male-dominated sectors often face a perception barrier, Lucey says, even though no capability gap exists. “In fact, most women aren't lacking in brilliance, potential or ability, but rather merely fighting to break through the myth of tech as a man's world,” she explains. She has worked hard to dismantle the unconscious gender bias. “I believe in ownership, mentorship, and recognition,” says Lucey. “I have seen firsthand how these pillars of action and behavior, when practiced with rigor and consistency, can create spaces where women not only thrive, but become the architects shaping the future we're building together, both in and out of the office.” Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

Musk held the title of the world's richest person as of March. However, a decline in Tesla's stock value has significantly impacted his net worth. Musk's Tesla Struggles, Zuckerberg's Meta Thrives (Image Source: IANS) follow us follow us Yesterday marked a significant shift in the wealth rankings among prominent tech figures, as Elon Musk's net worth dipped below that of Mark Zuckerberg's for the first time in four years. According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Musk's fortune currently stands at $181 billion, relegating him to the fourth position among the world's wealthiest individuals, with Zuckerberg surpassing him with a net worth of $187 billion. The rivalry between these two tech titans has been longstanding, characterized by occasional public challenges and competition. Last year, Musk notably challenged Zuckerberg to a cage fight in Las Vegas. However, such interactions have not overshadowed their respective achievements in the tech industry. Until recently, Musk held the title of the world's richest person as of March. However, a decline in Tesla's stock value has significantly impacted his net worth. Since the beginning of the year, Musk has seen approximately $48.7 billion wiped off his fortune, correlating with Tesla's stock price plummeting by over 30% since January. It's worth noting that Musk's wealth is intricately tied to the performance of Tesla, the electric car company he co-founded and leads as CEO. As such, fluctuations in Tesla's stock price have a direct impact on Musk's financial standing. This shift in wealth rankings underscores the volatility inherent in the tech industry and the closely intertwined relationship between individual fortunes and the performance of their respective companies.

The sector remains a key driver of Israel's economy and innovation, attracting significant investments. ANI Israeli cybersecurity exit deals grew by 65% in 2023 to $7.1 billion, more than half of total tech sector exit deals , a report showed on Sunday that underscored the importance of cyber to Israel's high-tech industry. Total tech sector exits - mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and buyouts - were some $11 billion last year, down from $13.5 billion in 2022. Cyber comprised just $2.5 billion of total exits in 2022, according to the report from Cybertech Global and data and research firm Israel Venture Capital (IVC) ahead of a Cybertech global conference in Tel Aviv this week. The high-tech sector drives Israel's economy and accounts for 16% of employment, more than half of Israel's exports, a third of income taxes and nearly a fifth of its overall economic output, according to Bank of Israel data. With many of Israel's 522 cyber firms borne from the military, Israel has become a global cybersecurity leader. In the first quarter of this year, there were 8 exits totalling $1 billion versus 24 exits in all of 2023, the report showed. Cybertech founder Amir Rapaport said cyber firms were resilient and served as an anchor for Israeli innovation even in a tense security situation. ""The trend of increased mergers and acquisitions in Israeli cyber, which began last year, continues into 2024, as global cyber threats grow year by year,"" he said. ""In contrast to other sectors, geopolitical tensions increase interest and investment in cyber companies. Therefore, we expect to see more investments in Israeli cyber companies and new startups that address emerging threats."" High tech startups raised $6.9 billion in 2023 in 393 rounds, down from $15.7 billion in 2022, according to IVC, a decline attributed to a global slowdown, investor jitters over a now shelved plan to overhaul the country's judicial system and the start of the war in Gaza. Funding raised by Israeli cyber companies in 2023 was $2.4 billion - the lowest figure in the past five years and down 43% from 2022. In the first quarter, the cybersecurity sector stood out with funding rounds totalling $620 million, or 38% of the total tech funding raised, according to Sunday's report.

Gelsinger Chief Executive Officer, Intel Corporation Presider Jon Fortt Coanchor, Closing Bell: Overtime , CNBC Introductory Remarks Blair W. Effron Cofounder, Centerview Partners; Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, and Chair, Committee on Corporate Affairs, Council on Foreign Relations Michael Froman President, Council on Foreign Relations from Series on Emerging Technology, U.S. Foreign Policy, and World Order and Series on Emerging Technology, U.S. Foreign Policy, and World Order EFFRON: Good evening and welcome to the Council on Foreign Relations 2024 Corporate Conference. I’m Blair Effron, cofounder of Centerview Partners, vice chairman of our board here, and I am delighted really to welcome everybody. As is customary, we have a good group here, but we have zooming in as well both throughout the country and around the world probably three times as many people as you see here today. So before we begin, I do want to take a moment to thank our newest members of the corporate program. We have Amazon and Visa at the founders level. We have Circle, CoBank, IBM, Nvidia, PwC, Hyundai Motors, and Recognize at the affiliates level. And whether your company has been a longtime member or is a relative newcomer, we obviously appreciate your involvement with the Council. And speaking of newcomers, we have for the first time our new president of the council, Mike Froman. Mike comes to us with years of private sector experience and experience in government at the highest levels. That breadth of experience really gives him a deep familiarity with all the issues facing the private sector today. And in a turbulent world, having that kind of dialogue really is what makes the CFR particularly special. Our corporate membership provides valuable access to all our own foreign policy experts. And with their help hopefully together we can all navigate these issues. So we hope you will continue to make the most of the benefits out of the program. That includes roundtable briefings, briefings with our CFR fellows, professional development opportunities—which is actually something that any companies can take advantage of. If you have great colleagues in the thirties and forties, we want to get them engaged in foreign policy early. And they really do love it. So, most importantly, I have the pleasure in a few minutes of welcoming Pat Gelsinger from Intel. And before we do that, our new head, Mike, is going to make some remarks. (Applause.) FROMAN: Well, thanks, Blair. And Blair chairs our Corporate Program Committee, and in addition to being vice chair of the board. And we’re very grateful for that. So want to recommend recognize chairman of our board, David Rubenstein, there in the back, who’s known to everyone here, I’m sure. And let me just add to what Blair said. I guess I’ve spent about half my adult life in government and the nonprofit sector and the other half in the private sector, in the corporate sector, and including most recently at MasterCard. MasterCard is a member here. And for some reason, I was never asked to participate in Council events, even though I was an employee of MasterCard. So I just want to encourage you all to do as Blair suggested, and take full advantage of the program. And I’m working with Suzanne Helm and her team to introduce some new elements of the program and make it even more valuable for our corporate members. Because I think we’re at a time when, whether it’s CEOs or boards or senior management, the issues of geopolitics, of the changing economic relationships between countries like the United States and China, transnational issues like pandemics, climate change, are having more and more impact on corporations, on their strategy, on their operations, on their capacity to execute on their strategy. And we are certainly getting a lot of incoming inquiries and requests for information for our fellows and our programming here that go directly to our corporate members and the work that they do. So I encourage you to take full advantage of your membership. As Blair said, we really want to encourage this both as a source of information but also as an opportunity for employees—up and coming employees to broaden their horizons, to get exposed to a broader network of people working in the same area, and to get involved in the issues of public policy that are interesting in their own right and increasingly relevant to their jobs in the private sector as well. Let me just say, we’re launching four initiatives here at the Council. The first one was launched earlier this week, called RealEcon, reimagining American economic leadership. Really looks at the issues of trade and investment, development, economic security—that convergence of national security and economics—and what do we need to do to really think about reformulating how the U.S. leads in those areas, and brings—ensures that there’s a support by the American public for that kind of leadership. Matt Goodman, who I think is here—where’s Matt Goodman? There he is way in the back. We’re delighted to have running that initiative. I hope you’ll introduce yourself to him. The second initiative is on managing great-power relations, particularly with regards to China. Rush Doshi, who has recently left the White House running—helping to run China policy, will be joining us to run that program. And, again, these programs look not just at what research we should be doing in this area, but what kind of programming, like, convenings we should have, what kind of outreach, how to involve our members, or individual members and our corporate members, and leverage their expertise, how to use our digital assets, our publications, et cetera. So it’s really a whole of CFR approach to taking on these issues. The third one will be on technology and foreign policy, national security, and international economics. Starting, as you might imagine, with AI, but also looking at quantum computing, synthetic biology, any number of other emerging technologies and the impact on policy. And the fourth one will be on climate change and the impact of climate on conflict, migration, health, food security, trade, and finance. So to the degree that those touch upon interests of yours and your companies, I hope you’ll let us know, and volunteer, and be part of the efforts that we have—the study groups, the working groups, the task forces, the reviews of new proposals—and bring your expertise to the table—to the table as well. It’s a great pleasure for me to introduce our first panel. And we’re really delighted to have Pat Gelsinger here CEO of Intel, interviewed by Jon Fortt. Jon Fortt’s from CNBC. NBC is a new partner of ours as we think about how to work with media to get our content and our expertise out to the broader public. And we’re very grateful for that partnership. Pat Gelsinger, I’m told, started at Intel at eighteen years old as a quality assurance technician. So there’s hope for all of us out there. (Laughter.) You start early, imagine where you can end up. And really a fascinating corporate leader in a fascinating sector going through so many changes and so many interesting challenges and opportunities. We very much look forward to hearing from him. We’re grateful to you, Pat, for joining us. Let me welcome Pat and Jon to the stage. (Applause.) FORTT: Well, Pat, you started off in quality assurance and now you are back to it. (Laughter.) GELSINGER: Thank you, Jon. FORTT: Well, I’m going to formally open up by saying, first of all, thank you, Mike, thank you, Blair. Welcome, everyone, to the opening session of the 2024 CFR Corporate Conference. We’ve got Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel with us for this keynote session. I’m Jon Fortt, co-anchor of CNBC’s Closing Bell: Overtime , alongside Morgan Brennan, a new CFR member. I’ll be presiding over this conversation. Pat, I think I’ve known you for, what, about fifteen years? GELSINGER: Something like that, Jon. FORTT: Back when you were CTO at Intel. And, boy, you’ve taken on a tough job, right? Intel was in rough shape three years ago when you came back on board as CEO. But I really want to start off in today’s context geopolitically. Markets took a little bit of a dip today starting around midday, concerns about what Iran might do retaliation-wise where Israel is concerned. You got around more than 11,000 employees in Israel across, I believe, four sites. Intel’s been there for fifty years, so this isn’t a new challenge. Tell me, how does today’s environment affect the way you approach that site, its strategic importance, and your overall business? GELSINGER: Yeah. Thank you, Jon. And, you know, Israel is so critical to us. This year is year fifty for us. You know, we began the tech boom in Israel. We were one of the first companies to establish a footprint there. You know, a fun story sometime I’ll tell you about Andy Grove and Dov Frohman, the inventor of the EEPROM, starting our site there. You know, just an amazing resilience in the Israeli people. And now it’s not just 11,000 employees, it’s also 5,000 Mobileye employees, 4,000 construction workers, and about 4,000 more contract workers there. So I have well over 20,000 souls I consider myself responsible for in Israel. And they’ve done extraordinary work for us, you know, now over fifty years. You know, that said, right—you know, they’ve done so through conflicts before. This isn’t the first Israeli, you know, Middle East challenge. And they, you know, have never missed a product deliverable, never missed a wafer deliverable. And that’s why I say this is a resilient people, extraordinarily so. You know, that said, we seek peace, right? This is terrible what’s going on, first in October with the raids and then the responses. So we seek peace as quickly as possible. And, you know, seeing that measured, all right, you know, in the international community, it’s not particularly surprising at this point given the – you know, the human loss in Gaza. You know, that said, you know, our job is to continue running our businesses as good as—as well as we possibly can. You know, making sure we have good resiliency. I’d also say part of our core strategy is building globally resilient supply chains. And whether it’s Taiwan, Ukraine, or Israel, that’s why we’re doing this. You know, we have to build resilience in the technology supply chains. And it underscores the importance of the essence of the strategy that I’ve laid out for Intel, the technology industry and, frankly, the Western world. FORTT: Let’s get closer to that. Now, you mentioned Taiwan. There’s, of course, this overarching concern for the entire Western world and beyond, certainly in Taiwan as well, about what China is going to do there. How much of chip manufacturing is now based in Taiwan? How much of a concern is it when we have an earthquake, like we did over the past couple of days, and what that could mean for powering the economy around the globe? GELSINGER: Yeah. And, yeah, it was rather frightening waking up on Wednesday morning to a 7.5 earthquake. Fortunately, it was on the eastern side of the island not on the western side, or the devastation or impact would have been far greater than it was. You know, that said, it just reinforces the point we need resilience in the supply chains, right? And today, you know, about 80 percent, 82 percent of the world’s semiconductors are built in Asia, right, not only in Taiwan, but Korea, China, Japan. And of the leading-edge semiconductors, over half of it is simply in Taiwan. One region of the world has well over half of leading-edge semiconductors today. And in fact, it’s one site in Taiwan in the world. And to me, that’s the epitome of not resilient, right? And to think it’s just a hundred kilometers from Chinese soil, right? You know, the most powerful leader in China, right? You know, boy, this is not a sustainable situation for the world. And if you think, what aspect of your life, Jon, is not becoming more digital? Everything is, right? (Laughter.) Every aspect of humanity is becoming more digital. Everything digital runs on semiconductors, right? You know, and I’ve said—you know, the geopolitics of the world has been defined by where oil reserves have been for the last fifty years, right? The geopolitics of the world will be defined by technology supply chains for the next fifty years. And the AI surge has just, you know, made—put even a bigger exclamation point on it. So let’s build these factories where we want them. You know, in 1990, 80 percent of the world’s supply was in U.S. and Europe. You know, today it’s about 18 percent now, right? So but never was a vote in Congress taken to get rid of this terrible semiconductor industry. But there were votes taken in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, throughout Asia, to attract this industry. And thirty-plus years of defined industrial policy, we lost this industry. And we’re no longer economic here. FORTT: Well, I want to talk about that, because when we talk about the CHIPS Act—and I saw you a few days ago in Arizona, where the president was unveiling the— GELSINGER: Yeah. He invited some friends, yeah. FORTT: Yeah. (Laughs.) The $8.5 billion-plus that you guys now have access to. Some people are like, oh, well, why do we need to give these multibillion-dollar companies more money to do what they should be doing anyway? Explain what happened in South Korea, in Taiwan, somewhat in Japan too, but especially those two places over the past several decades that has put them in position where—you know, my father-in-law grew up in Korea around the time of the Korean War. It was not industrial and not urban. And now it’s leading. GELSINGER: Yeah. And if you read Chip War by Chris Miller, you know, he chronolizes much of this. But it truly was thirty years of intense industrial policy in those locations to build these industries. There were incentives. There were tax preferences. There were land grants. You know, there was R&D, you know, credits. There was, you know, university programs. You know, the government pushed companies to invest in TSMC. And, you know, there was this strong hand of the governments in those locations to build this industry. And, you know, it wasn’t— FORTT: Well, how is that not—I’m just taking the other side here. If you know what I do on CNBC, you understand. How is that not picking winners, right? GELSINGER: You know, and there are multiple companies there, right? You know, there’s, you know, UMC, TSMC, Samsung, Hynix. You know, and obviously, you know, some have merged, and so on. The capital and R&D intensity that have occurred over time, they innovated, you know, the foundry model. And to some degree, there was a free market aspect to it. But they chose this industry. They chose the technology supply chain around it because it’s not just the chip vendors—I mean, not just the foundry, like TSMC. But it’s also the chemical suppliers that are there. It’s also the system suppliers that are there. It’s also the component suppliers that they built up. You know, TSMC is the center of the technology ecosystem of Taiwan. And Taiwan has become the technology center of the world, in that respect. And this was defined industrial policy that wasn’t picking winners and losers, but it was picking industries and deciding that they were going to build those up in a very sustained set of policies over many administrations that have emerged. It really is spectacular what they’ve done. You know, if you haven’t read Chip War yet, by Chris Miller, you know, take a read of it. And in some regards, that is what led to the creation of the U.S. chip industry, the industrial policy of DARPA, right? You know, I mean, it wasn’t arbitrary that got it here, right? (Laughs.) You know, we invented this. And then there were strong policies that enabled it to occur. FORTT: And not just the chip industry. All of Silicon Valley, arguably, has grown up around that ecosystem that started with government support. Then there are universities around it, right? There’s culture around it. Software industry grew up. And now it sort of self-perpetuates. GELSINGER: Yeah. And that’s what led to this huge, you know, 30 to 40 percent gap. You know, we’re not asking for handouts. But if I was a good, you know, CEO, I would invest where I can get good economic return. And I would not do it in the market that I have a 30 or 40 percent cost gap. I’d go build my factories in Asia. You know, that’s the thing that, you know, any good CFO or Wall Street investor would choose to do—invest where you get good return. So if we want to build these factories in the U.S., we have to close that cost gap. And that is exactly what the CHIPS Act was designed to do, make it economic to return manufacturing to U.S. shores. And that’s what’s now underway. FORTT: Is it enough? GELSINGER: You know, today—you know, when you look at CHIPS Act today, since, you know, we began this journey, you know, four years ago to get CHIPS Act underway—you know, it was passed in August of 2022. You know, a proud moment to stand on the West Lawn for the signing of the CHIPS Act. And the estimates today are—you know, we’ve declined since that began a couple more percent, from like 12 percent to 10 percent. But the projects that have been announced by Intel, by TSMC, by Samsung, by Micron, just one by SK Hynix this week—that the estimates are that that takes us from 10 percent to 20-plus percent approximately by the end of the decade. So the announced capital projects that are underway today would be more than doubling this industry back in American shores in less than a decade. That’s pretty phenomenal. Now, is it enough? FORTT: But is it enough? (Laughs.) Yes. GELSINGER: You know, as we think past CHIPS, you know, there’s a set of long-term policies that need to come into place, in my view, because we lost this industry. You know, and $152 billion, right, industrial policy, you know, shot in the arm ain’t gonna fix over three decades of bad policy. Our tax policies are wrong. Tax policies are wrong for R&D, for capital investments. You know, the bigger portion isn’t the 8.5 billion (dollars) of grants, you know, that we’ve received. Though that’s important. But it’s 25-plus billion (dollars) of investment tax credits we get. You know, put it all in the tax policy. You know, to me, if we invest it, we should be able to say we’re getting benefit financially for making long-term manufacturing capital investments. And I believe that should apply to every industry that we want manufacturing footprint in the U.S. We have to build long-term R&D capacity as well. You know, DARPA was essentially an R&D program, you know, for the nation. And we need—you know, this is seed corn for the future. We need talent as well. And I think the last component, as I think about the next phases, is supply chain preference. Got to get the supply chains that support the fabs back here, both the incoming as well as the outcoming, and put much more pressure on using government purchasing power and authority to incent, you know, products to be built, manufactured. You know, while President Biden’s comments at our chips grant, you know, he had one line that I really enjoyed. He said, supply chains shouldn’t end in the U.S. They should begin and end in the U.S. And I think that’s summarized the objective very well. FORTT: You talk about Samsung, TSMC, SK Hynix also trying to build some U.S. manufacturing capability. When it comes to the government’s need for chip manufacturing in the U.S., because defense has also become a much more technology-driven experience, how do you think the government should think about where they source those chips? GELSINGER: Yeah. There’s this binding of manufacturing and R&D that becomes an important aspect for government purchase. Intel happens to be, you know, the only Logic R&D provider in the U.S. You know, I believe we have to see more of those R&D footprints of those Asian countries move back to the U.S. as well. But from a government perspective, you know, that’s part of the reason, you know, the President and Secretary Raimondo called us the U.S. champion. You know, we’re the unique company that does manufacturing and R&D in the U.S. One of the objectives we would have as we get these commercially viable technology leadership, you know, manufacturing corridors underway in the U.S., that we build the national defense requirements as adjuncts to those commercially viable capabilities. And you might have seen some of the language of, you know, secure enclaves. You know, build a little thing on top of a big commercial thing to meet the unique requirements of governments. So that today, many of the government programs, you know, literally are more than a decade behind in their technology, right? In some cases, two decades behind. So, right, if you’re trying to, you know, put the best drone fleet in the air around the next generation F-35, are you OK if your AI capabilities and the drones are 20 years out of date? Of course not, right? We need to enable leadership technology for the secure defense program. So from our perspective, this is clearly a statement of, you know, the right economic policy—you know, building jobs through the manufacturing and R&D, but also the right national security policy as well. FORTT: Let’s talk about Intel now, because you’re embarking on a very gutsy, and extremely expensive turnaround right now. But you actually started at Intel, as was mentioned earlier, when you were eighteen years old. And you happen to be a Christian. I am too. Your Intel story kind of reads biblical, in the sense that you came in as a young lad. Mid-career you were forced out. Ended up being a successful CEO elsewhere. About three years ago, Intel’s board reaches out and says, will you join the board? And then they end up saying, actually, will you come back as CEO? Over Christmas you think about it, talk to your wife about it, end up saying, well, here’s my plan. If you let me do this, I’ll come back, right? You and I have talked about this before? GELSINGER: Yes, yes. FORTT: Now you find yourself with the stock lower than when you joined, tens of billions of dollars deep in this commitment to try to bring manufacturing back here. And with this plan to separate design at Intel from manufacturing, when the thinking had been the fact that those two things are, you know, intertwined is a strength of Intel. You gave some detail about that earlier this week. Wall Street freaks out when they see how much the manufacturing is costing. Why is it so important right now for Intel’s future to separate these two things? GELSINGER: Yeah. And, you know, the strategy that we’ve laid out is to take what was called integrated design and manufacturing—and, you know, the industry has moved on. You know, Intel perfected that. We produced superior financial results. We had leadership technology. And that business model worked until it didn’t, right? And when we stumbled and Intel lost technology, leadership, you know, then we were behind on both products and technology. And that exposed an uncompetitive manufacturing capability, as well as always hidden inside of, you know, the product manufacturing combination. So, today we look at it and we say, hmm. Most of the world’s wafers—you know, what we produce for semiconductor manufacturing—are actually done by foundries today. FORTT: Foundries being manufacturers for hire? GELSINGER: Correct. Correct. You know, I become your factory. You know, Nvidia makes no chips. FORTT: AMD makes no chips. GELSINGER: Right? Qualcomm makes no chips. You know, they use other people’s factories. And Intel was the lone company still making their own chips. So now we said we’re going to take the company and create, you know, a fabless company that looks like AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidia. And we’re going to create a manufacturing capability for the world. All right? Jensen, I want to build your chips. Lisa, I want to build your chips. You know, Christiano, you know, Tim Cook. I want to—you know, we want to be that foundry, because scale is critical to be able to maintain the R&D and the capital requirements of the industry. And the world needs resilient supply chains. FORTT: Isn’t that kind of like McDonalds saying to Burger King, I want to cook your burgers? GELSINGER: You know, in some ways it is. Now, and if burger cooking was quite as sophisticated as fabs, that may be a good strategy for them. But, you know, I’d also—right, you know, and to the audience here, if you haven’t seen one of these fabs, you just got to see them, right? You know, we had Jon there. You know, these are some of the largest construction projects occurring on Earth, building the smallest things that have ever been built on Earth. These are marvels, right? You know, the Ohio project, you know, when we announced, you know, it’s going to be $30 billion of capital there. You know, the site that we’re putting it on, I have capacity to create the largest manufacturing site on the planet, right, with fifteen fab modules. You know, the initial investment is $30 billion. We have—you know, next year, we’ll probably peak at 7,000 construction workers on the Ohio site. You know, today, I have about 6,000 construction workers on our Arizona site. These are extraordinary, capital-intensive facilities. It’s not like flipping a burger, right, on your camp or barbecue in the backyard, trust me. And the business model of the industry has changed. So we do believe we need to do that. But we need to create separation so that Lisa can look at me, or Jensen, or any of these other fabless companies, and say: You’re securing my supply chain. You’re protecting my IP. And that’s why we went through the steps that we just announced this week, right? Clean separation. You know, being able to present the financials of the foundry business separately to the industry. You know, by the way, it’s a reporting requirement. If I’m managing the company that way, SEC requires me to be public on it. You know, so we’re required to do it. And it’s the transparency I want to bring, you know, to drive that business to profitability, which we said will take a couple of years. And we believe it’s a huge value unlock. You know, practically from a shareholder perspective today, you know, we have almost $100 billion of, you know, invested capital in our manufacturing footprint. And we believe Wall Street today gives us zero to negative valuation, you know, for $100 billion of assets in the books. OK, what a value unlock, right, if we get it to profitability and competitiveness over time. So I think this is going to be, you know, great for potential customers. It’s going to be great for improving the operations. But ultimately bringing shareholder return as well is part of my job. FORTT: Speaking of potential customers, a lot of people might not realize this isn’t just existing chip companies that are fabless that need a manufacturing partner. Over the last several years Amazon, as it’s built up its Hyperscale Cloud is making its own chips—designing its own chips, to try to get more efficient. They need somebody to make them. Microsoft has made the same decision. GELSINGER: Yeah, and they just—Microsoft just announced being a customer of Intel, and our Intel foundries. And that was one we just announced. FORTT: And, as we all know, Apple began making—designing its own chips for first iPhones to now its entire hardware line. And they need people to make chips. They didn’t start off as a chip company. GELSINGER: Yeah. But these are big companies. Plus, it’s lots of other companies as well. You know, it’s the Marvells, it’s Broadcoms, you know, it’s Qorvos, it’s Texas Instruments. It’s a long list of these companies. Yeah, you know, Tesla as well. You know, Dojo and what—they’re designing their own chips in cars. But it’s also Lockheed Martin, and, you know, Raytheon, and all of the defense contractors, and, you know, the Department of Defense, in many cases, designs their own chips as well. So, you know, the list of these customers for foundries is actually quite broad. And until I changed the corporate strategy three years ago, Intel said: No, you can’t come into our factories. And now we’re saying, yes, please. And we’re becoming industry standard and making that available, you know, across the industry, across the globe. And key segments, like the national security interest, are super critical for us to enable. FORTT: We’ve talked about the policy implications for semiconductor manufacturing and what’s necessary to set up that ecosystem domestically. But there’s also a knowledge ecosystem and a knowledge pipeline that, arguably, needs to be created and nurtured. What’s your assessment of the state of U.S. investment in education, and whether there are the human workers, that I assume will still be necessary in the AI era, to run these fabs and design the chips that are going to run through them? GELSINGER: Yeah, there’s very good news here, and there is not-so-good news. The very good news is that the world sends their best in their brightest to U.S. universities, right? Our university system is chunking out, you know, every AI leader, you know, every, you know, innovator of quantum computing and neuromorphic—you know, that’s all being done in the U.S. So we clearly have the top tier, right? You know, unquestionably it’s here. We have a great pipeline of those capabilities. We lost all the manufacturing sciences, right? You know, we just sort of said, oh, I just want good quarterly results. I get that better in software. And, you know, sorry, Chuck, right? (Laughs.) You know, in other category—you know, higher margin. You know, so there are areas that we lost focus for. So some of those need to be built up. And, for instance, when we announced the Ohio site, you know, I stood on stage and I said: Today, the Rust Belt ends. Today, the silicon heartland begins. And we’re right next to Ohio State. You know, we have the top ten universities in that area committing to develop the programs for the talent that we need for the future. We committed fifty million (dollars), National Science Foundation has committed fifty million (dollars) for those programs. And, you know, there’s a surge of interest to rebuild those areas in the U.S. And I do think—you know, it will takes us a while to get those capabilities back, but I believe we’re well on course to do that. And I believe the talent pipelines will be there if the jobs are there. And a lot of people, hey, they want to come back to the Midwest. Yeah, right? (Laughter.) You know, when I gave the commencement speech at Ohio State, I said to every mother and grandmother in the audience: Bring your kids home. We want them right back here in the Midwest. So I was playing to the hometown crowd a little bit, but it seemed to work. (Laughter.) FORTT: Yeah. it also happens to be a purple state, so that doesn’t hurt. GELSINGER: Ah, may have—may have affected our decision. FORTT: (Laughs.) So, first of all, I’m going to open it up to questions in just a couple of minutes. So have those ready. When you look at Intel’s cadence of this turnaround that you’re trying to drive, where are you both on the strategy and then on the financial result? GELSINGER: Yeah. So when I took the job, my—as Linda and I—my wife is Linda. As we were debating the job—ruined my Christmas in deciding whether to take the assignment. Linda asked me two questions. She said how much—how much you going to have to work? And I said to her, I don’t know. A lot. And then said, how long? You know, we were just expecting our eighth grandchild, right? So she wasn’t expecting me to, like, you know, spend another decade or two in the workplace. And I said, it wasn’t less than five years to turn this around. You know, it’s well over a decade of bad performance and strategy. You don’t fix that in this kind of industry. So here we are, three years into what I said was at least five years. And I’d say we’re about halfway through the journey. You know, the technology is coming back to life. You know, the products are coming back to life. You know, we’ve laid out this clean separation of the two businesses inside of Intel. You know, we went through—you know, our financial trough was Q1 of last year, where I had the—you know, the distinct displeasure of announcing Intel’s first loss in over three decades, right. You know, and we’ve bounced off the bottom. You know, and now we’re—you know, we’re well over a buck of earnings this year, what the street is forecasting. Our consensus too. So, you know, we’re on the financial journey to build it back. You know, that said, we still have several years to go, right? This is—you know, if you want a—right, a great, you know, pop in your portfolio in the next two weeks, we’re not it. But I don’t want you. I want people who are committed to the strategic journey of rebuilding the most iconic technology company in American history, who is building long-term manufacturing capacity for the digital future that is more critical to every aspect of human life, the national security, and the economic engine. That’s who I want as my investor. And that’s a long-term, you know, commitment. And we’re well on our way to getting there. And we bounced off the bottom of the stock price when it was in the twenties. It was a great buy. So I bought a bunch, right? FORTT: (Laughs.) So it sounds like you’re saying Intel is not a meme stock? GELSINGER: So, no. So, all right. But, hey, this is a long-term journey to rebuild a company and rebuild value. And semiconductors—you know, there’s only a couple, three companies that can do this on the planet. And there’s only one of them that’s a Western company. And if you want to jump into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, all you have to do is invest tens of billions of capital, tens of billions of R&D, and do that for forty or fifty years. OK, then you can be a competitor in leading-edge technology. You know, there just aren’t those other opportunities. And the industry is consolidating because of the capital intensity and the R&D intensity. So in that sense, I view this as a—you know, not just restoring in honor of the founders Grove, Noyce, and Moore, right, the people I came back to the unique position Intel plays in the technology industry. But, you know, this is rebuilding the Western supply chains of the world. Those are the three reasons I came back. And we’re going to get them done. FORTT: All right. Well, we’ve got a full room and we’ve also got audience online. So first in the room. Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, I saw your hand first. Q: Great job, Jon. Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. I worked with Jon for a long time. Thanks for doing this, Pat. The foundry business, will it ever be profitable, do you think? Or do we just assume that it has to live on government subsidy in the name of national security or for the sake of national security? GELSINGER: Oh, absolutely. It must be profitable. It must become cashflow-positive. You know, and the picture that we laid out literally on Tuesday of this week was that we expect to break even in that business in the 2027 timeframe. And then it turns nicely profitable. As we go through the rest of the decade, we start to see ROIC, you know, get to the double-digit range by the end of the decade. But, you know, part of the problem is we have to significantly overinvest to get back to competitive. So we were years behind. So, you know, we had to churn capital and R&D investments to catch up. And that’s expensive. And, when I build the new factory, you know, it takes me four to five years to build the factory. So I’m investing 30 billion (dollars) of capital before I get a penny of revenue, right? And then you got to ramp that new factory. So that takes a couple, three years. But it doesn’t even start producing profits, right, out of a new factory for seven or eight years, right? You know, so it’s hard to pay for your cost of capital with those investments, you know, in a short period of time. So this is a long game in that regard. But, you know, semiconductors, yeah, it’s a profitable industry if you’re ready to go through these hard cycles, long-term investments. And our objectives as we think about chips and the long-term chips policies, is we have to rebuild a vibrant ecosystem on American soil. You know, it’s not about sustained investments and so on. I think that’s appropriate. You know, good tax policy, you know, good investment policy, you know, good long-term R&D. But we have to make this an economic industry back on American soil. That’s what we’re off to do. But we needed a jolt, let’s say, to fix some of those huge gaps, and to start rebuilding the ecosystem and supply chains. FORTT: I saw a hand here up front. That was the first one I saw. Q: Hi. Fred Hochberg. I was in the Obama administration with Michael—(laughter)—and others. (Laughter.) So this may be a question to—take us out of Intel. You know, automobiles are becoming more and more—as they become more electric and more chip-based—we see a lot of twelve-year-old cars on the road today. That’s the average age. No one wants a twelve-year-old computer. No one wants a two- or three-year-old iPhone. How does that ripple effect through the whole rest of our economy? I mean, the auto industry is a huge driver of our economy. Can you just help us—how would we navigate that? How is the world going to navigate that? GELSINGER: Yeah. And just to, you know, put a few numbers against the—you know, if you pick on the auto industry for a second. The auto industry in 2021-2022, about 4 percent of the bill of materials of the car was electronics. The estimates are by 2030, that hits 20 percent. So a 5X increase in the amount of electronics and semiconductors going into cars. You know, obviously, the electrification of the car, you know, what we call the software-defined car, right? You know, I mean, some of the modern cars that you’re seeing today, they have seventeen screens in the car, right, for some of the high-end models today—for the kids, for the navigation, for the different—you know, seventeen different displays. And, of course, you know, electrification. And, of course, the AV, you know, autonomous driving. So, you know, a 5X increase in the semiconductor technology going into cars. And this is across industry after industry. And that’s why, you know, today semiconductors is about a $600 billion industry. By 2030, trillion-plus, right? So, you know, and these are—this is one of the factors that are driving that. Now, how do I expect the car to look, you know, going forward? I do expect, you know, when you pull in, right, you’re not going to need oil in the car anymore, since you don’t have a combustion engine. You know, but every once in a while you will get a computer upgrade, right? You already get down the wire upgrades and software into the car. You know, your braking system, you want it to be firmer? Great, I’ll change that, right? You know, the automation of driving, mapping, all of those kinds of things are going to be a combination of cloud, you know, delivered services and computing. And every once a while you’ll come and you’ll get a new computer plugged into your car. And, you know, I do think it will drive a more aggressive refresh cycle for the automotive industry as well over time. So I think in these kinds of things, the capabilities, you know, will be so significant that you’ll see over the next decade are the result of electrification, right, you know, these software capabilities, and autonomous driving, you know, that we do expect to see acceleration in that industry. And I think you’ll see similar characteristics in other industries as well. You know, whether that’s construction equipment, farm equipment. You know, this combination of electrification, AI capabilities will truly be, I would say, so powerful for business process improvement in many of those industries, and acceleration, right, of the introduction of technology as a result. FORTT: Well, we have a question from our remote audience. OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from James Sullivan. Q: Good morning from Singapore. And thank you very much for taking the question. Pat, you had noted that both countries like Taiwan and Korea had chosen this industry, and that the U.S. is pivoting towards a more similar industrial policy. I would say the U.S. isn’t the only country making that decision. If you could compare and contrast, the policy decisions that you see coming out of both China and the United States relative to the semiconductor industry. And if you have a view in terms of where this ends up, that would be fantastic. Thank you very much. GELSINGER: Sure. You know, and if we look, you know, across the world, obviously, we’ve seen policy in Europe as well. You’ve seen strong policy in Japan. India has taken some steps here as well. Singapore has also programs in place. You know, China has probably been the most aggressive of any of the countries. And, you know, they—you know, their equivalent of the CHIPS Act, you know, it was probably four to 5X bigger in China. You know, what they’ve put in place. So they’ve been quite aggressive for this industry. Obviously, one of the limitations for China has been the export policies that the U.S. has driven as well. You know, that limits some of the most advanced capabilities to emerge in that industry. It’s led some, like me, to believe that, hey, leading-edge technology is going to be a good market to be in. Trailing edge is going to be heavily pressured by the overinvestments that we see China making over time. So I do think it’s going to create some distortions in the industry as a result. FORTT: And “leading edge” meaning your most sophisticated chips that are using the most advanced, what you call, process technology? GELSINGER: Yes. Yeah. And, you know, today, you know, we’re about to introduce our first below two nanometer technology. And not trying to make you all semiconductor experts, but the Chinese are sort of limited about ten nanometers. And, you know, and that’s sort of going to be the floor for how far they can go. And we’re going to go from two, to 1.4, to 1.0. You know, so that gap is going to become larger over time. Now this, of course, you know, the Chinese, you know, they’re going to build AI, you know, chips. They’re going to build phones and, you know, so on. Are they going to rely on, you know, our products and exports? Or are they going to be overinvesting in creating some of those technologies themselves? And today, you clearly see them trying—(laughs)—you know, to invest in their industry to build their suppliers, that they’re not dependent on the rest of the world. So more of the dual circulation model is emerging. But I think these technologies are so hard. You know, I expect the leadership position that the U.S. will have will be on the order of a decade—U.S., Europe, Japan. And, you know, as I talk about our overall export policies, you can’t ignore the China market. This is 25-ish percent of the global semiconductor market. So I need 25 percent less factories if I don’t have access to the China market. So we would say good policy is export all of our products we can to China, right? It’s a great market. It allows me to invest more in R&D and manufacturing. Be very thoughtful about what technologies you want to be exportable. You know, there are good, valid reasons for national security and others. As, you know, Jake Sullivan has said, you know, small garden, high fence. You know, be thoughtful about that. But the last piece that I would say in this, is we must align with our global allies. And in the semiconductor industry in particular, that means Europe and Japan. Almost every semiconductor technology, it comes from U.S., Europe, or Japan. And if we are aligned in our export policies, on how we view the rest of the world, that defines the technology for the world. So in that, those three, to me, you know, that is good policy framework for the future. FORTT: Let me look over to this side. Try to be even handed. Here. Q: Hi. I’m Emily from Goldman Sachs. Thanks so much for being here and speaking with us today. You know, you’ve spoken to the fact that your plan is long term for Intel. Given the uncertainty and headwinds in terms of, you know, current policy, you know, Wall Street valuation headwinds, you know, how did you get the board on the same page? (Laughter.) That seems difficult. And also, as a technologist myself, like, how do you keep kind of so engaged with the cutting-edge technology, given your role as, you know, CEO? How do you keep that balance? GELSINGER: Yeah. Thank you. On the first one, when Linda and I were debating the topic and deciding to take the job, I wrote a strategy document for the board. And when they asked me to take the job, I said: I need two things. One is, it must be unanimous. We are going on a hard journey. And the board must be aligned to me but, secondly, to the strategy. This is an expensive, long-term strategy. And if you want a guy to, you know, just clean up the company, break it into pieces, sell off the component parts and so on, that’s not me. And that’s not the strategy that we’re going on. Go hire somebody else. But this is the strategy. And I’m the leader to go drive that strategy. And we had unanimity when I joined it. And part of the reason we could roll out this strategy so quickly is we’ve got 100 percent alignment of the board to me as the CEO and to that strategy. And, by the way, when I slow down and write the next book, right, for future leaders, you know, to me, this is a good thing to do in any leadership decision—both for those who are the board, or calling somebody, as well as for somebody coming into the role. If you don’t have alignment on their support for you and for the strategy you’re going to pursue, don’t take the job, right? You must bring those two together into harmony. And we moved, you know, well through it. Now, of course, part of my job is the board has to stay on board, right? And one of the other things I would say is the board should never surprise their CEO. And the CEO should never surprise their board. FORTT: How are they doing? GELSINGER: And, you know, communications, and, you know, keeping it—it’s not that we don’t have tough conversations. Part of the board’s job is to have tough conversation. Pat, do you really need 40 billion (dollars) of capital authorization, right? That’s, like, a freaking big number. What are you talking about, right? You know, they should be challenging that. You know, you want good inspection on that kind of thing. But at the end of the day, we need to come to harmony, right, on such an audacious strategy. Because we know, right, you know, there’ll be questions from Wall Street. There’s going to be, you know, those who are doubters on the journey. And, you know, certainly will not be the first day that I wake up at 2:00 in the morning, are we going to be able to pull this off? OK. OK, Lord, help me, right, you know, for it. Because it is a challenging journey on that. You had a second— FORTT: Technologist. GELSINGER: Oh, and the technologist piece. One is, you know, when I became a technician at Intel, it was because I loved technology, right? And to me, a great day is spending time with engineers asking technology questions. I do technology CEO review with the team every week for a couple of hours, right? And to me, that’s some of my most fun hours of the week. I mean, meeting with Jon, that’s a fun hour of the week, right? And my government affairs team, and so on like that. But what do I really enjoy? You know, it’s the technology and customers using the technology. And if you’re going to be, and I really believe this, that particularly for technology—a technology company should never be led by somebody who’s not a technologist. You got to love technology. And you have to have an innate sense for the technology itself, as you’re making these very hard, long-term decisions. And I think if you look across the history of the industry, you know, technologists running technology companies have well outperformed the alternatives. FORTT: In the back. Q: OK. Pat, you know, I’m Jean-Hugues. I’m a partner with McKinsey. I love the technology, you know, point. Listen, if we were in the same room in Taiwan, or in Europe, you know, about, you know, corporate leaders, two-thirds of them will be engineers, master of science. And, you and I, you know, have that as a common. Why are we failing in our country to get the top talent to do science? You know, it’s a long-term question, but this is, as you say, what can I get us, you know, to solve for the future of humanity? So any advice of what our country should do about science? And why are we failing globally on that here? GELSINGER: Yeah. You know, I think about the two policy things—given this forum and Council. To me, the two policy things are every graduate in a technology-related, you know, field should get a green card attached to their diploma, right? If the world wants their best talent to come and get educated here, keep them, right? Just every opportunity that we get. And if I could fix one thing in our immigration policy, that’s the one. And by the way, if you go look at the most successful companies in Silicon Valley, how many of them were led by hungry, bright immigrants? It’s an extraordinary percentage of those companies. And I think there’s magic inside of that. You know, they’re hungry. They’re smart. You know, many of them were educated here. And they love our way of life. They’ve chosen, you know, the values of America. Keep them every chance that we get. You know, the second thing is long-term R&D, right? And, you know, like, right now—you know, there’s a bill in front... [truncated]"

The iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on March 28, 2024, that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on May 27, according to reports to regional authorities. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File) Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday. The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a massive surge in hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs. Winnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday Mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.

According to Jeremy Siegel, economist and professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the uptrend in stocks is here to stay. Don't miss Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today , no matter what the US Fed does or says Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) “The momentum is so strong in this market,” he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg . “I don't think this bull run is over. I think that we have more to go.” The tech sector has been a highlight in this market, particularly due to the exceptional performance of a group of mega-cap tech giants last year that earned the nickname the ""Magnificent Seven.” This elite group includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). More recently, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia have continued to perform strongly, leading strategists to dub them the ""Fabulous Four."" Is the market overvalued? Given the extended rally in stocks, host Romaine Bostick asked Siegel if the entire market is overvalued. His answer was negative. “No, I mean, we look at the Magnificent Seven, or you call it the Fabulous Four, or just the tech sector, we see 25 to 30 times earnings,” Siegel explained, referring to the price-to-earnings ratio, a key metric used in stock valuation. Tech is one among the 11 sectors of the stock market, and Siegel highlights the importance of considering valuations in sectors beyond tech. “You just take out this tech sector, there's 10 other sectors outside of tech, and they're more like 17 times forward earnings, which is an extremely reasonable level of valuation and pretty much on par with historical averages,” he remarked.

Here's how ‘Pockets’ of opportunities To be sure, valuation is not the sole metric that strategists use to identify opportunities. But if you’re looking for value, Siegel sees one group that could have major upside potential. Story Continues “When you say about pockets of reasonable and even low valuations, as we know once we get to the mid cap and the small stocks , we're talking about, you know, the mid teens and even the low teens in many of those averages,” he said. “So if we broaden out over here, we still could have a lot of ways to go in a lot of these stocks.” Mid-cap and small-cap stocks represent companies with medium and smaller market capitalizations, respectively. Mid-cap stocks, typically defined as having a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion, are often seen as a middle ground between the growth potential of small caps and the stability of large caps. Small-cap stocks, usually with market caps below $2 billion, are considered higher risk but offer higher growth potential. Both categories can diversify an investment portfolio, though they come with different risk profiles and potential rewards compared to their large-cap counterparts. For investors who don’t want to pick individual stocks, investing in ETFs can be a strategic way to gain access to the group. For mid-caps, SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF Trust (MDY) and the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) are popular options. For small-caps, names like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (VB) could provide a starting point for further research.

The reinvention of a Virginia city built by railway robber barons as a biotech hub defies default strategies of trying to attract new players to do what was done by the companies that left or closed. The story of Roanoke shares the cover of the rebooted print edition of Governing magazine * with a feature on what states are doing to increase the availability and affordability of housing. Governing Editor Alan Greenblatt discusses the magazine’s return to print after five years of being web-only. Greenblatt emphasizes the value of a physical magazine for high-level government officials, providing in-depth analysis and innovative ideas on pressing issues. The magazine aims to offer a thoughtful and lasting resource that readers can reference on their desks, offering a break from the overwhelming flood of web-based information. The cover stories feature Roanoke’s successful transition to biotech and the growing concern of housing shortages addressed by state policymakers. Here are the takeaways from this episode: Show Notes Solving the Economic Development Puzzle: Roanoke, Va., faced economic hardship when two Fortune 500 companies closed their headquarters. It was situation familiar to many communities that have lost major employers, leading to prolonged efforts to rebuild. However, Roanoke chose a different path. The city went all in on biotech, leveraging existing resources like Carilion Clinic and a new medical school from Virginia Tech. The shift resulted in a thriving biotech research institute that grew from one to over 500 employees. Shift in State Involvement in Housing: States are increasingly recognizing the widespread need for affordable and quality housing, leading them to take a more active role previously reserved for local governments. Zoning Policy Reform: States are reconsidering zoning policies, traditionally a local concern, as a factor contributing to housing cost increases and supply constraints. They are exploring changes to zoning laws to encourage more diverse housing options: West Coast: States like Oregon, Washington and California are permitting multifamily buildings in single-family areas to increase housing density. East Coast: Pennsylvania’s Whole-Home Repairs policy offers grants to homeowners for essential repairs, aiming to preserve existing housing stock. Meanwhile, Rhode Island explores a public developer model, inspired by Montgomery County, Md., to build mixed-income housing. Mountain West: Colorado purposefully introduced multiple housing reform bills with overlapping coalitions to build a broad base of support for legislative change. It has also taken administrative action to reduce turnaround for permitting and eliminate mandatory parking. Colorado took a page from what worked in Montana, which pursued policies that require cities to allow duplexes and accessory dwelling units in single-family areas to address housing affordability and supply issues. While zoning policy reform may address higher housing costs associated with restrictive zoning, it doesn't necessarily lead to immediate cost reduction. Importance of Transit Proximity: Progressive lawmakers recognize the benefits of building dense housing near transit hubs to reduce car dependency and improve efficiency in moving people. The issue also covers the turnover among school superintendents, citizenship for American Indians, city lobbying and the impact of clean energy credits.

The tech industry led layoffs in the first quarter of 2024 making up 16.5% of all the job cuts in the period, according to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report. There were 257,254 job cuts in the first quarter of 2024, with the tech industry accounting for 42,442 of these layoffs. Dell Technologies ( DELL ), International Business Machines ( IBM ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet's Google ( GOOGL ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) were among the tech companies that announced job cuts in the quarter. ""Tech companies are aggressively spending on AI and next-generation initiatives while cutting on non strategic areas,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Investopedia, noting that the firm believes ""the vast majority of job cuts are in the rear view mirror but will play a major role this year in the strong getting stronger."" March marked the highest number of layoffs in a month since January 2023. ""Layoffs certainly ticked up to round out the first quarter, though below last year’s levels,"" Vice President of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Andy Challenger said, adding that ""many companies appear to be reverting to a ‘do more with less’ approach."" The report indicated that ""cost-cutting"" was the most common reason employers gave for eliminating jobs with 66,302 of the layoffs being tied to cost reduction. Restructuring was the second most common justification accounting for 48,352 layoffs, followed by ""business, unit, or store closures,"" with 38,619 job cuts. U.S. employers announced plans for 36,795 new jobs in the first quarter of 2024, representing a 48% decline from the number of new positions announced in the same period in 2023. ""This is the lowest number of announced hiring plans since 2016,"" Challenger noted.

Long before the war, foreign investment in Israel was declining as businesspeople across the world flinched at a country apparently eating itself with non-stop political protests. Then the war came. According to the FT , investment in Israel dropped from $1billion (£795 million) in September 2023 to just $300 million in October. Many investors said while they weren’t pulling their money entirely, they were just anxious and wanted to wait out the war before committing. Business hates uncertainty, and this could yet have serious negative effects on an economy built on foreign investment. Capital inflows are substantially higher than other countries in the region – a reward for the government’s massive research and development spend (the most in the world as a percentage of GDP). But amid the turbulence, there are glimmers of hope. Aviva Steinberger Director of Innovation Diplomacy at Start-Up Nation Central [Missing Credit] Start-Up Nation Central (SNC), an NGO named after the 2009 book by author Dan Senor, is an enterprise whose sole aim is selling Israel to the world. Matching foreign investors with innovative Israeli companies, SNC is based in the heart of Tel Aviv, a stone’s throw from celebrity chef Eyal Shani’s first restaurant, its staff are working to make sure the world understands that Israel’s lucrative tech sector – which employs as many as 15 per cent of all Israelis, from global tech giants to tiny embryonic businesses – is alive and kicking. Aviva Steinberger, the director of innovation diplomacy at SNC, is defiantly upbeat about Israel’s prospects. “Fifteen per cent of the tech sector has been or is in reserve duty. From CEOs to CTOs and CIOs and all the way down. And so the impact is felt, but it hasn’t put the tech sector on hold in any way. “All the companies have evolved and adapted and we’ve even seen this very practically. A CTO will be literally in the field on reserve duty and he’s texting the team about a strategy or an interview.” It helps that this experience isn’t new. Many of the companies Sunc works with have employees in Ukraine, and are used to working around the busy schedules of soldiers on front lines. Another factor helping Israeli tech is the location. While most of Israel came under fire in the days after October 7, the tech sector is based largely in the centre of the country around Tel Aviv – far away from all but a few of Hamas’s rockets and somewhere that has been relatively calm since the war started. This security has allowed businesses to continue functioning, especially those that sell goods and services outside Israel, where demand remains strong. Facilitating diplomatic ties through business is key to Sunc’s mission. In a post-Abraham Accords world, where more and more traditionally hostile countries are seeing the value of Israel as an investment, they’ve found that selling innovative Israeli tech is the best way to build bonds. When asked if there’s been a reticence to engage with Israel from Arab countries since the war, Steinberger said: “We continue to engage. There are relationships happening. There’s a lot of business engagement happening. It’s just below the radar. “It requires more effort for fewer headlines. But now we’re not after headlines. We’re after laying the groundwork for real business collaboration to take hold.” Tech Challenge by Roche for a better future and SNC staff [Missing Credit] There seems to be a natural opportunity to match up some of Israel’s historic enemies with tech that could fundamentally change their countries for the better. Steinberger is convinced that selling these technologies will only boost Israel’s position in the Middle East and help resolve conflicts with its neighbours. “Water security, food security, agritech, renewable energy, these are issues that technology is critical for being able to resolve them. As citizens of the region, we’re just as susceptible and vulnerable to those challenges.” To get more Israel news , click here to sign up for our free Israel Briefing newsletter .

The controversial law restricts kids under the age of 14 from social media platforms, and DeSantis is ready to defend in court, according to Attorney General Ashley Moody during a recent event in Jacksonville. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mom (@boymom6247) The bill, also known as HB 3, was a top priority for the legislative session and had the backing of House Speaker Paul Renner. Limit social media access for kids under 16, except for 14- and 15-year-olds with parental permission. The idea is to shield youngsters from harmful effects such as addiction and potential contact with predators. Tech industry groups like NetChoice oppose the law, stating that it violates the First Amendment rights. Some individuals claim that mandatory data collection is unconstitutional and risky, as it can lead to privacy breaches. Renner supports the bill and highlights its aim to reduce the addictive aspects of social media rather than regulating its content. He’s confident it’ll pass the constitutional test, stressing that it’s all about protecting kids from being glued to screens for hours. DeSantis vetoed an earlier version of the bill but hashed out a revised plan with Renner that allows parental consent for 14-—and 15-year-olds and drops age verification requirements for adults. Instead, the new plan threatens social media platforms with lawsuits for breaching age restrictions, a move aimed at ensuring compliance without extra red tape. This tactic is no stranger to the tech industry, which previously fought a similar battle over Florida’s 2021 social media law, currently tied up in federal courts. Renner anticipates another legal showdown, but he’s unwavering in his conviction that Florida’s got this one in the bag. For him, it’s all about safeguarding kids in the digital age, even if it means facing off against tech giants in court. In addition to social media, the bill also addresses another digital minefield: minors’ access to online pornography. This aspect received less attention, but it is part of Florida’s broader efforts to protect children from harmful online content."
