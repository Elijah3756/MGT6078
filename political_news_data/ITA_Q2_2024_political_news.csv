In a statement released on the anniversary of the creation of the SDF and Defense Agency — the precursor to the current Defense Ministry — defense chief Minoru Kihara pledged to continue working to build trust in the ostensibly pacifist country’s armed forces amid “the most severe and complicated security environment of the postwar era.” “As minister of defense, I am determined to work together with the members of our armed forces so that we can continue to live up to the trust and expectations of the people,” Kihara said Monday."

Xi signals further military purges to eradicate corruption Print Washington — Speaking at China’s first military political work conference in a decade this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the need for the military to eliminate corruption and strengthen its loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. He also warned of ""deep-seated issues"" in the military’s politics, ideology, work style and discipline. ""The gun barrels should always be in the hands of those who are loyal and reliable to the party and there must be no place for corrupt elements to hide in the military,"" Xi said in his remarks, according to China’s state broadcaster CCTV. In a lengthy overview, Xi urged the military to enhance the thoroughness of its ideological transformation by following the Communist Party’s theories, improving the leadership of party organizations, and eradicating conditions that may allow corruption to thrive. Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the National Policy Foundation in Taiwan, said the remarks show that ""Xi wants to emphasize the importance for the military to be loyal to the party and his leadership while signaling his concerns about how corruption affects the military"" and its capabilities. Xi ""hopes the warnings can help accelerate the development of advanced technologies and equipment,"" Chieh told VOA by phone. Since last July, China has ousted more than a dozen top military commanders, including former defense minister Li Shangfu, and leaders of the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force. While the Chinese government hasn’t publicly linked their removals to corruption, some foreign media outlets and experts see their removal as part of the extended anti-corruption campaign Xi initiated since he came to power in 2012. Reuters reported last September that Li was facing an investigation related to the procurement of military equipment. The removal of top military leaders not only highlights the prevalence of corruption; it also raises other questions. ""Since corruption has hampered Russia’s ability to supply its military in the Ukraine war, it raises the question of whether the Chinese military’s capabilities have been compromised by corruption or not,"" Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. FILE - A child sits near canons on a retired warship at the Chinese People's Liberation Army Naval Museum in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province on April 23, 2024. There is also a concern about the impact Xi’s persistent attempts to eradicate corruption will have on the military internally. ""When a former defense minister can be abruptly removed from his position without any clear explanation, it will create a deep sense of fear within the military because no one knows when they might be the next one to be purged,"" said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. Su said this is part of the Communist Party’s strategy of ""ruling with terror,"" which allows Xi to concentrate decision-making power on the top leadership within the party. ""While tackling corruption in the military is important to Xi, the anti-corruption campaign has become a political tool for him to consolidate his control over the military,"" Su told VOA by phone. In January, the state-run People’s Liberation Army Daily published an opinion piece that emphasized the importance of implementing Xi’s instructions for the military and extending the party’s governance to the grassroots level. ""By strengthening the supervision of military personnel, it builds a firm first line of defense for soldiers to comply with the rules and refuse to be corrupted,"" said the opinion piece run by the PLA Daily. While Xi looks to consolidate control and build loyalty, both Chieh and Su see other potential side-effects such as the promotion of unqualified leaders and the impact that could have on the military’s capabilities and readiness. ""When Beijing puts so much emphasis on loyalty to the party, it could reduce the military’s combat capabilities and make the military huge but weak,"" Su said. Xi’s expressed desire to continue cracking down on corruption also means the Chinese military may need to go through a period of adjustment, Chieh said. ""Normally, the military’s combat capabilities will decrease following several rounds of purges, so I expect the Chinese military to go through a tough period of adjustment and reorganization over the next few years,"" he told VOA. And while top officials in the U.S. have repeatedly highlighted 2027 as the year that the Chinese military aims to possess the capabilities to invade Taiwan, Chieh thinks the purges and Xi's remarks at the political work conference suggest the PLA may be hard pressed to achieve that goal. ""Since the Chinese military’s command system and the rocket force’s capabilities may not have reached the goal set by the top leadership due to rampant corruption, I think this makes it even less likely for the Chinese military to have the capabilities required to invade Taiwan by 2027,"" he said.

The report covers industry analysis including the key market drivers, emerging technology trends, and major challenges faced by market participants. It also offers insights regarding key factors and government programs that are expected to influence the demand for military platforms over the forecast period. Austrian defense spending, as with many other European nations, has seen an appreciable uptick as the crisis in continental security stemming from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Austria is not a member of NATO, however it is an EU member, and still contributes to European security initiatives through the EU as well as other organizations like the OSCE and the UN. Being a formally neutral nation also comes with its own implications for security and defense: Austria maintains a small but well-equipped and highly professional standing army, alongside a robust system of 'people's militia' reserve forces - all males aged 18-35 must complete a minimum of 6 month's military service, or 9 months in 'alternative public service' for objectors. Those who have completed training are eligible to be called up again in times of national emergency. In response to the deteriorating security environment, Austria is beginning to modernise aspects of its existing forces as well as expanding to newer capabilities, such as new medium and long-range air defense systems. It is increasing the mechanisation of its forces with additional orders of Pandur APCs, and will begin seeking a replacement for its Eurofighter combat jet fleet in the coming years, alongside other purchases such as new helicopters from Augusta Westland (Leonardo). Whilst total spending had a historic tendency to fluctuate, since 2022 Austria has seen consistent increases in defense spending, and this is anticipated to continue through until 2029, where spending peaks at $5.8 billion. Key Highlights Drivers of Defense expenditure include Russia, Ukraine and European Security, tensions in the Middle East, and military technology and rearmament Major ongoing procurement program include procurement of long and medium-range air defense systems.

Photo: Tu Chien-jung, Taipei Times PROCEDURE: If any Chinese aircraft enters within 12 nautical miles of the nation’s territorial airspace and water, the right of self-defense would be invoked, minister said By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter 請繼續往下閱讀... The military would be ordered to exercise the right of self-defense if the Chinese People’s Liberation Army （PLA） attacks Taiwan or its outlying islands, or enters without permission within 12 nautical miles （22.2km） of its territorial airspace and waters, Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo （顧立雄） told lawmakers yesterday. Koo, who was head of the National Security Council under former president Tsai Ing-wen （蔡英文）, gave briefings to lawmakers at the meeting of the legislature’s Foreign and National Defense Committee for the first time after being sworn in on May 20. He is the nation’s seventh defense minister without a military background. During the question-and-answer session, Chinese Nationalist Party （KMT） legislators Huang Jen （黃仁） and Wang Hung-wei （王鴻薇） inquired about the ministry’s definitions of “first strike” and the right of defense. Koo said that the military would be ordered to exercise the right of defense if the PLA launches a first strike against Taiwan or its outlying islands, or its facilities, aircraft and sea vessels in operation. “The right of self-defense would also be invoked if any Chinese aircraft enters within 12 nautical miles of our territorial airspace and waters, and the military should defend and respond in proportion to the size of the attack,” Koo said. Wang also asked how the military obtained information about China’s “Joint Sword-2024A” military exercise on May 23 and 24, and whether its assessment showed that more military exercises are expected in the second half of the year. Koo said he cannot say how the military secured information about the exercise, but it forms assessments based on various signs. “Our military has always been able to obtain the updated status of the PLA, but there is no telling whether they would hold another exercise. We will closely monitor the situation,” he said. Meanwhile, Koo said that the ministry has lifted travel restrictions imposed on active military personnel. Although military personnel were not banned from traveling overseas, they were required to join group tours to ensure their safety and prevent them leaking confidential national security information. Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hung Sun-han （洪申翰） on Facebook wrote that such travel restrictions are meaningless as there is no mechanism to verify whether military personnel would only join group tours. More than 180,000 military personnel in the past few decades were subject to the restriction, including doctors and nurses in military hospitals or faculty members and instructors in military academies or colleges who do not teach subjects related to national intelligence, Hung said. Based on the revised regulations announced by the ministry on Wednesday, military personnel are allowed to travel independently as long as they provide a detailed itinerary, including flights and accommodation. They must present documents proving that they had traveled overseas when they return, such as a photocopy of their passports with arrival and departure stamps, boarding passes or documents provided by hotels. If military personnel join group tours, they must present travel itineraries and a copy of their travel service contract, the regulations say. Koo also said that military personnel with intelligence clearing would be regulated based on the level of confidential information to which they have access, rather than on their rank. The policy is to be changed after consulting with the US military system, he said. In addition, the ministry has relaxed a policy that bans chiefs of military units and their deputies from leaving their barracks at the same time, Koo said. “The requirement was previously set because of frequent harassment from Chinese military aircraft,” Koo said. “However, the military has a well-established chain of command and accumulated experiences. Following detailed discussions about the issue, we have decided to return to the normal division of labor between unit chiefs and deputies so military personnel at all levels can take care of their families as well,” he said. Food stipends for military personnel of all levels would increase, he added. 新聞來源： TAIPEI TIMES 免費訂閱 《自由體育》電子報 熱門賽事、球星動態不漏接 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法 相關新聞 焦點今日熱門 看更多！請加入自由時報粉絲團 網友回應"
https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/05/28/credible-certification-takes-flight,,Credible certification takes flight,20240528T010000Z,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/28/2717976.jpeg,thestar.com.my,English,Malaysia,ITA,Aerospace & Defense,aerospace,"PETALING JAYA: Even though Malaysia aspires to be a regional centre of excellence for civil aviation, the journey towards global recognition is way more than just having infrastructure – such as KLIA, Subang Aerotropolis and the Senai Aerospace Park, just to name a few. One low-key movement that the country is quietly undertaking is the quest to be South-East Asia’s leading aerospace nation by 2030 – as underlined in the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 (MAIB2030), a plan running from 2015 to 2030 that. If implemented correctly, it should generate RM55.2bil in total revenue and more than 32,000 positions with high income salaries, positioning Malaysia as an essential link in the global aerospace supply chain. The country’s aerospace sector has shown huge promise, emerging as South-East Asia’s second-largest aerospace industry that generates over 27,500 jobs, primarily in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) and aero-manufacturing subsectors, with a report from the Malaysia Investment Development Authority Website attributing these investments as coming from more than 230 domestic and foreign companies. In terms of revenue, the industry is anticipated to provide RM20.4bil in revenue for MRO, RM21.2bil for aero manufacturing as well as RM13.6bil for engineering and design services by 2030. With all of these in place, Malaysia must shine in another area, which is embracing industry-recognised certification linked to safety, reliability, and quality, along with the need for rigorous standard operating procedures. “To achieve their goals and ensure excellence, safety and global recognition, aerospace organisations are embracing AS9100, the Aerospace Quality Management Systems (AQMS) certification scheme,” said Zakaria Mohamad Nor, head of the Mechanical, Electrical and Automotive Sector of Sirim QAS International Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Sirim Group. He said in this regard, Sirim QAS is ready to play its role in assisting industry players to be proficient with AS9100 Aerospace Quality Management Systems (AQMS) certification. “The AS9100 is more than just a set of rules and regulations; it is a strategic tool for achieving success in the aerospace industry. “It provides guidelines and regulations for implementing a quality management system tailored to aviation, space, and defence organisations. “Companies operating in the aerospace sector must consistently manufacture and improve safe, dependable products that meet or surpass consumer and regulatory criteria to ensure satisfaction,” said Zakaria. The AS9100 Aerospace Quality Management Systems Certificate Scheme is essential for all businesses and organisations in the aerospace sector, including those involved in designing, manufacturing, maintenance and services. “Whether a company operates in commercial or military aviation, space or defence, it is imperative that the brand be associated with safety, airworthiness and adherence to global quality standards. Moreover, all leading aircraft OEMs require their suppliers and subcontractors to be AS9100-certified,” he said. The benefits of being AS9100-compliant are manifold, starting with enhanced access to global markets and improving a company’s standing with current and potential customers. “Organisations with AS9100 AQMS certification are better positioned to engage with aerospace industry players worldwide, from companies to government bodies. “This certification opens doors to larger-scale business opportunities. “Many government contracts, especially in aerospace and defence, mandate relevant certifications, making AS9100 certification a critical asset. “In line with the government’s strategy to bolster the local aerospace industry, having the AS9100 certification ensures product safety and reliability,” said Zakaria, adding that Sirim has a team of experienced auditors in this regard. As far as certification goes, Sirim QAS has a critical role in the fulfilment of Malaysia’s Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030, as coordinated by the National Aerospace Industry Corporation Malaysia (Naico Malaysia). “Through Naico Malaysia, the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry has designated Sirim as one of the service providers in the aerospace industry supply chain. “In accordance with international aerospace standards AS9100 (aero production), AS9110 (maintenance, repair and overhaul), and AS9120 (aerospace parts distribution), Sirim QAS initiated a five-year programme for the development of the Aerospace Quality Management Systems, making Sirim QAS an active contributor to Malaysia’s aerospace industry’s growth and competitiveness. According to Zakaria, Sirim QAS’ recent participation in the Singapore Air Show 2024 was intended to showcase his company’s expansion into the South-East Asia market for aerospace quality certification services, particularly highlighting its status as the first Asean-based company to offer aerospace standard 9100 in the region. “We also wanted to showcase Sirim QAS International as Malaysia’s leading testing, inspection, and certification services provider, emphasising its accreditation under various bodies. “We believe we have increased our visibility through good engagement with the aerospace community in South-East Asia, with Sirim successfully raising awareness about its expertise and offerings in aerospace quality certification services,” he added.

(When demand returned), many in (the talent pool) never came back in the western world,"" he said. As a result, there weren't adequate number of trained people to meet the sudden spurt in demand for parts, engines, and planes. That's when Kumar saw an opportunity for the Indian aerospace startups which were beginning to come of age due to the tremendous availability of talent in the country. ""The western world has a great shortage of manpower for highly skilled jobs. The big OEMs can find people but not the tier II, III & further down the line. So, there is an acute shortage of quality suppliers for aerospace. If you look at the output of the big OEMs, you can see that they are not able to meet even half the demand or less than that,"" said Kumar. ""At this point, I started thinking how we can alleviate this. Where do you go? You have to go to what are the friendly countries. India was in the short list with a deep experience and huge talent pool."" At this ""unique moment of time"" he thought of leaving Boeing and did so last year. Since then he has backed startups like Jeh Aerospace in India and is in talks with several more apart from advising VCs to do the same by shortlisting the right ones. ""I know over 200 suppliers (in India) really well. They have a really great opportunity and some truly world-class fantastic people. If you bring them together, you can create sustainable long-term successful businesses. That's how I got associated with these guys. The demand for aerospace products is tremendous and the supply chain will remain constrained. So as long as they (Indian supply chain industry) can maintain two things -- quality and delivery, -- there's infinite demand for these products,"" he said. Asked the size of his investments in India, Kumar just said he is ""investing some of my own personal savings in some companies. I'm also advising some big VC companies to find the right companies to support."" ""I'm in touch with at least 50 different Indian companies in that space. I'm not going to commit investment to all 50. In some I will do so and some I will refer to the VCs,"" he said. ""Most Indian startups don't have access to global markets. I am able to bridge that gap. Connecting the aerospace industry in the west with the Indian startup scene, that's what I'm trying to do,"" said Kumar who was the VP of Boeing F-15 programme when he left the aerospace major last year. He is now an angel investor in aerospace and defence startups like Jeh Aerospace and Conforming Inc and an advisor to leading VC firm General Catalyst.

In adjusting his take on the company now that it has ""Aerospace,"" attached to its name, one pundit following the stock reduced his price target. He still feels the shares have plenty of room to move higher, though. General Electric slims down into GE Aerospace The analyst behind the adjustment is Deutsche Bank 's Scott Deuschle, who lopped off $20 from his previous price target (back when the stock was just plain old General Electric) for a new level of $190 per share. That implies a nearly 22% upside from the current price. He also ported over his buy recommendation to GE Aerospace. The company, which is now more focused than the former General Electric, is deserving of a premium over its peers. Deuschle wrote that this is due to GE Aerospace's ""wide moat, dominant share position, strong long-term growth outlook, pricing power, high [return on total capital], high balance sheet optionality, and track record for beating and raising."" Deuschle is convinced GE Aerospace can soar. He pegged it as being one of Deutsche Bank's top stock picks in the aerospace and defense field.

Shares of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) traded up 5% as of 10:30 ET on Friday as investors took a fresh look at the potential of the aircraft-focused part of the business. A powerful force unleashed Amid all the issues experienced by General Electric over the last decade, aerospace was always a standout piece of the operation. The GE ticker took a plunge earlier this week to reflect that its energy business is now trading as a new entity, GE Verona , but the stock is slowly climbing back toward previous highs thanks to the potential of the aerospace market. GE Aerospace has exposure to some of the best-selling aviation platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 neo, thanks to its stake in the CFM International engine joint venture. Both Boeing and Airbus have order backlogs that will last through the rest of the decade, providing predictable growth. GE Aerospace also could have opportunities to take market share from rival RTX thanks to issues with that company's Pratt & Whitney engines . Half a dozen analysts have adjusted their price targets on GE downward this week to reflect the spinoff, but only one of those targets is below GE Aerospace's current share price. Now flying solo, is GE Aerospace stock a buy? GE Aerospace faces some near-term headwinds, including Boeing's ongoing issues with the 737 MAX and questions about how rapidly engine companies can ramp up production. But its potential for long-term growth is hard to ignore. For years, even as GE struggled under the weight of its debt burden and due to problems in its energy business and elsewhere, investors marveled at the strength of its aerospace segment and the potential for growth from here. Now, investors finally have the chance to buy into that potential without the baggage. For long-term focused investors, GE Aerospace ranks as one of the more attractive opportunities in its sector.

According to Matrade, the UK is a significant export destination for Malaysian aerospace products, as exports of aerospace products (parts of planes and helicopters) to the country stood at RM287.2 million in 2023. “The UK’s demand for aerospace products and services is anticipated to maintain its upward trajectory, driven by the resurgence of air travel, a spike in aircraft orders, and the expansion of the MRO sector. “Malaysian companies are encouraged to leverage this burgeoning demand by engaging with potential clients, project leaders and aerospace procurement officials during FIA 2024,” added Matrade. This year will mark Matrade’s fifth participation in the FIA. In 2022, Matrade had set up 332 business meetings and linkages, resulting in total sales of RM572.6 million. Malaysian companies wishing to participate in FIA 2024 may send in their application before April 26. Those who wish for more information may contact Matrade at 03-6207 7933. — Bernama"

These forward- looking statements often address GE Aerospace’s expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “target,” “preliminary,” or “range.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For GE Aerospace, particular areas where risks or uncertainties could cause GE’s actual results to be materially different than those expressed in GE Aerospace’s forward-looking statements include: changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including risk of recession, inflation, geopolitical conflict; supply chain constraints or disruptions, interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets (including GE Aerospace’s equity interest in GE HealthCare), commodity prices and exchange rates, and the impact of such changes and volatility on GE Aerospace’s business operations, financial results and financial position; GE Aerospace’s capital allocation plans, including the timing and amount of dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, organic investments, and other priorities; and other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such description may be updated or amended in any future reports that GE Aerospace files with the SEC. These or other uncertainties may cause GE Aerospace’s actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements. GE Aerospace does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.
