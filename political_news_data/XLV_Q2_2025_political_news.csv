N.J.) has been filed and seeks to represent investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Pharmaceuticals securities between February 27, 2025 and May 26, 2025 . The lawsuit comes after investors saw the price of their shares in Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( NASDAQ: RCKT ) crash over 60% on May 27, 2025 as a result of the company's announcement that the FDA put a clinical hold on its Phase 2 pivotal trial for RP-A501, an experimental therapy intended to treat patients with a rare gene disorder called Danon disease.

(REGN) Price Target Fatima Gulzar June 11, 2025 2 min read REGN Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is one of the 13 Biotech Stocks with Huge Upside Potential . JPMorgan has maintained its Overweight rating on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) after reducing its price objective from $950 to $800. Why Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) Crashed Last Week A pharmacist in a lab coat carefully analyzing a vial of medicine for its quality. Following poor IL-33 data in late May, the company believes that the recent selloff in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares is “very much overdone.” JPMorgan pointed out that IL-33 was never a key component of its model, though. The company stressed that, even without accounting for any pipeline contribution, Dupixent, Eylea, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’ solid cash position alone warrants a valuation far higher than current levels. JPMorgan anticipates several catalysts over the next six months that will help reset its value. Recently, the firm’s valuation was under pressure due to its IL-33 program’s lackluster Phase results. JPMorgan is still optimistic in spite of this, concentrating on important assets like Dupixent and Eylea that support the company’s financial stability. The company’s updated $800 estimate, which reflects confidence in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)’s core business and future potential milestones, still suggests significant upside. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) discovers, develops, and commercializes drugs to treat eye disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammation. It is one of the stocks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of REGN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Even Healthcare, a managed care startup, is making a foray into brick-and-mortar hospitals, marking a shift from digital-first care to full-stack healthcare delivery. It aims to open 25 hospitals over the next 36 months, Even Healthcare co-founder and COO Matilde Giglio has told Moneycontrol. The decision follows a $30-million Series-A funding round in October led by global investors, including Khosla Ventures. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad “We’re building the first hospital now, which will be inaugurated on July 15 in Bangalore,” Giglio said. “It’s the first of many. The majority of the capital we raised will go into building hospitals from scratch.” Giglio said the hospitals would not offer tertiary services such as oncology or cardiac care, allowing for a leaner capex model with an average investment of $3.5 million a hospital. The first facility, located on Bengaluru’s Race Course Road, will house 60–65 beds and focus on secondary- care procedures such as maternity, orthopaedics, and minor surgeries.

The company already operates six clinics in Bengaluru and its membership includes unlimited consultations, diagnostics and inpatient coverage through insurance partners. It follows the model of Kaiser Permanente, a non-profit private healthcare organisation in the US, under which it owns and manages the entire value chain — from medical coverage to hospitals to pharmacies. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Kaiser follows managed care model, where the focus is on making a person healthier through preventive consultations, screenings, nutrition and specialist support. A healthier person need lesser hospitalisation where the much of the healthcare costs are incurred. “We want to own the entire healthcare journey,” Giglio said. “Our doctors are salaried and incentivized based on clinical outcomes — not procedure volume. That’s a first in India.” The company’s approach aims to disrupt traditional fee-for-service models, which Giglio argues incentivises “overtreatment”. Instead, Even’s hospitals will prioritise patient outcomes and affordability, with pricing designed to be competitive for India’s middle class. Funding growth Even has raised more than $50 million since inception, with the latest $30 million round earmarked for hospital expansion. The company plans to fund growth through a mix of venture capital and debt, once initial hospitals demonstrate operational success. “We’re not rushing to raise more capital,” Giglio said. “We have a lot of money in the bank but we’re always open to the right partner.” The company’s revenue model is anchored in membership sales, which Giglio said accounts for the majority of income. Even closed FY24 with $30 million in revenue, and serves nearly 300,000 members, primarily in urban centres. Scale up Even plans to expand into Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Pune, with scouting already underway in several cities. Giglio acknowledged the operational challenges of scaling healthcare infrastructure but stressed the importance of standardisation and tech-driven processes. “We’re obsessed with customer experience,” she said. “Every touchpoint is tracked. Our clinics became profitable within four to six months.” The company’s phased rollout will begin with three hospitals in Bengaluru, followed by additional facilities in other cities. Giglio said the team includes seasoned healthcare executives from Columbia Asia and Narayana Health, ensuring clinical and operational rigour.

Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund ’s latest new fund offer , the Baroda BNP Paribas Health and Wellness Fund , is open for subscription and will close on June 23. This open-ended equity scheme will focus on companies expected to benefit from the rising demand in healthcare and wellness—an emerging megatrend both in India and globally. The fund aims to capitalise on the multi-decade structural growth story within the healthcare and wellness space. CEO comments on fund launch Best MF to invest Looking for the best mutual funds to invest? Here are our recommendations. View Details » “Over the last century, average life expectancy in India has more than tripled. Across every life stage—from toddler to septuagenarian—there is a constant need and expenditure towards well-being. Given the low starting base of per capita healthcare spending, we view this sector as a multi-decadal opportunity offering promising prospects for investors,” said Suresh Soni, CEO, Baroda BNP Paribas AMC. Also Read | Lumpsum vs SIP: Is caution killing the case for lumpsum? CIO on fund launch Live Events “India offers a $200 billion market cap opportunity with over 100 investible companies across pharma, diagnostics, Medtech, hospitals, insurance, and healthcare research,” said Sanjay Chawla, CIO – Equity, Baroda BNP Paribas AMC. The primary objective of the scheme is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing predominantly in equity and equity-related instruments of pharma and healthcare companies. The fund will be benchmarked against the BSE Healthcare Total Return Index and will be managed by Sanjay Chawla. This thematic fund is suited for investors with an investment horizon of three years or more. It offers an opportunity to participate in India’s growing health consciousness and invest in an evolving ecosystem of wellness-focused businesses. Sector Expected to Grow While India’s current per capita healthcare expenditure is significantly lower than that of developed markets, it is expected to grow exponentially. Key drivers include rising affordability, increasing awareness, longer life expectancy, and a higher incidence of chronic diseases, according to a press release. Experts’ Take on the New Launch Experts typically advise caution when it comes to investing in New Fund Offers (NFOs), unless the scheme offers something genuinely unique—such as access to an untapped investment theme or an enhanced proposition over existing options. Without a historical performance record, investors may find it difficult to make informed decisions. According to one expert, there are already over 10 pharma and healthcare-focused mutual funds available in the market. However, this new fund may adopt a distinct approach in terms of stock selection, portfolio construction, or focus on sub-segments like diagnostics, CDMOs, wellness, or healthcare services—potentially offering a fresh perspective within the broader theme. “As with any new fund, it does not yet have a performance track record. So, while the investment philosophy might be compelling, it’s sensible to monitor how the portfolio evolves and how the fund navigates different market conditions,” said Sagar Shinde, VP of Research at Fisdom, in a note to ETMutualFunds. Also Read | Mutual funds reduces overall cash allocation by Rs 6,200 crore to Rs 2.17 lakh crore in May “There's no pressing need to rush into the NFO . Given the ample choices already available in this category with proven track records, it’s better to wait, watch how this fund shapes up, and then consider it for investment based on merit,” Shinde added. Another expert shares a different opinion on this new fund as she mentions that Baroda BNP Paribas Health and Wellness Fund is not the first of its kind in India as several healthcare and pharma-focused funds are already in the market but what differentiates each fund is its investment approach, stock selection, and how broadly it defines the healthcare ecosystem—some include wellness, diagnostics, hospitals, and even health-tech platforms. “Baroda BNP Paribas fund offers investors another opportunity to tap into India’s growing healthcare story. It’s worth considering for those looking to increase sectoral exposure, especially from a long-term perspective. Like any sectoral fund, it should be evaluated based on investment horizon, portfolio strategy, and alignment with personal financial goals,” Shruti Jain, Chief Strategy Officer, Arihant Capital Markets shared exclusively with ETMutualFunds. The minimum amount for lump sum investment is Rs 1,000 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter. For Systematic Investment Plans with daily, weekly, or monthly frequency, the minimum SIP amount is Rs 500 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter; for quarterly SIPs, the minimum amount is Rs 1,500 and in multiples of Re 1 thereafter. The fund will allocate 80–100% in equity and equity-related instruments of companies in the pharma, healthcare, and allied sectors; 0–20% in equity and equity-related instruments of companies other than those in the pharma, healthcare, and allied sectors; 0–20% in debt and money market instruments; 0–10% in units of mutual funds (domestic schemes); and 0–10% in units issued by REITs and InvITs. Time to allocate in this sector? Shinde advises that in pharma, recent corrections have created better entry points, and the long-term structural drivers remain intact. Staggered investments can be considered. On the other hand, Jain mentions that pharma and healthcare remain strong thematic plays, particularly because they offer defensive qualities in uncertain markets. Given India’s demographic trends—rising average age, increasing healthcare awareness, and lifestyle-related health issues—this sector is poised for long-term structural growth. “Investors who do not currently have any exposure to this space may consider allocating around 10% of their total equity portfolio to healthcare and pharma funds. However, this should be done with a minimum 3–5 year investment horizon and as part of a well-diversified portfolio. A staggered investment approach (via SIP or tranches) can also help manage entry-point risk,” Jain advises investors. Apart from Baroda BNP Paribas Health and Wellness Fund, there are 16 funds based on the pharma and healthcare sector, of which 10 have a track record of three years in the market. ICICI Pru Pharma Healthcare & Diagnostics (P.H.D) Fund offered the highest return of around 29.05% in the last three years, followed by SBI Healthcare Opp Fund , which has offered a 28.36% return in the same time period. LIC MF Healthcare Fund gave the lowest return of around 20.77% in the said period. With enough funds based on the sector and having a long performance track record, Shinde mentions that the outlook is neutral to positive overall but very constructive on hospitals and specialty pharma segments. While U.S. pricing pressure remains a concern, domestic demand, growth in chronic therapies, and export diversification are supportive. In the last three years, these funds have offered an average return of 24.72%, and in the last five years, they have delivered an average return of 21.93%, with up to 25.16% return in the last five years. LIC MF Healthcare Fund gave the lowest return in the last five years at around 17.40%. Jain believes that the long-term outlook for India’s pharma and healthcare sector remains robust. Post-COVID, there has been a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour and government focus toward healthcare infrastructure, wellness, and preventive care. India’s role as a global pharmaceutical manufacturing hub and growing domestic demand support the sector’s earnings potential. “While short-term volatility may persist due to regulatory changes or global market sentiment, the structural drivers remain intact. Innovation in biosimilars, rising export demand, growth in diagnostics and hospitals, and increasing insurance penetration further strengthen the investment case. As such, this sector offers a compelling mix of growth and defensiveness, making it a relevant thematic allocation for long-term investors,” she added. One should always invest based on their risk appetite, investment horizon, and goals. ( Disclaimer : Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The report draws insights on key concerns from healthcare professionals and patients in 16 countries, including Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea. Findings show that despite strong optimism about artificial intelligence's (AI) potential to ease pressure on APAC's healthcare systems, trust and implementation concerns persist. 66% of patients surveyed in APAC are experiencing delays in seeing specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days. 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions. Building trust among patients and healthcare professionals around AI key to driving wider adoption. ""The need for AI has never been greater. Our survey shows that patients are anxiously waiting more than a month for specialist care, while some healthcare professionals are losing about four working weeks of clinical time a year due to incomplete patient data,"" said Jasper Westerink, Senior Vice President and Representative Director of Philips Japan and Acting Managing Director of Philips APAC. ""There is a clear role for AI to help clinicians act faster, make better decisions, and anticipate patient needs earlier as we strive to deliver better care for more people."" Worsening patient outcomes because of care delays call for accelerated AI adoption About two in three patients (66%) surveyed in APAC are waiting nearly one and a half months to see a specialist doctor, with an average waiting time of 47 days. Generally, one in three patients (33%) in APAC report that their health has deteriorated due to delays in seeing a doctor, with one in four (25%) ultimately going to the hospital as a result of long waiting times. AI has the potential to transform care delivery and significantly improve patient outcomes across APAC. * 81% of healthcare professionals in APAC believe that digital health technologies, including AI and predictive analytics, will lead to a reduction in hospital admissions in the future. * 86% of healthcare professionals anticipate that these technologies will decrease the need for acute or emergency medical procedures and interventions. * 89% of healthcare professionals believe that AI and predictive analytics can save lives by facilitating earlier interventions. Workforce challenge and data burdens call for AI relief Three in four healthcare professionals (76%) in APAC report losing valuable clinical time due to incomplete or inaccessible patient data, with close to one-third (31%) of these losing over 45 minutes per shift, adding up to 23 full days a year lost by each professional. Similarly, two in five (39%) clinicians say they are now spending less time with patients and more time on administrative tasks than they were five years ago. These exacerbate the workforce challenge experienced by healthcare professionals in APAC, as estimated by the World Health Organization. The shortage of health workers in Southeast Asia alone will be 6.9 million respectively in 2030, nearly 40% of the global shortage burden.[1] About 300 healthcare professionals surveyed shared the following concerns if AI is not implemented: * 45% worry about an expanding patient backlog* 42% cite growing burnout from non-clinical tasks* 40% worry about their inability to provide cutting-edge care Addressing AI concerns from HCPs and patients crucial for widespread adoption A majority of healthcare professionals (81%) in APAC are involved in developing new technology at their organizations. However, 39% believe that the new technologies developed are not catered to their needs. Concerns around accountability persist, with 71% sharing concerns about the legal liability for AI usage, while 66% worry that potential data biases in AI applications could widen disparities in health outcomes. Among patients, a majority (75%) welcome the increased use of technology if it improves access to care and benefits them. Around half are concerned that it could reduce face-to-face time with their doctors (51%) and are worried about data security when new technologies are introduced in healthcare (54%). Trust key to transforming healthcare in APAC For the majority of healthcare professionals surveyed (84%) building trust in AI has to involve support with guidelines, issues and liability. In addition, healthcare professionals cite the development of evidence-based, transparent, and monitored AI solutions (72%), followed by reassurance on data security issues, with 51% of healthcare professionals seeking clarity in this area. For patients, about three in four (74%) welcome the use of more technology in healthcare if it helps make it easier to see a healthcare professional and if it helps improve care for patients like themselves (75%). Healthcare professionals play a key role in building trust between patients and AI. Majority of patients (86%) would feel more comfortable with AI in healthcare if hearing about it from their doctors, indicating that doctors are a trusted source of information about such technologies. ""It's essential to foster trust of AI-powered technologies among healthcare professionals and patients,"" said Jasper. ""This will enable widespread adoption and effective implementation. Industry-wide collaboration will help us address trust gaps to unlock AI's full potential, enabling responsible, inclusive integration across APAC's healthcare systems.""

Following poor IL-33 data in late May, the company believes that the recent selloff in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The company stressed that, even without accounting for any pipeline contribution, Dupixent, Eylea, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Recently, the firm’s valuation was under pressure due to its IL-33 program’s lackluster Phase results. JPMorgan is still optimistic in spite of this, concentrating on important assets like Dupixent and Eylea that support the company’s financial stability.

In an op-ed published Tuesday by USA Today , the actor, who has become deeply familiar with the health care industry through his roles on “ER” and “The Pitt,” revealed that he plans to travel to Capitol Hill this week with ambassadors of FIGS, an apparel company dedicated to supporting and standing up for health care workers. He will join 18 health care professionals and his mother, a retired nurse, on the trip to Washington. “Since [‘The Pitt’] premiered, I’ve heard from countless health care workers who’ve told me they finally feel seen,” Wyle wrote. “Their stories echo the same themes: exhaustion, compassion and a system that threatens to make their life’s work unsustainable.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In Washington, Wyle and his fellow advocates will ask Congress to act on the lack of mental health support, as well as the administrative burden and financial strain, that health care workers are struggling with right now. Wyle and co. are specifically seeking the reauthorization and renewed funding of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which was enacted with bipartisan support in 2022 but expired in 2024. The act sets aside funding for both federal mental health programs for health care workers and financial grants designed to strengthen peer support, training programs and encourage cultural change at an institutional level. The group will also be calling on Congress to move forward with reforms that are meant to take clinical judgment out of the hands of insurance companies and back into those of health care workers. “Administrative red tape is strangling the system. Physicians and their staff spend nearly two full business days each week dealing with prior authorization – essentially asking insurance companies for permission to treat their patients,” Wyle explained. Finally, Wyle said he plans to address the financial issues plaguing health care workers’ lives. Citing one FIGS ambassador’s experience working 80-hour weeks while barely being able to afford groceries, Wyle announced his intention to champion the Awesome Humans Act, which is a proposed federal tax credit intended to provide health care workers with some much-needed financial relief. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Our message is simple: Without a supported, protected and fairly treated workforce, there is no patient care,” Wyle argued. “These aren’t partisan issues. They’re practical ones. And they’re urgent. Because when our health care professionals are burned out, buried in paperwork or forced to leave the field altogether, we all pay the price.” “I’m not a policymaker. I’m not a clinician. But I’ve spent my career listening to those who are, and I’ve seen the difference they make when it matters most,” the “Pitt” star concluded. “To anyone who’s ever benefited from the knowledge, care and courage of a health care professional, now’s the time to show up for them and take action.

In an op-ed published Tuesday by USA Today , the actor, who has become deeply familiar with the health care industry through his roles on “ER” and “The Pitt,” revealed that he plans to travel to Capitol Hill this week with ambassadors of FIGS, an apparel company dedicated to supporting and standing up for health care workers. He will join 18 health care professionals and his mother, a retired nurse, on the trip to Washington. “Since [‘The Pitt’] premiered, I’ve heard from countless health care workers who’ve told me they finally feel seen,” Wyle wrote. “Their stories echo the same themes: exhaustion, compassion and a system that threatens to make their life’s work unsustainable.” In Washington, Wyle and his fellow advocates will ask Congress to act on the lack of mental health support, as well as the administrative burden and financial strain, that health care workers are struggling with right now. Wyle and co. are specifically seeking the reauthorization and renewed funding of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which was enacted with bipartisan support in 2022 but expired in 2024. The act sets aside funding for both federal mental health programs for health care workers and financial grants designed to strengthen peer support, training programs and encourage cultural change at an institutional level. The group will also be calling on Congress to move forward with reforms that are meant to take clinical judgment out of the hands of insurance companies and back into those of health care workers. “Administrative red tape is strangling the system. Physicians and their staff spend nearly two full business days each week dealing with prior authorization – essentially asking insurance companies for permission to treat their patients,” Wyle explained. Finally, Wyle said he plans to address the financial issues plaguing health care workers’ lives. Citing one FIGS ambassador’s experience working 80-hour weeks while barely being able to afford groceries, Wyle announced his intention to champion the Awesome Humans Act, which is a proposed federal tax credit intended to provide health care workers with some much-needed financial relief. “Our message is simple: Without a supported, protected and fairly treated workforce, there is no patient care,” Wyle argued. “These aren’t partisan issues. They’re practical ones. And they’re urgent. Because when our health care professionals are burned out, buried in paperwork or forced to leave the field altogether, we all pay the price.” “I’m not a policymaker. I’m not a clinician. But I’ve spent my career listening to those who are, and I’ve seen the difference they make when it matters most,” the “Pitt” star concluded. “To anyone who’s ever benefited from the knowledge, care and courage of a health care professional, now’s the time to show up for them and take action. They’ve had our backs. It’s time we have theirs.” Read NEXT: Noah Wyle Says His Nurse Mom Experienced PTSD Watching Him on 'The Pitt' Comments"

The global home healthcare market is experiencing robust growth, driven by a confluence of emerging and evolving factors. A major driving force is the global demographic shift toward an aging population, particularly in developed economies, which is significantly increasing the demand for chronic disease management and age-related care within the comfort of patients' homes. Simultaneously, the rising prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory diseases is fueling the need for accessible and cost-effective home-based solutions. Technological advancements—such as AI-enabled remote monitoring, wearable health devices, and smart home integration—are transforming home healthcare delivery by enhancing real-time diagnostics, personalized care, and patient engagement. Additionally, the growing acceptance and adoption of telehealth services, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have normalized virtual care models, making them an integral part of home healthcare ecosystems. Market expansion is further supported by increased healthcare expenditures, shifting consumer preferences toward convenience, and supportive government policies and reimbursement frameworks. Moreover, the emergence of platform-based home healthcare services, supported by big data analytics and cloud computing, is enabling better coordination, scalability, and outcome tracking, positioning home healthcare as a central component of modern, value-based care delivery. The worldwide population is aging while chronic diseases become more common: The aging population across developed regions such as North America , Europe , and parts of the Asia-Pacific area stands as a key driver for the home healthcare market expansion. The United Nations reports that by 2050 the number of people aged 65 years or older will reach over 1.5 billion worldwide as their population doubles. The demographic shift leads to more chronic illness cases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, and respiratory conditions that demand ongoing monitoring and long-term treatment. Home healthcare represents a better option than institutional care for many older patients because it provides high-quality treatment within their own homes where they feel safe and comfortable. The growing need for home healthcare solutions has expanded the market for in-home nursing services alongside physical therapy options and disease management programs and remote patient monitoring tools thereby integrating home healthcare into essential care processes. For Detailed Market Insights, Visit: https://www.theresearchinsights.com/reports/home-healthcare-market-1372 Technological Advancements in Remote Monitoring and Telehealth: Medical technology developments have led to enhanced operational capabilities for home healthcare services. Home administration of complex treatments has become both safe and efficient due to the use of portable oxygen concentrators, mobile dialysis machines, infusion pumps, and wearable health monitors. The rapid expansion of telehealth services and digital health platforms has enabled patients to conduct virtual consultations easily while receiving continuous monitoring and making decisions based on data analysis. The importance of these technologies increased after COVID-19 because they serve to decrease hospital visits and lower exposure risks while preserving excellent care quality. The combined use of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) , and cloud-based data sharing gives clinicians enhanced capabilities to manage patient outcomes proactively. These emerging solutions increase patient satisfaction and clinical success while broadening the scalability and cost-efficiency of home healthcare delivery. Cost-Effectiveness and Healthcare System Strain: Financial and logistical challenges for the global healthcare system are escalating because of increasing chronic disease burden and hospital overcrowding combined with higher treatment expenses. Home healthcare reduces financial burdens by minimizing extended hospitalizations alongside emergency room admissions and institutional facility requirements. Public and private payers experience significant cost reductions through home healthcare while maintaining high patient care standards. Home-based care models have gained support from governments and insurers who are using policy changes and financial incentives to push for their adoption. Middle-class populations in developing countries now find home healthcare services affordable and viable alternatives to pricier hospital treatments while still delivering quality medical attention.

Hunter and Ryan K. McBain Housing is increasingly being viewed as an important contributor to health outcomes. As a result, more and more health care systems and managed health care plans are getting into the housing business , but will this pay off for their bottom lines? Probably not right away. The research evidence demonstrates that the best way to serve individuals experiencing homelessness may be to provide them with housing, often through a rental subsidy or voucher, coupled with case management services, also known as permanent supportive housing (PSH). More than two decades of research have shown that such approaches improve housing stability among those experiencing homelessness, and they are widely embraced as an approach to address chronic homelessness in the United States. The reported costs of PSH programs vary depending on factors such as the intensity of case management supportive services and the way housing is provided. The costs are typically borne by different service systems, such as various federal, state, and local programs. Because these programs may offset the costs of the housing subsidy and/or case management services, it can be difficult to monitor the total program implementation costs. This challenge in tracking program costs means that most studies only show part of the picture. A number of studies, for example, only begin to capture program and housing costs once an individual has been placed into PSH. This leaves out significant costs during the “transition period” into PSH, after identification and before PSH placement. These figures range dramatically from $13,400 to $48,000 per person per year (USD, 2025) . When examining potential cost offsets to the health care system, the housing and service provision costs are typically compared to health care service utilization and associated costs prior to and following PSH placement among a treatment and, ideally, a control group. Reviews have found that studies using more rigorous research designs, such as randomized trials, report smaller health care cost offsets. To better document the implementation costs of operating a PSH program from the perspective of a health care provider, we assisted a large managed care plan located in Southern California in assessing its program costs. We also assessed ongoing program costs and examined health care service utilization among members enrolled in their PSH program compared to an observational comparison group to explore potential cost offsets to the health care system. We found that the period after an individual is enrolled in the program, but prior to placement in PSH, was a critical moment in terms of costs. During this period, participants required more intensive health care and housing services as they transitioned from acute care settings to community settings. In prior PSH research studies, this period is typically ignored and therefore excluded from cost estimates, omitting a significant component of PSH program implementation spending. In our study , the transitional housing costs amounted to, on average, $4,147 per member per month (USD, 2025)—and most members spent approximately 3–4 months in this phase for total cost of almost $14,000. Health care spending during this transitional period was over $6,400 per member per month. These costs were reduced once members moved into PSH. Monthly PSH costs reduced to less than $3,500 per member per month, and health care costs decreased to approximately $3,400 per member per month. The period after an individual is enrolled in a permanent supportive housing program, but prior to placement, is a critical moment in terms of costs. When we examined overall program costs and health care service utilization over a 12-month period that included program entry, we observed a dramatic reduction in utilization and a $24,500 decline in the average associated costs annually. However, there was no difference in service utilization between the treatment and comparison groups, and it didn’t result in cost savings—primarily because enrollees in PSH generated program implementation costs. Although the program did not result in dramatic reductions in overall spending, participants were more likely to engage in routine outpatient care once housed. While we were unable to track more general indicators like health functioning or quality of life, members appeared to spend less time receiving emergency or inpatient care after receipt of PSH. These patterns are similar to those observed in other studies ( PDF ) examining the health care service offsets after PSH placement. It is important to note that PSH programs often target the most vulnerable. In our work, the average 12-month health care spending prior to housing was close to $82,000, and many of the members suffered from multiple chronic health conditions. As a result, health care spending is not likely to be reduced to zero after PSH receipt, as ongoing management of those chronic conditions is warranted. However, reductions in crisis care may be achievable. To our knowledge, our study was the first to examine the upfront implementation costs of providing PSH in a managed health care setting. While getting people into PSH soon after identification is the goal of “Housing First” efforts, the reality is that many individuals experiencing homelessness may be placed in transitional housing for some period of time. Our study demonstrates that such programs are not cost-neutral. It is important to note, however, that the reduction in crisis care easily covers the housing and supportive services component of such programs. If the goal is to prevent emergency room visits and long hospital stays while increasing housing stability, PSH programs are a worthwhile health care investment.

Credit: Coco Ratta/Shutterstock. · Pharmaceutical Technology · Coco Ratta/Shutterstock. GlobalData June 9, 2025 2 min read AYTU Aytu BioPharma has signed an exclusive agreement with Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals to commercialise Exxua (gepirone) extended-release tablets, a new antidepressant, to the US market for major depressive disorder (MDD). Exxua, developed by Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals, is a selective serotonin 5HT1a receptor agonist that has gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating MDD in adults. Aytu issued an initial payment to Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals upon closure and will make another payment on the first anniversary of Exxua's market release. Aytu is committed to royalty payments based on net sales as stipulated in their definitive agreement, including a product transfer cost. Contingent on reaching specific revenue milestones over the duration of their partnership, Aytu will disburse variable milestone fees to Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals. Aytu CEO Josh Disbrow stated: ""We believe that the licensing of EXXUA represents a transformative milestone for Aytu and a significant advancement for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. ""More importantly, given the compelling and novel product profile of EXXUA and the unmet needs of MDD patients, we believe EXXUA can become a very important treatment option for the over 21 million Americans affected by MDD. We look forward to launching EXXUA later this year and to our exciting partnership with Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals."" Funding for the transaction comes from cash reserves, accompanied by financing from healthcare-focused investors such as Nantahala Capital Management and Stonepine Capital Management, along with contributions from Aytu management and new institutional shareholders. Preparations are underway to introduce Exxua into the US market swiftly, aiming for pharmacy and patient access by late 2025. Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals co-founder and CEO Stephen Kramer stated: ""We believe EXXUA will be a very important addition to physicians managing the millions of patients with depression in the US and worldwide."" The therapeutic effect of Exxua is attributed to its modulation of serotonin activity through strong binding affinity for 5HT1a receptors — crucial components in mood regulation.

https://borgenproject.org/frugal-health-care/,,How Frugal Health Care Innovation Is Reimagining Accessibility,20250610T163000Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Frugal-Health-Care-1030x687.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Reports assessing the relationship between extreme poverty and health care accessibility have and continue to prove a cyclical relationship in which each exacerbates the other. Though the availability of health care across the world increases, out-of-pocket costs often force families and individuals below the poverty line. Meanwhile, populations suffering from untreated illness are unable to participate effectively in the workforce. In short, being sick keeps people from financial earnings, while treatment costs account for most of their spending. Either path hampers the ability to participate in the local economy. In response, frugal health care initiatives have risen in popularity, combating the personal financial aspect of health care accessibility. How Does Frugal Health Care Work? Frugal health care works by using low-cost, low-tech solutions that are adapted to local needs. Many solutions arise by repurposing everyday tools or simplifying existing techniques. One early example is the stethoscope , originally made from a rolled piece of paper to preserve a patient’s modesty. Today, frugal innovations include using hardware drills instead of expensive medical ones and placing premature babies in plastic bags to prevent hypothermia. These practical, outcome-based solutions stand apart from the prevailing model of Western, research-driven progress due to their deep contextualization. While vaccines serve as a universal preventive measure for those with access, innovations like the “ Jaipur Foot ” address specific local needs. Designed for barefoot amputees, the Jaipur Foot is affordable and effective thanks to partnerships with local artisans and readily available materials. Its success, however, is closely tied to local production capacity, making it a powerful but regionally limited solution. The Frugal Biomedical Innovations Program Western University has incorporated research into frugal health care innovation in Canada via its Frugal Biomedical Innovations Program (FBIP). A branch of the Engineering Health Equity (EHE) training program, the institute has partnership sites in Northern Canada, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda. The FBIP is hands-on and follows a conceptualize-create-deploy model. This ensures that abstract ideas become a physical reality and are implemented in the low-resource communities where they are needed. Partnering Universities also lead projects at home with the aid of the Frugal Biomedical Innovations Catalyst Grant program. One example is 3D-printed hands and feet developed by Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, Ethiopia. Another is a low-cost teledentistry system from the University of Nairobi, designed to improve oral health care in rural Kenya. Prototypes are tested in the field with financial support from organizations such as Western University’s Africa Institute and program grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. A Good Enough Future Hi-tech innovation in health care will and should continue to progress. However, the emerging focus on extending medical accessibility to areas lacking the financial and technological resources to implement it is ushering in a revolution of rural health care access. The 2025 World Economic Forum identified the need for decentralized, equitable health care systems. Similarly, the 2024 report on Global Health Care Sector Outlook published by Deloitte University suggests multiagency collaboration and taking opportunities to digitalize care delivery. Decentralization, equity and collaboration are pillars of frugal health care innovation. By prioritizing practical repurposing over novelty, an increasing number of communities will have access to the medical care necessary to facilitate economic growth. – Emily Galán Emily is based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and focuses on Global Health and Politics for The Borgen Project.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 10, 2025, 06:00am EDT Share Save Fran Rosch is the CEO of Imprivata, a digital identity company for life- and mission-critical industries. getty After spending the spring at ViVE and HIMSS, two of the healthcare industry's most influential conferences, the industry is clearly standing at a major inflection point. Mobile transformation is no longer a trend on the horizon—it's here, it's accelerating and it's bringing a wave of complexity that the industry isn't fully prepared for. AI, similarly, is moving quickly from hype to implementation, but the road to meaningful adoption is full of friction, and the cyber risks we face today are more sophisticated and business-disrupting than ever before. I left both events not just energized by the innovation but focused on what comes next and how we translate these promising new technologies into real-world improvements for clinicians and patients alike. Here's where I see the biggest opportunities for healthcare organizations—and where the tech industry must step up to meet healthcare's most urgent needs. The Mobile Momentum Conversations about mobile devices, their increasing ubiquity across the industry and their pivotal role in driving operational efficiencies, employee experience and better patient care took center stage at both events. As organizations deploy more mobile devices—and corporate-owned shared devices, in particular—to enhance efficiencies and streamline access to electronic health records, the focus is shifting toward improving clinician experiences, with capabilities like passwordless authentication proving to be instrumental in driving satisfaction. By making access to all workstations and devices frictionless and secure for clinicians, healthcare leaders are effectively enhancing cybersecurity strategies and tools to address the evolving endpoint environment. Data and analytics further amplify these benefits by enabling real-time decision making, improving patient outcomes and protecting sensitive patient information. While the rise of mobile strategies presents clear advantages for healthcare organizations, it also introduces complex challenges. Effective implementation of mobile access management is critical for mobile adoption. Expanding an organization's endpoint environment can quickly strain existing cybersecurity infrastructure. Compromised access can directly affect patient safety. In response, comprehensive mobile access should fit seamlessly into clinician workflows while still ensuring users can only touch the data they need. To truly capitalize on the promise of mobile transformation, the tech industry must shift from a product-centric to partnership-driven approach—prioritizing a deep collaboration with healthcare providers to truly understand clinical workflows, effectively invest in user-centric design and develop robust support for device life cycle management and compliance. Driving AI Advancements And Operational Efficiencies Ambient listening solutions drive much of healthcare's growing adoption of mobile devices and were the focus of many AI conversations across both events. These solutions transform clinical workflows by automating notetaking and updates to electronic health records. Along with a wave of AI-powered innovations, these tools are addressing and improving clinician burnout, patient management, drug discovery and more. It was clear that the focus of AI innovations in healthcare is to improve patient outcomes by enhancing treatments and giving back valuable time, allowing clinicians to focus on delivering effective, customized care. Despite this momentum, the road to widespread adoption has just begun. Some healthcare organizations are still hesitant to fully embrace AI due to upfront costs, integration complexities and cultural resistance among clinicians. Nevertheless, organizations (and, particularly, CIOs) are increasingly strapped for resources and need to do more with less. AI advancements are helping meet this pain point, allowing organizations to keep up with operational demands and expand their services. While so much of the broader AI conversation revolves around fears that AI will replace workers, the reality in healthcare is that many systems are understaffed, and AI can fill gaps. Driving mainstream adoption requires demystifying AI through transparent systems that demonstrate tangible value for providers and integrate with existing systems and workflows. Looking ahead, healthcare organizations will need scalable infrastructure, tailored training and strong governance frameworks to drive effective AI implementation. The Evolving Role Of Cybersecurity While innovations in AI and cloud technology, as seen across events, improve workflows and greatly enhance threat monitoring and remediation, they also introduce new cybersecurity risks. As digital infrastructures expand, they require advanced approaches to protect sensitive health data. Leaders at ViVE reflected on the Change Healthcare attack , which broke during the 2024 conference. These leaders emphasized the growing concern over advanced persistent threats, the need for comprehensive cyber resilience strategies and the importance of better managing all users across ecosystems—especially outside vendors, which are an increasing concern across the industry. The healthcare sector remains one of the most targeted industries for cybercriminals, and attacks are growing more sophisticated. Ransomware continues to be the most disruptive threat, often crippling clinical operations and putting patient safety at risk. Not only do organizations have to worry about internal users, but they also need to worry about their third-party vendors. An October 2024 survey we commissioned The Ponemon Institute to conduct found that 44% of healthcare organizations had suffered a cyberattack from third-party access in the previous 12 months. To counter these threats, healthcare organizations must prioritize a proactive security strategy that leverages zero trust, real-time threat monitoring, privileged access management and automated remediation. If the rest of 2025 is anything like the outlook that ViVE and HIMSS painted, we can expect further mobile transformation, a surge in AI and cloud adoption and the continuing need to implement robust security strategies and solutions effectively. Data analytics and machine learning capabilities underpin this evolution, driving smarter clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes. While these innovations promise to improve patient outcomes, organizations will have more devices to secure. Luckily, cybersecurity and digital innovations will make it possible to do more with less. The future of healthcare is promising, but we must remain vigilant about safeguarding against the cybersecurity risks that come with these technological advancements.

The incident sparked a fresh online debate comparing healthcare accessibility between Europe and the United States. In a TikTok video reposted by Mr. Georgiadis on platform X, the tourist expressed surprise and appreciation for receiving treatment free of charge. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ ""I just left the hospital here in Mykonos. They gave me an IV and a whole bag of medicine — and you know how much it cost? Zero dollars. Zero,"" the tourist says in the clip. ""In the U.S., that would have cost me $400 to $500."" The tourist went on to criticize the American healthcare system, labeling it ""a scam."" Mr. Georgiadis responded to the video, commenting: ""Let’s also point out the good things. See what an American tourist posted about our healthcare system."" The minister's post comes amid ongoing efforts by the Greek government to modernize its National Health System (ESY). The system has faced pressure in recent years from staffing shortages and underinvestment, but it continues to provide low-cost or free care to citizens and visitors, particularly in emergencies. ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ The video, which quickly gained traction online, contributes to a broader discussion about healthcare accessibility in Europe compared to the United States, where millions remain uninsured or underinsured despite high overall healthcare spending.

""We had a new tech a few weeks ago that was bitten by a patient and it was like her second week,"" Fogt recounted. ""My first thought was, 'I really hope she doesn't quit, because she's really really good.' She's an amazing CNA."" Fogt said the new staff member didn't leave, though the incident was a difficult one. ""There was six of us in the room with one patient and it took six of us to try to calm him down and he still wasn't calm,"" Fogt said. The experience underscored a problem in health care facilities in Indiana and across the country. The American Hospital Association recently released a report that estimates health care providers spent close to $15 billion in 2023 responding to workplace violence in health care facilities across the country. Credit: WTHR Here in Indiana, a 2023 survey of 14,000 Hoosier health care workers showed 34% said their unit had a problem with patients or visitors being physically aggressive towards staff. ""Bottom line, we just want to feel safe at work,"" said Fogt, who's a registered nurse and has a doctorate in nursing. Even though Fogt has 25 years invested in the health care profession, she still thinks about one of her early days on the job when she said a patient's dad attacked her. ""Struck me, threw me against a brick wall and I was so young, I thought, 'Well this is part of the job,'"" Fogt said she thought at the time. Only it's not supposed to be, she said, but statistics suggest it's becoming more of a regular occurrence. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, health care workers are five times more likely to be injured from workplace violence than workers in other industries. ""We can't normalize this violence at work,"" Fogt said. Credit: WTHR She recounted her experience to Indiana lawmakers this year, testifying in favor of a bill to expand protections for health care professionals against attacks from patients and visitors. The bill didn't get across the finish line. ""You can't assault an airline worker, a police officer, a fireman, but there's really not those same protections in place for health care workers,"" Fogt explained. Current Indiana law provides for harsher penalties for attacking certain licensed health care professionals and emergency department staff. At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced the Save Health Care Workers Act that would extend protections for everyone working in health care, no matter the position. ""We have so many people that make up the team in a hospital that are not protected right now and we really have to get protection for the entire team,"" Fogt said. ""What we found over the last four or five years, there's been a steady increase in the violence in our hospitals,"" said Jon Barefoot, vice president of security, safety and disaster preparedness at IU Health. Credit: WTHR Barefoot can't say what's contributing to the increase in attacks on hospital staff, but said last year, IU Health began tracking incidents with the same criteria at all of its hospitals. He said so far this year, there have been 300 incidents at IU facilities, but says the problem is not unique to IU Health or Indiana. ""All of my colleagues across the country are experiencing the same things and we're struggling to wrap our heads around why the change,"" Barefoot said, explaining that IU Health has both both sworn police officers and public safety officers on staff. According to Barefoot, if those officers don't witness an incident themselves, the options to act are limited. ""We can ask that person to leave, and then we can work with the prosecutor to file charges, but we lose that ability to remove them from the environment immediately,"" Barefoot explained. That why he believes the push for further legislation is important. ""It's not necessarily about punishing people, it's about making sure we've got the tools that we need to do, to keep our facilities safe,"" Barefoot said. For Fogt, it's also about having laws in place that act as a deterrent. ""People are upset. Society is upset for a lot of different reasons and that's spilled over in the hospital. It's been going on a long time,"" said Fogt. Close Ad"

Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Iziaq Adekunle Salako, announced the distribution on Monday during a flag-off event held at the International Conference Centre in Enugu. The initiative, under the Renewed Hope Agenda, is designed to empower frontline health workers and strengthen healthcare services, especially in underserved areas. Dr. Salako expressed appreciation to Senator Oluremi Tinubu, wife of the President, for her unwavering commitment to health initiatives, particularly in tackling tuberculosis, cervical cancer, and HIV/AIDS. He described her support as pivotal to the ongoing reforms in the nation’s healthcare system. According to the minister, the distribution of the midwifery kits will directly benefit 60,000 midwives, covering about 40% of the country’s registered midwives. “Each item in the kit you are being given today represents a commitment to life, to health, and to the dignity of our women and children,” he remarked. The kits, he said, are expected to significantly improve the ability of midwives to deliver quality care, particularly in rural communities where access to healthcare remains limited. The move is part of broader government efforts to curb Nigeria’s high maternal and under-five mortality rates. ALSO READ: Senator Basiru denies criticising Tinubu over Gov Adeleke, family’s visit The event drew attendance from several dignitaries, including the wife of the Vice President, Hajia Nana Shettima, and wives of state governors, who lauded the government’s commitment to improving the welfare of healthcare professionals and reducing health disparities across regions. Dr. Salako also highlighted recent achievements under the Renewed Hope Initiative, such as the establishment of new federal tertiary hospitals, recruitment of healthcare personnel, and execution of critical infrastructure projects in hospitals nationwide. The midwifery kit distribution marks another step in the Federal Government’s strategy to enhance primary healthcare delivery and build a resilient health system for all Nigerians.

The market share of single-speciality hospitals, catering to segments like eyecare, dental care, orthopaedics, oncology, fertility treatments and mother & child care, is expected to rise to 40% of the total healthcare market by 2028 from the current 30%, said the report from investment bank Avendus. Of this, the total organised single-specialty healthcare - which includes scaled chains - accounts for $4 billion, which is seen rising to $9 billion, said the report. ""The share of single speciality will become larger in the next four years and the organised players will more than double,"" said Anshul Gupta, managing director and head of healthcare investment banking at Avendus Capital. The single-speciality format, where a hospital typically would have 40-50 beds, presents the opportunity for greater geographical depth compared to multispeciality hospitals where the average size is 250-300 beds. These formats offer an ideal blend of low capital intensity, high specificity of care, and replicable business models that are increasingly appealing to institutional investors and founders. Live Events Strong returns A combination of factors is driving faster consolidation in the sector, including their demand for capital expenditure and better return on investments. ""Some of the scaled players are very aggressively rolling up. Be it the large eyecare chains like Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital , Maxivision and others, each of them has private equity backers and they have been doing M&As of anywhere between eight and 10 acquisitions every year,"" said Gupta. Doctors running small chains are mostly interested in clinical work and for them admin work is a hassle, he said. ""By being part of a larger (investment) platform allows them the flexibility to focus on clinical work."" Besides, such chains find it harder to invest in capex in tech and infrastructure development on their own, but when they are part of a larger platform the cost gets spread, said Gupta. India's total private and trust healthcare market is $50 billion and expected to grow to $79 billion by 2028, according to Avendus estimate. Total private equity investments in the single-specialty sector crossed $3.7 billion, accounting for over 35% of total hospital investments in the last 10 years. About 70% of these investments have gone to established specialties such as IVF, eyecare, mother & childcare, dialysis and oncology. In the last two-three years, leading players in specialties such as dental care, urology / nephrology, skin and hair care have started to attract investor interest due to significant whitespaces in the demand-supply in these specialties, according to the report. ""A trifecta of factors is helping accelerate investor interest in the single-specialty healthcare chains ... significant growth opportunity in tier 2/3 cities, clearly visible unit economics and viability with best in class ROIs,"" Vishal Bali, executive chairman of Asia Healthcare Holdings, an healthcare investment platform that focus on single specialities like oncology, women and child care, fertility, urology and nephrology, told ET in a recent interaction. Top PE transactions in single-specialty healthcare in the last two years include Indira IVF-BPEA EQT, NephroPlus-Quadria Capital and TPG Growth and Temasek in Dr Agarwal Healthcare.

The Trump administration is accused of gutting Medicaid, public health programs, and medical research. Health professionals urge major medical institutions to break their silence and defend public health infrastructure. More than 6,000 frontline health professionals — including doctors, nurses, researchers, and public health experts — have signed an open letter condemning the Trump administration’s actions to dismantle key components of the U.S. healthcare system. The signatories say that the proposed policies pose a direct threat to American lives. The letter, released publicly today, criticizes the administration for deep cuts to Medicaid, slashing support for scientific research, and weakening the federal health workforce — moves that, according to the authors, ""will cost lives."" “The administration claims to want to ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but these actions will do the opposite,” the letter states. “We are certain this will cost lives.” ""Cuts target vulnerable Americans"" Among the most alarming proposals cited is a drastic reduction in Medicaid funding, which the letter says would devastate healthcare access for tens of millions of Americans. Medicaid currently: Covers 40% of children in the U.S. Supports 60% of nursing home residents If enacted, the proposed cuts would ""threaten the well-being of the most vulnerable in our society,"" the health professionals argue. They also warn that front-line workers cannot compensate for the void left by such massive funding and staffing shortfalls. An Attack on Science and Public Health In addition to healthcare access, the letter denounces the administration’s efforts to dismantle public health infrastructure by: Reducing funding for scientific research and data access Limiting medical training programs Undermining federal agencies that protect medical care and public health “These reckless and deep cuts are tearing apart crucial systems for protecting and promoting Americans’ health,” the letter reads. Dr. Robert Steinbrook, Director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, issued a statement in support of the message: “We must continue to sound the alarm about the Trump Administration’s attacks and threats against our healthcare system,” he said. “It’s time for leading medical institutions and individual professionals to end their silence.” A Call to Action for the Medical Community While acknowledging that federal healthcare policy needs improvement, the letter emphasizes that any reform must be thoughtful and evidence-based, not a wholesale abandonment of effective programs. “There is plenty to fix… but we need intelligent redesign, not shutting down programs and abandoning the public,” the letter concludes. The signatories are urging professional societies, medical schools, hospital networks, and healthcare leaders to take a public stand and defend the systems that keep Americans healthy. As debate over the future of the U.S. healthcare system intensifies, this unified front from healthcare workers sends a clear message: reckless cuts to critical health programs will not go unnoticed — and will not go unchallenged.

The report, based on a Q2 2025 survey of 122 hospital and physician practice administrators in Greece conducted ahead of HIMSS25 Europe, reflects the perspectives of stakeholders on the state of healthcare IT adoption and readiness in the country. While the findings point to significant challenges in Electronic Health Records (EHR), interoperability, and cybersecurity, they also highlight a unique opportunity for Greek-oriented and regional digital health vendors to accelerate transformation. With dissatisfaction running high among providers and patients, local innovation and targeted vendor partnerships could reshape the national health IT landscape. EHR Adoption and Vendor Opportunity Only 14% of Greek providers surveyed reported access to integrated, functional digital health records in routine care. A significant 98% expressed dissatisfaction with current systems, citing fragmented platforms, inefficient workflows, and lack of real-time clinical data access. These gaps open the door for localized EHR vendors to design solutions aligned with national healthcare workflows and policy environments, offering custom platforms that overcome the limitations of foreign, one-size-fits-all technologies. Interoperability as a Catalyst for Growth Just 7% of Greek health IT leaders stated their systems are capable of supporting interoperable data exchange across care settings. The lack of HL7 FHIR-standardized integration highlights the pressing need for Greek vendors and regional integration firms to develop scalable, standards-based health data exchange platforms. Opportunities exist for companies positioned to bridge public-private sector silos, modernize legacy systems, and create unified health information networks. Population Health and Analytics Market Gaps Only 3% of respondents reported using real-time data analytics or risk stratification tools to support population health initiatives. Vendors focusing on chronic disease management, preventive care, and regional analytics platforms can play a key role in helping Greek healthcare organizations harness data-driven care models that are still in early stages of development. Cybersecurity Innovation Needs With 95% of surveyed IT leaders citing significant gaps in cybersecurity, there is growing demand for security-as-a-service, cloud-based protections, and affordable infrastructure assessments tailored to smaller Greek hospitals and clinics. This represents a prime opportunity for cybersecurity firms with healthcare specialization to support compliance, resilience, and trust. Patient Experience Solutions In a companion survey, 97% of Greek patients reported never accessing their health records online, and 100% lacked confidence in their provider's digital tools. This signals a strong market opening for vendors offering secure patient portals, mobile health access, and education tools that empower individuals and improve engagement. Key HIMSS25 Europe Vendors Supporting Greece's Digital Health Needs Several vendors exhibiting and sponsoring at HIMSS25 Europe in Paris next week stand out as especially well-positioned to support Greece's digital transformation goals. These companies offer technologies directly aligned with the challenges facing Greek healthcare and are prepared to demonstrate scalable solutions that address EHR adoption, interoperability, analytics, and patient engagement. InterSystems will showcase their advanced data integration and interoperability platforms, which leverage HL7 FHIR to enable seamless data sharing which is an urgent need for fragmented Greek health systems. Dedalus , a vendor with deep roots in European healthcare, is offering regionally aligned EHR and population health management solutions that address local workflow gaps and regulatory complexities in Greece. Hyland is exhibiting its Content Innovation Cloud, designed to enhance document-based interoperability, support clinical content access, and reduce administrative burden, an important area for Greek hospitals with legacy infrastructure. Oracle Health and Epic Systems will also present end-to-end EHR platforms and AI-powered analytics tools that offer Greek providers the opportunity to benchmark against high-functioning, digitally mature health systems, should they be capable of encompassing the needs of the Greek healthcare systems, its providers and patients at a cost the Greek government and providers can afford. T-Systems , with its cybersecurity and managed IT offerings, will demonstrate solutions ideal for smaller hospitals in Greece needing affordable and scalable security frameworks. Greek CIOs and provider executives attending HIMSS25 Europe are encouraged to engage with these vendors, explore real-time demos, and evaluate how proven digital technologies can be adapted to Greece's local challenges and accelerate national interoperability progress. ""This report reflects the voices of healthcare professionals and patients in Greece-not an opinion or judgment by our firm,"" said Douglas Brown, founder of Black Book Research. ""With the right collaborations, local vendors and regional innovators have a real opportunity to drive digital transformation and close persistent technology gaps."" ""For Greek CIOs and healthcare leaders attending HIMSS25 Europe, this is a pivotal moment to explore firsthand the technologies reshaping connected care across the continent,"" Brown added. ""Vendor demonstrations at the exhibition offer strategic insights into scalable interoperability frameworks, AI-driven analytics, secure cloud infrastructures, and patient engagement platforms-all critical components for modernizing Greek healthcare. The opportunity to benchmark with leading systems and meet innovators building regionalized EHR and data exchange solutions should not be missed."" Furthermore, the 2025 World Index of Healthcare Innovation ranked Greece 26th out of 32 European countries in health digitization, possibly falling to last at 32 in 2026. The report highlighted that Greece is one of the least digitally connected countries in the index, limiting its ability to take full advantage of electronic health records and other digital health technologies. The 2025 Black Book of Global Healthcare Information Technology provides independent performance evaluations of healthcare IT systems and infrastructure in 44 countries. The Greece-specific findings are intended to guide policymakers, health institutions, and vendors toward high-impact modernization strategies.

Omega Healthcare partnered with UiPath to automate medical billing and other administrative tasks. The revenue cycle management company has saved employees hours with its AI document-processing tool. This article is part of ""CXO AI Playbook"" — straight talk from business leaders on how they're testing and using AI. For ""CXO AI Playbook,"" Business Insider takes a look at mini case studies about AI adoption across industries, company sizes, and technology DNA. We've asked each of the featured companies to tell us about the problems they're trying to solve with AI, who's making these decisions internally, and their vision for using AI in the future. Omega Healthcare Management Services is a revenue cycle management company that helps more than 350 healthcare organizations, including providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies , manage their financial operations. This includes medical billing, insurance eligibility verification, collections, clinical documentation, and other administrative tasks. The company, which was founded in 2003, is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. It also has teams in India, Colombia, and the Philippines. Situation analysis: What problem was the company trying to solve? Omega Healthcare has more than 30,000 employees who perform a high volume of administrative tasks, including medical billing and insurance claim submissions, for healthcare organizations. Every year, they process about 250 million digital transactions . These tasks have traditionally been done manually. Rajusiva Arunachalam, the company's vice president of technology, said that the administrative tasks are mundane, repetitive, and time-consuming. ""We have a lot of humans working in the background for these doctors and providers who help them do their non-clinical work,"" he said. Arunachalam said Omega Healthcare wanted to automate billing, insurance claims, and other administrative tasks to free up employees to handle decision-making aspects, such as when to deny claims or follow up on a late payment. The goal was to improve its operations and help its clients increase collections, minimize incorrect claim submissions and denial rates, reduce receivable payment times, and enhance patient engagement. Rajusiva Arunachalam is the vice president of technology at Omega Healthcare. Courtesy of Omega Healthcare Key staff and partners Omega Healthcare partnered with UiPath , an enterprise automation and AI software company, about five years ago to automate some of the workers' manual administrative tasks, including billing, medical coding, and correspondence with insurance companies. Arunachalam said UiPath's platform was a good fit for Omega Healthcare's strategy, which focuses on boosting automation and speeding up the completion of clients' administrative tasks. Arunachalam said Omega Healthcare created an internal team made up of developers, business analysts, and data scientists. The group focused on finding opportunities to automate repetitive tasks to save employees' time while speeding up work for clients. AI in action Omega Healthare uses UiPath Document Understanding , an AI tool that automatically pulls data from various client documents, such as accounts receivable correspondence, insurance denial letters, or electronic medical records. Arunachalam said the AI tool extracts data from these documents based on what a healthcare institution is trying to accomplish. For example, if the task is to file an insurance claim , the AI tool may pull out relevant data from electronic medical records. Or, if a claim was denied, it may identify relevant data from a denial letter or transcript of a call about the case. Arunachalam said human staff members review the data extracted by AI and use it to make decisions. For instance, they may decide that a claim was denied incorrectly due to a medical coding problem or based on information from a medical record. Staff can also use the tool to follow up with a healthcare company for more information on a billing error. Employees then send their decision to the client. ""Human work is now more knowledge-based, very decision-oriented,"" which AI technology can't do, Arunachalam said. But humans and AI ""work together in conjunction to achieve what the client needs."" AI ""can run 24 hours,"" Arunachalam said. It can also process data much faster, so fewer employees are needed for this work, which is more cost-effective for clients. Arunachalam added that Omega Healthcare has automated its administrative tasks, such as submitting insurance claims and medical billing, for about 60% to 70% of its clients. Did it work, and how did leaders know? Since 2020, Omega Healthcare has processed more than 100 million transactions using UiPath automations, Arunachalam said. Omega Healthcare tracked the time it took employees to manually complete different administrative tasks and compared it to the time they spent on them after adding UiPath's tool to measure the tech's impact. Arunachalam said the company found that automation was saving employees more than 15,000 hours a month. Arunachalam said Omega Healthcare has also reduced the amount of time workers spend on documentation tasks by 40%. He added that automation has also slashed document processing turnaround time by 50% with a process accuracy of 99.5%. The company told BI that these improvements have increased efficiency and cost savings for Omega Healthcare's clients, delivering a 30% return on investment since using the AI-powered automation. Arunachalam said Omega Healthcare is working on automating more of its client work, including payment posting and patient appointment scheduling.

https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-growing-shadow-in-healthcare-securing-the-vulnerable-supply-chain,,The growing shadow in healthcare : securing the vulnerable supply chain,20250604T090000Z,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrPfm8TckZKMotMePyS8bG.jpg,techradar.com,English,United Kingdom,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"(Image credit: Getty Images / Miljan Živković) In today’s hyper-connected healthcare environment, the supply chain has quietly become one of the sector’s most vulnerable digital frontiers. Once viewed purely as a logistical or procurement function, the modern healthcare supply chain now includes everything from pharmaceutical distributors and cloud-based software providers to diagnostic platforms and medical device manufacturers. This expansive ecosystem, while critical to patient care, is also under siege and must be protected. Cybercriminals have recognized this opportunity. Rather than targeting hospitals directly, they are increasingly breaching third-party vendors to disrupt services, access sensitive data and hold patient-critical systems hostage. The implications are far-reaching, leading to delayed treatments, compromised medical equipment, shortages of critical supplies and the alarming risk of counterfeit or tampered materials entering the system. As the NHS drives forward its transformation from analogue to digital, as part of the UK government’s plan to build an NHS Fit for the Future, the need for robust cybersecurity becomes even more pressing. Empowering individuals to take control of their own health is a powerful step forward, but it also expands the digital footprint that must be protected. To safeguard patient trust and ensure seamless, secure care delivery, defenses must now extend beyond hospital walls to every point in the healthcare supply chain. Barry O'Connell General Manager, EMEA, Trustwave. An overlooked entry point in a complex ecosystem The very interdependence of today’s digitalized, interconnected network of the healthcare supply chain is increasingly putting the whole system at risk. Gone are the days of cybersecurity in healthcare being mainly focused on internal systems. Today, a vulnerability in a third-party supplier can be the weak link that opens the door to widespread disruption. Whether it’s patient records held by cloud providers , digital tools used in diagnostics, or the logistics systems that ensure timely delivery of medications, every component in this ecosystem is a potential target. Trustwave’s latest research report reveals that vulnerabilities in third-party systems or devices can have cascading effects for healthcare organizations. To maximize harmful impact, cybercriminals target healthcare software providers, knowing that compromising a single vendor could grant them access to multiple hospitals and healthcare facilities at once. A prime example of this was the 2022 ransomware attack on Advanced Computer Software Group, a major IT provider to the UK health and care sector. The breach, which exploited an account lacking multi-factor authentication, disrupted critical NHS services including NHS 111 and compromised the personal data of over 79,000 people, some of whom were receiving care in their own homes. Ransomware attacks Similarly, the ransomware attack on that pathology partnership, Synnovis, which occurred as recently as 2024, caused significant disruptions to NHS services in South East London. The attack affected all Synnovis IT systems and severely reduced the capacity to process pathology samples. This led to delays in diagnostics and treatment, with multiple patients negatively impacted and some procedures postponed or cancelled altogether. Such incidents serve as a stark reminder that the stakes in healthcare are uniquely high. A ransomware attack doesn’t just lock files. It freezes operating theatres, delays chemotherapy, or prevents prescriptions from being processed. In the worst-case scenario, such threats can result in clinical errors or delayed diagnoses, with life-threatening consequences. Are you a pro?

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Hospitals and healthcare providers cannot afford prolonged downtimes. Cybercriminals are aware of this vulnerability, making the healthcare sector one of the most targeted industries. The pressure to pay ransom and restore services quickly makes it a prime target for financially motivated attackers. Medical devices are particularly at risk. Imagine a compromised infusion pump or a malfunctioning ventilator caused by tampered firmware. These aren’t just hypothetical threats rather, very real possibilities in today’s increasingly dangerous cyber environment. In fact, as recently as January 2023, an insulin pump maker disclosed an IP address exposure The following month, an infusion pump provider acknowledged a vulnerability enabling unauthorized access to personal data. Soon after, a cardioverter defibrillator product reported a vulnerability leading to a data breach affecting over 1 million individuals. Such incidents underscore a harsh reality: when cybersecurity fails in healthcare, it’s not just data , but lives that are at stake. From national risk to global priority In the UK, the NHS is one of the most trusted institutions and maintaining public confidence is vital. But cybersecurity cannot be tackled in isolation. The cyber threat to the healthcare sector is not just a national risk but a part of a broader, international challenge. It requires a coordinated and cooperative response, both within the UK and with partners across Europe and beyond. One critical component to strengthening the healthcare supply chain’s cyber defenses is cross-border threat intelligence sharing, as the digital nature of healthcare means attacks can come from anywhere. UK institutions, cybersecurity companies and government agencies must work closely with their international counterparts to share threat intelligence, track criminal activity and respond rapidly to emerging risks. This includes monitoring forums where NHS-related data may be traded or discussed. Shared intelligence is also only effective when it’s specific and actionable. The healthcare supply chain has unique challenges that require a tailored analysis. National bodies such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), in collaboration with industry consortia, should lead efforts to coordinate information-sharing networks tailored to healthcare. Additionally, the NHS and private healthcare providers alike must begin to impose more stringent security standards on their vendors and partners. As best practice, contracts should clearly spell out responsibilities around breach notification, data protection and compliance with UK regulations such as the Data Protection Act and NHS DSP Toolkit standards. Adopting a zero-trust architecture can help mitigate the impact of supply chain breaches. Efforts underway Efforts to this effect are already underway, with the government drawing up the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill. Set to be introduced in Parliament in 2025, this Bill aims to bolster the UK's cyber defenses by expanding regulatory coverage to include more digital services and supply chains, both of which are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals. With recent high-profile cyberattacks on critical public services such as the NHS underscoring the urgency, the Bill will address vulnerabilities in the nation’s critical infrastructure, ensuring that essential services like healthcare are better protected. It will also enhance reporting requirements to improve the government's understanding of emerging threats and provide regulators with the tools needed to proactively identify and address potential risks. Alongside external collaboration and regulation, the internal cyber defenses of UK’s healthcare providers must also be brought up to par. That starts with culture. Frontline NHS staff and administrators must receive regular training on phishing, social engineering and password security. Moreover, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), robust access control and continuous monitoring significantly reduces the risk of future cyber attacks. Finally, legacy systems must be patched regularly and backup and data recovery plans should be tested and refined to ensure that healthcare services can bounce back quickly from any disruption. Cybersecurity as public health duty At the end of the day, securing the healthcare supply chain is not just a technical task, rather, it’s a duty of care. Patients trust their healthcare providers to keep their data and their lives safe. As the digital thread in healthcare becomes more essential to how we diagnose, treat and deliver care, this trust must extend to the technologies and the third-party suppliers our healthcare providers choose to partner with. Recent cyber incidents in the healthcare supply chain are not isolated attacks. They are signals that action must be taken now and in collaboration to close the security gaps and protect the arteries of our healthcare system. Only through shared responsibility, strong standards and relentless vigilance can we ensure that the technologies meant to heal do not become the very vectors of harm.

Advertisement Gary Cox for his role in operating a platform that generated false doctors’ orders to defraud Medicare and other federal health care benefit programs of more than $1 billion. According to court documents, Cox, along with his co-conspirators, exploited hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries by misleading them into accepting unnecessary medical items like orthotic braces and pain creams. They used an online platform, DMERx, to generate fake doctors’ orders and facilitate illegal kickbacks and bribes between telemedicine providers, pharmacies, and marketers. In return, Cox and his team profited by coordinating these fraudulent transactions and selling the bogus orders. The scheme falsely claimed that Medicare patients had been properly examined and treated. However, doctors were paid by telemedicine companies to sign off on orders without confirming patients' medical needs. This would often happen after only a brief phone call, and sometimes, the doctors would have no contact with the patient at all. Cox was convicted of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, along with three counts of health care fraud and conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks. He was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and making false statements concerning health care matters. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Dmitri Bolt Advertisement Related: MEDICARE Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Matthew Galeotti, stated that Cox led a massive healthcare fraud scheme involving fake doctors’ orders to bill over $1 billion, exploiting seniors and government programs, and emphasized the Justice Department’s commitment to prosecuting such crimes. “The defendant orchestrated a scheme to defraud government health care benefit programs on a massive scale, creating fraudulent doctors’ orders used to bill insurers over $1 billion,” Galeotti said. ""Americans are all too familiar with junk mail and spam calls that target seniors to steal their personal information and promote waste, fraud, and abuse in our economy. The Criminal Division will continue to aggressively prosecute health care fraud schemes to hold criminals accountable, protect the vulnerable, and recover financial losses.” Deputy Inspector General Christian Schrank criticized Cox for violating public trust by billing the government for unnecessary medical equipment.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stands against other stocks that just rocked the market. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals declined by 16.7 percent last week as investors sold off positions amid the surprising failure of its potential treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in one of its late-stage trials. According to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), the first trial of the Phase 3 study for the efficacy of itepekimab in adult former smokers with COPD met the primary target of showing a 27-percent reduction in the worsening symptoms after 52 weeks. However, the second trial failed to meet the same endpoint, having reduced by only 2 percent during the same study period. A pharmacist in a lab coat carefully analyzing a vial of medicine for its quality. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), along with its partner, Sanofi, said that they are reviewing the data and will discuss with regulatory authorities to evaluate next steps. “Certain people with COPD are in desperate need of new treatment options, especially those who continue to experience exacerbations despite being on maximal therapy, and we remain committed to discussing these data with regulatory agencies to evaluate our path forward,” said Sanofi Head of Research and Development Houman Ashrafian. Overall, REGN ranks 6th on our list of stocks that just rocked the market.

Addressing journalists, weekend, when they visited a primary healthcare centre in Calabar, Otu said most of the medical facilities were dilapidated and unfit for human use. She disclosed further that the poor state of infrastructure and inadequate attention forced pregnant women and other patients to patronize native doctors, traditional birth attendants and chemists. She, however, claimed that the situation has improved today, following the steady attention paid to the healthcare by sector Governor Bassey Otu’s administration. “The Primary Health Care, PHC, system in the state has undergone a dramatic transformation with 94 health facilities already renovated, digitalization ongoing across 196 wards, and immunization rates topping national charts Dr Otu explained that funding from multiple sources—including the World Bank-supported IMPACT Project, the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund (BHCPF), and direct state government allocations—has facilitated the ongoing renovation of facilities across all 18 local government areas. “These renovations include the installation of solar-powered electricity, solar boreholes for 24/7 water supply, and complete medical equipment for maternal and child healthcare.” Otu added that each renovated center also comes with a Mama Kit, a fully stocked childbirth package containing essentials for both mother and baby. “All the mother needs to bring to the hospital is herself and the pregnancy,” she said. She added that 196 skilled birth attendants have been recruited, along with over 380 newly employed healthcare workers, to address the longstanding manpower deficit.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Becca Bratcher is an author and journalist specializing in crypto. Follow Author May 31, 2025, 01:43pm EDT Jun 02, 2025, 01:52pm EDT Share Save Comment NEW YORK, NEW YORK - From 2022 to 2023 the average increase of drug prices in the U.S. was 15.2%, higher than the inflation rate, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Getty Images Bitcoin has made inroads into finance, energy, and even politics. Now, a growing number of healthcare companies are embracing it. Not only as a hedge or a balance sheet asset, but also as a guiding philosophy and potential infrastructure layer. The move may seem unlikely, given healthcare’s deeply regulated and bureaucratic nature. But that’s precisely the point. For companies like CrowdHealth and Semler Scientific, Bitcoin's appeal isn't speculative. It’s structural. In a sector inundated with reverse incentives, opaque pricing, and costly middlemen, Bitcoin offers transparency. The Current U.S. Healthcare System The U.S. healthcare system is worth roughly $5 trillion , averaging over $17,000 per person. Even with the high costs associated with health insurance, claims are often denied . Andy Schoonover, founder and CEO of CrowdHealth, experienced this firsthand. His insurer refused to pay an $8,000 bill for his daughter’s ear tube surgery, despite doctors deeming it medically necessary. Soon after, he dropped his insurance and began building a cash-pay model that eventually became CrowdHealth. A peer-to-peer platform where members fund one another’s healthcare needs. In this process, he found a natural audience among bitcoiners. MORE FOR YOU The Bitcoin Community And Healthcare Schoonover, who told Forbes in an interview in 2024 he holds roughly 80% of his liquid assets in Bitcoin, says the overlap wasn’t accidental. “Bitcoiners understand incentives,” he said. Schoonover believes that as patients dig deeper into the healthcare system, it becomes clear that hospitals, health networks, and government policies often work against patients’ best interests. A pattern quickly recognized by bitcoiners. CrowdHealth allows members to pay a monthly fee, directly contributing to each other’s care. In return, they avoid premiums and networks. More recently, Schoonover said their model has since grown to over 10,000 members. CrowdHealth is leaning further into Bitcoin by letting users invest unused healthcare funds into bitcoin. The long-term vision, according to Schoonover, is Bitcoin circularity in healthcare. “If we can build bitcoin circularity within healthcare we believe that will go a long way in normalizing bitcoin as a medium of exchange,” Schoonover said. Unlike insurance, CrowdHealth doesn’t guarantee payment. However, Schoonover claims that the community fully funds over 99% of eligible bills. Applying Bitcoin’s Philosophy To Healthcare And Finance While CrowdHealth integrates Bitcoin at the user level, Semler Scientific takes a top-down approach. The publicly traded medtech company adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in 2024, becoming one of the first healthcare companies to do so. For Semler chairman Eric Semler, Bitcoin represents resilience, scarcity, and alignment, traits sorely lacking in the healthcare system. “Bitcoin is monetary freedom,” Semler told me in an interview. “We’re freeing people medically through early detection, and Bitcoin helps us stay strong financially.” The company’s core product, QuantaFlo , is an FDA-cleared diagnostic tool for vascular disease. It enables early detection of cardiovascular issues, allowing for timely and potentially life-saving interventions. Semler emphasized the importance of early detection and noted that healthcare could benefit from adopting principles found in Bitcoin’s design, such as decentralization, transparency, and reducing reliance on middlemen. Turning To Bitcoin In Healthcare As A Strategic Asset In an interview with Forbes in 2024 , Eric Semler of Semler Scientific explained that their Bitcoin strategy isn’t just about protecting cash in an inflationary environment. It’s about owning the digital future. The company is exploring ways to mine Bitcoin creatively and integrate value into its shareholder model. “We’re in acceleration mode,” Semler told me this year in a followup interview. “We’re not just buying Bitcoin, we’re adding value to our value.” Back inn 2023, Semler became active in the company his father had founded. He joined the board to improve capital allocation and saw Bitcoin as the obvious next step, following Michael Saylor’s Strategy concept. “It was a last resort in the best way,” he added. Bitcoin offered a neutral reserve asset with no counterparty exposure or political entanglements, making it a good fit. Despite its early-mover status, Semler Scientific remains a rarity. Semler said that few medtech or biotech peers have followed suit. One exception is KindlyMD , a company that shares philosophical alignment but little market overlap. Still, he believes healthcare is well-positioned to lead a treasury shift. Healthcare companies generate steady cash flow, operate under strict regulations, and require long-term resilience, which according to Semler, makes Bitcoin a natural fit. That shift may be slow, but for now, Semler is content leading the charge. How Bitcoin Could Help Reshape Healthcare's Broken System The future of Bitcoin in healthcare, according to companies like CrowdHealth and Semler Scientific, is not about layering crypto onto a broken system. It is about rebuilding that system from the ground up using first principles. They see the Bitcoin network as having the potential to help make healthcare more affordable, build trust by putting patients in control, protect savings from inflation, and support better systems for sharing medical information. Schoonover envisions a future where bitcoin users fund one another’s procedures and doctors accept bitcoin directly, cutting out insurers entirely. Semler imagines a more robust, future-proof treasury model that gives healthcare companies stronger balance sheets and global leverage. Bitcoin won’t eliminate the need for regulation, nor will it immediately replace legacy players. But it does offer some interesting options. The examples of CrowdHealth and Semler Scientific suggest that some healthcare companies are exploring Bitcoin not for its popularity, but as a response to challenges in the current system.

(HCA) Due To Medicaid Cuts Ramish Cheema May 28, 2025 3 min read HCA We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Says “We Have No Idea What’s Really Going To Happen” and Discusses These 12 Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a mega-American hospital operator. Unlike its peer Tenet Healthcare, Cramer has discussed the firm in 2025. He remarked in March that he believed the shares had been punished enough. Since Cramer’s comments, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)’s shares have gained 11.9%. The stock jumped by 4.9% in mid-May as while Republicans did share their estimates to reduce healthcare spending, the reduction wasn’t as drastic as some feared. However, a drop in spending is still on Cramer’s mind when it comes to HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). Here’s what he said: “The ones I’m [inaudible] worried about, I’m worried about HCA. . .on the cutback in Medicaid. Because [it thrives] on Medicaid. . . .because they’re gonna delay reimbursement or they’re going to lower reimbursement. Because Medicaid, Medicaid is cut back.” Jim Cramer Is Worried About HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA) Due To Medicaid Cuts A team of healthcare professionals in lab coats and masks meeting at a hospital ward. L1 Capital mentioned HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its Q1 2025 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: “ HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s (NYSE:HCA) share price partially rebounded in the March 2025 Quarter, and was the only company to positively contribute over 1% to the Fund’s quarterly returns. We outlined in the December 2024 Quarterly Report that HCA’s share price had over reacted to concerns that healthcare policy under the Trump administration would be materially adverse for HCA. We took advantage of the market concerns to add to our investment in HCA at a share price well below our assessment of fair value, and it was pleasing to see a partial recovery in the share price during the March 2025 quarter. Six other companies each positively contributed 0.5% or greater to the Fund’s returns, across a diverse range of industries. We believe our unique approach to assessing quality businesses of varying size across a number of diversified sectors provides the opportunity to deliver strong risk adjusted returns in a range of market conditions. Overall, HCA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of HCA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Following a national search, the Montana Hospital Association Board of Trustees today announced that it has appointed F. Edward “Ed” Buttrey as President and chief executive officer for the Association. Buttrey will begin in the role on July 1. In this role, Buttrey will provide strategic leadership for association activities as well as provide direction to the association’s charitable arm, the Montana Health Research and Education Foundation, and for-profit subsidiary, MHA Ventures. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Ed is uniquely qualified to lead the Montana Hospital Association into its next chapter, thanks to his extensive experience in both healthcare policy and decades leading successful businesses. Ed understands the challenges and opportunities facing healthcare in Montana, the various solutions that can help or hinder them, and how to build and lead successful organizations. He has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to improving the lives of the people and communities he serves, and we believe Montana patients will continue to benefit from his vision and leadership,” said Craig Aasved, MHA Board Chair and CEO of Shodair Children’s Hospital in Helena. Buttrey, a graduate of Montana State University, is a business owner and long-serving state legislator from Great Falls. As a lawmaker, he’s worked on the state’s healthcare policies and future, including improving access and affordability, and was the sponsor of the 2015 Montana Medicaid expansion bill and bills to renew and revise the program in 2019 and during the 2025 session . He has served as a board member on the Benefits Health System (Great Falls) Board of Trustees since 2015. In addition to his legislative work, Buttrey has extensive experience in business, with a focus on real estate, hospitality, technology and manufacturing. He has volunteered with numerous local organizations, including efforts aimed at improving healthcare accessibility, supporting youth programs, and promoting economic development in Great Falls and surrounding areas, according to the press release. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “This is an exciting opportunity to move from crafting policy to driving meaningful change in the healthcare system itself. For more than 14 years, I’ve worked hard on a variety of healthcare policy issues because I have seen firsthand the importance of healthcare to our neighbors, our communities and our local economies. While the MHA is actively involved in the healthcare policy space, it also supports our state’s hospitals by providing quality improvement, safety, workforce development, emergency preparedness and other programs that enhance care in rural and frontier communities. I am deeply committed to applying both my legislative and business experience to build a stronger future for all Montanans who rely on the care our healthcare system provides,” Buttrey said. Buttrey will succeed Robert W. “Bob” Olsen, who has served in leadership positions for the Association since 1989 and has led the organization as president and CEO since 2022. During the course of his more than 30-year career with the association, Olsen has made significant contributions to federal and state regulatory, policy and advocacy matters.

What comes next? After the approval, Houston Healthcare and Emory Healthcare are on a collision course. The merger could possibly come as early as Sunday. Emory commits to keeping both hospitals open for at least seven years with no money changing hands in proposed healthcare system merger WARNER ROBINS, Ga. — Georgia's Attorney General's Office approved the merger of Houston Healthcare and Emory Healthcare. The merger comes after Houston Healthcare and Emory Healthcare signed a ""Letter of Intent"" to merge the two systems and, in February, the two agencies reached a final agreement overseeing the merger, according to the Attorney General's Office. The Attorney General's Office says that with the approval from their office, Houston Healthcare could be integrated into Emory Healthcare by Sunday, June 1. In a statement, Emory Healthcare CEO Joon Lee said, “We are excited we have reached this important milestone to bring our two organizations together. The unification of our two health systems will allow us to strengthen and grow our services for patients in Central Georgia, while providing continuous high-quality health care to the communities who need us most.” The merger comes after a consultant's report, incorporated in the merger application, cast doubt on the feasibility of Houston Healthcare's operations. The report found that, should the hospital systems not merge, Houston Healthcare could shutter within a year or two. The healthcare agency had $170 million in cash-on-hand a decade ago; in 2024, their cash reserves had dwindled to $80 million. As the merger completes, Houston Healthcare CEO Charles Briscoe is set to resign from his position when Emory Healthcare takes over operations. In a statement, Briscoe says he's excited for the future of the hospitals as Emory takes over. “This new affiliation with Emory Healthcare will help us reinforce our commitment of providing exceptional care and patient-focused services in Warner Robins, Perry and the surrounding areas,” Briscoe said in the statement. “For more than 60 years, we have supported our community with their health care needs and we look forward to what the future holds.” Houston Healthcare has two hospitals with 282 beds, according to Emory Healthcare. The hospital system has been in operation since 1960. They say that the hospital has 2,500 employees and 200 physicians, serving 300,000 patients. They'll be joining Emory Healthcare, which employs 26,400 employees and 10 hospitals. They're an academic health system and they employ 3,950 physicians in over 70 specialties, the health care system says. Close Ad"

What they're saying: ""Sharp increases in health care costs in recent years have made it difficult for some people to seek essential care,"" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said in a statement. ""Even in states with lower-than-average health care prices, residents’ incomes may not be enough to keep up with the cost, especially since virtually every part of Americans’ budgets have been impacted by inflation over the past few years."" RELATED: House GOP unveils spending bill that includes massive Medicaid cuts States where people spend the most on health care By the numbers: Not surprisingly, people in the nation’s poorest states tend to spend the most on health care, the analysis shows. Mississippi topped the list, with residents spending 18.66% of their median household income on health care costs. RELATED: HHS, led by vaccine skeptic RFK Jr., cancels contract to fight flu viruses The main reason people spend more on health care in Mississippi is because of low wages. The state’s average income is $54,915, the lowest average in the country, ""so even without extremely expensive health care prices, Mississippians still outspend people in other states when you adjust for income."" Here are the top 10 states where people spend the most on health care: Mississippi: 18.66% Louisiana: 17.82% West Virginia: 16.24% Arkansas: 16.23% Oklahoma: 16.11% New Mexico: 15.78% Alaska: 15.65% North Carolina: 15.37% Alabama: 15.10% Kansas: 14.77% States where people spend the least on health care By the numbers: Conversely, people in higher income states spend less of their earnings on health care, WalletHub found. Maryland residents spend the least on health care, at just over 9%. Here are the 10 states where people spend the least on health care: Maryland: 9.03% New Jersey: 9.40% Massachusetts: 10% Connecticut: 10.72% Rhode Island: 10.91% Colorado: 11.14% Virginia: 11.17% New Hampshire: 11.41% California: 11.43% Utah: 11.60% How can you reduce health care costs? What you can do: Jeff Helton, the academic director of health administration programs at the University of Colorado Denver Business School, told WalletHub that the best way to save on health care costs is with a healthy lifestyle – eating a balanced diet, drinking plenty of water, getting enough sleep and exercising regularly. ""Just those few easy things can prevent the expensive health care that comes up when you ‘let yourself go,’"" he said. When you do find yourself in need of a doctor or hospital, Helton said be sure to check with your insurance first and make sure the doctor, hospital, labs, and tests ordered are covered by your plan. ""If you can, get a regular checkup - prevention is the best medicine for keeping your health care costs under control,"" he said. The Source: This report includes information from WalletHub.

Kim Reynolds signs bill aimed at growing rural hospital workforces GUTHRIE CENTER, Iowa — Governor Kim Reynolds signed her top priority into law on Wednesday afternoon. The Governor signed her own proposed legislation at the Guthrie County Hospital, with state health care leaders, lawmakers and health care workers in attendance. The bill, HF 972 , has a plethora of provisions aimed at incentivizing medical students in the state to practice here. “Iowa ranks 40th in the number of residency slots available to medical students, which means many of our graduates from Iowa medical schools don’t get a chance to continue their education and training here,” said Reynolds. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The bill sets up a loan repayment program for medical students who commit to work in a rural health care system for at least five years — doubling the funding of the existing program to nearly $8 million. Families part ways with 1,800 Iowa soldiers at deployment sendoff ceremonies Iowa Health and Human Services is also directed to work on receiving $150 million in federal funding that will allow 115 new residency slots to be added annually to Iowa’s medical schools. “Just three to four years from now, the amount of time it takes for a typical residency rotation, we could have up to 450 more physicians being trained right here in Iowa, with some ready to enter the workforce, and we’re going to be ready for them,” said Reynolds. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The legislation also sets up a $3 million health care credential granting program that will allow hospitals to educate and train future health care workers. “It’s no secret there’s a physician shortage and a nurse shortage,” said Chris Stipe, the CEO of the Guthrie County Hospital. “But let’s be honest, there’s a shortage of all qualified health care workers in nearly every field. And workforce shortages are often more severe in smaller communities. If we are to continue to effectively care for our rural Iowa communities, critical strategies such as loan forgiveness programs and graduate medical education programs must be funded and expanded and run efficiently.” Governor Reynolds also signed another bill, HF 310 , into law that expands the legal definition of “health care provider” to protect more health care workers who are assaulted while at work by an individual. Outside of expanding the definition, the penalties were increased for anyone who commits the crime.

Under the guidelines, these providers are prohibited from attending to emergency cases involving injury or acute illnesses. The Health Ministry said in a circular dated May 5 that these guidelines would be an interim measure and could be a precursor to a future law to regulate the Online Healthcare Services (OHS) space. “It is becoming apparent that healthcare policies and regulations created in an analogue age may be inadequate to cater for the often-disruptive healthcare service models in the digital age,” the guidelines said. “Ambiguities and lacunas in the law create uncertainty for healthcare professionals, platform providers and patients alike. “It is crucial for there to be clear standards and requirements to guide those involved in the online healthcare services industry,” the guidelines added. According to the guidelines that came into effect on May 5, OHS can only attend to non-emergency cases; follow-up management for stable cases; group session counselling services for areas such as psychology, nutrition or rehabilitation; referral or secondary care programme by specialist or consultant; or support services such as the supply of medication, laboratory and imaging services. They are barred from attending to emergency cases which involve injury or illness that are acute and pose an immediate risk to a person’s life or long-term health or psychiatric cases requiring in-person sessions. Aside from that, cases which require the supply through post of any psychotropic drugs or drugs falling within the ambit of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and its related regulations; as well as cases which require intermediate or complex medical treatment are also prohibited. The company that runs the platform must be incorporated and registered with the Companies Commission of Malaysia and those with e-pharmacy services must employ a licensed pharmacist. At least one senior member of the board must be a medical practitioner registered in Malaysia with a valid practising certificate. The platform must be based in Malaysia and have a physical office. The platform must also have in place processes and procedures to enable the registration of Healthcare Professionals and Patients; conduct proper and necessary screenings and checks; obtain all required supporting documents from healthcare professionals and patients; and extend their best efforts to verify their veracity before approving any registration. Patients’ written information for the collection, use, processing and retention of confidential data and written information as well as the provision of OHS are obtained and recorded during the registration process in line with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, the relevant Code of Professional Conduct and the Malaysian Medical Council Guideline. “Such consent must be reproducible as and when required,” it said. A proper patient grievance mechanism and process to enable them to provide feedback on OHS, Healthcare Professionals and the platform must be in place. “The Platform Provider shall ensure that any issue raised using such Grievance Mechanism is promptly addressed and managed,” it stated. “The Platform is merely a technology platform to provide patients with access to Healthcare Professionals and facilitate the delivery of Online Healthcare Services, and there is no doctor-patient relationship between the Platform Provider and the Patient,” the guidelines said. It should also ensure the e-prescription issued must be controlled, given to the patient for single use only and can only be dispensed up to three times per prescription. Medications that are categorised under Group B under the Poisons Act 1952, whereby it cannot be purchased over the counter and and can only be supplied as per the provisions under Section 21(2) of the same Act. “Platform provider shall ensure any collection, use, processing, disclosure, transfer, retention and disposal of confidential data complies with all applicable laws including data protection laws,” it said. The healthcare professional employed by these platforms must be registered with a professional regulatory body in Malaysia; and possess valid practising certificate. “A healthcare professional should have appropriate liability protection and coverage to provide protection from any malpractice incidences,” it said.

Kim Reynolds signed two healthcare bills into law at the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center May 28, 2025, including her proposal to increase rural health care accessibility. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Wednesday her legislative proposal to increase physician training options and rural health care accessibility, a step she said will help ease burdens on rural hospitals and increase patients’ health outcomes across the state. Reynolds signed House File 972 at Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center, one of many rural health providers she said will benefit from the measure. The law, which she first introduced in February , includes multiple components. It directs the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to create a “hub-and-spoke” funding model for rural health care services based on the current Centers of Excellence Program and makes changes to Iowa Medicaid rates for providers serving mothers and infants. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Reynolds said improving rural health care access “starts with growing our physician workforce.” To address health care workforce shortages, the law makes changes to Iowa’s training and residency programs — HHS is also directed to work to draw down $150 million in federal funding that will go toward the creation of a projected 115 new residency slots at Iowa teaching hospitals. Reynolds said this expansion will help Iowa retain more of the health care providers who went to school in Iowa. “Doctors often decide to practice where they do their residency,” Reynolds said. “Today, Iowa ranks 40th in the number of residency slots … which means many of our (medical graduates) don’t get chance to continue their training here.” The new residency slots are one way to encourage medical providers to stay in the state — another part of the law works to provide an incentive to health care providers by consolidating the state’s medical student loan repayment programs to a new system with a boost of $8 million in funding, opening the program to individuals who are trained out-of-state who commit to practicing in high-demand areas of Iowa for five years. Other medical professions, like Registered Nurses and Certified Nursing Assistants, can also receive funding for training through the Health Care Professional Incentive Program, with Iowa HHS designating what fields are in high demand and eligible for the program. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Chris Stipe, the CEO of Guthrie County Hospital, thanked Reynolds for pursuing this measure, saying her administration has prioritized improving health care providers’ “ability to recruit and retain health care workers in rural Iowa.” “It’s no secret, there’s a physician shortage and a nurse shortage, but let’s be honest, there’s a shortage of all qualified healthcare workers in nearly every field,” Stipe said. “And workforce shortages are often more severe in smaller communities. If we are to continue to effectively care for our rural Iowa communities, critical strategies such as loan forgiveness programs and graduate medical education programs must be funded and expanded and run efficiently.” He also thanked Reynolds for signing a bill on health care workers’ safety. She also signed House File 310 Wednesday, a bill that expands the definition of “health care provider” under existing laws that provide increased penalties — a Class D felony — for assaulting people in certain occupations. The new definition would raise the criminal charges for assaulting anyone who is working, volunteering or participating in education at a hospital or rural emergency hospital. Reynolds said the measure is necessary to address increasing cases of violence occurring at health care facilities. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In addition to signing these two health care measures, the governor also signed a slate of bills into law Tuesday. The bills she signed include: House File 856 , a measure banning state entities, including local governments and community colleges, from spending funds or opening diversity, equity and inclusion offices and officials. House File 865 , a change to Iowa’s definition of “bullying and harassment,” removing reference to bullying as acts and conduct based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic” that lists characteristics like age, religion, race, sexual orientation and disability as potential traits a student could targeted for. The new definition states bullying is defined as “repeated and targete” acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student. Senate File 608 , increasing the grain indemnity fund maximum of $16 million and minimum of $8 million to help cover farmers’ losses in credit-sale contracts. House File 889 , Reynolds’ proposal to provide four weeks of paid parental leave to stay employees within 12 months of birth or adoption. Senate File 369 , another of the governor’s goals, that requires Iowa high school students pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalization civics test with at least 60% to graduate beginning in the 2026-2027 school year.

Healthcare delivery looks vastly different today from even five years ago. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, wearable health monitors, and telemedicine have changed how care is delivered. They have made healthcare faster, more personalized, and more accessible. The COVID-19 pandemic added to these changes, making virtual visits a common service in most healthcare systems and emphasizing the importance of mental health integration across clinical settings. Aging populations have also influenced healthcare dynamics, shifting approaches to long-term care models and chronic care management. As the healthcare environment continues to evolve, it’s increasingly important that healthcare education adjust alongside it. Education reform not only helps students, but it also helps tomorrow’s patients receive adequate and high-quality care. Whether pursuing a Doctorate in Physical Therapy or a Master of Science in Nursing, modernized education is essential in order to prepare students for the new dynamics of healthcare and the future of patient care. Current Gaps in Healthcare Education Despite a rapidly changing field, many healthcare education programs are ill-equipped to present students with the skills and experiences to embrace modern healthcare. One of the critical gaps between modern healthcare and outdated programs is the development of soft skills. Patient communication, emotional intelligence, and cultural competence are fundamental skills in healthcare but often underdeveloped in the classroom, as many programs lean primarily into clinical skills. Another shortcoming of many of today’s education programs is the lack of technological immersion. There are new technologies and tools being implemented into healthcare at a rapid pace, and it is essential for students to have exposure before entering the field. Not only is digital and data literacy helpful to keep up with the evolving industry, but it’s also critical for safe and effective care. Interdisciplinary collaboration is another important element in modern healthcare, but there is an underwhelming amount of cross-disciplinary training options in healthcare programs. Real-world care is administered by teams, and quality care takes a collaborative approach. For students to be successful providers, it’s imperative to receive experience during their education that prepares them for today’s healthcare, not an outdated version of it. Modernizing Healthcare Curriculum and Training Some programs have taken the lead in addressing the gaps by modernizing their curriculum. Healthcare programs like the University of St. Augustine’s Doctorate of Physical Therapy have embraced technologically advanced coursework and immersive learning experiences to prepare students for the current healthcare environment. These modern education programs focus not only on building clinical skills but also on incorporating leadership and professional competencies. They expose students to real-world experiences like telehealth training, AI tools, and simulation-based learning to ensure graduates are technologically proficient and confident going into their careers. Developing Real-World Readiness Beyond technology integration , programs that emphasize experiential learning better prepare students to support patients in the real world. Programs that partner with hospitals, community clinics, and tech companies offer students hands-on learning opportunities that expose them to the real environments they’ll step into as professionals. Beyond the practicality, clinical rotations and case-based studies help students develop soft skills so that by the time they enter the real world, they’re able to adapt, manage pressure, and approach interactions confidently. Preparing the Future of Healthcare With Education As technology continues to advance and population needs shift , the healthcare industry requires prepared and adaptable incoming professionals. Education reform closes the gap of current outdated education models and brings students closer to real-world care. By equipping the future healthcare workforce with clinical experience, soft skills, interdisciplinary collaboration, and tech exposure, they can meet current challenges while welcoming future opportunities for better care.

If healthcare costs are lower than expected, Agema (PVV) can spend 400 million euros per year on this over the next decade, Heinen (VVD) agreed, sources close to the government told NOS . This paves the way for an agreement between the government and the healthcare sector on keeping healthcare affordable. Agema can take the 400 million euros per year from the 2.3 billion euros set aside to absorb the expected increase in healthcare costs once the healthcare deductible is halved to 165 euros in 2027. The condition is that the reserved amount remains enough to cover the increased costs - so if healthcare costs turn out lower than expected. Agema assumes that this will be the case; Heinen has doubts. He therefore wants to evaluate after two years whether the investment in AI is still responsible. Heinen and Agema have been clashing on this topic for months, and the disagreement escalated in recent weeks to the point that Agema reportedly threatened to resign on Friday. The VVD Minister of Finance only wanted to commit the 400 million euros for 2027 and 2028, while the PVV Health Minister wanted the amount to be structural. According to Agema, the pot to absorb the increase in healthcare costs is far too big and can easily spare money for these investments. The two Ministers met extensively on Monday and Tuesday to resolve the conflict. Prime Minister Dick Schoof attended the meeting on Tuesday, and an agreement was reached after 9:00 p.m., NOS’s sources said. Now that this issue is settled, Agema can announce that the 400 million euros investment in AI in healthcare is fairly certain. And she can continue talks on the supplementary healthcare agreement with healthcare institutions and hospitals, which contains agreements on keeping healthcare affordable. Agema firmly believes that AI and other new technologies will play a big part in this."

Cody’s articles from Mintz are most popular: with readers working within the Banking & Credit and Securities & Investment industries Mintz are most popular: within Law Practice Management and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) California legislative activity focused upon private equity group and hedge fund health care transactions continues notwithstanding California Governor Gavin Newsom's veto last fall of California Assembly Bill 3129 (AB-3129). As we discussed in previous posts here and here , AB-3129 would have authorized the California Attorney General (AG) to review certain private equity group and hedge fund health care transactions. In vetoing AB-3129, Governor Newsom stated that the California Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) is the appropriate agency for assessing proposed health care transactions and their cost and market impacts and AB 3129's structure would have impeded this process. Against this backdrop, in February 2025, Assembly Member Mia Bonta introduced Assembly Bill 1415 (AB-1415) and subsequently amended the bill in April 2025. AB-1415 seeks to directly require private equity groups and hedge funds to notify OHCA of proposed health care material change transactions and affords OHCA review of such proposed transactions. Separately, in February 2025, Senator Christopher Cabaldon introduced Senate Bill 351 (SB-351), which adopts the corporate practice and restrictive covenant prohibitions contained in AB-3129. Both AB-1415 and SB-351 continue to work their way through the California legislature. On May 15, 2025, AB-1415 was voted out of the California Assembly (by a 42-16 vote) and sent to the Senate while SB-351 was placed in the Senate Appropriations Committee's ""suspense file"" for further consideration in a closed hearing on May 12, 2025. As currently drafted, AB-1415 does not fundamentally alter OHCA's pre-transaction review of health care entity material changes. Similarly, SB-351's corporate practice and non-compete prohibitions align with existing California law. As such and given that the more comprehensive AB-3129 was voted out of the California legislature last year, there is a likelihood that both AB-1415 and SB-351 wind up before Governor Newsom with potential enactment effective January 1, 2026. AB-1415 Update During a California Assembly Health Committee hearing on April 22, 2015, Assembly Member Bonta stated that the intent of AB-1415 is to provide OHCA with access to the information needed to assess the impact of health care transactions and establish growth targets to address California's rising health care costs. In that regard, Bonta noted that the current ""health care entities"" required to provide notice of certain material change transactions to OHCA do not include key players in the health care marketplace, including private equity groups, hedge funds, management services organizations (MSOs), and health systems. At the hearing, California hospital associations and insurance companies, among others, noted their opposition to AB-1415. These stakeholders primarily asserted that expansion of the definition of ""health care entities"" was premature given that OHCA had been operating for just over a year, and the bill could adversely impact health care investment and innovation. Following a 11-3 vote at the April Assembly Health Committee hearing, AB-1415 was moved to the House Appropriations Committee. On April 24, 2025, AB-1415 was amended as described further below. On May 12, 2025, the amended AB-1415 was voted out of the California Assembly (by a 42-16 vote) and is now in the California Senate awaiting committee assignment for initial consideration. Revised ""Health Care Entity"" Definition and New ""Noticing Entity"" Under existing law, ""health care entities"" are required to provide 90-day prior notice to OHCA for certain material change transactions involving their assets or operations. The term ""health care entities"" currently includes payors, fully integrated delivery systems, and individual providers such as hospitals, clinics, surgery centers, clinical laboratories, and imaging facilities. As part of this notice to OHCA, ""health care entities"" are required to submit comprehensive information regarding the proposed transaction, including third-party entity information obtained from private equity groups, hedge funds, MSOs, and other third-party entities as applicable. As originally drafted, AB-1415 would have added MSOs and parent entities of providers to the list of ""health care entities"" subject to OHCA's notice requirements and separately required that private equity groups and hedge funds provide pre-transaction notices to OHCA. As amended, however, the bill removes MSOs and parent entities from the definition of ""health care entities"" and creates a new ""noticing entity"" definition to include MSOs, parent entities, private equity groups, hedge funds, and other entities created for the purpose of entering into agreements or transactions with ""health care entities."" Under amended AB-1415, ""noticing entities"" are required to directly report to OHCA certain material change transactions between themselves and a health care entity. The removal of MSOs and parent entities from the definition of ""health care entity"" is significant. Without the legislative amendment, MSOs and parent entities would have been required to provide OHCA with pre-transaction notice of certain material changes solely involving their assets or operations and wholly unrelated to any health plan, fully integrated health system, or provider. As amended, MSO-only or parent entity-only transactions (e.g., MSO or parent entity changes of ownership) are not subject to OHCA notice provided that no assets or operations of a ""health care entity"" are involved. Management Services Organization Monitoring Amended AB-1415 would allow OHCA to establish MSO data reporting requirements and add MSOs to the existing list of entities OHCA will research and evaluate to determine if OHCA's transaction review provisions are sufficiently broad. The bill does not detail the nature or scope of these MSO data reporting requirements, but they likely would include information regarding the structure and substance of the relationship between MSOs and health care entities. Clarification of ""Health System"" Definition Under existing law, ""health care entities"" include certain individual defined providers, as noted above. As originally drafted, AB-1415 added ""health systems"" to the definition of ""provider"" subject to OHCA's pre-transaction notice requirements. Amended AB-1415 revises the definition of ""health system"" to include a ""combination of one or more hospitals and one or more health care providers"" (rather than ""physician organizations"" as originally drafted) to ensure that ""health care entities"" do not include small physician groups. No Substantive Revision to Private Equity Group and Hedge Fund Provisions As noted above, there are no substantive revisions to the provisions regarding private equity groups, hedge funds, and newly created entities, and such entities are ""noticing entities"" in the revised bill. To the extent that the other party to a material change transaction is a ""health care entity,"" AB-1415 would require that private equity groups, hedge funds, and newly created entities provide direct pre-transaction notices to OHCA. SB-351 Update During a California Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on April 29, 2025, Senator Cabaldon described SB-351 as responding to Governor Newsom's veto of AB-3129 by not including provisions regarding California AG review of material change transactions. Instead, Cabaldon stated that SB-351 adopts virtually verbatim the corporate practice prohibitions in AB-3129 with express authority for the California AG to seek injunctive relief and attorneys' fees in the context of private equity group and hedge fund investment in California physician or dental practices. Specifically, the bill removes AB-3129's reference to psychiatrists and prohibits private equity groups and hedge funds (excluding individuals or entities contributing to the group or fund) from exerting undue influence or control over the professional clinical judgment of physicians or dentists consistent with existing California law. Further, SB-351 would mirror AB-3129's prohibitions against private equity groups and hedge funds entering into certain non-compete or non-disparagement clauses with physicians or dentists. (See our general discussion here regarding restricted covenants in private equity transactions.) At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, dental groups opposed SB-351 by noting that corporate practice prohibitions already exist and that the targeted approach signals that private equity and hedge fund investment is unwelcome in California notwithstanding the benefits of access to capital, operational support, and ability to focus upon patient care. Following an 11-2 vote at the hearing, SB-351 was moved to the Senate Appropriations Committee. On May 12, 2025, SB-351 was placed in the Appropriations Committee ""suspense file"" for all bills having unbudgeted costs exceeding $150,000. It is likely to be heard at a closed suspense file hearing on May 23, 2025. Takeaways The introduction of AB-1415 and SB-351 is further evidence of the scrutiny of private equity group and hedge fund health care sector investments, both in California and more broadly across the states. As of this publication, OHCA has reviewed twenty-two material change transaction notices, and to date none have been subject to full cost and market impact review (CMIR). AB-1415 seeks to further OHCA's mission by broadening the scope of entities required to directly submit material change transaction notices to OHCA to include MSOs, parent providers, private equity groups, hedge funds, and certain newly created entities. Instead of receiving relevant ""noticing entity"" information indirectly from ""health care entities,"" California law would require ""noticing entities"" themselves to provide applicable transaction information directly to OHCA. AB-1415 does not otherwise impact OHCA's pre-transaction review of ""health care entity"" material changes, and ""noticing entities"" apparently would submit the same material change transaction notice information as currently required of ""health care entities."" We do not yet know whether AB-1415, if enacted, would increase the burden upon OHCA in conducting its pre-transaction review or whether the likelihood of a full CMIR would be impacted. SB-351 proposes to strengthen corporate practice and restrictive covenant prohibitions specifically in the context of private equity and hedge fund investment in physician and dental practices by providing the California AG with mandatory enforcement authority. As noted above, the corporate practice prohibitions incorporated from former AB-3129 are consistent with current California law and impose no new restrictions upon private equity groups or hedge funds. SB-351's restrictive covenant prohibitions similarly mirror former AB-3129's provisions. The non-compete restriction is consistent with existing California law and the non-disparagement restriction likely does not raise significant issues for private equity groups or hedge funds.

Stay Updated on The Latest Generic Pharmaceuticals Market Trends : https://www.theresearchinsights.com/request_sample?id=9170 Patent Expirations of Brand-Name Drugs : The generic pharmaceutical market continues to expand mainly because patents for high-revenue branded drugs keep expiring. The expiration of these patents allows generic drug makers to develop bioequivalent products which they sell at much lower prices. The pharmaceutical industry has consistently experienced the ""patent cliff"" phenomenon. Major medications such as Humira (adalimumab), Revlimid (lenalidomide), and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) now face or will face generic market competition. The expiration of patents creates billion-dollar market opportunities for generic drug manufacturers. Healthcare providers and insurers show a growing preference for generic medications as economical options especially within large public health systems throughout the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. The trend of blockbuster drug patents expiring will remain a strong advantage for generic manufacturers throughout the upcoming years. Healthcare expenses across the globe continue to increase which drives the demand for affordable therapeutic options: Healthcare providers and governments around the world face increasing pressure to manage escalating healthcare costs due to aging populations, chronic diseases proliferation and the expansion of universal healthcare coverage. Generic medications serve as an essential remedy by delivering clinically equivalent options which cost between 30% to 80% less than their brand-name equivalents. Due to their lower price point generics have received extensive policy backing. Both the U.K., Canadian and Indian governments have put pricing policies and incentives into place to support generic drug use over branded ones. The FDA's Drug Competition Action Plan (DCAP) demonstrates the U.S. policy drive for drug affordability by expediting generic drug approvals. The global focus on healthcare affordability drives continuous growth in generic medicine demand thus establishing it as a stable expanding market domain. Regulatory Streamlining and Growing Acceptance of Generics : Global regulatory agencies are progressively making the generic drug approval process more efficient to boost market competition and guarantee quick access to necessary medications. The U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have developed expedited pathways and established guidelines to eliminate obstacles faced by generic drug manufacturers. The FDA's Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process allows generic drugs to enter the market more quickly after patent expiration if the generic can prove bioequivalence. Enhanced manufacturing standards and increased transparency in production methods are driving global confidence in generic drugs' effectiveness and quality. Patients and healthcare providers have gained more trust in the prescription and utilization of generic drugs. Digital tools and e-pharmacy platforms improve generic drug accessibility across underserved regions which enhances market penetration.

Alberta’s government is investing in made-in-Alberta solutions to strengthen the province’s primary health care system, including Indigenous primary health care. These new grants will support projects that improve access, reduce administrative burdens and support team-based care so all people in Alberta can get the care they need, when and where they need it. The grants are being awarded through two innovation-focused programs: the Primary Care Innovation Fund and the Indigenous Primary Health Care Innovation Fund. These funds will support 19 projects that will improve primary care, advance research and innovation and support community health priorities. “A strong, reliable primary health care system is the foundation of the entire health system. These strategic investments are helping to make that a reality for families across Alberta. They are especially meaningful for Indigenous communities, as they support culturally safe care that respects traditional knowledge and addresses unique community needs.” “Ensuring Indigenous communities have access to quality primary health care that aligns with their unique needs is a priority for Alberta’s government. The Indigenous Primary Health Care Innovation Fund empowers communities to lead the way in developing solutions that enhance care, support cultural traditions and improve health outcomes for Indigenous Peoples across the province.” The $5-million Primary Care Innovation Fund is supporting five projects that will help improve access to care, support early detection of dementia and other conditions, provide post-reproductive care for women, advance research and clinical trials, and harness the potential of artificial intelligence to improve health care services. The $20-million Indigenous Primary Health Care Innovation Fund is supporting 14 community-led initiatives, including virtual care clinics, cultural reconnection, facility upgrades and Elder care. The funding is flexible so Indigenous communities can address their specific priorities and support culturally appropriate care. “We are thrilled to announce the approval for the Indigenous Primary Health Care Innovation Fund. We are eager to be providing a welcoming and supportive environment for our Elders. This facility represents a significant investment in our community and is a testament to the growing need of quality care for our Elders.” Both of the grant programs stem from a recommendation in the Modernizing Alberta’s Primary Care System (MAPS) final report. MAPS was created to strengthen Alberta’s primary health care system and ensure all people in Alberta have access to timely, appropriate care throughout their lives. “University Hospital Foundation is grateful for the Primary Care Innovation Fund that enabled us to match the vision of our donors with talented University of Alberta researchers and health providers. Using a co-design approach, the dementia program will enhance early diagnosis, facilitate more efficient research and improve post-diagnosis care pathways for people living with dementia and their caregivers.” “We’re excited to work with Alberta’s primary care teams and innovation partners to build a program grounded in real-world needs – helping them develop the skills and confidence to turn ideas into action and shape the future of care."" Indigenous Support Line To further support access to primary care for Indigenous patients and families, the Indigenous Support Line will be expanded to Edmonton and Calgary on June 1. The phone line has supported more than 10,000 callers over the past three years with health system navigation, access to cultural supports, language services and more. Operated by Health Link in partnership with the Indigenous Wellness Core, the line connects callers with health professionals who understand Indigenous ways of knowing and traditional healing practices. The support line can also be utilized by front-line health care providers to assist in providing culturally appropriate care. Providers can use the support line to learn about cultural support services, Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional healing practices, access to ceremony and other services that may assist their patients. “Health Link and Indigenous Wellness Core teams have provided exceptional care to Indigenous Peoples in the north, south and central zones for the past three years through the Indigenous Support Line. The impact of this service is evident in the response from those who have accessed the line, and through it, Indigenous listeners who aid their health care journey. I am thrilled that the line will now be available to Indigenous Peoples and communities across the province.” Quick facts Primary Care Innovation Fund grant recipients are: Praxus Health – to develop and deliver a comprehensive primary care innovation training program for health professionals. Arthritis Society of Canada – to implement a cost-effective, AI-enhanced portable infant ultrasound screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip. Dr. Kerry McBrien, University of Calgary – to develop a community health navigator program to enhance team-based care, integrate social and community resources and improve access to care.

The rising adoption of healthcare IT solutions, increasing demand for better clinical outcomes, and concerns over medication errors and patient safety are driving the growth of CDSS. Advancements in AI, machine learning, and natural language processing are improving the accuracy and efficiency of CDSS tools, while government initiatives, widespread EHR use, and investments in digital health infrastructure are further fueling market expansion worldwide. Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=18085342 Browse in-depth TOC on "" Clinical Decision Support Systems Market "" 300 - Tables 55 - Figures 350 - Pages By delivery mode, the clinical decision support systems market is divided into on-premises and cloud-based modes. In 2024, the on-premises CDSS segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the clinical decision support systems market. This growth of this segment is primarily due to the growing demand for data security and control, especially among large healthcare organizations and multispecialty hospitals. On-premises solutions offer enhanced data protection, allowing institutions to manage patient information within their infrastructure, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches. These systems provide organizations with the flexibility to customize and integrate CDSS with existing healthcare systems and workflows, catering to specific organizational needs. The ability to decide when to implement software upgrades ensures that institutions have adequate time to test new features and train staff, minimizing disruptions to clinical operations. By interactivity level, the clinical decision support systems market can be divided into active CDSS and passive CDSS. In 2024, the active CDSS is the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Active CDSS provides real-time alerts and recommendations directly within clinical workflows, enhancing decision-making efficiency and patient safety. Robust government initiatives promoting the adoption of healthcare IT solutions, such as electronic health records (EHRs), CDSS, and computerized provider order entry (CPOE), are significantly contributing to this growth. For instance, the US Department of Health and Human Services revised certification program rules in April 2023 to encourage greater utilization of clinical decision support tools. By geography, The Asia Pacific region is expected to experience significant growth, with a noticeable annual growth rate during the forecast period. Key factors driving the expansion of clinical decision support systems solutions in this region include rising healthcare expenditure, growing awareness about the benefits of health IT, and expanding digital infrastructure. Rapid urbanization and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases are placing pressure on healthcare systems, prompting investments in advanced clinical technologies such as CDSS to improve efficiency and patient outcomes. Government initiatives promoting digital health, such as India's Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and China's Health Information System reforms, are accelerating the adoption of EHRs and CDSS platforms. The growing presence of multinational healthcare IT firms, increasing collaborations with local providers, and a rising demand for cost-effective healthcare solutions are all contributing to the region's rapid market expansion.

Chapter 31 VA Benefits: Will your VR&E benefits be deducted from your VA education entitlement? Medicare. Is UnitedHealth Group under investigation for Medicare fraud? Here's what we know T he cost of home health care can be a financial strain for patients and their families. For many, Medicare serves as a crucial support system , offering not just affordable care but also financial and emotional relief . Medicare costs vary depending on your specific coverage , the services you receive, and the providers you choose. Medicare Part B covers physician services, hospital outpatient care, durable medical equipment, and certain home health care services . In 2025, Medicare Part B has a monthly premium of $185 and a $257 deductible , which includes coverage for home health care. Here's what you'll pay for home health care services after meeting your deductible . Medicare home health care costs There is no separate deductible or copayment specifically for home health care, as long as beneficiaries meet the eligibility criteria. However, once the deductible is met, beneficiaries typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for home health care coverage. This coinsurance may be applied to the purchase of durable medical equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, and hospital beds . Medicare Part B eligibility To qualify for Medicare Part B, you must be 65 years or older, have a disability, or be diagnosed with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Enrollment begins three months before your 65th birthday, but benefits start only after reaching that age. Staying informed is the key to accessing the benefits you're entitled to. If you have questions, visit your nearest Social Security office or contact their support services.

https://www.medindia.net/news/medical-tourism-on-the-rise-as-us-tariffs-raise-the-price-of-healing-at-home-219898-1.htm,,Medical Tourism on the Rise as US Tariffs Raise the Price of Healing at Home,20250518T144500Z,https://images.medindia.net/health-images/1200_1000/first-aid-kit.jpg,medindia.net,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"Medical tourism is traveling abroad to get affordable, quality healthcare not easily available locally. As the United States imposes steep tariffs on medical imports from China, a new report warns that these trade policies may have unintended consequences for the medical tourism industry. The report by GlobalData, a leading analytics firm, highlights how recent changes in US trade policy are driving up the cost of healthcare domestically and pushing more patients to seek affordable medical treatment abroad ( 1 ✔ ✔ Trusted Source GlobalData highlights potential impact of US tariffs on medical tourism Go to source ). The US has recently levied high tariffs on a broad range of medical goods imported from Chinaâincluding syringes, surgical gloves, and face masks. These products are essential for routine medical care and surgical procedures. The increased costs associated with these tariffs are straining hospital supply chains and inflating the overall cost of healthcare in the country. Medical Tourism Medical tourism can be broadly defined as provision of ''cost effective'' private medical care in collaboration with the tourism industry for patients needing surgical and other forms of specialized treatment. ‘Passports for procedures? With domestic #healthcare expenses climbing, more Americans are exploring #medical_tourism. What does this trend say about our current system? #HealthcareReform’ âThese items are integral to a wide variety of medical procedures and daily healthcare operations. The imposition of tariffs on such goods has disrupted supply chains, constrained hospital procurement strategies, and driven up the cost of healthcare delivery across the US,â the report stated. Medical Tourism on the Rise Countries like India, Mexico, Thailand, and Costa Rica are emerging as popular medical tourism hubs due to their competitive pricing and internationally accredited hospitals. For example, the cost of a knee replacement surgery in the US may exceed $50,000, while the same procedure in India or Mexico ranges from $8,000 to $12,000. This vast price difference is compelling patients â particularly the uninsured and underinsured â to seek treatment overseas. Medical Tourism-The Road Ahead Medical Tourism has become a serious enterprise in India over the last two years. However some hospitals have been practicing it for quite a few years. âWhile the intended impact of tariffs may not have been to affect healthcare, they do shape patient behaviour,â said Alexandra Murdoch, Senior Medical Analyst at GlobalData. âThe rise in the cost of medical devices ultimately leads to more out-of-pocket expenses for patients.â Unintended Economic Consequences The report warns that tariffs on medical imports are not just altering trade dynamicsâthey are also influencing domestic healthcare economics. Hospitals and clinics, already under pressure from labor shortages and inflation, are now facing higher costs for essential medical tools and equipment. LASIK Surgery and Medical Tourism Get a LASIK done for laser- sharp eyes. If traveling abroad for treatment Consult Us First for affordable options. As a result, healthcare providers may be forced to pass these costs onto patients, exacerbating financial strain for those without comprehensive insurance. This could further accelerate the trend of outbound medical tourism, especially among cost-conscious consumers seeking affordable alternatives. Unless the current trajectory of trade policy and healthcare costs is reversed, the trend of Americans looking overseas for medical care is likely to continue â raising new questions about the intersection of economic policy and public health . Medical Tourism On Rise in India Medical tourism in India has become a revenue earner of sorts for the country. Medical tourists entering the country are driven by treatment at cheaper prices. With the global healthcare landscape becoming more interconnected, the ripple effects of US tariffs may extend far beyond economics, potentially reshaping how and where Americans access life-saving treatments.

The Commercial Officer, U.S. Mission in Nigeria, Blake Murray, at the launch on Thursday in Abuja, described the partnership as a powerful accelerator in Nigeria’s healthcare modernisation efforts. ALSO READ: Firm to drive investment opportunities for media industry in Nigeria He said, “Nigerian firms and public institutions collaborating with U.S. medical suppliers, like Cassona Global Imaging, have access to original equipment manufacturers, cutting-edge technologies, world-class standards, and critical service and warranty support.” Murray also noted that strategic partnerships between U.S. companies and Nigerian institutions can improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, expand access to healthcare, and advance disease prevention and control. “The U.S. Mission in Nigeria is committed to deepening bilateral trade relations between the two countries. “Last year, two-way trade between the United States and Nigeria hit a record $13 billion. Our shared goal is to promote two-way investment and deepen commercial ties between our nations. “The U.S. Department of Commerce and Nigeria’s Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment are set to launch the United States-Nigeria Commercial and Investment Partnership next month in Abuja, prioritizing collaboration in agriculture, digital economy, and infrastructure, including healthcare infrastructure. “This partnership is expected to unlock new opportunities for economic growth, job creation, and technological advancement in Nigeria. “By working together, the U.S. and Nigeria can address pressing healthcare challenges and improve the lives of millions of Nigerians. “The investment by Cassona Global Imaging is a testament to the growing interest of U.S. companies in Nigeria’s healthcare sector. “It demonstrates the potential for mutually beneficial partnerships that can drive progress and prosperity in both countries,” he said. Also, the Chairman and CEO of Cassona Global Imaging Limited, John Chigbu, while speaking to journalists explained that the company’s mission is to make quality healthcare accessible to all Nigerians. “We sell our equipment at a fraction of the cost. A CT scanner that would normally cost $1 million is available for $250,000. Not only do we sell it at an affordable price, we also finance it, allowing you to make a small down payment and pay the rest over 24 months,” he said. Chigbu also disclosed that the company’s equipment range includes ultrasound machines, X-ray machines, CT scanners, and PET scans, which will significantly improve disease diagnostics in Nigeria. He raised concerns that the lack of access to quality healthcare has led to medical tourism, where Nigerians with means travel abroad for treatment. “We need to reverse this trend. We need medical tourism to come into Nigeria, not the other way around. We need to make quality healthcare accessible to all, not just those who can afford it. “Cassona Global Imaging plans to set up diagnostic centers and hospitals in Nigeria, equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. The company will also provide training for healthcare professionals, ensuring that they are proficient in using the equipment. “We’re not just building hospitals; we’re building a healthcare ecosystem. We’ll provide training, maintenance, and support to ensure that our equipment is always working. If it breaks down, we’ll fix it within 48 hours or provide a loaner,” he stated. He said the company is committed to localising Nigeria’s healthcare system by recruiting and training Nigerian professionals. “We need to build capacity in Nigeria. We need to train our people to take care of our healthcare needs. That’s why we’re recruiting Nigerian engineers and healthcare professionals to work with us. “With Cassona Global Imaging’s innovative approach, Nigeria’s healthcare sector is poised for a significant transformation, making quality healthcare more accessible and affordable for all,” he said.

It suggests eight in 10 Americans had some form of medical data stolen last year. The biggest hack in 2024 was also one the largest healthcare data breaches in US history, impacting 190 million patients linked to Change Healthcare. Now, researchers at the cyber watchdog Check Point are warning of a newly uncovered healthcare cyberattack that could expose even more sensitive information than the previous year. According to the team, cybercriminals are impersonating practicing doctors to trick patients into revealing Social Security numbers, medical histories, insurance details, and other personal data. The phishing campaign has been active since March 20, and researchers estimate that 95 percent of its targets are in the US. 'In some versions of these phishing emails, cybercriminals deploy images of real, practicing doctors but pair them with fake names,' the Check Point team reported. The emails instruct recipients to contact a listed healthcare provider using a specific phone number—part of the scam. Researchers noted that Zocdoc has become a key tool in the attackers' arsenal, as it allows them to use images of real doctors while disguising their identities with fake credentials. The healthcare industry is under siege, with cybersecurity researchers revealing that 276 million patient records were compromised in 2024 The Check Point team noted that the data compromised in 2024 amounted to roughly 758,000 records every single day. 'Victims of medical identity theft will spend an average of 210 hours and $2,500 out-of-pocket to reclaim their identities and resolve the fallout,' the researchers said. In one case, cybercriminals created a fake profile on Zocdoc using a real doctor's image but a fake name and sent a fake pre-appointment message, booking confirmation, and additional instructions. To safeguard patients' private information and finances, healthcare organizations are urged to install advanced phishing filters, conduct regular employee cybersecurity training and mock drills, and ensure their IT teams are equipped to respond to threats quickly. In March 2025, Yale New Haven Health experienced a data breach affecting approximately 5.5 million individuals. Hackers copied the data on the day it was discovered, indicating a likely ransomware attack and exposing the fragility of the U.S. healthcare system. These breaches highlight systemic failures in the cybersecurity infrastructure of the healthcare sector. Many organizations still rely on outdated systems that lack modern security protocols, making them easy targets for cybercriminals. A recent study revealed that some medical devices—unlike smartphones or laptops—lack basic security safeguards, making them a significant entry point for hackers. Now, researchers at Check Point are warning of a newly uncovered healthcare cyberattack that could expose even more sensitive information By compromising devices like MRI machines, cybercriminals can gain access to entire networks and connected systems, creating widespread vulnerabilities. The financial repercussions of these breaches are staggering. UnitedHealth Group estimated the cost of the Change Healthcare breach at approximately $2.5 billion, covering response efforts, system rebuilds, and support for affected providers. 'The company has restored most of the affected Change Healthcare services while continuing to provide financial assistance to remaining healthcare providers in need,' UnitedHealth Group stated. Beyond financial damage, the cyberattack also caused severe operational disruption.

Smaller healthcare providers faced devastating revenue losses, threatening their survival. In response to the rising threat, a new set of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations was proposed in January 2025. The goal is to enhance the protection of medical records through stronger data encryption and stricter compliance checks. The proposed rule is expected to cost $9 billion in the first year and $6 billion annually over the next four years. Patients affected by data breaches are urged to monitor their financial accounts, request credit reports, and consider placing fraud alerts. 'Patients are encouraged to review statements from their healthcare providers and report any inaccuracies immediately,' said Yale New Haven Health. The exposure of 276 million patient records underscores the urgent need to reinforce cybersecurity in healthcare. As threats continue to evolve, it's critical for healthcare organizations to implement modern safeguards and conduct regular audits to stay ahead of attackers and protect sensitive patient data.

""The news about significant layoffs at Providence Community Health Centers is as alarming as it is unsurprising.

Providence Community Health Centers is a well-respected, critically important organization, and yet, they are struggling to survive; the latest victim in this state’s unwillingness to address reimbursement rates. What’s infuriating is that we know what the problem is, and we know how to fix it, but instead we are rolling out modest health care grants and commissioning more studies. Rhode Islanders deserve quality, affordable, and accessible health care, and state leadership is failing to deliver it. “I urge the General Assembly to support increases in the state budget for Medicaid reimbursement.

NEW YORK, NY AND ONTARIO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / May 13, 2025 / Equum Medical and Prime Healthcare have announced the renewal and expansion of their successful telehealth partnership, celebrating five years of collaboration in advancing virtual care delivery. Under the renewed agreement, Prime Healthcare will broaden its adoption of Equum Medical's telehealth services, expanding into Illinois (formerly part of Ascension Health) and introducing additional offerings like Virtual Safety Observers across its network. This expanded partnership represents a critical step forward in Prime Healthcare's enterprise-wide telehealth strategy, which aims to alleviate capacity challenges while maintaining high-quality care across its facilities. Through Equum's outcomes-focused clinical services platform, Prime Healthcare will enhance its ability to standardize care protocols, effectively scale resources, and deliver expert care to high-acuity patients, regardless of location. As health systems across the country continue to adjust post-COVID, there is an increasing urgency to rationalize and standardize telehealth investments that have become fragmented over the past several years. Recognizing the need for a unified approach to virtual care, Prime Healthcare understands that integrating both technology and dynamic virtual workforce resourcing is crucial for addressing growing demand and capacity challenges. By partnering with Equum, Prime Healthcare can optimize telehealth across its system with a flexible, modular solution that can be efficiently scaled to meet diverse needs, all while supporting a consistent, high-quality patient experience. ""We are proud to continue and expand our partnership with Prime Healthcare, a relationship that has proven the value of telehealth in transforming care delivery at scale,"" said Dr. Corey Scurlock, Founder & CEO of Equum Medical. ""What began as a Tele-ICU program has grown into a broader initiative aimed at standardizing and extending critical care services across multiple hospitals. This partnership is a powerful example of how innovation and technology can improve care access and patient outcomes on a national scale."" As one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, Prime Healthcare operates 51 hospitals across 14 states, earning national recognition for its clinical excellence and commitment to community health. The health system's decision to extend its partnership with Equum comes as Prime continues its growth, including the recent acquisition of seven hospitals in Illinois. The expanded agreement will also see the deployment of Equum's Virtual Safety Observer solutions on medical-surgical floors, complementing ongoing Tele-ICU support. This remote monitoring service enhances patient safety by providing continuous oversight, preventing falls, and addressing other adverse events that could impact patient care. ""Equum's telehealth solutions have proven to be invaluable in helping us manage patient demand and support our clinical teams,"" said Harsha Gopinath, Director of Telemedicine Services at Prime Healthcare. ""As we expand our use of telehealth, we are confident that this partnership will continue to support our goals of delivering high-quality, scalable care across our network while addressing capacity challenges and improving patient safety."" This renewed and expanded partnership between Equum Medical and Prime Healthcare sets a precedent for the future of telehealth in large health systems. The partnership underscores the importance of flexible, technology-enabled solutions that allow healthcare organizations to extend critical care expertise and improve operational efficiency in the face of growing patient volumes and clinician shortages. By combining Prime Healthcare's commitment to quality care with Equum Medical's expertise in high-acuity telehealth, both organizations are pioneering new approaches to care that will serve as models for other healthcare systems across the country. About Equum Medical Equum Medical is a leading provider of acute telehealth-enabled clinical services solutions, specializing in high-acuity care and acute patient monitoring.

Back in February, management said tariffs would hit its earnings per share ( EPS ) in 2025 by $0.05. Fast forward to the end of April (almost a month after the ""Liberation Day"" tariffs were announced), and management discussed an additional $0.80 net hit from the tariffs. For reference, GE HealthCare's current full-year EPS guidance for 2025 calls for $3.90 to $4.10. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to a cost impact, GE HealthCare is a major exporter to China, and the country's aim to improve its healthcare provision is a key driver of demand for GE's scanners and imaging equipment. Indeed, management outlined that about $0.65 of the total $0.85 impact on EPS was due to U.S./China tariffs, with CFO James Saccaro noting on the earnings call: ""It really goes both ways. We do ship a fair amount of product from the U.S. to China and vice versa."" What's next for GE HealthCare? The thawing of the U.S./China trading relationship is excellent news for GE HealthCare and the Chinese healthcare system. It could also lead to investors pricing in improved assumptions for the company's earnings in 2025, which is why the stock is up today."

The leaders in this rapidly growing field are attracting significant attention. Many have produced outstanding returns over the past two years. Naturally, most investors want to cash in on this, but the biggest names in the industry tend to trade at steep premiums. It might be worth considering smaller, under-the-radar AI-focused companies that haven't performed well yet but boast significant upside potential. And some think that description fits Recursion Pharmaceuticals ( RXRX +4.43% ) , an AI-focused biotech company. The stock has attracted the attention of some of the most famous names in the investing world, including Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest. But is Recursion Pharmaceuticals really worth investing in right now after shedding 35% of its value this year? Image source: Getty Images. Bad news trumps good news Recursion Pharmaceuticals got some good news earlier this year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it would phase out animal testing in favor of other methods, including AI-based models. That fits right into the biotech's strategy. Recursion Pharmaceuticals specializes in using AI to speed up the discovery and development of novel therapies, which is an incredibly expensive and time-consuming process. If Recursion Pharmaceuticals can achieve its goal of cutting the time and money it takes to develop drugs by meaningful amounts, its stock could skyrocket over the long run. However, it isn't there yet, and in the meantime, it is facing problems leading to its share price falling. Recursion Pharmaceuticals recently released its first-quarter results, during which it announced it was streamlining its pipeline to focus on fewer candidates and deprioritizing others -- a fancy way of saying it is abandoning the development of some investigational therapies that did not look promising enough to justify the investment. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But for a company that claims it can deliver competitive medicines in less time and with less money than its peers, it's a bit worrying that it has yet to send a single product to late-stage studies and is instead forced to abandon some candidates. First, if Recursion Pharmaceuticals' AI-based algorithm is so effective at identifying promising compounds, why doesn't the company have at least one product in phase 3 clinical trials yet? Second, recent political developments threaten the company's ability to raise capital. The Trump administration cut federal funding that often trickles down to clinical-stage biotechs. These moves might make it harder for Recursion and others like it in the future. The biotech's shares recently fell due to growing fears of this outcome. Is there any hope for Recursion Pharmaceuticals? Expand NASDAQ : RXRX Recursion Pharmaceuticals Today's Change ( 4.43 %) $ 0.20 Current Price $ 4.71 Key Data Points Market Cap $2B Day's Range $ 4.46 - $ 4.77 52wk Range $ 3.79 - $ 12.36 Volume 25M Avg Vol 41M Gross Margin -16039.74 % Dividend Yield N/A A high-risk, high-reward play The company's bulls might point out a few things. First, Recursion Pharmaceuticals' AI-based operating system (OS) isn't perfect, but one of its strengths could be its network effect . Successes and failures allow the company to fine-tune its OS, making future successes more probable. So, the fact that the company recently had to give up on some programs isn't the end of the world. It might actually help improve things. Second, Recursion Pharmaceuticals has a reasonably strong cash position. It ended the first quarter with $509 million in cash and equivalents, down from the $603 million it had as of the end of 2024. The company thinks this will be enough to sustain its operations until mid-2027. It's also worth pointing out that Recursion Pharmaceuticals has partnerships with leading drugmakers, including Roche , Bayer , Merck , and Sanofi . Recursion Pharmaceuticals could get more money from these successful pharmaceutical companies , even if it is more difficult for the biotech to access funding elsewhere. That said, Recursion Pharmaceuticals remains a high-risk option. Any drugmaker without a single medicine in phase 3 studies carries above-average risk. In Recursion Pharmaceuticals' case, it has yet to release blowout phase 2 data from highly promising candidates. It also faces other headwinds, including the possibility that others will steal its modus operandi and develop better AI-based models for drug discovery, especially now that regulators are increasingly moving in that direction. If Recursion Pharmaceuticals can achieve its goals, it could deliver life-changing results, but it is just as likely (if not more) that the company will fail. That's why only those with an appetite for risk and volatility should consider initiating a small position in this stock."

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways CHICAGO – Innovations in logistics technologies took center stage at the recent DHL Media Day, held at one of its four Innovation Centers. The event put particular emphasis on how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing supply chains across industries. When it comes to the life science and health care industries, where reliability, compliance and precision are crucial, these advancements represent opportunities to enhance patient outcomes while optimizing operational efficiency. In April, DHL, a Germany-based global logistics company, announced a $2.2 billion investment over the next five years to upgrade and prioritize its logistics capabilities and footprint in the life science and health care sector. “When there is significant investment in that industry, it makes it easier to go out and find partners to help innovate,” Klaus Dohrmann, head of innovation and trend research, said at the Chicago event. “The advancements allow us to lean on our internal expertise and identify strong use cases for new innovations.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement DHL has dedicated significant resources to leverage its global network to address the specific requirements of health care products and pharmaceutical supply chains. Among 40 trends identified in DHL’s Logistics Trend Radar , AI applications emerged as particularly relevant to health care logistics. The use of AI in the life sciences supply chain addresses multiple critical areas: Enhanced safety and compliance The Protex AI partnership offers insights applicable to health care environments. While initially focused on general workplace safety, this AI-powered computer vision technology demonstrates how visual monitoring systems can identify risks and enhance compliance – critical factors in pharmaceutical and medical production facilities where maintaining sterile conditions and following strict protocols is essential. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Protex AI’s system uses computer vision and AI to analyze data and generate proactive safety events. These events can include use cases like near misses or noncompliance with procedures. The technology actively observes and assesses various parameters such as forklift speed, adherence to predefined walkways, proper use of personal protective equipment and identification of obstructed pathways. The innovation process in health care contexts Ernesto Camacho’s, senior innovation manager, overview of DHL’s five-stage innovation process provided a framework for understanding how the company evaluates and implements new technologies in specialized sectors like health care: Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Discovery: Identifying pain points in health care logistics through interviews with hospital administrators, pharmaceutical manufacturers and clinical staff. Solution identification: Scouting AI technologies with potential applications in health care supply chains. Fit assessment: Evaluating solutions against strict health care compliance requirements and ROI potential. Pilot testing: Conducting limited-scale tests in health care environments. Recommendation: Determining whether solutions meet the stringent requirements for health care deployment. This methodical approach aims to ensure that innovations address real operational challenges while meeting the high standards required in health care environments, Camacho said. Implementation challenges and change management While the potential benefits of AI in health care logistics are substantial, successful implementation must be accompanied by thoughtful change management and staff engagement according to DHL. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The importance of this people-centric approach is magnified in health care settings where clinical staff, laboratory technicians and logistics personnel must work together seamlessly. DHL’s is therefore focusing on collaborative development with technology partners to ensure that solutions are adapted to specific operational contexts rather than implemented as one-size-fits-all technologies. Asked about the innovation the team was proudest of over the past few years, Dohrmann said, “The advancement of IoT trackers: the evolution the devices have taken from more than just location and temperature to now shock notification, humidity, light exposure and CO2 emissions.” Emilia Endara, innovation engagement manager, said hers was “The network adaptability. Being able to pick up medicine outside its normal route. Having the ability to take a temperature-tracking device and know that medicine is safe for use after it leaves the safety of the controlled environment. That in addition to the colleagues on the front lines of the deliveries. The fact that so many packages can be handled without failure will always be a highlight.” The focus on sustainability, highlighted as a key trend in DHL’s research, also has particular relevance for health care logistics. Sustainability is top of mind for most countries. For example , the European Commission notes that “The European Climate Law writes into law the goal set out in the European Green Deal for Europe’s economy and society to become climate-neutral by 2050. The law also sets the intermediate target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.” As global health care and life science companies continue to move forward, sustainability has returned to the front of the conversation in a major way for the cold chain as refrigerants and coolants get phased out in favor of cleaner alternatives. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As these technologies continue to evolve, their integration into health care logistics operations will likely accelerate, driven by the dual imperatives of improving patient outcomes and controlling health care costs. DHL is pursuing a systematic approach to innovation that balances technological advancement with practical implementation, potentially providing a model for how complex organizations can successfully adopt AI within specialized supply chains.

A recent call to improve the country's deteriorating healthcare system on social media by Youth Minister Tinomuda Machakaire has sparked a national debate about whether or not the government is really in touch with what's happening on the ground in public healthcare facilities. Responding to the posts, Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of Health and Child Care, Sleiman Kwidini, told parliament that citizens are ""happy"" with the care they receive in public hospitals. ""People on social media always talk. We are doing wonders since 2018 to make sure citizens receive quality care,"" Kwidini said during a question and answer session. ""Our citizens are very happy with the service that we are giving."" Youth Minister Tinomuda Machakaire feels otherwise. In posts on X and Facebook, he called for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to intervene and provide more support to the healthcare system. ""I respectfully plead with you: Please find time in your busy schedule to visit these institutions yourself. There is no substitute for seeing, listening and understanding first-hand what our citizens are going through,"" wrote Minister of Youth Tinomuda Machakaire on X and Facebook . The posts came after Machakaire visited a relative at a public healthcare facility. ""I visited one of our public health institutions this morning to see a relative and left deeply concerned by the conditions I witnessed. What I saw was deeply moving—a clear indication that many of our people are facing serious challenges,"" said Machakaire. He added that ""the growing public outcry over our healthcare system is not an exaggeration; it reflects the difficult experiences of many citizens."" While some healthcare workers protest conditions, many choose to leave the country and seek work abroad Image: Privilege Musvanhiri/DW Citizens not satisfied with level of care Citizens who frequently use public health services have long been speaking out about the poor conditions in hospitals. Lisa Chindeya, a Harare resident who frequently visits Parirenyatwa Hospital, Zimbabwe's biggest referral facility, is not happy with the care she and her family have received. Her sister has cancer and has experienced kidney failure. As a result, she frequently visits the hospital for dialysis treatment. ""It makes me very emotional to narrate the ordeal we go through trying to get radio and chemotherapy sessions,"" Chindeya told DW. She adds that patients sometimes have to buy their own supplies and that the conditions inside the hospital are far from ideal. ""We have to wait for hours and sometimes days to get treatment. There is often one working radiotherapy machine that has to serve patients coming from different corners of the country,"" laments Chindeya. President Mnangagwa's administration says the public healthcare system is doing just fine Image: Tsvangirayi Mukwazh/AP Photo/picture alliance Lack of public funding Zimbabwe's healthcare system has faced serious challenges due to years of neglect, brain drain as healthcare professionals move abroad and lack of adequate equipment. Experts say the country's health sector needs more funding. ""The health sector allocation stands at 10.2% of the total projected public health spending in 2025, a decline from the 10.6% in 2024,"" Itai Rusike executive director of the Community Working Group on Health in Zimbabwe told DW. Such inadequate public financing for public healthcare has resulted in a poorly run and underperforming health system that relies too much on outside funding from international organizations, including United Nations agencies , the European Union and others. In 2001, African Union (AU) member states signed the Abuja Declaration, pledging to allocate at least 15% of their national budgets each year to improving their healthcare systems. ""The Abuja target of 15% allocation of national budget to health has remained an elusive target for Zimbabwe ,"" said Rusike, adding that the target is now outdated given the population increase and growing disease outbreaks .

Some citizens, like Linda Masarira, are still pushing for change. Masarira, a political activist and leader of the Labour Economists and Afrikan Democrats (LEAD) has been busy collecting signatures for a recent petition she launched to appeal to the country's president to intervene. ""More than 60% of Zimbabweans are dying prematurely due to lack of access to basic healthcare. This petition is a call to action demanding that the government of Zimbabwe make basic healthcare accessible to all,"" Masarira told DW. ""If we don't speak up now, we risk losing more lives to preventable causes,"" she added. Zimbabwean girls lobby for free period products To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to local media reports, the Zimbabwean government has stopped over 4,000 local nurses from taking jobs in foreign countries to prevent further strain on the already fragile public healthcare system. Professional health workers have been pushed to seek better opportunities abroad due to low wages, poor working conditions and limited career growth in Zimbabwe. The country has been losing healthcare professionals to countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. On average, a qualified nurse in Zimbabwe earns only $255 (€226) per month after taxes. The Zimbabwe Nurses Association estimates that the minimum living wage should be $840 (€744) per month. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more 4,600 public sector health workers have left the country since 2019. The exodus has put pressure on the already understaffed healthcare system. Many nurses are leaving the country due to the poor conditions and salaries in public hospitals Image: Tafadzwa Ufumeli/Getty Images ""Healthcare workers are supposed to work in teams and not in isolation. At central hospitals there used to be multidisciplinary teams, registrars, a nursing team, physiotherapists, nutritionists and other roles. But currently, it may just be one doctor and few nurses,"" said Rusike. ""The workload becomes unmanageable, and each shift is taxing. This has resulted in burnout,"" Rusike added. In an attempt to stop public sector healthcare professionals from leaving, the government has reportedly resorted to withholding verification letters that thousands of nurses and doctors need to secure jobs abroad. The letters confirm health workers' qualifications and local media has reported that despite paying, they still hadn't received their documents. Zimbabwe was placed on the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Health Workforce Support and Safeguards List which includes 55 countries that face significant health workforce challenges. As a result, some countries, like the UK, have stopped actively recruiting healthcare workers from Zimbabwe. The article was edited by Sarah Hucal. Advertisement"

(Dreamstime/TNS) By Cynthia Romero | Guest Columnist PUBLISHED: May 8, 2025 at 6:05 PM EDT | UPDATED: May 8, 2025 at 6:20 PM EDT The commonwealth of Virginia is confronting two big challenges with a common solution. We need more health care professionals to care for a growing and aging population, and we need more family-sustaining career opportunities that lift Virginians into the middle class. The solution to both is a reimagined approach to health care workforce development that trains and prepares the next generation of health care professionals while creating the kind of well-paying careers that provide stability for families and entire communities. At Claude Moore Opportunities, where I recently joined the board of directors, we are reimagining health care workforce development not as a simple pipeline where a worker moves from Point A to Point B, but as a highway with on and off ramps that create flexible opportunities for advancement and work throughout a person’s career. My own family’s story is a testament to the power of a health care career in helping more Virginians live healthy lives and achieve the American dream. I am the proud daughter of Filipino immigrants who moved to Hampton Roads to pursue a better life for their children. My mother and I were fortunate to pursue careers as physicians, operating a family medicine practice in Hampton Roads for 16 years with my father as our office manager. We hired dozens of health care professionals, many at the beginning of their careers, and saw how a health care career can provide stability and opportunity for families in Hampton Roads. As I have continued along my own health care highway into education, health care administration and community health, I have watched the demand for health care workers far outpace the supply, and the problem is only getting worse. Here in Hampton Roads, the Old Dominion University Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy projects that our region will face a shortfall of 139 new nurses every year until 2031. The George Mason University Center for Health Workforce projects that Virginia will face similar shortfalls in other critical health care fields such as lab techs, pharmacy techs and behavioral health counselors. This current and looming health care workforce shortage could have significant repercussions for the well-being of our citizens and for Virginia’s economy. No single government agency, university, nonprofit or hospital system can solve this problem alone. The solution will require coordination, cooperation, trust and resources. Fortunately, there is a growing coalition of educational enterprises, public sector, private sector and nonprofit partners such as Claude Moore Opportunities working together to get ahead of this challenge. The key to success will be the embrace of an employer-engaged, community-coordinated health care workforce development model with multiple points of entry and exit for workers at any stage of their career. To support this important work, Claude Moore is serving as a convener of and investor in regional, multidisciplinary partnerships, including in Hampton Roads, which bring together major employers, academic institutions and workforce development professionals to build a larger, more skilled, better credentialed health care workforce. Sign up for Viewpoints, an opinion newsletter As we expand our efforts statewide, I am proud to add the voice and experience of Hampton Roads to this exciting new venture. For example, I believe the health care highway model offers exciting opportunities to reexamine the connections between military and civilian medical training to help our region’s veterans and military families pursue careers in health care. Right now, Virginia has a rare opportunity to address a known challenge before it becomes a crisis. If we tackle this challenge in a cooperative, coordinated way, we can make Hampton Roads and the entire commonwealth of Virginia a healthier, more prosperous place to call home. Cynthia Romero, M.D. is a Hampton Roads native who serves on the board of directors of Claude Moore Opportunities, a Virginia health care workforce non-profit. She previously served as Virginia Health Commissioner and in statewide and regional leadership roles for hospital systems, health care associations and nonprofit organizations.

The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $652.5 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.45 per share was significantly above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy AMN Healthcare Services? Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free . AMN Healthcare Services (AMN) Q1 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $689.5 million vs analyst estimates of $670.1 million (16% year-on-year decline, 2.9% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.45 vs analyst estimates of $0.21 (significant beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $64.2 million vs analyst estimates of $53.21 million (9.3% margin, 20.6% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2025 is $652.5 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Operating Margin: 1.8%, down from 4.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 13.4%, up from 7.7% in the same quarter last year Sales Volumes fell 22.1% year on year (-23.8% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $749.1 million “Our financial results for the first three months of 2025 yielded positive upside in revenue and operating leverage. We are benefiting from growth in our clients' patient volumes, continued normalization in our industry, and market adoption of our tech-enabled talent solutions,” said Cary Grace, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. Company Overview With a network of thousands of healthcare professionals ranging from nurses to physicians to executives, AMN Healthcare ( NYSE: AMN ) provides healthcare workforce solutions including temporary staffing, permanent placement, and technology platforms for hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States. Sales Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, AMN Healthcare Services grew its sales at a mediocre 4.5% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. AMN Healthcare Services’s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 23% annually. AMN Healthcare Services also reports its number of travelers on assignment, which reached 8,981 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, AMN Healthcare Services’s travelers on assignment averaged 21.7% year-on-year declines. Because this number is in line with its revenue growth, we can see the company kept its prices fairly consistent. This quarter, AMN Healthcare Services’s revenue fell by 16% year on year to $689.5 million but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 2.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 11.9% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 7.6% over the next 12 months. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend, it's tough to feel optimistic about a company facing demand difficulties. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link . Operating Margin Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. AMN Healthcare Services was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 8% was weak for a healthcare business. Looking at the trend in its profitability, AMN Healthcare Services’s operating margin decreased by 12.7 percentage points over the last five years. This performance was caused by more recent speed bumps as the company’s margin fell by 16.3 percentage points on a two-year basis. We’re disappointed in these results because it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn’t pass those costs onto its customers. This quarter, AMN Healthcare Services generated an operating profit margin of 1.8%, down 3.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for AMN Healthcare Services, its EPS declined by 2.8% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.5%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes. Diving into the nuances of AMN Healthcare Services’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, AMN Healthcare Services’s operating margin declined by 12.7 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q1, AMN Healthcare Services reported EPS at $0.45, down from $0.97 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AMN Healthcare Services’s full-year EPS of $2.79 to shrink by 56.4%. Key Takeaways from AMN Healthcare Services’s Q1 Results We were impressed by how significantly AMN Healthcare Services blew past analysts’ revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 12.3% to $22.80 immediately after reporting. AMN Healthcare Services may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The global home healthcare market size is expected to reach USD 747.70 billion by 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research, Inc., expanding at a CAGR of 10.21% from 2025 to 2030. This growth can be attributed to cost-efficiency, improved patient outcomes, and convenience offered by home healthcare agencies. In addition, the rising geriatric population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, dementia, and orthopedic conditions, are expected to drive market growth. As per the Population Reference Bureau data updated in June 2019, the number of people aged 65 years and above was 52 million in 2018 and is projected to double by 2060 to reach 95 million. The World Health Organization (WHO) statistics state that there are around 50 million dementia patients in the world with 10 million new cases getting added every year. This number is expected to reach 82 million by 2030. The establishment and maintenance of hospitals and other healthcare establishments are capital-intensive efforts. Hence, healthcare solution providers are now entering the rapidly growing market in an attempt to capitalize on the available opportunities and contain costs. Although hospital-at-home models are less prevalent in the U.S. than they are in other countries, several noteworthy initiatives have been undertaken in the past decade. These include programs at Johns Hopkins, Marshfield Clinic Health System, and Mount Sinai, which partnered with PE-backed Contessa in 2016. Moreover, these organizations engage extensively in mergers and acquisitions to expand their regional presence. Hospitals such as Apollo (Apollo Homecare) and Max (Max@Home) have entered the Indian homecare industry. Some have also established joint ventures, including the Burman family (promoters of Dabur) and UK-based Healthcare at Home, as well as India Home Healthcare and Bayada Home Healthcare, based in the U.S. Request a free sample copy or view report summary: Home Healthcare Market The demand for home care services is expected to increase in the immediate future, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These services are safer and cost-effective alternatives to hospital services. External substitutes, including hospitals, informal care, and other healthcare establishments, pose a limited threat, mostly due to their high costs. Thus, the threat of substitutes in the market is expected to be moderate during the forecast period. Home Healthcare Market Report Highlights: Based on components, the service segment dominated the market with the largest revenue share of 84.1% in 2024. Based on indication, the neurological & mental disorder segment dominated the market with the largest revenue share of 16.75% in 2024 owing to increasing disease prevalence.

This growth can be attributed to cost-efficiency, improved patient outcomes, and convenience offered by home healthcare agencies. In addition, the rising geriatric population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, dementia, and orthopedic conditions, are expected to drive market growth. As per the Population Reference Bureau data updated in June 2019 , the number of people aged 65 years and above was 52 million in 2018 and is projected to double by 2060 to reach 95 million. The World Health Organization (WHO) statistics state that there are around 50 million dementia patients in the world with 10 million new cases getting added every year. This number is expected to reach 82 million by 2030. The establishment and maintenance of hospitals and other healthcare establishments are capital-intensive efforts. Hence, healthcare solution providers are now entering the rapidly growing market in an attempt to capitalize on the available opportunities and contain costs. Although hospital-at-home models are less prevalent in the U.S. than they are in other countries, several noteworthy initiatives have been undertaken in the past decade. These include programs at Johns Hopkins , Marshfield Clinic Health System, and Mount Sinai, which partnered with PE-backed Contessa in 2016. Moreover, these organizations engage extensively in mergers and acquisitions to expand their regional presence. Hospitals such as Apollo ( Apollo Homecare ) and Max (Max@Home) have entered the Indian homecare industry. Some have also established joint ventures, including the Burman family (promoters of Dabur) and UK-based Healthcare at Home, as well as India Home Healthcare and Bayada Home Healthcare, based in the U.S. Request a free sample copy or view report summary: Home Healthcare Market The demand for home care services is expected to increase in the immediate future, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These services are safer and cost-effective alternatives to hospital services. External substitutes, including hospitals, informal care, and other healthcare establishments, pose a limited threat, mostly due to their high costs. Thus, the threat of substitutes in the market is expected to be moderate during the forecast period. Home Healthcare Market Report Highlights: Based on components, the service segment dominated the market with the largest revenue share of 84.1% in 2024. Based on indication, the neurological & mental disorder segment dominated the market with the largest revenue share of 16.75% in 2024 owing to increasing disease prevalence.

Maryland’s system, unusual among states, gives the state significant say over the costs of health care services across different coverage plans to keep costs low and consistent. The state hopes to have a similar authority as it transitions into a federal program called the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But advocates worry that the feds’ apparent interest in changing who sets Medicare rates could disrupt health care payments for consumers, governments and providers. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) told reporters this week that he was “cautiously concerned” about the future of Maryland’s health care system while those negotiations continue between federal and state health officials. “I don’t want to over-index anything … There’s reason to be concerned that there are going to be substantial changes,” he said. The state’s ability to set Medicare rates has been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. Congressional budget agency projects sweeping Medicaid cutbacks in states under GOP plans But the current iteration of that payment system, called Total Cost of Care, is set to end in December 2025. Last November, Maryland entered into an agreement with the Biden administration to continue under the similar AHEAD system. The AHEAD model was actually based on Maryland’s Total Cost of Care model and similar systems in other states, due to its success in reducing health care costs. But the Trump administration is now talking about taking another look at that arrangement and possibly making some changes. Specifically, federal officials are interested in removing Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services While current talks focus on Medicare rates, there could be ripple effects on rates for Medicaid and private insurance due to the state’s all-payer model that aims to keep costs for health care consistent across the board, according to health care advocates. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees CMMI, did not confirm whether the Trump administration plans to end Maryland’s rate-setting authority for Medicare, but reiterated that “subject to discussions with State authorities,” the AHEAD model is currently set to begin in January 2026. Maryland Health Secretary Dr. Meena Seshamani, a former CMS official in the Biden administration, said that those discussions are ongoing. “Since the change in federal administration, the Maryland Department of Health has been in direct discussions about the future of the model, working with CMMI and in-state stakeholders to align the Maryland model with federal priorities to deliver high-quality outcomes for all Marylanders,” Seshamani said Wednesday. “The administration will not comment further, given that discussions are ongoing and confidential.” There may be opportunities where CMMI and the state can find common ground over shared goals like preventing and reducing chronic disease, experts say, though it is unclear where negotiations will land at this moment. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, believes it is not time to panic, and that there is still opportunity for the state and the Trump administration to “meet in the middle” — even if CMMI officials signal interest in changing the rate-setting process for Medicare. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE And despite his “cautious concern,” Ferguson said he hopes that any changes that come down on the state’s current health care plan will still help lower health care costs for Marylanders while pushing for greater quality of care. “There could be changes that don’t have a dramatic impact on the financial stability of our marketplace for health care,” he said. “I am hopeful that those in charge of CMS and CMMI will see the benefit that the Maryland model has provided for lowering costs over time,” he said, noting that there may be “important updates” in the next few weeks.

Priyamvada C , Jessica Jani Updated 8 May 2025, 11:13 AM IST Yashish Dahiya, cofounder and chief executive of PB Fintech, is leading the healthcare venture. Policybazaar promoter Yashish Dahiya's healthcare venture on Thursday said it has raised $218 million in seed capital at a valuation of $243 million. While Policybazaar parent PB Fintech invested $62 million for a 26% stake in PB Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd, General Catalyst infused $50 million for 20.57%. The names of other investors could not be ascertained. Incorporated on 1 January 2025, the Gurugram-based healthcare firm will use the proceeds to set up a 1,000-bed hospital network in the National Capital Region and accelerate product development and technological innovation. Also Read: GIC-backed Asia Healthcare Holdings to acquire Dr Dangs Labs This is part of the startup's broader aim to build an end-to-end platform that integrates healthcare and insurance. To be clear, PB Healthcare is a separate entity from listed PB Fintech, which owns Policybazaar and Paisabazaar. Though Yashish Dahiya, chairman and group chief executive of PB Fintech, is leading the venture, PB Fintech’s role will be that of an incubator and not a long-term owner. In 2024, Dahiya revealed his plans to enter the healthcare space through a one-time investment of up to $100 million for a 20-30% stake. He explained the new healthcare entity will eventually generate its own resources for growth and may attract investments from private equity firms and other financial institutions.

Our focus remains on building a tech-first healthcare platform that improves outcomes, enhances trust, and redefines the care journey for millions across India,” said Dahiya. The company will improve long-term health outcomes, reduce avoidable surgeries, and deliver a more predictable, full-stack patient experience by operating its own hospitals, and leveraging technology, analytics, and a preventive-care approach, PB Healthcare said in the statement. Also Read: Healthcare for all: Don’t rely on insurance alone The hospital sector has been seeing significant traction, with a boom in private equity interest, single-speciality chains growing, and leading hospitals in expansion mode. According to Crisil Ratings, private hospitals in India plan to add approximately 10,000 beds over the current and next fiscal years, backed by investments of around ₹ 25,000 crore. This surge is driven by high occupancy rates nearing 70% and increased demand for quality healthcare services. Top hospital chains are investing heavily in expanding bed capacity. Apollo Hospital has announced plans to add over 3,500 beds across cities like Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Delhi over the next 3-4 years. Max Healthcare plans to add 3,700 beds across key locations in India by 2028, with an investment of ₹ 6,000 crore. Fortis Healthcare is adding 2,200 beds over the next three years, and Aster DM Healthcare has a plan to add 1,500 beds by FY27. “The Indian healthcare services sector is seeing a lot of growing interest given the largely unorganised space and growing demand…there’s a lot of room to grow…additionally this is a business that is purely domestic and insulated from geopolitical shifts, making it an attractive bet for investors,” an industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Mint . Icra estimates that hospitals in its sample set will see revenue growth of 12-14% in FY25. Improving operating leverage, along with continued cost optimisation and digitisation measures, will support a healthy operating profit margin of about 22-23%, the rating agency said. Narayana Hrudalaya launched its own insurance arm in 2024. Its subsidiary Narayana Health Insurance Ltd received a license from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to operate as a standalone health insurance company in January 2024. The firm’s Aditi Plan which offers coverage of ₹ 1 crore for surgeries and ₹ 5 lakh for medical management, with an annual premium of ₹ 10,000, aimed at families, and its Arya Health Plans, launched earlier this year, provide coverage options ranging from ₹ 25 lakh to ₹ 1 crore, with flexible top-up options starting at ₹ 25,000, combining hospitalisation and outpatient benefits.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.74 per share was 7.6% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Amphastar Pharmaceuticals? Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free . Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) Q1 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $170.5 million vs analyst estimates of $173.9 million (flat year on year, 2% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.74 vs analyst estimates of $0.69 (7.6% beat) Operating Margin: 21.9%, down from 27.9% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $1.16 billion Company Overview Founded in 1996 and known for its expertise in complex drug formulations, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ: AMPH ) develops and manufactures technically challenging injectable and inhalation medications, including both generic and proprietary pharmaceutical products. Sales Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals grew its sales at an impressive 17.4% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s annualized revenue growth of 18.7% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. This quarter, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.8% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $170.5 million of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health. Today’s young investors won’t have read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Amphastar Pharmaceuticals has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average operating margin of 22.6%. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin rose by 22.9 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage. Zooming in on its more recent performance, we can see the company’s trajectory is intact as its margin has also increased by 3.6 percentage points on a two-year basis. In Q1, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals generated an operating profit margin of 21.9%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s EPS grew at an astounding 60.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 17.4% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Diving into the nuances of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 22.9 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also shrank by 1.3%, and these factors together are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth. In Q1, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals reported EPS at $0.74, down from $1.04 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts’ estimates by 7.6%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s full-year EPS of $3.56 to shrink by 7.3%. Key Takeaways from Amphastar Pharmaceuticals’s Q1 Results It was encouraging to see Amphastar Pharmaceuticals beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue missed. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 1.7% to $24 immediately following the results. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now? If you’re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free ."

Speaking to Gulf Times, al-Mansoori expressed confidence in Qatar’s capabilities, highlighting its status as having one of the world’s best healthcare systems and the presence of “very advanced hospitals”. He also stressed that Hamad Hospital stands out in the region. “Healthcare is an important pillar in Qatar’s vision 2030, so we need to be supporting this vision by bringing the best to the Qatar market,” he said, citing the recent introduction of innovative treatments, such as the recently launched obesity drug Wegovy. This, he pointed out, forms part of Aamal’s aim of providing the best in healthcare for the people of Qatar. “We look at healthcare not only as a trading or for making profit but it is the service and social responsibility of Aamal for its community,” al-Mansoori said. He added that partnerships with international pharmaceutical leaders such as Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy, are crucial not just for accessing new medicines but also for knowledge transfer. Wegovy’s launch, a weight management therapy already attracting global attention, adds to the portfolio of advanced healthcare offerings available in Qatar, it is learnt. Al-Mansoori said that Aamal’s commitment extends beyond providing medication, but to include public health awareness and prevention. He said the company actively works to educate its staff and the wider community about these diseases, viewing such efforts as fundamental, pre-medical steps that underline the importance of lifestyle and dietary choices. He said the noticeable increase in general tourism, demonstrated by reports of a crowded airport, also shows that Qatar’s tourism authorities are successfully working on all fronts to attract more visitors and diversify the nation’s economy."

Caroline Farrington , Jessica Robinson Hanna , Lindsey Johnson , Joseph Liss , Rianna Modi , Jeffrey Schneider Hogan Lovells + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: On May 6, 2025, Indiana state enacted HB 1666 , which modifies Indiana’s existing transaction law to exempt certain practitioner-owned practices, grants the Attorney General additional authority to investigate health care entity market concentration, and requires health care entities to report ownership information. Earlier versions of the bill would have substantially revamped the existing state transaction clearance regime (IC § 25-1-8.5-4 ), but these changes were omitted in the final version of the legislation. It will be important to continue to monitor Indiana, as the legislature may make another run at enacting more significant reforms with respect to the state’s clearance regime next year. HB 1666 will take effect in part on July 1, 2025, and in part on January 1, 2026, as described below. Changes to the existing state transaction notice law Indiana’s current state transaction law (enacted effective July 1, 2024) requires “health care entities,” which is broadly defined to include insurers, PBMs, private equity partnerships, and “any organization or business that provides diagnostic, medical, surgical, dental treatment or rehabilitative care” that is “involved in” a merger or acquisition with another health care entity, with total assets taken between the parties of $10M, to report the transaction to the Attorney General at least 90 days prior to closing. IC § 25-1-8.5-1 et seq . The law does not give the Attorney General explicit authority to disapprove a transaction, but permits the Attorney General to issue a civil investigative demand if, based on its initial review of a health care entity’s notice, it has concerns about the transaction. In practice, the Attorney General has been granting “notices of no further action” upon completing review of a transaction, even though such clearance is not explicitly contemplated in the statute. Effective July 1, 2025, HB 1666 exempts from the transaction notice law a health care provider that is majority owned (or would be majority owned after the majority or acquisition) by Indiana-licensed health care practitioners who routinely furnish health care services in the practitioner-owned practice. See HB 1666 § 9. The state’s transaction notice law is otherwise unchanged. Among other things, prior versions of the legislation would have made transactions between health care entities explicitly subject to “approval of the attorney general,” or created a “health care entity merger approval board” to “evaluate” and “approve or deny” proposed transactions. This language was ultimately dropped from the bill. Market concentration investigations Effective July 1, 2025, HB 1666 authorizes the Indiana Attorney General to, at any time, “investigate the market concentration of a health care entity,” including by issuing a civil investigative demand to that entity. HB 1666 § 10. As noted above, under existing law, the Attorney General may issue a civil investigative demand when a health care entity submits a transaction notice or, more broadly, when “the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that a person may” possess evidence “relevant to an investigation” regarding any “statute enforced by the attorney general” or to criminal violations. See IC §§ 25-1-8.5-4 (e), 4-6-3-3 . Therefore, it is unclear how meaningfully this expands the Attorney General’s existing authority to investigate health care antitrust matters. New ownership reporting requirements HB 1666 establishes a number of new reporting requirements for health care entities: Hospitals . Effective July 1, 2025, HB 1666 requires hospitals to include ownership information in annual reports already submitted to the state under IC § 16-21-6-3 , which generally cover detailed financial and billing information. Newly required information includes names, business addresses, and ownership stakes for each person or entity with either an ownership of 5% or more , each practitioner of the hospital with any ownership interest, any person or entity with controlling interest , or any person or entity with interest as a private equity partner . HB 1666 § 5. The report must specify the ownership stake held by each person or entity, and for each person or entity, provide a business address, business website, and if applicable, National Provider Identifier (NPI) number, Taxpayer ID, Employer Identification Number (EIN), Medicare provider number, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) identification number. Under existing law, the penalty for a hospital which fails to provide the report by the date required is $1,000 per day the report is overdue. See IC § 16-21-6-3 (c). Health care entities . HB 1666 establishes a new reporting requirement for “each health care entity that does business in Indiana.” For this purpose, “health care entity” means “any organization or business that provides health care services,” aside from hospitals, insurers, PBMs, TPAs, and entities that do not accept commercial health insurance reimbursement. HB 1666 § 6. “Health care services” is broadly defined to include diagnostic, medical, surgical, dental, or rehabilitative care for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing, or healing human illness or injury. Effective January 1, 2026, in-scope health care entities must submit on a biennial basis the same information outlined above for hospitals, as well as information regarding whether the health care entity is a Medicaid provider, and if so, if it “accepted Medicaid recipients during a majority of the preceding two years.” HB 1666 §§ 7, 8. HB 1666 does not establish a fine for non-compliance, but existing Indiana law permits a person “aggrieved” to “petition” a court to force the filing and imposes penalties for false filings. See IC §§ 23-0.5-2-9 (a), 23-0.5-2-10 . Insurers, TPAs, and PBMs . Finally, beginning July 1, 2025 (and annually thereafter), HB 1666 requires various health insurers (including HMOs), TPAs, and PBMs to report to the Indiana Department of Insurance (“IDOI”) the same information as outlined above for hospitals. Further, HB 1666 authorizes IDOI to provide this information to the Department of Health. IDOI would also be permitted to assess a fine of $1,000 per day on such insurers for each day their report is past due or to take disciplinary action for repeated violations.

U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue was $68.3 billion, due to overall market growth primarily driven by unit volume growth, including increased sales of products labeled for diabetes and/or weight loss in the GLP-1 class and specialty products to physician practices and health systems. The company reported adjusted EPS of $4.42, up 16.3% year over year, beating the consensus of $4.11 . Adjusted gross profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.9 billion, a 15.2% year-over-year increase, due to the increase in gross profit in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, offset in part by the decrease in gross profit in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Also Read: Walgreens Cashes In: Slashes Cencora Stake Again In Debt-Fighting Move Adjusted gross profit margin was 3.86%, an increase of 16 basis points. Adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, a 15.3% increase, driven by an increase in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, partially offset by a decrease in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Margin was 1.58% in the fiscal 2025 second quarter, an increase of seven basis points when compared to the prior year quarter. Guidance: Cencora updated its fiscal year 2025 financial guidance to reflect stronger earnings growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and a lower contribution from the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Cencora expects adjusted diluted EPS of $15.70-$15.95, up from prior guidance of $15.30-$15.60, compared to the consensus of $15.46. International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth to be in the range of 3%-4%, down from the previous range of 4%-5%.

Despite a change in provincial government almost two years ago, the Manitoba Nurses Union says its members are still encountering the same broken health-care system shift after shift and that they are feeling disappointed and frustrated with the lack of progress. President Darlene Jackson told 680 CJOB’s The Start that wait times are up and workplace violence is increasing, turning many nurses away from the profession. “There’s probably not a shift in the last year that there hasn’t been violence in some facility, or probably all facilities, some type of violence … and that is massive. “Nurses are leaving because of it. I had one nurse that said to me, ‘I loved my job at the Health Sciences Centre, but I’m not putting my life at risk to go to work.'” Story continues below advertisement Jackson said promises made by the NDP government have, so far, seemed empty, and nurses are growing more frustrated as morale continues to deteriorate. “We are still seeing nurses working short with the incredibly heavy workloads — mandated overtime and tons of voluntary overtime is still a thing,” she said.

They rose again this year. Nurses are frustrated because we truly hoped that we would see some big differences in health care based on the promises and we’re just not seeing that.” Jackson, who has been a nurse since 1981, told The Start the state of health care in the province is now worse than it was in the 1990s when nurses went on strike. While the MNU says it would give the province’s current health care situation a D-minus grade, a spokesperson for Doctors Manitoba said that organization has a slightly more positive view. 10:01 Nurses union bemoans lack of health-care progress in Manitoba Trending Now U.S. trade policy is ‘radically different’ now, Carney says B.C. ostrich cull started a ‘new kind of war’ after birds gunned down, family says “Looking at the evidence we have on health care, and considering there was a pandemic and years of disruption and underfunding, Doctors Manitoba would grade the progress of the last 18 months as a B-minus — improvement still needed, but on the right track,” they said in a statement.

Improvement has been seen, however, as far as recruitment to turn around the doctor shortage and wait-time improvements in certain areas. “There’s still a lot that as to get better, but it’s safe to say Manitoba is on the right track when it comes to improving health care,” the statement said.

Mind of the Writer Blog of Wednesday, 7 May 2025 Source: Etsey Atisu 2025 Ghana Wellness and Healthcare Awards announced Comments (0) Share: Albony Global Communications is thrilled to announce the much-anticipated second edition of the Ghana Wellness and Healthcare Awards, scheduled for 23rd August 2025. This year’s ceremony is held under the theme: “The Role of the Wellness and Healthcare Sector in Ghana’s Socioeconomic Development.” It is a timely reminder of the nation’s urgent need to strengthen and celebrate the pillars of wellness and healthcare as a critical foundation for a more prosperous and resilient Ghana. The awards are grounded in a compelling mission: to identify, recognise, celebrate and promote excellence and innovative initiatives, individuals and teams in the Wellness and Healthcare Sector of Ghana. This mission directly responds to a growing crisis; Ghana’s health and wellness professionals are increasingly migrating in search of greener pastures, due to a long-standing culture of limited motivation, underappreciation, and lack of national recognition. This event challenges that narrative. By spotlighting exceptional practitioners and visionary efforts, the Ghana Wellness and Healthcare Awards not only raises the bar for excellence, it also fuels national pride and restores value to a sector often overlooked. Guided by a bold vision; A healthy and wealthy Ghana for all, the 2025 edition brings together policy makers, healthcare professionals, entrepreneurs, wellness advocates, and the media to catalyze a national conversation on how wellness and healthcare institutions, personnel and practice, directly influences Ghana’s socioeconomic growth. The event is led by Founder, Mr. OB Sinachy, Co-founder, Dr. Alberta Ama Atta Ackon, and Project Chair, Madam Vivian Awinne; visionaries with a shared passion for advancing health equity and wellbeing across the country. Call for Nominations and Participation Nominations are now officially open! Individuals and organisations across the country are encouraged to visit the official website to nominate deserving professionals, teams, and initiatives that are driving innovation and impact in the health and wellness space.

Maham Fatima May 5, 2025 5 min read GE We recently published a list of the 11 Hidden AI Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) stands against other hidden AI stocks. David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management, joined CNBC on May 1 to discuss the AI-driven demand for data centers and tariff uncertainty. The main concerns regarding tariffs are the potential impact on costs, the resilience of supply chains, and the overall effect on business operations and their expansion. He also shared his perspective on why investors are still confident in the broadband and digital infrastructure sector. He characterized broadband as universally essential and emphasised that the demand for faster connectivity has not slowed, which is why the regulatory support for broadband expansion is globally robust. Grain noted that the administration has also met expectations for lighter regulation in the infrastructure sector, which makes it easier to advance projects and close deals. He described the admin’s stance as pro-growth and supportive of secure and competitive networks. Grain also observed that infrastructure, especially broadband, is an area where there is bipartisan support, given its positive impact on economic growth at both the state and local levels. DeepSeek’s announcement was also followed by reports that suggested that some companies might be pulling back on data center spending. However, the latest earnings reports appeared to settle at least this debate and confirmed that the investments in this sector were still ongoing. David Grain elaborated on the current trends in data center investments and also stated that the demand for data centers is rising due to the increasing expansion of AI, as it requires vast amounts of computing power. He explained that while the demand here is not slowing, the feasibility of building new data centers is still influenced by the availability of reliable and high-capacity electricity. Our Methodology We sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top hidden AI stocks with AI-related operations and opportunities. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( s ee more details here ). Story Continues Is GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) a Hidden AI Stock to Buy Right Now? A radiologist in a lab examining a computed tomography scan of a patient. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: GEHC ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) manufactures and markets products, services, and digital solutions for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients. It operates through four segments. The company also provides new-age medical technology, cloud-first AI-enabled solutions, and data analytics services. In Q1 2025, the company’s AVS (Advanced Visualization Solutions) segment reported revenue growth of 3% year-over-year, with particularly strong performance in the US. This growth, while currently a smaller portion of the overall $4.8 billion revenue, is important as GE HealthCare’s product roadmap for AVS is increasingly centered on accelerating recurring revenue through digital and AI-powered solutions across its ultrasound and Interventional Guided Therapy product portfolios. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) is actively investing in R&D within the AVS segment to further advance its AI capabilities. On January 8, Jefferies analysts recently raised the stock’s rating from Hold to Buy due to a bullish outlook for the company. The analysts emphasized GE HealthCare’s ability to acquire market share in diagnostic imaging and prenatal diagnostics, which Jefferies regarded as increasing and under-modeled for future development. Oakmark Fund stated the following regarding GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : “GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a leading global medical technology company that was spun off from General Electric in January 2023. As a standalone company, we expect GE HealthCare to benefit from increased focus, better aligned management and incentives, and an improved corporate culture. We believe these changes will help drive higher margins and organic growth. In addition, we think GE HealthCare is well-positioned to capitalize on technology trends as a greater portion of the value proposition comes from AI-enabled software and a shift toward precision care. A lack of appreciation for the company’s self-help potential coupled with short-term concerns around weak demand in China provided us with the opportunity to purchase shares at a low valuation relative to other high-quality medical technology companies and at the lowest price relative to the S&P 500 since the IPO.” Overall, GEHC ranks 4th on our list of the hidden AI stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of GEHC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock .

Company Overview Originally founded in 2003 and now headquartered in Ireland following a 2012 tax inversion merger, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQGS:JAZZ) develops and markets medicines for sleep disorders, epilepsy, and cancer, with a focus on treatments for patients with limited therapeutic options. Sales Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s sales grew at a solid 13.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 4.3% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. This quarter, Jazz Pharmaceuticals missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.5% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $897.8 million of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.4% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is above average for the sector and implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Jazz Pharmaceuticals has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 11%, higher than the broader healthcare sector. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin decreased by 15.3 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 15.3 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see Jazz Pharmaceuticals become more profitable in the future. This quarter, Jazz Pharmaceuticals generated an operating profit margin of negative 6.2%, down 13.6 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s EPS grew at a remarkable 9.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 13.2% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. We can take a deeper look into Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin declined by 15.3 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 9%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. In Q1, Jazz Pharmaceuticals reported EPS at $1.68, down from $2.68 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates, but we care more about long-term EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s full-year EPS of $20.19 to grow 15.8%. Key Takeaways from Jazz Pharmaceuticals’s Q1 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results as it lowered its full-year EPS guidance and missed on revenue and EPS. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 3.2% to $107.50 immediately following the results. Jazz Pharmaceuticals didn’t show it’s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now? We think that the latest quarter is only one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Company Overview With a diverse portfolio of eight FDA-approved medications targeting neurological conditions, Supernus Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ: SUPN ) develops and markets treatments for central nervous system disorders including epilepsy, ADHD, Parkinson's disease, and migraine. Sales Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s sales grew at a decent 10.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. Supernus Pharmaceuticals also breaks out the revenue for its most important segment, . Over the last two years, Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s revenue was flat. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company’s performance. This quarter, Supernus Pharmaceuticals reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 4.3% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 5.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

Looking at the trend in its profitability, Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin decreased by 17.2 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 3.8 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see Supernus Pharmaceuticals become more profitable in the future. This quarter, Supernus Pharmaceuticals generated an operating profit margin of negative 6.8%, down 4.7 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Sadly for Supernus Pharmaceuticals, its EPS declined by 12.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 10.7%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Diving into the nuances of Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s operating margin declined by 17.2 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 4.3%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. In Q1, Supernus Pharmaceuticals reported EPS at negative $0.21, down from $0 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data. Key Takeaways from Supernus Pharmaceuticals’s Q1 Results It was good to see Supernus Pharmaceuticals narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed significantly and its full-year revenue guidance fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock remained flat at $32.20 immediately following the results. Supernus Pharmaceuticals didn’t show it’s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Federal discussions on cuts include work requirements, risking $500 million in federal funding for Utah. Speakers stressed Medicaid's role for low-income families, elderly and disabled in Utah. SALT LAKE CITY — The Protect Medicaid Utah coalition launched its new organization focused on maintaining Medicaid coverage on Tuesday. The group has members all over Utah who seek to share stories about why Medicaid is important. In 2018, Utah voters expanded Medicaid coverage to thousands of low-income and other individuals and families in the state. The changes made under the Affordable Care Act significantly reduced the number of uninsured people, resulting in economic benefits and better health care for low-income families. More recently, the federal government has been discussing potential cuts to the Medicaid program, the most significant of which is a work requirement. This would require all recipients to prove completion of 48 job applications to access treatments that would otherwise be provided without further documentation. Additionally, many individuals would need to provide documentation of any disability to access health care coverage. Ciriac Alvarez Valle, a senior policy analyst at Voices for Utah Children, speaks during a press conference by the newly launched Protect Medicaid Utah coalition that highlighted the impact potential cuts to Medicaid could have in Utah, at Pioneer Park in Salt Lake City on Tuesday. (Photo: Brice Tucker, Deseret News) ""Someone can be incredibly ill with no paperwork to prove it. Tumors can cause symptoms and threaten lives before there is any evidence of the disease. A person can spend years in pain, confined to a bed or a wheelchair, without a diagnosis on paper from a physician. That is why it is so important to eliminate as many barriers as possible between people and access to health care,"" explained Stacy Stanford, a representative with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Members of the coalition expressed concern that disability is a spectrum and cannot always be ""proved"" via paperwork or other means. Unease has also been raised for those with invisible disabilities, such as mental health issues that can be difficult to document. ""For many individuals battling significant behavioral health challenges, stable health care isn't a reward for work; it's the foundation that makes work possible,"" said Evan Doan, associate director for Utah Support Advocates for Recovery Awareness. The group claims that if changes are implemented, the state would lose $500 million in federal funding annually, and 7,000 jobs — including many essential workers in the health care system — would also be put at risk. With over 352,000 Utahns currently using Medicaid, the coalition is fighting to ensure that cuts to Medicaid are not made. Multiple speakers from various organizations addressed the crowd gathered Tuesday at Pioneer Park to discuss their experiences and perspectives on the proposed cuts; some held signs explaining what Medicaid does for them, for their families and for those around them. For many individuals battling significant behavioral health challenges, stable health care isn't a reward for work; it's the foundation that makes work possible. –Evan Doan, Utah Support Advocates for Recovery Awareness ""I'm a retired health care worker,"" said Kris Calfrick. ""Medicaid was enormously important to cancer patients and to the elderly who needed supplements. … I think it would be devastating to health care if this were removed."" The speakers and attendees repeatedly emphasized that Medicaid budget cuts would most directly impact low-income families, the elderly and people with disabilities. One in five Utah children and 1 in 3 individuals with a disability are currently protected by Medicaid, according to state data. ""I want to be clear: All the cuts discussed will directly affect people with disabilities,"" said Disability Law Center representative Nate Crippes. ""If enacted, many of them will have their health care terminated."" According to the coalition, with the budget cuts, the state would be forced to move the financial burden elsewhere. Many health care institutions currently operating under Medicaid would no longer be able to provide the level of care that many patients need.

Protect Medicaid Utah urges anyone interested in advocating for the cause to reach out to local legislators to share their own experiences with Medicaid. × Photos The Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.

Healthcare workers who spoke with 8 News Now said the hospital’s refusal to meet their basic needs is threatening staff retention and compromising patient care across the region. They also told 8 News Now they want to see some accountability from the parent corporation, the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). “We are the heart and soul of our hospital, and we matter,” Medical Social Worker Genie Patrick said. Service Employees International Union (SEIU) workers stated that HCA Healthcare who owns Sunrise Hospital made $5.8 billion in profits last year, up nearly 10% from 2023.

We want better healthcare for our community, and I want HCA to step it up,” Medical Social Worker Christina Hooper told 8 News Now.

We value all members of our care teams, and we provide a safe environment for our patients. Since negotiations began last fall, we have bargained in good faith and we will continue to do so.” – HCA Healthcare There are nearly 300 Sunrise Hospital employees who told 8 News Now they want to work collaboratively with HCA to address their concerns, but if major progress is not made in union contract negotiations, they said they plan to hold a picket at the hospital.

The bill aims to bring healthcare investments by private equity groups and hedge funds more fully into the scope of the California Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) transaction review process. The amended bill notably removes management services organizations (MSOs) and parent entities from the definition of “health care entity,” but retains reporting obligations for those entities if they enter into a transaction with another health care entity. The amended bill would also allow OHCA to impose data reporting requirements on MSOs. Stakeholders should continue to monitor the progress of AB 1415 and its potential impact on the OHCA transaction review process. If signed into law, AB 1415 would likely take effect on January 1, 2026. In Depth Our prior On the Subject summarized the proposed changes to the OHCA transaction review process in the version of AB 1415 that was introduced on February 21, 2025. The amended bill includes the following material changes: Removes MSOs and Parent Entities From “Health Care Entity” Definition AB 1415 originally included MSOs and parent entities of providers as types of “health care entities.” The amended version removes both MSOs and parent entities from the definition of health care entity and adds them to the newly defined term “noticing entity,” which refers to entities that have an obligation to report certain material transactions between themselves and a health care entity. “Noticing entity” also includes private equity groups, hedge funds, and entities created for the purposes of entering into agreements or transactions with health care entities. MSO Monitoring The amended bill states that OHCA will establish MSO data reporting requirements “as necessary to carry out the functions of the office” and adds MSOs to an existing list of entities that OHCA will research and evaluate to determine whether the current OHCA transaction review process captures all entities that “significantly affect health care cost, quality, equity, and workforce stability.” Health System Definition The amended bill broadens the new definition of “health system” to include a combination of one or more hospitals and one or more providers, rather than a combination of one or more hospitals and one or more physician organizations. The definition also includes a combination of one or more providers, rather than a combination of one or more physician organizations. KEY TAKEAWAYS MSO Acquisitions: Under the amended bill, MSOs would no longer fall within the definition of health care entity, which critically impacts the applicability of the OHCA transaction review requirements to changes of ownership or control of an MSO. Under the initial version of AB 1415, if a buyer acquired equity in an MSO in California, the transaction would potentially be reportable to OHCA because there would be a change in control of a health care entity. Under the amended bill, an MSO sale is unlikely to be reportable, as long as no assets or control of another health care entity are transferred. Parent Entities: The removal of certain parent entities (“an entity that owns, operates, or controls a provider, regardless of whether the provider is currently operating, providing health care services, or has a pending or suspended license”) from the definition of health care entity would narrow the types of transactions potentially subject to OHCA’s reporting requirements. However, such entities would still have an obligation to report to OHCA if they enter into a material transaction with a health care entity. MSO Data Reporting: While the amended bill removes MSOs from the definition of health care entity, it allows OHCA to develop data reporting requirements for MSOs. While the language of the bill is silent as to the nature of these reporting requirements, OHCA likely would want to better understand the relationships between MSOs and other health care entities. Private Equity Group and Hedge Fund Reporting Requirement: No material changes were made to the language requiring private equity groups and hedge funds (and their downstream affiliates) to report certain transactions if the counterparty in a transaction is a health care entity. AB 1415 would specifically require the private equity group or hedge fund to submit notice to OHCA, which would involve the submission of a substantial amount of information regarding the private equity group or hedge fund, including financial statements, organizational charts, and information regarding past healthcare transactions consummated by the private equity group or hedge fund.

Subscribe to Marketing Daily pharma Report: Healthcare Marketers Should Be 'Authentic,' Use CTV by Les Luchter , May 5, 2025 “Authenticity is Key to Winning Over Consumers with Healthcare Advertising,” say researcher eMarketer and programmatic ad platform StackAdapt in a just-released joint report under that title. Based largely on a January survey of 1,013 U.S. consumers, the study found that, while nearly 90% of respondents had seen healthcare ads over the past year, only 20% trusted them more than ads from other product categories. This discontent stems from the reality that “most consumers purchase healthcare products, treatments, and services out of necessity, not desire,” Rajiv Leventhal, eMarketer’s senior analyst, digital health, says in the report. “On top of that, enhanced media coverage over the last several years of how healthcare providers, insurers, and drugmakers prioritize profits over patient care has eroded consumer trust.” advertisement advertisement The solution? Since almost half (45.1%) of respondents said that focusing on facts and avoiding over-the-top claims would make them find healthcare ads more trustworthy, the report states that “healthcare marketers can win over skeptical consumers with transparency, fact-focused campaigns, and a proven record of reliability.” How can marketers best do this? “Be relatable and demonstrate to your audience that you understand their concerns with the healthcare system,"" Leventhal says in the report. ""Product/service ads should include evidence-based information along with real-life patient testimonials.” But not from celebrities. “Over half of consumers (55.8%) would be less likely to notice and take action if they saw or heard a healthcare ad with a celebrity endorsement,” says the report. And healthcare marketers should use video, particularly on connected TV (CTV). “TV across the board moves the needle with consumers in reach and trustworthiness,” the report states, but “while traditional TV offers broad reach,” it’s a waning medium and healthcare marketers should “double down on CTV.” “We’re seeing significant success in helping healthcare advertisers reach and engage consumers through CTV,” Jasmaan Panesar, StackAdapt’s senior manager, solutions, says in the report. “As the healthcare industry continues to navigate consumer skepticism, CTV offers a powerful, brand-safe environment that allows advertisers to build trust through authentic, fact-driven messaging."" Almost half (45.1%) of survey respondents said that focusing on facts and avoiding over-the-top claims would make them trust healthcare ads more. “Ads from a company with a proven track record (40.6%) and more transparency about risks, side effects, and potential outcomes (38.8%) are also very important to bridging that gap,” the report states. ""Avoid making misleading claims, and show consumers how they can access products, treatments, and services at affordable prices,” said Leventhal. advertising , connected tv , health , health care , marketing , pharma , television Comment Next story loading advertisement More from Marketing Daily Crayola, Lego Find New Shades Of Holiday Heart George Strait's Codigo 1530 Tequila Offers Cowboy Cocktail Kit Cava Launches First Merch Line In Time For Holiday Shopping John Goodman Lends Voice To Disney's 'Best Christmas Ever' Rewiring The Algo: Consumers Negotiate A Different Kind Of Personalization SPONSOR CONTENT Join QSR Marketers in Santa Barbara!

Titled, “Leading Healthcare in the AI Era: People Strategies to Ensure Tech Investments Deliver,” the report advocates for human capital-oriented approaches to ensure organizations throughout the healthcare ecosystem fully utilize today’s innovations to maximize clinical, operational, and financial results, and avoid falling behind in coming waves of disruption. The report includes industry challenges reported by surveyed FMG Leading healthcare clients as well as healthcare AI use cases, actionable strategies for bridging people and technologies amidst implementations, and best human capital practices for healthcare entities. It is currently free for download here . The release of the report comes at a time when healthcare organizations are making increasing investments in novel technologies while often overlooking how their people are or will be interacting with these tools. For example, an American Medical Association survey published in February 2025 found that 66% of physicians reported using AI in 2024, up from 38% in 2023, but 25% of respondents were more concerned than excited about the tools. What’s more, a March 2025 study by generative AI platform Writer found that 31% of employees—including 41% of Gen Z workers—admit to “sabotaging” their company’s AI strategy by refusing to adopt AI. As a result, roughly two-thirds of executives say generative AI adoption has led to tension and division within their organization, with 42% suggesting it’s “tearing their company apart.” “While AI-enabled and other groundbreaking technologies are expected to help solve numerous, longstanding healthcare challenges, they won’t serve as automated springboards to value creation,” said Dr. Matt Brubaker, Chairman and CEO of FMG Leading. “Leaders need to examine the interplay between these technologies and their people, processes, and structures, bringing real wisdom and experience to the table in order to realize their full benefits and remain competitive in the years to come.” ### About FMG Leading is a human capital advisory firm that partners with leaders and investors on a mission to make the healthcare system work, better. Its trusted advisors bring together management and key stakeholders to engage with critical people-centric levers that drive change and impact, helping address what’s broken and imagining different, better ways of enabling organizations to achieve their full potential.

How can organizations thrive amid this constant change? New research from Huron identifies five priorities essential for successful digital transformation: foundational technology investments, data integration, enhanced interoperability, healthcare workforce optimization and cautious artificial intelligence (AI) implementation. Insights drawn from technology leaders at national and regional healthcare systems and academic medical centers highlight how the following strategic priorities can position organizations for sustained growth and improved patient outcomes. 1. Strengthening foundational technology in healthcare Healthcare leaders increasingly recognize robust foundational technology as essential to digital transformation. Cloud optimization emerged as leaders’ top digital transformation priority, rising 36% from the previous year. This is followed by data management (23% increase) and security and compliance (18% increase), signaling a commitment to building resilient digital infrastructures that support efficient, data-driven decision-making and care delivery . 2. Solving healthcare data integration challenges Despite widespread acknowledgment of data's strategic importance, only 17% of healthcare organizations report having a unified view of their data. Fragmented systems significantly limit the potential of healthcare analytics. The top challenge cited by respondents is maintaining data integrity across partner organizations, underscoring the necessity of cohesive healthcare data integration strategies for achieving comprehensive, actionable insights. 3. Improving interoperability for enhanced care Interoperability remains critical for informed clinical decision-making and care quality improvement. Yet, most technology leaders report low-to-moderate interoperability between their core systems. Nearly 80% of respondents report limited interoperability among electronic health record (EHR) platforms. While fewer (48%) note similar issues for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, opportunities for improvement persist for many organizations. These findings highlight the ongoing need for solutions that seamlessly integrate core systems with real-time data sources, such as IoT devices and remote patient monitoring tools. Achieving advanced interoperability will be key to accelerating information access and transforming healthcare delivery. 4. Driving healthcare workforce optimization Facing rising workforce shortages and burnout, healthcare organizations are increasingly prioritizing digital tools that empower their staff . More than 70% of leaders identify digital applications supporting workforce efficiency as an immediate priority, with 60% planning significant investments. Technology focused on healthcare workforce optimization not only improves staff experience but also enhances operational effectiveness and patient care. Ensuring these digital tools add value requires understanding employee needs and challenges, thorough training and thoughtful implementation to maximize staff adoption and return on investment (ROI). 5. Taking a measured approach to AI in healthcare Although AI offers considerable promise, healthcare organizations are slowing integration to strengthen foundational data and technology infrastructure. This deliberate strategy ensures AI investments align closely with organizational readiness and infrastructure maturity to achieve intended outcomes and maximize long-term success. As healthcare systems move beyond operational use cases into clinical applications, this foundation will be pertinent to mitigate risk and build consumer trust. The opportunity for healthcare leaders to lead digital transformation As healthcare organizations navigate their digital transformation journeys, these five priorities offer a roadmap for strategic investment and innovation. By focusing on technology modernization, integrated data strategies, improved interoperability, empowered healthcare workforces and strategic AI integration, healthcare organizations can effectively position themselves for sustainable growth and elevated healthcare delivery.

Courtesy of Choose New Jersey By Jackie Roman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com New Jersey is appealing to frustrated reproductive health providers in the Lone Star State with four billboards encouraging obstetricians, gynecologists and other providers of women’s health care to relocate. The billboards, located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and San Antonio near major university hospitals and medical schools, are part of the “Choose New Jersey Reproductive Rights Campaign” which launched on April 14. One billboard states “In New Jersey, your patient’s care is prioritized. Not compromised.” Another billboard reads “New Jersey: where health care providers determine patient care, not politicians.” The billboards are paid for by Choose New Jersey , an independent nonprofit organization created under former Governor Chris Christie’s administration focused on driving economic growth and attracting businesses to the state. Choose New Jersey was awarded a $21.3 million contract by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for business attraction and marketing services in June of 2023. Spending for the “Choose New Jersey Reproductive Rights Campaign,” which includes the four billboards located in Texas, comes from this source. The organization’s campaign aims to recruit current and future reproductive health care providers who are facing increasing restrictions to practice in southern states. Texas, which has a total abortion ban, has made headlines for investigating and arresting providers who provide abortion care. It’s unclear if the reproductive rights campaign has plans for more billboards in other states, but in 2022 a similar campaign was used in Georgia, Florida, Mississippi and Texas. In addition to the billboards, the campaign has a digital component involving search, display, social media ads, and a website . The website outlines New Jersey’s protections for reproductive rights to medical students and health care providers around the country. For example, New Jersey health care providers cannot be disciplined for performing abortion-related services and the state prohibits any board from cooperating in interstate investigations involving health care providers who provided abortion services. The website also pointedly states that in New Jersey, “reproductive health care is based on science, not politics.” New Jersey is using its position as one of nine states with no limits on abortion to recruit providers that want to practice medicine in accordance with their values. Courtesy of Choose New Jersey Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, abortion has been banned in 13 states, and another 6 states have implemented early gestational limits between 6 and 12 weeks, according to health nonprofit KFF , formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. New Jersey is one of nine states and Washington D.C. with no limits on abortion. Gov. Phil Murphy has made attracting OB-GYNs to the state a priority under his administration. In his February state budget speech, Murphy announced he was allocating $2 million in the coming year to help recruit providers of women’s health care. This money will be used to defray moving costs and loan forgiveness programs for doctors and nurse practitioners who are willing to relocate to the Garden State, according to the Murphy administration. The state has seen an increase in the demand for abortion services since the June 2022 ruling that overturned the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. “New Jersey is facing a looming shortage of reproductive health care providers. And, with this investment, New Jersey will get ahead of that challenge by creating a new pipeline for these professionals,” Murphy said during his state budget address. In February, Murphy said that beyond its practical benefits, the OB-GYN incentive program is also about defending New Jersey values. “Because if these health care heroes are going to be targeted by politicians elsewhere, we will always stand up for them and their ability to provide care. My priority is ensuring that every woman can access the best possible health care, when they need it. Period,” said Murphy in his budget address.

Then share it with your loved ones and put it in writing. April was Advance Care Planning Month. Massachusetts Department of Public Health appealed to clinicians to ask all adults, regardless of age if they have a health care proxy. If they don’t have one, it’s time to start the conversation. Do you have a health care proxy? If yes, pat yourself on the back, but still review it yearly. If you don’t, you are not alone. More than 90% of Americans believe it is importance to assign a trusted person in your life as your voice should you be unable to communicate. Sadly, only one third of adults has completed a health care proxy form. The benefits are two-fold. You will have the peace of mind that your wishes are carried out. Your loved ones will have the tools to make decisions for you and respect your choices. Many resources are available to you, along with your health care provider, to help have these conversations with your family and make decisions. Honoring Choices of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association Simple Step Campaign offers online guidance, forms, videos, multilingual tools, the health care proxy form with instructions and a hand out titled Who is Your Health Care Agent?

This decision follows the bill's passage in the Republican-controlled Tennessee Senate with a 27-3 vote and in the Tennessee House of Representatives with a 71-22 vote. Known as the Medical Ethics Defense Act, Senate Bill 955 states that “a healthcare provider must not be required to participate in or pay for a healthcare procedure, treatment, or service that violates the conscience of the healthcare provider.” The law defines “healthcare provider” to include healthcare institutions, health insurance companies, and healthcare professionals, while the term “conscience” refers to “the sincerely held ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or principles held by a healthcare provider.” The legislation also provides protections for whistleblowers who report violations of the law, ethical guidelines, or “gross mismanagement” by healthcare providers. It prohibits the state and its political subdivisions from taking adverse actions against healthcare providers for “engaging in speech, expression, or association that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Actions prohibited by the law include reprimanding or revoking the licenses of healthcare providers over their speech, as well as denying the issuance of licenses altogether. The measure allows individuals who believe their rights have been violated under the law to seek relief in court. The enactment of Senate Bill 955 comes amid a backdrop of medical professionals and institutions in other states facing repercussions for refusing to perform elective services that conflict with their deeply held religious beliefs. For instance, Robyn Strader, Paige Casey, and Suzanne Schuler, three nurse practitioners at CVS Pharmacy MinuteClinics, were terminated for declining to provide prescriptions for abortion-inducing drugs based on their beliefs regarding the sanctity of life. In 2023, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that a Catholic hospital violated the Affordable Care Act by refusing an elective hysterectomy for a trans-identified woman due to the hospital's religious beliefs about the immutability of biological sex. As reported by the Center for Religion, Culture and Democracy at First Liberty Institute, Tennessee joins other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, and Washington, in providing general conscience protections for healthcare professionals. This report was published before Idaho enacted its own Medical Ethics Defense Act earlier this year. Share Tweet COPYRIGHT @ CHRISTIANITY DAILY"

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions . Δ According to recent research from PYMNTS Intelligence , which polled C-suite executives at healthcare companies generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue, the sector is exhibiting strong bullishness on AI, with most already having deployed GenAI in key areas like product innovation and customer service. This push comes as GenAI rapidly reshapes industries, particularly those, like healthcare, that are heavily reliant on big data and advanced technology. The survey indicates a widespread expectation of positive return on investment (ROI) from GenAI initiatives. Ninety percent of executives surveyed reported that their previous GenAI investments have already achieved a positive ROI, a finding noted as remarkable given the typical slow and expensive nature of technology implementation. Companies are not just expecting returns; they are seeing them, and this success is fueling plans for further investment. Fifty-nine percent of healthcare executives specifically stated they would increase their GenAI investment in the next year, a figure higher than the 52% cross-industry average. Full embedding of GenAI across healthcare businesses is expected to take, on average, 7.4 years, aligning with the cross-industry average. Scaling up these investments is rapidly becoming essential for healthcare organizations to maintain a competitive edge. Key findings from the report highlight the financial commitment and positive outcomes experienced by healthcare firms: High ROI Achievement: Ninety percent of the healthcare executives surveyed reported that their previous GenAI investments have already achieved a positive ROI. This high rate of return is seen across the sector, validating the strategic focus on GenAI. Investment Correlates With ROI: Healthcare companies invested an average of $2.7 million in GenAI implementation and services over the past 12 months. Notably, firms reporting very positive ROI from their GenAI investments spent significantly more, averaging $6.4 million, compared to $2 million for those with somewhat positive ROI and $1.5 million for those with negligible benefits. This suggests that greater investment correlates with better ROI outcomes. Prioritized Use Cases: Approximately 6 in 10 healthcare CFOs reported their companies are already using GenAI for innovating products and services and for providing real-time, automated customer service responses (such as chatbots). Other significant areas of implementation include data visualization and reports (55%), search and access to information (55%), and workflow automation management (51%). While deployment is high in innovation and customer-facing applications, the report notes that most healthcare firms are not yet widely deploying GenAI in high-stakes areas such as fraud detection or cybersecurity management. Despite the rapid advancement of technology, healthcare firms are advised to approach these areas cautiously and potentially focus GenAI investments elsewhere for the near future. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The research underscores that GenAI is shaking up major industries and is becoming central to healthcare operations, requiring businesses to ensure they have robust strategies in place to leverage its potential effectively.

This milestone follows the successful first-in-human treatment with HG-CT-1, which demonstrated a favorable initial safety profile with no adverse effects observed, and the subsequent recruitment of the second patient. Together, these milestones mark steady progress in the clinical development of HG-CT-1 and reinforce the Company's commitment to advancing treatment options for patients with limited therapeutic alternatives. The Phase I trial is a dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety profile of HG-CT-1 and to collect data on key secondary endpoints, including anti-leukemic activity, overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. The Company believes that continued clinical execution will not only advance a potentially transformative treatment for adult patients with limited therapeutic options but also generate long-term value for shareholders by establishing HG-CT-1 as a platform-defining asset in the field of hematologic malignancies. While the current trial is focused on adult patients, successful initial outcomes would pave the way for a pediatric trial - an area of significant unmet medical need in AML, where few effective treatment options exist for children. Further updates on the clinical trial will be provided in due course. Dr. Vladislav Sandler, CEO & Co-Founder of Hemogenyx Pharmaceuticals, commented: ""The treatment of a second patient with HG-CT-1 marks another critical step in the development of our CAR-T therapy for relapsed or refractory AML. The ability to move forward with dosing reflects the capabilities of our scientific and manufacturing teams and further validates our platform. We remain deeply focused on executing the clinical program with rigor and care, and on our mission to bring potentially life-saving treatments to patients in need.""

Alignment Healthcare (ALHC) Q1 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $926.9 million vs analyst estimates of $888.1 million (47.5% year-on-year growth, 4.4% beat) EPS (GAAP): -$0.05 vs analyst estimates of -$0.12 (59.7% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $20.18 million vs analyst estimates of $4.40 million (2.2% margin, significant beat) The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $3.79 billion at the midpoint from $3.75 billion, a 1.2% increase EBITDA guidance for the full year is $49 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $47.1 million Operating Margin: -0.6%, up from -6.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $8.36 million, up from -$17.36 million in the same quarter last year Customers: 217,500, up from 189,100 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion “Alignment Healthcare’s first-quarter performance reflects the strength of our model and the discipline of our execution, showing what’s possible when technology, clinical management and member-first service operate as one,” said John Kao, founder and CEO. Company Overview Founded in 2013 with a mission to transform healthcare for seniors, Alignment Healthcare ( NASDAQ: ALHC ) provides Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors with features like concierge services, transportation benefits, and technology-driven care coordination. Sales Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, Alignment Healthcare’s 30.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Alignment Healthcare’s annualized revenue growth of 40.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 217,500 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Alignment Healthcare’s customer base averaged 38.8% year-on-year growth. Because this number is in line with its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent roughly the same amount each year on the company’s products and services. This quarter, Alignment Healthcare reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 47.5%, and its $926.9 million of revenue beat Wall Street’s estimates by 4.4%. Company management is currently guiding for a 40.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 32.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is commendable and implies the market sees success for its products and services. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Operating Margin Operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals. Although Alignment Healthcare broke even this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 6.2% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. On the plus side, Alignment Healthcare’s operating margin rose by 3 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. This performance was mostly driven by its recent improvements as the company’s margin has increased by 6 percentage points on a two-year basis. These data points are very encouraging and shows momentum is on its side. This quarter, Alignment Healthcare generated a negative 0.6% operating margin. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Alignment Healthcare’s earnings losses deepened over the last five years as its EPS dropped 13.2% annually. We’ll keep a close eye on the company as diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. In Q1, Alignment Healthcare reported EPS at negative $0.05, up from negative $0.25 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Alignment Healthcare’s full-year EPS of negative $0.48 will reach break even. Key Takeaways from Alignment Healthcare’s Q1 Results We were impressed by how significantly Alignment Healthcare blew past analysts’ revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad it raised its full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key metrics above expectations. The stock remained flat at $16.77 immediately after reporting. Alignment Healthcare may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free ."

The healthcare cybersecurity market is experiencing unprecedented demand, driven by a 137% increase in ransomware attacks targeting hospitals over the past 18 months (Check Point Research) and new FDA premarket cybersecurity requirements taking full effect. Current needs center around three critical gaps: medical device security (with 68% of IoT healthcare devices running unsupported operating systems per Cynerio), identity governance for hybrid workforces (where 42% of clinicians still share passwords according to Imprivata), and cloud configuration management (as 73% of Azure healthcare tenants show critical misconfigurations per Orca Security). This surge in threats across the healthcare cybersecurity market has created a $3.2 billion serviceable available market just for healthcare-specific solutions, with managed detection and response (MDR) growing fastest at 89% YoH. In line with this, major players are responding through both innovation and acquisition—Palo Alto Networks’ acquisition of medical device security startup Zingbox exemplifies the strategic focus on clinical environment protection, while Microsoft's healthcare-specific Azure Sentinel modules now protect 41% of Epic EHR implementations. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/healthcare-cybersecurity-market Adoption patterns reveal stark divisions in healthcare cybersecurity market maturity. While 78% of academic medical centers have deployed AI-powered anomaly detection (Darktrace), only 29% of community hospitals can monitor medical device traffic in real-time (Ponemon). The competitive landscape has bifurcated between platform players like Cisco (now securing 32% of healthcare network infrastructure) and specialists like Claroty, whose medical device security platform grew 140% in hospital deployments last year. Legacy vendors face challenges—despite McAfee's 63% market share in endpoint protection, only 17% of healthcare CISOs rate their solutions as effective against modern supply chain attacks (KLAS). Some of the emerging differentiators in the healthcare cybersecurity market include regulatory automation (ServiceNow's HIPAA workflow tools reduced audit prep time by 58% at Kaiser) and clinical context awareness (Armis' device-to-EHR mapping prevented 12,000 false alerts at Mass General). However, persistent adoption barriers remain, with 61% of organizations citing clinical workflow disruption as their top concern (CHIME), explaining why behavior-adaptive security tools like Hypr's passwordless authentication see 3x faster deployment times than traditional IAM solutions in emergency departments. Key Findings in Healthcare Cybersecurity Market Market Forecast (2033) US$ 82.90 billion CAGR 18.55% Largest Region (2024) North America (35%) By Deployment Mode On-Premise (60%) By Security Type Network Security (35%) By Threat Type Malware (32%) By End Users Hospitals (40%) Top Drivers Rising ransomware attacks targeting sensitive patient data and systems. Strict regulatory compliance mandates enforcing robust data protection measures. Increased adoption of telehealth and IoT devices expanding vulnerabilities. Top Trends AI-powered threat detection for real-time attack mitigation and response. Zero-trust security frameworks replacing traditional perimeter-based defenses. Growth in healthcare cloud security investments for scalable protection. Top Challenges Legacy systems with outdated security protocols increasing exploitation risks. Shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals specializing in healthcare threats. High costs of advanced security solutions straining healthcare budgets . Network Security: Zero Trust Adoption and Persistent Vulnerabilities Healthcare networks remain a prime target due to legacy systems and high-value data. A 2024 HIMSS Cybersecurity Survey found that 43% of healthcare breaches originated from unsecured network perimeters, with VPN exploits accounting for 28% of initial access points. Attackers in the healthcare cybersecurity market increasingly exploit misconfigured SD-WAN deployments, particularly in multi-site hospital systems. The shift to zero-trust network access (ZTNA) is accelerating, with 62% of large providers piloting or implementing it. However, only 19% have fully enforced least-privilege policies, leaving lateral movement risks unchecked. Furthermore, medical IoT compounds network risks—a single compromised device can expose entire VLANs. Darktrace’s 2024 analysis revealed that 37% of healthcare IoT devices communicate with unexpected external IPs, often due to outdated firmware. Solutions like microsegmentation and AI-driven NDR (Network Detection & Response) are gaining adoption, but 56% of IT teams struggle with legacy-medical device compatibility. The rise of 5G-enabled remote care further strains security, with 41% of cellular-connected devices lacking encrypted backhaul. Cloud Security: Misconfigurations and Third-Party Risks Dominate Healthcare’s cloud adoption surged in the healthcare cybersecurity market, but 73% of breaches involve misconfigured storage buckets or APIs (2024 IBM X-Force). Microsoft Azure and AWS host over 65% of healthcare cloud workloads, yet 32% of these deployments have excessive IAM permissions (Orca Security). The #1 exploited vulnerability is overprivileged service accounts, implicated in 51% of cloud-based ransomware attacks. Multi-cloud complexity also exacerbates risks—58% of providers lack unified visibility across AWS, Azure, and GCP. In addition, emerging solutions include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools, now used by 47% of large health systems. However, shadow SaaS apps (e.g., unauthorized EHR plugins) create blind spots—28% of healthcare employees use unvetted cloud apps (Netskope) in the healthcare cybersecurity market. Encryption gaps persist: Only 39% of cloud-stored PHI is encrypted at rest, despite HIPAA requirements. Vendors like Wiz and Lacework are gaining traction with automated compliance mapping, but adoption lags in mid-tier hospitals. Endpoint Security: Medical IoT and Unpatched Devices Under Siege Connected medical devices represent the fastest-growing attack vector in the healthcare cybersecurity market, with 1.4 vulnerabilities per device (Cynerio 2024). Infusion pumps and imaging systems are particularly vulnerable—23% run on unsupported Windows versions. A single unpatched device can cost hospitals $430K in remediation (Ponemon). Despite this, only 34% of providers enforce device-level encryption, and 61% lack real-time firmware monitoring. Therefore, EDR solutions are now deployed in 68% of hospitals, but 45% fail to detect low-and-slow attacks on IoT devices. Manufacturers are slowly improving—22% of new devices now support secure boot and signed updates. FDA’s 2024 premarket cybersecurity guidance mandates SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), but legacy device risks persist. Some health systems are piloting network air-gapping for critical devices, though this limits telehealth integration. Ransomware: Double Extortion and Supply Chain Attacks Escalate Healthcare ransomware attacks increased by 57% YoY in Q1 2024 (Check Point) in the healthcare cybersecurity market. The average dwell time before detection is 14 days, up from 9 days in 2023 (Sophos). Double extortion is now standard—83% of attackers exfiltrate data before encryption. Today, the top 3 ransomware variants (LockBit 3.0, ALPHV, and BlackCat) account for 76% of incidents, often exploiting ProxyShell and Log4j vulnerabilities. In line with this, defense strategies are evolving: 71% of providers now use immutable backups, but only 29% test restoration weekly. AI-powered behavioral analytics reduce dwell time by 40% (Darktrace). However, third-party breaches (e.g., MSPs) caused 38% of incidents, highlighting weak vendor risk management. Rural hospitals are disproportionately affected—62% lack dedicated ransomware playbooks (HHS). Competitive Landscape: Consolidation Trends & Emerging Differentiators The healthcare cybersecurity market vendor ecosystem is undergoing rapid consolidation, with 78% of venture capital funding in 2024 flowing to specialized providers in medical device security and compliance automation. Legacy players like Cisco and Palo Alto are acquiring niche innovators—9 out of 12 healthcare cybersecurity M&A deals this year targeted clinical workflow-integrated solutions (PitchBook). However, market fragmentation persists, with 64% of healthcare providers using 3+ competing endpoint security solutions simultaneously (Ponemon Institute), creating visibility gaps. Differentiation is now driven by regulatory-aware AI – vendors offering automated HIPAA audit documentation see 2.3x faster sales cycles in the healthcare cybersecurity market. The managed detection and response (MDR) segment grew 142% YoY as mid-sized hospitals outsourced SOC operations. Surprisingly, 41% of provider RFPs now mandate FDA pre-market cybersecurity controls for vendor selection, favoring firms like MedCrypt and Sternum. Pricing models are shifting—63% of new contracts include breach warranty clauses, transferring risk to vendors. Remote Care Security: Telehealth Vulnerabilities & RPM Device Risks Healthcare cybersecurity market data shows 61% of telehealth platforms lack end-to-end encryption for specialty consultations (CynergisTek Audit Findings), while 78% of patient-facing apps fail OWASP Mobile Top 10 compliance (NowSecure). The most targeted vulnerability is SSO implementation flaws in EHR-telehealth integrations, enabling 39% of all identity-based attacks (Okta Healthcare Threat Report). RPM devices present alarming risks—FDA's 2024 recall list includes 14 devices with hardcoded credentials, impacting 230,000 patients. Leading providers in the market are adopting FIDO2 authentication with biometric fallbacks, reducing account takeovers by 89% (Mayo Clinic Pilot). Emerging technologies show promise—quantum-resistant encryption pilots in academic medical centers grew 320% YoY (Post-Quantum). However, interoperability requirements force 71% of providers to accept vulnerable API connections (CommonWell Alliance), creating systemic risks. Request Additional Details Before Purchase: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/inquire-before-purchase/healthcare-cybersecurity-market Deployment Benchmarking: Cloud Migration Patterns & Legacy Challenges Primary infrastructure data in the healthcare cybersecurity market reveals hybrid cloud architectures now dominate in terms of growth rate, with 68% of providers running critical workloads across 2-3 platforms (Flexera 2024). Cost analysis shows on-premises EHR security requires 37% more FTEs than cloud equivalents (HIMSS Analytics), yet 89% of academic medical centers retain physical data centers for research compliance. Container security remains problematic—52% of healthcare Kubernetes deployments expose sensitive pods due to misconfigured network policies (Red Hat OpenShift Audit). The zero trust implementation gap is striking—while 81% of providers have ZTA roadmaps, only 29% have protected medical IoT segments (Fortinet Survey). Legacy system burdens are quantifiable—Windows Server 2008 systems require 3.2x more patching hours than supported OS (Tenable), costing $420K annually per 500-bed hospital. Air-gapping shows unexpected ROI—critical care networks using physical segmentation reduced incident response costs by 63% (ECRI Institute), though with 41% higher maintenance overhead.

Contributed By Pamela Knudson April 30, 2025 at 6:50 AM Comments Share Share this article News Reporting News Reporting Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. The Trust Project What is this? GRAND FORKS – Home Therapy Solutions has qualified for certification as an Age Friendly Health Care System, Kara Welke, who owns and operates the business, has announced. This is the first entity in Grand Forks to receive this distinction, Welke said. ADVERTISEMENT This recognition comes from the Institute for Health Care Improvement, which is internationally known for its work on optimizing health care, according to a news release. The certification indicates that an organization is providing services that meet requirements and standards which ensure that older adults receive the highest quality care and ensure they are aging in the right place. Home Therapy Solutions, which Welke founded in 2018, “was the first mobile therapy practice in the U.S. to achieve recognition as an Age Friendly home therapy provider,” she said. “Many individuals and families mistakenly believe that assisted living or nursing home placement is their only option, unaware of the extensive resources available to support aging in place,” Welke said. And “many (health care) providers are not adequately prepared to care for our aging population.” Age Friendly Health Care is a new framework for evaluating and managing older adults’ problems through four elements related to quality of life, she said. These elements are assessed and acted upon with each clinical encounter. By focusing on them, older adult health care improves and better outcomes are achieved. In the process of attaining certification as an Age Friendly Health Care System, Home Therapy Solutions collaborated with the UND geriatrics program and Quality Health Associates, Welke said. “Home Therapy Solutions has been a community health care partner for training UND medical students and other health profession students,” said Dr. Donald Jurivich, professor and chairman of the UND geriatrics program, in the news release, “and it is truly remarkable how they are pioneers in the Age Friendly movement.” ADVERTISEMENT Kara Welke, an occupational therapist, founded Home Therapy Solutions in 2018 to provide high-quality, personalized outpatient physical and occupational therapy in the comfort of home, supporting both clients and their caregivers. Contributed Certification as an Age Friendly Health Care System is important, Welke said, because “80% of cognitively impaired individuals go unrecognized in primary care, and 50% of primary care physicians report feeling unprepared to care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.” (Primary care is basic health care, rather than specialized care, for those making an initial approach for treatment from doctors and nurses who practice in the areas of family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics.) Early detection of cognitive impairment can offer hope for improvement, Welke said, as “research shows that 20% of individuals with mild cognitive impairment may regain normal cognitive function.” Read more Comments Share Share this article News Reporting News Reporting Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

https://www.itweb.co.za/article/is-sa-ready-for-ai-in-digital-health/KPNG8v8NP9xM4mwD,,Is SA ready for AI in digital health ? ,20250430T080000Z,https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2025/02/Henry-Adams-05Feb2025.jpg,itweb.co.za,English,South Africa,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"Issued by Anti-Clockwise Consulting for InterSystems Johannesburg, 30 Apr 2025 Henry Adams, Country Manager, InterSystems South Africa. (Image: InterSystems) The healthcare industry is experiencing a digital revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven technologies shaping the future of patient care, medical innovation and operational efficiency. The global digital health market is projected to reach nearly $1 trillion by 2032, underscoring the vast opportunities for healthcare providers, MedTech companies and innovators. But are South African organisations ready to fully harness the potential of digital health and AI? The challenge of data in healthcare South Africa’s healthcare system, like many others worldwide, is awash with data. Electronic patient records, medical device outputs, public health databases and clinical research all generate a wealth of information. Yet, for AI to deliver on its promise – whether in automating diagnostics, personalising treatments or predicting health outcomes – this data must be accurate, interoperable and accessible. The reality is that many healthcare organisations still struggle with siloed data, legacy systems and integration challenges. Interoperability remains a significant barrier, preventing seamless data exchange between hospitals, laboratories, insurers and government entities. Without a unified data strategy, even the most sophisticated AI algorithms will fall short. AI is only as effective as the data it processes, and in a fragmented ecosystem, valuable insights remain locked away, limiting healthcare providers’ ability to innovate and improve patient outcomes. Laying the foundation for AI-ready healthcare To maximise the benefits of AI, healthcare providers and MedTech firms must address five key data management questions: 1. Are your data systems interoperable? Effective digital health solutions must integrate diverse healthcare systems and standards, from HL7 FHIR to legacy EHR formats. A robust data platform can bridge these gaps, ensuring that AI applications have access to high-quality, structured data. Without interoperability, healthcare professionals face inefficiencies, delayed decision-making and difficulties in sharing critical patient information across different providers and regions. Modern healthcare interoperability solutions leverage AI to automate data mapping, translation and processing, reducing the manual effort required to make systems compatible. With the right data platform, South African healthcare organisations can overcome these integration hurdles, improving patient care co-ordination and enabling advanced analytics for proactive healthcare management. 2. Can you unify and govern patient data securely? With evolving regulations such as POPIA, data privacy is paramount. Healthcare organisations must not only comply with security standards but also establish governance frameworks that maintain data integrity while enabling innovation. Data breaches and unauthorised access can erode patient trust and lead to severe legal and financial repercussions. The solution lies in adopting advanced data governance strategies that include role-based access controls, encryption and blockchain-powered audit trails. AI-driven security tools can detect anomalies in real-time, identifying potential breaches before they occur. By implementing these measures, healthcare organisations can create a secure and compliant foundation for digital health initiatives. 3. Do you have the infrastructure to process large datasets at scale? AI models rely on real-time insights from vast amounts of data. Traditional systems may not be equipped to handle the processing demands of AI-driven healthcare applications, necessitating modern platforms that can scale efficiently. Many healthcare institutions still rely on outdated infrastructure, limiting their ability to support data-intensive AI projects. Cloud-based digital health platforms offer a cost-effective and scalable solution, enabling organisations to leverage high-performance computing resources without heavy capital investment. South African healthcare leaders must consider hybrid cloud models that balance data security with computational power, allowing AI-driven applications to thrive. 4. Can your organisation derive actionable insights from healthcare data? AI’s value lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights – whether for improving patient outcomes, enhancing operational efficiency or driving predictive healthcare. Without a strong analytics framework, valuable data remains underutilised. Advanced analytics, powered by machine learning, can detect patterns in patient records, predict disease outbreaks and even assist in clinical decision-making. Predictive models can help hospitals optimise resource allocation, reduce patient wait times and improve overall care quality. However, achieving these benefits requires an ecosystem where AI tools can seamlessly access, process and learn from diverse datasets. 5. Is your data truly AI-ready? Data inconsistencies, gaps and redundancies can compromise the effectiveness of AI applications. MedTech firms and healthcare providers must ensure that their data is standardised, cleaned and structured for AI-driven decision-making. Incomplete or biased datasets can lead to inaccurate predictions, creating risks for patient care and regulatory compliance. Investing in AI-ready data platforms that provide automated data cleansing, harmonisation and enrichment is essential. These platforms help transform fragmented data landscapes into comprehensive, reliable datasets that can fuel AI innovation and improve healthcare outcomes. The path forward In South Africa, forward-thinking organisations recognise the importance of investing in AI-ready data infrastructures. Digital health development platforms, such as InterSystems IRIS for Health, provide the essential building blocks to streamline integration, ensure compliance and unlock the full potential of AI-powered healthcare. By addressing data fragmentation and embracing a modern data architecture, South African healthcare organisations can position themselves at the forefront of digital transformation – delivering smarter, more efficient and more personalised patient care.

The U.S. Senator was joined on Tuesday by Michigan’s U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell and U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2025. “Every American has the right to health care, period,” Dingell said in a statement. “If you’re sick, you should be able to go to the doctor without being worried about the cost of treatment or prescription medicine. Too many families must decide between putting food on the table and getting medical care that they desperately need.” She added, “A health care system that ties coverage to employment will always leave patients vulnerable. It’s flat-out wrong and Medicare for All would put a stop to it. We’ve been fighting this fight since the 1940s, when my father-in-law helped author the first universal health care bill. It’s time to get this done.” Dingell is referring to John Dingell Sr., who drafted the first legislation that ultimately led to the creation of Medicare in 1965. Her late husband John Dingell Jr. introduced a single-payer health care plan every session he served in Congress until 2015, which Dingell has continued to do since winning his seat. A 2024 Gallup poll found 62% of Americans support universal healthcare . Despite this, the 2024 election was the first in decades where neither major party candidate campaigned on health care reform. That disconnect could explain the massive public interest in the case of Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old man who allegedly murdered the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a for-profit insurance company notorious for denying claims and blocking health care reform efforts . Related Diagnosing healthcare in America: The case for Medicare for All The insurance industry is killing us. Medicare for All could save us. “The American people understand, as I do, that health care is a human right, not a privilege and that we must end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all of its citizens,” Sanders said in a statement. “It is not acceptable to me, nor to the American people, that over 85 million people today are either uninsured or underinsured. Today, there are millions of people who would like to go to a doctor but cannot afford to do so. This is an outrage. In America, your health and your longevity should not be dependent on your wealth. Health care is a human right that all Americans, regardless of income, are entitled to and they deserve the best health care that our country can provide.” The Medicare for All Act would expand Medicare, currently eligible only for those age 65 or older and younger people with certain disabilities, to cover every person in the United States — including primary care, vision, dental, prescription drugs, mental health, reproductive health care, and more. The legislation also calls for the freedom for patients to choose care without worrying about the provider being in-network, as well as streamlining the health care system to negotiate drug prices and reduce the administrative waste that drives up costs. The legislation was endorsed by President Shawn Fain of the United Auto Workers labor union, among others. Related Bernie Sanders on his political future, Duggan going independent, and why ‘despair is not an option’ Metro Times spoke with the Senator ahead of his massive “Fighting Oligarchy” rally in Warren “Health care should be a human right,” Fain said. “But every time we negotiate with a boss for the right to see a doctor, they nickel and dime us until people have to choose between their health and putting food on the table. We’re sick of having to go on strike just to have decent health care.” He added, “We’re sick of corporate America asking us to give up raises, retirement security, or work-life balance at the bargaining table so working-class people can avoid medical bankruptcy. Our current health care system is a con job that only works for the billionaire class. Medicare for All is common sense, and it’s what the working class needs. The UAW is proud to support this bill.” Related Stories Abdul El-Sayed joins race for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat with Bernie Sanders endorsement The former public health director and one-time Whitmer rival is running on a platform supporting Medicare for All and an end to dark money in politics Diagnosing healthcare in America: The case for Medicare for All The insurance industry is killing us.

Wider healthcare platform adoption requires healthcare providers to show platform transparency and demonstrate ethical AI practices alongside patient education about AI-powered health solution advantages. AI for Health Care Matters Prosper Insights & Analytics Nader confirmed that “Trust remains a critical element for the organization. The AI systems run under medical professional guidance at our organization because they strengthen human expertise without replacing it.” A Holistic Approach to Healthcare and Well-Being Modern healthcare transforms its approach by adding mental health services, wellness education, and individualized treatments to its system. These AI-driven platforms unite various healthcare elements to develop an integrated, complete healthcare experience for patients. Doc.com drives this transformation through its no-cost mental health consultation services combined with wellness education and AI-based personalized patient care recommendations that improve treatment results. These digital healthcare platforms redefine patient wellness management by providing complete physical and mental health care within a unified digital space. The essence of healthcare extends beyond treating illnesses because Nader stated that “True healthcare requires tools which empower people to achieve better health results in their physical and mental aspects.” The Future of Healthcare AI technologies, together with telemedicine services, create an accessible healthcare system that delivers proactive, patient-centered care. The industry's progress will be led by companies that focus on ethical AI practices combined with transparent operations and consumer education about AI solutions, despite ongoing trust-building challenges. According to a McKinsey & Company report on healthcare innovation, “AI-driven innovations are poised to transform the healthcare sector by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment plans, and reducing operational inefficiencies.” This independent analysis reinforces the growing role of AI in shaping the future of healthcare, underscoring its potential to drive efficiency and deliver personalized care at scale. The healthcare industry is approaching a future with universal high-quality care because platforms such as Doc.com show AI-driven healthcare advantages. The upcoming years will decide how AI should be responsibly used to enhance worldwide health results. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

It also offers advanced tertiary and quaternary care across key specialities, including cardiac sciences, oncology, renal sciences, neurosciences, robotic surgery, pediatrics, and organ transplants. Soi said Delhi-NCR is a critical hub for advanced medical care, and Dwarka, given its strong connectivity to multiple parts of Delhi, is perfectly positioned to meet the region's growing healthcare needs. ""As a greenfield venture, this facility reflects our intent to expand meaningfully by building high-quality infrastructure in locations that improve accessibility,"" he noted.

Trump signed an executive order in February that renewed his order from his term in office that requires hospitals and health insurers to “deliver meaningful price information to the American people.” This allows consumers to price shop and find the best deal for their healthcare needs. Breitbart News reported on how the executive order could save consumers billions of dollars: The executive order cited a 2023 analysis that found that, if fully implemented, this could save as much as $80 billion in healthcare costs for consumers. A report from 2024 suggested that transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. Recent data has found that the cost of the top 25 percent of most healthcare services was reduced by 6.3 percent per year after the initial implementation of the transparency rule. The Trump administration believes that they will continue the president’s work to lower healthcare costs. “President Trump pledged to increase transparency and lower healthcare costs for everyday Americans. Promises made, promises kept – and we’re just getting started,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told Breitbart News in a written statement. Ilaria Santangelo, the director of research for Patient Rights Advocate, said in a statement to Breitbart News: President Trump delivering real prices in his first 100 days is a monumental achievement for the Make America Healthy Again movement. Without access to real prices, families across America are avoiding visits to the doctor for fear of unknown costs, preventing them from getting the care they need. Real prices in healthcare empower patients to make informed decisions and lay the foundation for a healthy America. Prioritizing price transparency so early on in his second term reaffirmed President Trump’s commitment to putting patients first and holding hospitals accountable. To celebrate Trump’s healthcare victories, the Patient Rights Advocate unveiled a Times Square billboard featuring “superhero” President Trump. The billboard will run in New York from April 28 to May 4 as well as on digital platforms across the country: Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on X @SeanMoran3 ."

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Heather Wishart-Smith is a board director who covers innovation. Follow Author Apr 28, 2025, 08:08pm EDT Apr 28, 2025, 09:22pm EDT Share Save Comment AI is transforming healthcare delivery getty Artificial intelligence is no longer a future disruptor – it’s already transforming healthcare delivery. From AI-assisted diagnostics to predictive analytics and virtual surgical planning, healthcare AI is reshaping how care is delivered, how clinical resources are managed, and how patients engage with the system. Captain (Ret.) Hassan Tetteh, MD Angie Vasquez At a recent book discussion at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia, retired U.S. Navy Captain and thoracic surgeon Dr. Hassan Tetteh explored these themes through the lens of his new book, Smarter Healthcare With AI: Harnessing Military Medicine to Revolutionize Healthcare for Everyone, Everywhere . Interviewed by Colonel (Ret.) Dr. Caesar Junker, a former presidential flight surgeon, Tetteh outlined a pragmatic vision for integrating AI into healthcare, informed by military deployments, academic medicine, and his leadership at the Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (now part of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office ). Real-World Results from Healthcare AI “I don’t think this is hyperbole,” Tetteh said. “AI is going to fundamentally change healthcare in the coming years. It already has in so many ways.” He points to real-world outcomes: Johns Hopkins’ AI-powered command center increased capacity for complex cancer cases by 60% and cut emergency room boarding time by 25%. A rural hospital in Michigan saw a 56% drop in cardiac and respiratory arrests after implementing an AI-enabled early warning system. Healthcare’s Structural Roadblocks Despite the promise, systemic challenges remain. “As a physician, I feel healthcare has failed people in a number of ways,” Junker said. “The science is there, but the step from provider to patient has been ignored.” MORE FOR YOU Dr. Tetteh's book Smarter Healthcare with AI Peter Cutts, book design by Analisa Smith Tetteh agreed, pointing to the fragmented nature of the system. “Healthcare is very amorphous,” he said. “Everyone has different incentives, such as insurance companies, hospitals, big pharma, providers, patients. Patients’ incentives rarely align with this.” Even proven technologies struggle to gain traction. To overcome this, Tetteh stresses three critical success factors: validation, scalability, and saleability. Without all three, even the most promising healthcare technologies are unlikely to reach widespread adoption. A National Security Imperative The resistance to AI in healthcare is reminiscent of the 18th-century fight against scurvy . The British Navy knew citrus prevented the disease, yet millions died before the cure was embraced. When adopted, it didn’t just save lives—it enhanced operational readiness. Tetteh argues that AI represents a similar inflection point for today’s healthcare and national security. “When service members cannot deploy because of health concerns, the ripple effect impacts our military’s defense capabilities,” he writes. “The DoD spends an estimated $3 billion annually on non-deployable Army personnel alone.” Healthcare AI for the Warfighter—and the Civilian From shipboard medicine on the USS Carl Vinson to trauma care in Afghanistan, Tetteh witnessed firsthand how constrained environments demand scalable, data-driven tools. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has launched a Triage Challenge , with a mission to bring AI to the warfighter. One application: smartphone-based AI that can predict internal bleeding using vital signs collected in the field. “The best tech may already exist,” he said. “We just need a way to onboard it.” Scaling Clinical Capacity with Healthcare AI Tetteh sees AI as key to expanding clinical capacity without scaling staffing. “Physicians aren’t going to be replaced,” he said. “But physicians who don’t use AI will be.” The World Bank projects a shortfall of 15 million healthcare workers by 2030, based on WHO data. Without AI, the global health system may struggle to close the gap. He envisions a near-future healthcare model where biometric sensors collect health data, AI models interpret results, and treatment is dispatched—all without a clinic visit. “We lived through a pandemic that fundamentally changed people’s expectations of care,” he said, noting the acceptance of virtual visits, care via chat and other online care. “Who’s going back to the old model?” Cautious Optimism—and Urgency Dr. Hassan Tetteh en route to a life-saving transplant case. A renknowned cardiothoracic surgeon and digital health expert, Tetteh combines frontline medical experience with forward-thinking insight on healthcare AI. Elijah Wells Tetteh is optimistic but realistic. He acknowledges risks in data quality, algorithmic bias, and regulatory complexity. Yet he’s confident in the trajectory. “The AI you’re using today is going to be the worst AI you’ll ever use in your life,” he said. The pace of innovation will only accelerate. His closing thought is pragmatic and human-centered: “AI will change everything—except the things that matter most.” The objective is not to replace clinicians, but to equip them to make smarter, faster, and more personalized decisions. As with citrus in the age of sail, the challenge isn’t discovering what works—it’s deploying healthcare AI at scale, with intention. Did you enjoy this story?

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Apr 28, 2025, 10:30am EDT Share Save Paulina Wierzbicka | Executive Director of SNAH Healthcare Software Management . getty When it comes to running a healthcare-centered organization, our greatest priority should be ensuring all patients within our circle of care can receive the best care possible. Yet research shows that over 60 million Americans have experienced difficulties accessing healthcare in traditional settings. What's more, many Americans aged 65 and older are homebound due to chronic conditions. One option that healthcare leaders can consider for bridging this gap is creating teams of mobile healthcare providers. In my experience leading a healthcare technology platform, I've seen firsthand how the mobile care model can address barriers that traditional systems often overlook. From reducing missed appointments to improving care for homebound patients, mobile physician services can provide a smarter, more human-centered approach to delivering care. Let’s take a closer look at what mobile physicians do and best practices for incorporating these services into your organization. Defining Mobile Physicians Mobile physicians are doctors who provide healthcare services to patients outside of traditional clinical settings. This can include everything from regular check-ups to urgent care. They often work in teams, accompanied by nurses, technicians and other healthcare professionals who provide a range of services during house calls. In my experience, these services can provide the most benefit to patients who are unable to travel to a medical facility due to mobility issues, chronic health conditions or other physical or mental limitations. Mobile physicians can make regular visits to monitor these conditions, adjusting treatment plans as needed and ensuring that patients stay informed about their health. Additionally, some patients find the act of visiting a doctor's office to be extremely stressful and tiring. With mobile physician care available, patients can receive care in the comfort of their own homes, reducing anxiety and stress associated with doctors' offices and travel. For healthcare organizations, the benefits can be just as compelling. I've found that mobile care can help reduce missed appointments while boosting engagement and retention. It can also position providers to tap into value-based reimbursement models, improve population health metrics and stand out in a marketplace that’s increasingly driven by accessibility and outcomes. In a system plagued by fragmentation, mobile care can deliver both clinical impact and operational edge. Best Practices For Building Your Team 1. Start small, scale fast. Don’t wait for perfect conditions—start where the need is highest. Launch a focused pilot targeting underserved patients or areas with high no-show rates, then use real-time data to refine your model. Once the program is well-established, I recommend scaling aggressively. Momentum matters. 2. Hire mission-driven providers, not just clinicians. Mobile care isn’t for everyone. You need providers who believe in the mission, thrive in fast-moving environments and can deliver world-class care without the structure of a traditional clinic. Look for those who lead with empathy but think like operators—independent, resourceful and invested in outcomes. 3. Build a hybrid model of in-person and digital. Based on my observations, the future of healthcare isn’t binary—it’s blended. Consider pairing house calls with telemedicine and remote monitoring to create a seamless, always-on care experience. I've found that this type of hybrid model can enhance continuity, boost engagement and drive measurable improvements in both outcomes and efficiency. 4. Treat logistics like a tech company would. At its core, mobile healthcare is a logistics operation. Equip your teams with intelligent routing systems, portable diagnostic tools, automated coordination with pharmacies and labs and real-time access to electronic health records (EHRs). Think operationally—this service is about delivering care with the precision of Amazon and the humanity of medicine. 5. Know the playbook for reimbursement and regulation. In my experience, sustainable innovation requires more than great outcomes—it requires financial and regulatory fluency. I recommend becoming familiar with the billing codes, coverage structures and policy levers tied to Medicare Advantage, Medicaid waivers and value-based care. Align your billing, legal and compliance teams early to ensure your mobile operations are not only impactful but also built to scale. The Future Of Mobile Healthcare As the demand for accessible healthcare grows, I believe the role of mobile physicians will continue to expand. Whether it’s senior transportation in the U.S., prescription delivery services or urgent care services, the ability to receive medical attention in the comfort of one's own home can make healthcare more accessible to those who need it most.

Article Insights Seyfarth Shaw LLP are most popular: within Compliance, Consumer Protection, Government and Public Sector topic(s) with readers working within the Business & Consumer Services and Construction & Engineering industries The healthcare industry continues to have greater union representation than the private-sector as a whole. And unions have taken advantage of their stronger position in the healthcare sector to push for increased wages and benefits, as well as less subcontracting of work in recent months. Although perhaps counter-intuitive, the strong economy and low unemployment rate have worked to strengthen Labor's hand because healthcare providers are already struggling to find qualified applicants to fill all open positions. As a result, when faced with a potential labor shortage, healthcare providers have few options for temporary assistance to keep operations going during a strike. This reality has allowed unions to aggressively push for their demands in 2019. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, one in every seven jobs created in the U.S. in 2018 came in the healthcare sector. The growth in healthcare demand and jobs is due to coalescing of factors, including an aging healthcare workforce, retirement of the Baby Boomer generation, and a slowing nationwide population growth. The growing need for healthcare services has coupled with a historically low employment rate to put increased pressure on healthcare providers to raise the wages and benefits of their workforce. For example, in September 2019, the national unemployment rate declined to 3.5%. Moreover, the unemployment rate in the healthcare sector remains substantially lower than the national average, at 2.2%. And healthcare providers have been unable to fill all open positions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in July 2019 (the latest month for which numbers are available), healthcare providers filled only about half of reported job openings. Furthermore, workers in the health care sector are more likely to be members of a union than workers in the overall private sector—7.7% compared to 6.4% in 2018. Unions have taken advance of their stronger position in the healthcare sector and the economics of a stronger economy to push for increased pay and benefits. Indeed, healthcare sector unions flexed their muscles in 2019 on a larger (and more aggressive) scale than recent years, demanding greater pay and benefits, that fewer jobs be outsourced during the life of a contract, and that healthcare providers use fewer contract and temporary workers. For example, in September more than 80,000 technicians, nurses, and other medical personnel at a national healthcare provider voted to authorize a strike. Similarly, about 2,200 nurses at a Chicago-area hospital] went on strike at the end of September. Nor have unions limited their campaigns to traditional economic pressure. Unions have also brought political pressure to bear, including endorsements from Presidential candidates and other political allies. Faced with such challenges, healthcare providers are under significant pressure to meet the workers' demands. For example, it can be very difficult in such a tight job market to find temporary workers who can fill-in while a strike takes place. For its part, the national healthcare provider and the union recently reached a deal that included increased wages and benefits for its workers, and that staved off the proposed strike. In short, companies in the healthcare sector should anticipate increased pressure from unions as long as the economy remains strong and politics continue to focus on healthcare. This means taking a hard look at Labor's demands and analyzing the effect that a restrictive labor contract might place on a company's ability to adapt to a quickly-changing healthcare industry.

Looking Ahead HCA management reaffirmed guidance, forecasting full-year 2025 revenue between $72.8 billion and $75.8 billion, with adjusted EBITDA projected to range from $14.3 billion to $15.1 billion.

Projections from the Association of American Medical Colleges indicate a shortfall of up to 19,900 surgical specialist physicians.

View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.eh7dgy3gv In the emotionally complex world of dementia care, communication is more than just what we say – it’s how we say it. Terms of endearment like “darling”, “my lovely” and “sweetheart” are often used by healthcare staff with the best intentions: to comfort, connect and show warmth. But some people believe that elderspeak may sound patronising. For my doctoral research , I collaborated with a team of researchers who study real-life acute hospital interactions by examining video recordings of how healthcare professionals communicate with dementia patients . The researchers use these insights to develop training programs for healthcare workers. In my research, I focused on the use of elderspeak – a style of speech often directed at older adults. It typically involves a higher-pitched tone, simplified grammar and sentence structure and the use of terms of endearment. Some people compare elderspeak to the way someone might speak to a young child, which is why it’s often viewed as patronising. Terms of endearment – like love, sweetheart, or darling – are particularly controversial and frequently debated in healthcare settings. Some people have strong opinions about ‘elderspeak’ and assume it’s patronising. Yet, despite these concerns – and that healthcare professionals are discouraged from using terms of endearment during training – the data showed that experienced healthcare professionals were using the terms regularly, suggesting that they might actually serve a valuable purpose in communication. When I closely analysed a range of real-life hospital interactions where terms of endearment were used, that’s exactly what I found. Three key themes emerged from the data. 1. Mirroring First, healthcare professionals weren’t the only people using these terms. Terms of endearment were used responsively – so both patients with dementia and staff used them, reflecting or mirroring each other’s language. This resulted in positive interactions. For example, a patient saying “OK duck” when a doctor asked them if they could sit the hospital bed up higher, and the doctor responding with “all right mate”. These examples shows that terms of endearment can be helpful for building rapport and trust between staff and patients. 2. Signposting Second, terms of endearment were used at the beginning and end of conversations between staff and patients. In this case, terms of endearment were helpful for signposting and giving information about context to patients. Previous work has shown that people living with dementia can struggle with recognising cues in conversation. So, a term of endearment could help to signal that a conversation is coming to an end, such as a nurse saying: “Alright darling, it’s lovely to speak to you.” This is not surprising since people use terms of endearment to signal the end of conversations in many social settings. For example, in a shop, a cashier might say “Thanks very much, love!” to signal the end of the transaction. Terms of endearment were also used regularly when conversations began, signalling that the healthcare professional who has come to speak to the person with dementia is someone familiar or friendly. Although in this case, the healthcare professional would need to show caution depending on context and whether they’re familiar to the patient. For example, one doctor opened a conversation with: “Hello my dear, you haven’t seen me for a while, have you?” The conversation continued with no issue. Another doctor used a very similar opening of: “Hi darling, I’m Ethan I’m the doctor for today.” In this case some conversational trouble followed. The difference here is that in the first example the doctor’s words demonstrate he has met the patient before. In the second, the words show they are unfamiliar. 3. Mitigation A third way terms of endearment are used is to mitigate or minimise an imposition on a patient. Examples of this are: • When a healthcare professional asks a patient to repeat something if their words were hard to interpret or unclear. For example: “What my lovely? Say that again.” • When a healthcare professional is giving an instruction during a healthcare task. For instance: “Just bend this knee my love.” • When a healthcare professional is responding to a patient expressing unease or discomfort – often when an unpleasant but medically necessary medical task is occurring, such as a blood test. For instance: “I won’t be a second darling.” In these cases, the terms of endearment work to soften whatever the healthcare professional is doing. This can help to save face – avoid or reduce embarrassment on the part of the patient – particularly in cases where the healthcare professional has to ask them to repeat a comment or question. It can also aid in minimising whatever the professional is doing – similar to if someone said “We’re just going to do xyz,” rather than “We are going to do xzy.” Terms of endearment also acknowledge the sensitivity of the healthcare situation. While there were many examples of terms of endearment being used successfully in healthcare settings, they are not a magic bullet that can improve every situation. There were a couple of examples in the data of patients rejecting terms of endearment. In both cases, patients were particularly distressed about the healthcare activity at hand – a painful injection, for example. In these cases, the terms of endearment were not enough to excuse the action that the healthcare professional was trying to do. This is therefore an example of where context and sensitivity to the individual situation are important. Language Dementia Health Society Educate me"

This was disclosed by the Deputy Governor, Ikechukwu Emetu, on Wednesday, during the State’s Taskforce on Primary Health Care quarterly meeting. Emetu, who doubles as the Chairman of the committee, frowned at the ugly incidents of such practices, describing them as obnoxious, unhealthy, and encourages mother and child mortality rates. He called for collaboration between the state’s Primary Health Care Development Agency and stakeholders such as the religious bodies, traditional institutions and the local authorities to ensure a seamless immunization delivery. Emetu, who said that such a partnership will overcome cultural and social barriers to immunization, rejection and non-compliance, stated that the administration of Governor Alex Otti is fostering health care accessibility and prompt delivery. In his address, the Executive Secretary, Abia State Primary Health Care Development Agency, ABSPHCDA Dr Kalu Ulu Kalu expressed happiness over the ongoing construction and equipping of 200 Health Centres across the state by the governor.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250424681712/en/ Ken Shinomiya, Leader of Asahi Kasei's Healthcare Sector Having served as Vice President of Strategy at ZOLL Medical Corporation from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, Shinomiya became Head of the Bioprocess Division of Asahi Kasei Medical in April 2019 and President of Asahi Kasei Medical in April 2023. In April 2025, he was named President of Asahi Kasei Life Science, the successor company to the bioprocess business of Asahi Kasei Medical. With operations focused on products and services that support the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, the life science business has grown globally by ascertaining market needs and business opportunities within the pharmaceutical industry. Under Shinomiya's leadership, the life science business has successfully expanded from its foundational Planova virus removal filters through the addition of contract research organization (CRO) testing services as well as the biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) business of Bionova Scientific in the U.S. Asahi Kasei's Healthcare Sector has dramatically globalized since the 2012 acquisition of ZOLL Medical Corporation with its U.S.-based business platform in critical care. Since then, the Healthcare Sector has accelerated its growth strategy as a diverse global healthcare company by accurately discerning market needs, making proactive investments including M&A, and moving its headquarters to the U.S. in 2023. This has leveraged the strength of Asahi Kasei's Healthcare business while enhancing global management. Under the new leadership, the Healthcare Sector will continue to execute a long-term strategy to grow its pharmaceutical, life science, and critical care businesses. Guided by its mission to ""Improve and save patients' lives,"" the sector is committed to delivering innovative therapeutics and medical devices that address unmet medical needs and contribute to better patient outcomes worldwide. It will serve as the main growth driver of the Asahi Kasei Group, targeting operating income of ¥150 billion in 2030. ""For over a century, the Asahi Kasei Group has created distinctive business models leveraging creativity and innovation to provide exceptional products and services to the world,"" said Ken Shinomiya, Leader of Asahi Kasei's Healthcare Sector. ""Our healthcare business exemplifies Asahi Kasei's unique ability to effectively integrate the advanced, efficiency-oriented management approaches gained through global acquisitions. Moving forward, we will further evolve based on our blended international outlook as we continue to lead the growth and globalization of the Asahi Kasei Group.""

Stewart United Parcel Service agreed to buy Canada's Andlauer Healthcare Group for roughly $1.6 billion in an effort to grow in healthcare transportation and logistics. Under the terms of a definitive agreement between the companies, the delivery-and-logistics giant will pay 55 Canadian dollars, the equivalent of $39.62, per share in cash for Andlauer. The offer, representing a total price of about C$2.2 billion, marks a 31% premium to the Andlauer's last closing price. Andlauer, a supply-chain management company that offers specialized temperature-controlled transportation for the healthcare industry, is set to bolster UPS's healthcare business and extend its ability to offer so-called cold-chain solutions and precision logistics, UPS said. Andlauer is to become part of UPS Healthcare's global network, but remain headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario. Founder and Chief Executive Michael Andlauer is slated to lead UPS Canada Healthcare and Andlauer. Kate Gutmann, UPS executive vice president and president of international, healthcare and supply chain solutions, said the addition of Andlauer would allow the company to deliver expanded capability to customers and would contribute to overall growth plans. ""Next-generation treatments are driving more complexity than ever, expanding the needs of healthcare customers and increasing demand for the integrated, end-to-end cold-chain solutions UPS Healthcare provides,"" Gutmann said. Closing of the transaction is targeted for the second half of 2025, subject to approval by Andlauer shareholders and regulatory reviews. The deal is supported by Michael Andlauer, who is the indirect holder of about 53% of his company's outstanding shares and 82% of the votes entitled to be cast to approve the transaction. The Canadian company's board also approved the agreement with UP and recommends shareholders vote in favor of the deal. The companies said that when the deal closes, they expect Andlauer's subordinate voting shares will be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Andlauer said it plans to continue to declare a C$0.12 a share quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis until the closing of the transaction. Write to Robb M.

Its non-GAAP profit of $6.08 per share was 2.1% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Molina Healthcare? Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free . Molina Healthcare (MOH) Q1 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $11.15 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.86 billion (12.2% year-on-year growth, 2.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $6.08 vs analyst estimates of $5.96 (2.1% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $508 million vs analyst estimates of $520.8 million (4.6% margin, 2.5% miss) Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $24.50 at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Operating Margin: 3.9%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 1.5%, similar to the same quarter last year Customers: 5.8 million, up from 5.54 million in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $17.57 billion Company Overview Founded in 1980 as a provider for underserved communities in Southern California, Molina Healthcare ( NYSE: MOH ) provides managed healthcare services primarily to low-income individuals through Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace insurance programs across 21 states. Health Insurance Providers Upfront premiums collected by health insurers lead to reliable revenue, but profitability ultimately depends on accurate risk assessments and the ability to control medical costs. Health insurers are also highly sensitive to regulatory changes and economic conditions such as unemployment. Going forward, the industry faces tailwinds from an aging population, increasing demand for personalized healthcare services, and advancements in data analytics to improve cost management. However, continued regulatory scrutiny on pricing practices, the potential for government-led reforms such as expanded public healthcare options, and inflation in medical costs could add volatility to margins. One big debate among investors is the long-term impact of AI and whether it will help underwriting, fraud detection, and claims processing or whether it may wade into ethical grey areas like reinforcing biases and widening disparities in medical care. Sales Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Molina Healthcare’s sales grew at an impressive 19.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Molina Healthcare’s annualized revenue growth of 13.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 5.8 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Molina Healthcare’s customer base averaged 4.1% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent more money each year on the company’s products and services. This quarter, Molina Healthcare reported year-on-year revenue growth of 12.2%, and its $11.15 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 2.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. We still think its growth trajectory is satisfactory given its scale and indicates the market is baking in success for its products and services. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. Molina Healthcare was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 4.2% was weak for a healthcare business. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin decreased by 1.2 percentage points over the last five years. A silver lining is that on a two-year basis, its margin has stabilized. We like Molina Healthcare and hope it can right the ship. In Q1, Molina Healthcare generated an operating profit margin of 3.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Molina Healthcare’s EPS grew at a spectacular 14.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 19.4% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes. Diving into the nuances of Molina Healthcare’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 1.2 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q1, Molina Healthcare reported EPS at $6.08, up from $5.73 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 2.1%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Molina Healthcare’s full-year EPS of $23 to grow 11.4%. Key Takeaways from Molina Healthcare’s Q1 Results We enjoyed seeing Molina Healthcare beat analysts’ revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also happy its customer base narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed. Still, this quarter had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $332 immediately after reporting. Indeed, Molina Healthcare had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free ."

Article Insights Wiley Rein are most popular: within Compliance topic(s) with readers working within the Insurance industries As the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same – and the world of health care fraud enforcement is no exception. Recent years have seen a wave of novel technologies, emerging threats to our nation's health, and a regulatory and statutory regime struggling to keep up. Yet at least one constant has been in the periphery of the health care industry without fail: the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). And, while recent actions by DOJ may lead some to believe there will be less health care fraud enforcement under the Trump Administration, that could not be further from the truth. If anything, health care fraud enforcement is likely to be invigorated while, at the same time, companies will have to navigate a much more uncertain regulatory landscape. DOJ (and its local equivalents) have hunted for wrongdoing in the health care industry for as long as the government has had a hand in paying for it. And unlike some other DOJ components, those tasked with rooting out health care fraud typically enjoy bipartisan support for those efforts. For example, President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act strengthened enforcement with its provision creating per se False Claims Act liability for any violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; on the other side of the aisle, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) has been a vocal advocate for whistleblower incentives since the 1980s and continues to advance that cause today. Both of those endeavors measurably advanced health care fraud enforcement, with generally favorable responses from the electorate of both parties. The appeal of health care fraud enforcement is no mystery; in the last 10 years, the DOJ Criminal Health Care Fraud Unit has charged over $30 billion worth of fraud, while the Civil Division's health care fraud group has actually recovered over $20 billion in that same period. In other words, these prosecutions look great on a balance sheet. The Trump Administration has made its mark by defying traditional expectations in many respects – but when it comes to health care fraud, the Trump DOJ appears likely to continue the trend of vigorous enforcement. In fact, the units charged with investigating and prosecuting these cases have increased in headcount and investigative capacity. Trial attorneys from areas of reduced DOJ enforcement (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example) have seen much of their census reallocated to criminal health care fraud investigations in recent months. With the recent disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, additional DOJ trial attorneys may be swelling those ranks even more. This should serve as a signal to everyone in the health care industry that increased scrutiny is likely on its way. Indeed, with so many more experienced trial attorneys shifting their focus to health care fraud, prospective defendants that might have flown under DOJ's radar last year could find themselves under its microscope this year. Of course, there are other factors that health care industry players must navigate, such as impacts from the leadership shake-up at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which has had an Acting Inspector General since Christi Grimm was removed from that position in January (along with a group of Inspectors General from various other agencies). HHS-OIG is a primary enforcement partner of DOJ when it comes to health care fraud, along with FBI, so uncertainty at the agency level may cause cases to drag out. The landscape of health care is also rapidly shifting, as issues such as vaccination, research, and drug pricing are brought to the forefront of the public discourse. Artificial intelligence (AI), moving at light speed into the world of health care provision, was previously the subject of scrutiny by the Biden Administration. But the Trump Administration on January 20 revoked Biden's Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence – and the next day, President Trump announced ""Project Stargate,"" a $500 billion private-sector initiative promoting AI technology. Health care providers have been left uncertain whether they can rely on the security, impartiality, or accuracy of new technologies. The present uncertainty extends beyond technology, leaving those in the industry to speculate as to when and where the enforcement hammer may swing next. As one example, in the area of reproductive health, it is conceivable that emboldened states may seek to impose restrictive policy goals through the existing fraud enforcement mechanisms if their more direct efforts are stymied by courts or voters. Likewise, drug pricing, rebate programs, and pharmacy benefit manager arrangements may find their way into more criminal or civil complaints soon, as the hunt for fraud, waste, and abuse turns its eye towards pharmaceuticals. And, on an even more basic level, the health care sector must navigate the shifting policy landscape around diversity and inclusion in a way that serves patients and protects employees. Keeping up with these evolutions is critical for compliance officers and in-house counsel. Given the heightened wave of enforcement forecast here, it may be prudent to conduct holistic reviews of your organization's policies, practices, and audit functions. Health care fraud risks from reliance on AI are an emerging area well worth taking the time to assess by ensuring that your organization is securing data, seeding the models with accurate information, and educating employees on the appropriate usage of the technology. Internal whistleblower programs are another area that organizations will be well-served by revisiting and revamping to ensure your employees are heard and action is taken. With more government attorneys ready to run with new tips and an appetite for enforcement, it wouldn't take much for a squeaky wheel on the inside to become a thorn in your organization's outside. Wiley's Health Care and White Collar Defense practices are adept in helping clients implement the steps recommended here, tailored to the specific needs of each organization. Working in collaboration with the firm's seasoned employment, life sciences, and intellectual property attorneys, we are available to consult and assist on any issues in this time of increased enforcement. After all, while the landscape may be changing every day, the importance of ensuring compliance across the board is the same as it ever has been. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

After all the progress he’d made with his therapist on his anxiety, he saw his insurance company had only covered 50% of his appointments—not the 80% he was used to for other health care visits. Since he was getting help for his brain, shouldn’t seeing a therapist be covered the same as seeing a neurologist? It’s not only patients who are frustrated–providers are frustrated, too. Lower coverage and limited visits mean many patients don’t get all the care they need. Anyone who has been discharged after just 30 days of inpatient substance use disorder treatment knows this all too well. The need for a more equitable system With physical health care, the more serious a patient’s condition is, the more health insurance companies typically cover. And not just two or three times more—exponentially more. One reason for this is medical health care has thousands more quantifiable measures of illness that can be billed than mental health care does. This disparity limits providers’ ability to demonstrate to insurance carriers what care their patients need. If the teacher mentioned above had suffered a physical head injury, every test, blood draw, procedure, and surgery would have been billed separately, whereas his mental health visits probably had only one or two billable charges. That’s despite the duration of mental health care often being long and complicated due to the chronic nature of many mental health conditions. ""There's a translation problem; there isn't a complete language developed to support the span of mental health needs that exist."" Mental health care also takes time and personal attention from care providers, which is exactly why it’s so impactful—but also so economically challenging. The gold standard is still one-to-one care that can’t be easily delivered or streamlined through technology. ""We want our patients to be able to get back to their lives as quickly as possible, and we celebrate when someone feels better,"" says Ian Macdonald, MHA, MBA, Senior Director of Finance at Huntsman Mental Health Institute. ""But there isn’t one perfect mechanism to show the before and after in mental health, like seeing a broken bone in an X-ray and then seeing it healed in another. This lack of quantifiable measures of care feeds right back into the economic challenges of mental health care."" The importance of Quantifying care To remedy these challenges, Huntsman Mental Health Institute, part of the world-class care system at University of Utah Health, is working to better define quantifiable measures of acuity, or sickness. ""We're getting close to the point where we can prove these numbers with research and use them to improve the option that hospitals and insurers have to quantify the cost of care,"" Macdonald says. ""It's where mental health care needs to go."" ""Placing a dollar amount on the societal benefits of mental health is the panacea."" A recent study showed that untreated mental health conditions cost the US economy $282 billion every year. But proving out the benefits is harder to measure. This year, Huntsman Mental Health Institute partnered with the Sorenson Impact Institute to research and quantify the societal and economic benefits of mental health. ""The early indicators are promising,"" says Mark Rapaport, MD ""Building a monetization framework and conducting a socioeconomic impact analysis will help bring more attention and investment in this space, which can dramatically benefit society as a whole.' There is no health without mental health Implementing more sustainable mental health care models pays dividends for our physical health According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , when we’re mentally healthy, we’re much less likely to smoke, eat unhealthy food, use substances, and develop heart disease, diabetes, or other kinds of secondary physical ailments. And that’s good business for everyone. Ways to shift your thinking about mental health the impact of collaborative care Another solution to the economic challenges is the integration of behavioral health and medical health services. Huntsman Mental Health Institute now uses the Collaborative Care Model , which brings early mental health care intervention into all University of Utah Health primary care clinics . All patients receive a mental health screening at a primary care visit. If care is indicated, behavioral health professionals collaborate with the primary care provider to treat mental health conditions in the same setting as medical problems—reducing stigma and siloed care. They also make referrals to the next level of treatment. It’s part of a stepped care model where the most effective yet least resource intensive treatment is delivered first, which helps patients get care before symptoms get worse and are harder to treat. Outcome data show that 74% of patients receiving integrated care had clinically significant improvement, with a drop of over 5 points in depression scores. Last year, 17,641 screenings were completed as part of the Collaborative Care program. Huntsman Mental Health Institute is unique in that it offers two models of care in the integrated health program: 1) Primary Care Behavioral Health and 2) Collaborative Care in both primary care and specialty care settings. Rarely do integrated programs offer both. It's not only about the money The economic challenges of mental health care are influenced by more than just dollars and cents. For example, fear and prejudice weigh heavily on decisions to seek care. The brain is difficult to assess and measure. Mental health disorders are complex compared with the average medical condition. And many health systems aren’t keeping up with advances in treatments or using validated methods to measure symptoms and progress. Huntsman Mental Health Institute is working to change these dynamics by: Expanding a continuum of care so patients receive the right level of care for their specific needs. Understanding that many patients may only need one visit, while some will need multiple visits with different services across the continuum of care. Emphasizing preventive and primary intervention programs, such as school-based care programs. Using stepped models of care, such as the Collaborative Care Model first, followed by specialty care when needed. These approaches help increase access to care while decreasing costs. And that’s better for everyone. Stories of impact, joy, and progress Learn more about what we're doing to make changes in mental health care.

MANILA, Philippines — Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (Lourdes Hospital) continues to make waves in championing the future of Philippine healthcare, this time on the international stage. Lourdes Hospital was presented with the Best Marketing Initiative Award at the Healthcare Asia Awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia last April 10. The award was in recognition of the hospital’s BIDA Lourdes: Sci-Tech Champs marketing campaign that aims to nurture the next generation of healthcare professionals while promoting the value of health and wellness towards students, parents, and teachers. The Healthcare Asia Awards is an awards program that recognizes outstanding hospitals, clinics and healthcare companies across Asia that redefine excellence in the healthcare industry. Out of all of the entries from across the continent, Lourdes Hospital was selected as one of this year’s awardees. Launched in 2023, BIDA Lourdes is a collaboration between Lourdes Hospital and the Department of Education NCR that aims to bridge the gaps between healthcare and education. It engages elementary and high school students in interactive, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)-focused activities such as quiz bowls, robotics challenges, science fairs and work immersion programs. This is alongside promoting preventive health practices through free health screenings and discounts for consultations and medical services at Lourdes Hospital. Now on its third year, the campaign expanded with thousands of students from hundreds of schools across Metro Manila joining in the campaign’s activities that has garnered a reach of one million people on social media. The campaign has also garnered partners from government and private organizations who share the same passion as Lourdes Hospital for the future of healthcare, like University of the Philippines Rural High School, Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and De La Salle Santiago Zobel School among others. As the hospital celebrates this milestone, it also looks ahead to continue building the future of healthcare by promoting the importance of academics and overall wellness. Through the programs and activities that combine science, technology and healthcare, Lourdes Hospital will continue to increase its reputation as a healthcare provider and as an advocate of quality education.

More than a quarter of adults in West Virginia rate their health as fair or poor, and the state leads the nation in physical and mental health challenges,” ProfitDuel add, citing data from the West Virginia Department of Health. “High rates of chronic illness and low physical activity drive up healthcare costs, and despite efforts to improve public health, demand for care continues to exceed available resources.” To establish which state spends the most on health care, ProfitDuel analyzed the U.S. Census Bureau data – revealing that West Virginia spends the highest percentage of its income on health care. The state’s average annual household income was $75,575, with $6,249.65 spent on health care each year, accounting for 8.27% of the total income. Montana ranked as the state with the second-highest percentage of income spent on health care. With an average household income of $90,142 and an annual health care expenditure of $6,992.40, Montana residents spend 7.76% of their income on health care. “With Montana residents spending 7.76% of their income on healthcare, the financial strain is clear,” ProfitDuel’s statement continues. “Limited healthcare access, high insurance costs, and an aging population contribute to rising expenses, making affordability a growing concern.” Spending the most The following five states are spending the highest percentage of their income on health care: West Virginia – 8.27% Montana – 7.76% Iowa – 7.75% Arkansas – 7.69% Maine – 7.69% Spending the least On the other end of the scale, the following states ranked the best overall, spending the lowest percentage of income on health care: Hawaii – 6.26% New York – 6.30% California – 6.39% New Jersey – 6.47% Connecticut – 6.48% ProfitDuel highlighted Hawaii’s top ranking, attributing its lower healthcare spending to several key factors. “Hawaii stands out due to its high rate of insured residents, widespread access to healthcare, and some of the lowest obesity rates in the nation,” the spokesperson adds. “A favorable lifestyle, combined with strong state healthcare initiatives, helps keep costs manageable, making it the most affordable state for healthcare relative to income.” In this article: expenditure , Health , Medicine Written By Dr. Tim Sandle Dr. Tim Sandle is Digital Journal's Editor-at-Large for science news.

As consolidation trends continue, independent providers must navigate challenges such as rising operational costs, shifting reimbursement models, and competition from hospital-affiliated networks. At First Citizens National Bank, we recognize the financial strain this shift places on independent practices and offer solutions to help them remain competitive. The Growing Trend of Healthcare Consolidation In recent years, hospital systems and large healthcare organizations have been acquiring smaller independent practices across Ohio. This trend is driven by several factors, including: Financial Pressures: Rising administrative costs, regulatory compliance, and technology investments make it difficult for smaller practices to remain independent. Reimbursement Challenges: Insurance companies often negotiate better reimbursement rates with larger healthcare systems, putting independent providers at a disadvantage. Access to Resources: Larger systems offer advanced technologies, integrated electronic health records (EHRs), and streamlined administrative support, making it harder for smaller practices to compete. Key Challenges for Independent Practices 1. Financial Strain from Rising Costs Operating an independent medical practice requires significant investment in equipment, staffing, and technology. The rising costs of malpractice insurance, medical supplies, and compliance with new healthcare regulations make it challenging for smaller practices to sustain profitability. 2. Competitive Pressure from Large Healthcare Networks As more healthcare providers consolidate under large systems, independent practices face difficulty in negotiating contracts with insurance providers. Patients may also be steered toward hospital-affiliated providers due to network agreements, limiting the patient base for smaller practices. 3. Increased Administrative Burdens Independent practitioners must manage billing, insurance claims, and regulatory compliance on their own, often requiring additional staff and resources. The complexity of healthcare regulations adds another layer of operational difficulty for those without the infrastructure of a larger system. Financial Strategies to Support Independent Practices Despite these challenges, independent practices can take proactive steps to strengthen their financial position and remain viable in Ohio's evolving healthcare market. 1. Business Loans for Expansion and Technology Upgrades Investing in new medical technology, EHR systems, or facility improvements can help independent practices stay competitive. A business loan or equipment financing solution can provide the necessary capital to make these upgrades without straining cash flow. 2. Lines of Credit for Cash Flow Management Fluctuating insurance reimbursements and delayed payments can create cash flow issues. A business line of credit provides financial flexibility, allowing practices to cover operational costs, payroll, and unexpected expenses while waiting for reimbursements. 3. Merchant Services for Efficient Payment Processing Optimizing revenue cycle management is essential for independent practices. Merchant services , including automated billing and online payment options, can streamline collections and improve cash flow, reducing administrative burdens. 4. Treasury Management for Financial Efficiency By utilizing treasury management services , independent practices can better control expenses, manage vendor payments, and optimize cash reserves. Digital banking tools can help improve financial oversight and reduce time spent on administrative tasks. Positioning for Long-Term Success While the landscape of Ohio's healthcare industry is shifting, independent practices still play a crucial role in providing personalized, patient-centered care. By leveraging financial strategies and innovative solutions, independent providers can maintain autonomy and continue to serve their communities effectively. At FCNB, we are committed to supporting independent healthcare providers with tailored financial solutions. Whether you need financing for growth, tools for better cash flow management, or expert financial guidance, our team is here to help. Let's work together to keep independent practices strong and Ohio's healthcare industry diverse.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other innovative healthcare stocks to watch in 2025. In the US, healthcare costs and prices have been increasing. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, U.S. healthcare spending increased 7.5% from 2022 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. In 2023, the healthcare industry made up 17.6% of the US economy, an increase of 17.4% from 2022. The growth of Medicare and private health insurance is the two leading causes of this increase. Impact of Tariffs on the US Healthcare Industry and China Relations The impact of tariffs on this continuing trend has become a significant bone of contention in the healthcare industry as more and more US corporations turn to China for agreements on the next breakthrough chemical, whether in the areas of obesity or cancer. Carlo Rizzuto, managing director of Versant Ventures, spoke on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on February 7 about the impact of tariffs on healthcare. Rizzuto says that tariffs may impact the sector in two ways. Products made in China and sold in the US or other countries would be the first. The industry would need to watch how the tariffs are used in the market to comprehend how they would impact such trade operations. Second, and more precisely, the US healthcare industry relies heavily on China as a basis for contract production and research. Consequently, anything that raises that price is probably going to make the market more difficult. Cost hikes won't help the healthcare industry's management, which is already under pressure from investors. Speaking on China's enormous impact in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, Rizzuto said that the vast majority of healthcare companies use a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some capacity during the research and development phase. As a result, it significantly affects how the nation's biotech and pharmaceutical industries function. This trend is rather common in businesses of all sizes. In other words, the lack of infrastructure to facilitate the transfer prevents healthcare corporations from reshoring all of their externalized R&D and production to the United States. Therefore, it is hard to imagine how such a large-scale reshoring might occur. The amount of tariffs imposed can be used to determine the expenses of achieving this objective linearly. According to McKinsey, healthcare EBITDA will rise from a starting point of $676 billion in 2023 to $987 billion in 2028 at a 7% CAGR. Recovery from post-pandemic lows is anticipated to spur progress in several areas, even though development is anticipated to be faster in some (such as specialized pharmacy and HST). Software platforms are essential to the healthcare ecosystem because they let payers and providers operate more effectively in a complex environment. Story Continues By automating procedures, fostering data connectivity, and producing actionable insights, technological innovation (such as generative AI and machine learning) keeps providing opportunities for stakeholders from all industries. McKinsey predicts that increased utilization and pipeline expansion (as in cancer) will result in a considerable increase in specialty pharmacy income. Specialty pharmacy profit pools are continuing to grow as a result of the rise in the use of specialty medications. Our Methodology For this article, we began by screening the top holdings of the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH) to focus on prominent companies within the U.S. healthcare sector. From this list, we selected the top 10 holdings based on their weight in the ETF portfolio. We then ranked these stocks according to the number of hedge funds holding positions in each company as of Q4 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey's hedge fund tracking database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Jim Cramer: UnitedHealth (UNH) “Defines What People Want” - Totally Domestic and in Demand A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE: UNH ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 150 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) tops our list for being one of the best healthcare stocks . It operates in the healthcare sector in the US and globally, with four main segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. The board of directors approved a $2.10 quarterly dividend per share on February 24. In line with its previous forecasts, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) produced approximately $400 billion in revenue in 2024 and adjusted earnings per share of $27.66. Throughout the year, it concentrated on improving the customer experience, speeding up innovation, and honing its business plan for sustained expansion to solidify its position going forward. Over $16 billion was distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while over $17 billion was allocated to expansion initiatives. The company anticipates operational cash flow to be 1.2 times its net income in 2025, or around $33 billion. Optum Rx, a division of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), announced modifications to its payment models on March 20 to better reflect pharmacy expenses impacted by manufacturer pricing. The changes go into effect right away, and they will be fully implemented by January 2028. More than 24,000 independent community pharmacies in Optum Rx's non-affiliated network will profit from this change, which attempts to give customers more reliable and reasonably priced prices. Overall UNH ranks 1st among the innovative healthcare stocks to watch in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Brisbane, Australia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 17, 2025) - NextClinic, an Australia-based digital health platform, announced today it has received full electronic prescription (e-script) certification, allowing it to issue electronic prescriptions nationwide. NextClinic Marks Milestone in Australia's Digital Healthcare Landscape After Achieving Nationwide E-Script Approval To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8814/248877_068c9b1ab4875af2_002full.jpg Electronic prescriptions, commonly called e-scripts, digitally replicate traditional paper prescriptions and are legally recognized by pharmacies nationwide. This advancement removes barriers to medication access, allowing prescriptions to be issued instantly and securely online. Patients will no longer need to visit healthcare providers in person merely to renew prescriptions or obtain medication for minor ailments. NextClinic's approval represents a key milestone in the country's digital healthcare landscape as it accelerates the shift toward secure and accessible telehealth services. ""This marks a critical step forward in our mission to deliver accessible and secure healthcare solutions for patients across Australia,"" said Htet Aung Shine, the company's CTO. ""With full e-script conformance, we now offer a service that not only enhances convenience but significantly improves the continuity of care for individuals who rely on regular medications or quick treatment for common illnesses."" According to NextClinic, full e-script capability mainly benefits rural and remote populations, who historically faced longer travel times and fewer healthcare options. Now, patients across Australia, from urban centres to remote regions, have equal access to immediate, reliable, and compliant medical care. NextClinic's platform offers not just e-scripts but a suite of related digital healthcare services, including issuing digital medical certificates. These certificates fulfil requirements for work or educational institutions and come directly from certified medical professionals registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Each digital certificate is fully compliant and verifiable, eliminating traditional paperwork and delays associated with obtaining official medical documentation. ""Digital healthcare needs to address real-world challenges effectively, and the introduction of our fully compliant digital medical certificates complements our e-script services,"" said Htet Aung Shine. ""We are providing tools essential for everyday health management, particularly benefiting employees, students, and individuals who require proof of illness without unnecessary inconvenience."" The new nationwide e-script service arrives as NextClinic continues its growth trajectory in Australia's digital healthcare sector. The company's platform provides direct consultations, prescription issuance, and medical certifications entirely online, responding to an increased demand for telehealth solutions accelerated by changing healthcare dynamics and patient preferences. NextClinic's services operate from 24-hour accessible digital portals, providing patients with responses and medical assistance promptly, thereby reducing the reliance on traditional healthcare facilities. The ability to issue electronic prescriptions instantly further strengthens NextClinic's appeal in Australia's competitive digital healthcare market. Security and patient privacy remain central to NextClinic's operations. The company provides robust cybersecurity measures and strictly adheres to Australia's national healthcare privacy standards. All patient data processed via the NextClinic platform is securely stored and transmitted, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and privacy laws. ""Our infrastructure prioritizes patient safety, privacy, and data protection at every level,"" Htet Aung Shine emphasized. ""The integration of e-script functionality within our secure environment is another step toward making digital healthcare not just accessible but entirely trustworthy."" NextClinic continues to expand its digital health ecosystem, planning further integrations and enhancements to its virtual healthcare offerings. The company's platform is staffed by fully qualified medical professionals, ensuring quality medical advice and prescription accuracy for patients nationwide. The e-script implementation is part of the company's initiatives to elevate digital health transformation in Australia. This move is part of a sustained national effort to integrate digital healthcare technology within public health services, improve healthcare delivery efficiency, and maintain high-quality patient outcomes.

Originally launched in the retail sector in the 1970s, the barcode has simplified processes and enhanced efficiency across the healthcare industry. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250414850444/en/ GS1 Healthcare 20 years campaign key visual GS1 barcodes have become indispensable in global healthcare supply chains. From giving time back to patient care by streamlining inventory management, to enabling unique identification of medicines and medical devices, these barcodes have laid the foundations for safer, smarter care. ""The journey of barcodes in healthcare began when regulators sought a reliable and smart way to identify and track medical products. GS1 provided the right technology-an innovation as simple as a barcode scan,"" said Renaud de Barbuat, President and CEO of GS1 . ""Over the past two decades, GS1 barcodes have transformed healthcare systems, creating a ripple effect that ultimately benefits patients worldwide."" Regulators rely on GS1 standards to ensure globally harmonised traceability of medical products. Today, the GS1 DataMatrix barcode is recommended or mandated in healthcare regulations across more than 70 countries. With over 16.5 billion medicine packs in the U.S. and EU alone carrying GS1 DataMatrix barcodes annually, the system has become a cornerstone of global healthcare. Making patients safer every day Barcodes in healthcare are making a difference for millions globally. In the UK for instance, a report commissioned by the Scan4safety initiative found that the use of GS1 barcodes led to a 76% reduction in medical errors, eliminating mistakes related to the wrong patient, drug, or dosage. Scanning GS1 DataMatrix barcodes allows healthcare professionals to verify the correct medication, dose, and patient in real time. In operating rooms, barcodes help track surgical instruments, so all tools are sterilised and accounted for before and after surgery, reducing risks for patients. ""For two decades, GS1 barcodes have been an indispensable guardian of patient safety"", said Susan Moffatt-Bruce (MD), President of Lahey Hospital Medical Centre (US). ""By powering the efficient sharing of data, barcodes help healthcare providers make informed decisions that prevent errors and improve care"". Additionally, GS1 barcodes support fighting counterfeit medicines. The WHO estimates that 1 in 10 medicines globally are substandard or falsified. GS1 barcodes ensure that medicines can be tracked and traced at every stage-from manufacturer to patient-making it easier to detect fake drugs or to report adverse events swiftly across the world. A year of celebrations to mark 20 years of GS1 standards in healthcare To mark the 20th anniversary milestone, GS1 has announced that the 40th GS1 Healthcare Global Conference will take place in Brussels from 4 to 6 November 2025. This flagship event will bring together global healthcare leaders, regulators, and industry stakeholders to celebrate two decades of progress and collaboration. Held as the culmination of a year-long series of local events, the conference will spotlight the critical role of global standards in driving digital transformation patient safety and supply chain resilience across the healthcare sector. The future of safer, smarter care GS1 Healthcare looks to the future with a clear mission: to make safer, smarter care accessible to everyone, everywhere. GS1 is working with leading global technology companies to ensure barcodes on medical products can be scanned by patients with their smartphones, giving instant access to critical information about treatments-all in one simple scan. ""For over a decade, we've been using GS1 barcodes to help us share patient data to enable digital innovation in the Australian healthcare system. I imagine a world in the future where all data can move seamlessly from point A to point B without any manual intervention"", said Peter O'Halloran, Chief Digital Officer for the Australian Digital Health Agency. A Call to Action This 20-year milestone is a celebration and a call to action to all healthcare stakeholders to join GS1 in building safer, smarter care for everyone, everywhere. About GS1 GS1 is a neutral, not-for-profit organisation that is best known for the barcode, named by the BBC as one of ""the 50 things that made the world economy."" GS1 standards improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains across physical and digital channels in 25 sectors. We enable organisations to identify, capture and share information seamlessly. Our scale and reach local Member Organisations in 118 countries, more than 2 million user companies and 10 billion transactions every day -ensure that GS1 standards create a common language that supports systems and processes across the globe.

Book Former Senior Research Fellow in Health Economics Robert is a former Senior Research Fellow specializing in Health Economics. Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Abstract: The President's Council of Economic Advisers correctly notes that fixing several problems with the American health care system would produce substantial economic benefits. However, the current health care reform proposals from the Democrats would address none of these serious problems. In fact, their proposals would exacerbate some of the problems, without producing any of the economic benefits described in the CEA report. The nation's health care delivery and financing systems have many serious problems, and President Barack Obama has reiterated his desire for major reform to fix them. Rapidly rising health care expenditures can be a manifestation of a troubled health care system, and devoting an increasing share of national income to health care might restrain growth in other sectors of the economy. The President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) released a report on June 2 that discusses these issues and how health care reform could strengthen the economy in the long run. [1] The CEA's report offers much useful and insightful analysis of problems in the health care sector of the economy, but draws a rosy conclusion based on its stated assumption that health care reform will produce a best-case scenario. The report simply assumes, without giving any justification, that health care reform would ""slow the annual growth rate of health care costs by 1.5 percentage points,"" which in turn ""would increase real gross domestic product (GDP), relative to the no-reform baseline, by over 2 percent in 2020 and nearly 8 percent in 2030."" [2] The problem with this scenario is that none of the Democrats' current proposals for health care reform is capable of ""slowing the annual growth rate of health care costs"" because none of them would even address, much less solve, the most serious problems that the CEA identifies in the current health care system. All current reform proposals from the Administration and congressional Democrats would either increase health care spending even faster or reduce spending by limiting patient access to necessary care. Indeed, the CEA report conspicuously avoids discussing any specific reform proposals, either those currently before Congress or any others that the CEA might believe would achieve its best-case scenario. While the CEA presents a tantalizing picture of the economic benefits that could theoretically accompany ideal health care reform, it gives no reason to believe that enacting any of the health care proposals before Congress would produce these benefits. Health Care Reform and Economic Growth If Americans could maintain the current level of health for a lower total cost, the resources saved could be used for some other beneficial purpose, and U.S. economic well-being would undoubtedly improve. This is the basic claim of the CEA report, and it is uncontroversial -- even tautological. Yet would health care reform lead to this idealized outcome? Some experts claim, based on regional differences in Medicare spending [3] or the results of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, [4] that health care expenditures could be reduced by up to 30 percent without any adverse health consequences. Notwithstanding the controversy surrounding these claims, [5] there are also many specific reasons to believe that America's health care system is inefficient, many of which the CEA details in its report. The U.S. health care system is clearly far from optimal, and reform, if done properly, would produce great benefits, both economic and otherwise. The problem is that none of the reform proposals from the Administration and congressional Democrats would accomplish this goal. These reform proposals fall into two basic categories: Reforms that would necessarily increase health care spending, with or without improving care, and Reforms that would restrict access to care and very likely produce adverse health outcomes. Sadly, the wrong reform could quite possibly do both. For example, the Kennedy-Dodd bill in the Senate and the America's Affordable Health Choices Act (H.R. 3200) in the House of Representatives, focus on increasing health insurance coverage by expanding coverage to the uninsured and mandating increased coverage and lower out-of-pocket payments for those currently uninsured. While these may be admirable goals, especially expanding coverage, this approach would necessarily increase health care spending. In fact, that is their goal. One problem these proposals seek to solve is that the uninsured and ""underinsured"" do not spend enough on health care. Covering the uninsured would improve their access to health care by enabling them to spend more. If reducing spending on health care improves economic growth, these proposals, whatever their merits, would not achieve that goal. Likewise, reducing or eliminating out-of-pocket payments, such as deductibles, co-insurance, and co-payments for those with insurance, will encourage those individuals to seek more health care and thus increase total spending. Proposals centered on ""cost containment"" -- which usually really means expenditure containment -- work by limiting patients' access to health care. If the goal is to reduce spending without regard to patients' well-being, the government can easily contain health care costs by making higher spending illegal. The American Health Security Act (S. 703), introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA), would take this approach by establishing a Canadian-style system with a ""global budget"" and by banning private insurance and private health spending. S. 703 would explicitly limit total national health care spending to the 2008 level plus the GDP growth rate. It would prevent health spending from ever increasing as a share of GDP, except during a recession when the health budget would remain constant. Similarly, the United States National Health Care Act (H.R. 676), introduced by Representative John Conyers (D-MI), would have Congress annually establish a national limit on health care spending. These proposals would likely succeed in limiting health care spending, but do nothing to ensure that health care outcomes would remain the same. On the contrary, with each state (and hospital) assigned a specific annual budget, patients would be turned away when the money ran out. Indeed, this is similar to the way the Indian Health Service -- a single-payer health care system run by the federal government -- already operates. The Wall Street Journal recently described the health care system ""on reservations, where the common wisdom is 'don't get sick after June' -- the month when the federal dollars usually run out."" [6] Clearly, ""health coverage"" is not the same as ""health care."" Under this approach to cost containment, everybody would be covered, but everybody would be denied health care once the spending limits were reached. Nothing in this approach would make health care more efficient or more effective. The only goal is to limit spending, even if patients suffer. The reduction in spending would not be worth the reduction in health and longevity. Sources of Current Problems The CEA's excellent discussion of the problems with the current health care system is far more insightful than what is typically heard from most policymakers and pundits. The authors identify several key sources of inefficiency in the current system: structural features that lead to unnecessarily high expenditures for a given level of health care and features that reduce quality, but not costs. The problems include: Because health care providers are paid for providing services, rather than for the effectiveness of those treatments, they have little incentive to avoid providing costly or excessive treatments. Because most insured patients are largely insulated from the cost of care, they have little incentive to seek out the most cost-effective treatments. Prices for health care services are usually determined by administrative procedures, which are based on imperfect historical measures of cost and, in the case of Medicare, are subject to intense lobbying by interested parties. As the CEA points out, these systems are slow to adjust to reductions in costs. Although not explicitly mentioned in the CEA report, by focusing on only cost of a service, these systems ignore the value of the service to the patient and thus blunt the incentives for patients and providers to choose treatments with the best value. On the contrary, the system discourages such choices by paying more for high-cost, low-value treatments than for low-cost, high-value treatments. The health care system is highly fragmented. The lack of incentives for proper communication among different providers who are treating the same patient leads to higher utilization (for example, redundant tests) and poorer health outcomes. In addition, a diversity of billing systems increases providers' administrative costs. Information about the effectiveness of and interaction among multiple treatments is difficult and expensive for providers to obtain. Providers have little disincentive to provide expensive treatments of marginal additional value compared to their less-costly alternatives. It is difficult for providers to measure their own performance, and the payment system gives them little incentive to establish or implement systems to give them feedback. It is difficult for patients to obtain information about provider performance, and providers have little incentive to communicate to patients or prospective patients what information they have about their own performance, even if that information is positive. In short, there are serious problems with the method of pricing health care services, incentives for providers and consumers point in the wrong directions, the system is too fragmented, and much of the information needed for all parties to make good decisions is unavailable. Discussion of these factors is too often missing from the health care debate, which seems at times to focus primarily, or even exclusively, on insurance coverage. Yet these problems would all remain even if the entire population had health insurance. The only flaw in the CEA's diagnosis of the ills afflicting the American health care system is the extensive discussion of the supposed U.S. low performance in life expectancy and infant mortality. This is the standard conventional wisdom, supported by unverified data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the data do not account for the different standards that countries use to report live births and, by implication, infant mortalities. The United States has the most inclusive definition of live birth, and as a result reports a higher infant mortality rate than other countries would report in the same circumstances. [7] In other words, births that would be reported in other countries as stillbirths are reported as infant mortalities in the U.S. This also reduces the reported U.S. life expectancy, because the U.S. reports more ""near-zero"" life lengths in the data because of its inclusive definition of live birth. Furthermore, U.S. infant mortality statistics and, consequently, life expectancy figures are sometimes adversely affected by factors reflecting improvements, not defects, in the health care system. For example, high rates of treatment for infertility reflect the widespread availability of advanced, expensive treatments that provide substantial benefit to many people who want, but would otherwise be unable to have children. However, they also result in a disproportionate number of high-risk pregnancies and infant mortalities. In addition, social factors also contribute to an increasing average maternal age, which increases the percentage of high-risk pregnancies and infant mortalities for reasons having nothing to do with defects in the health care system. Furthermore, attempts to save babies with conditions that are more frequently ""treated"" by abortion in other countries skew U.S. infant mortality rates compared to the rates in those countries. In addition, the U.S. has a higher rate of accidental death than other advanced countries. While this is no comfort to Americans, it reflects many social and other factors besides the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of the U.S. health care system. [8] When adjusted for the higher rate of accidental death, the U.S. life expectancy is the highest in the world. [9] All of these problems are distinct from the problem of insurance coverage, and these problems could conceivably persist even if every American had health insurance. Indeed, if the only achievement of health care reform is to provide health insurance for all Americans, these substantial systemic problems would remain, harming patients and increasing costs. Economic Side Effects The CEA report also discusses some consequences of the U.S. system of health insurance on the rest of the economy, particularly the effects of the link between health insurance and employment. For example, the report states that labor mobility is impaired by this link. In fact, the effect of health insurance on job-to-job mobility has largely disappeared since the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 took effect, prohibiting pre-existing condition exclusions for those changing insurance plans. However, mobility from employment to entrepreneurship is still somewhat impaired. [10] If health insurance were easier to obtain outside of the employment relationship, mobility into entrepreneurship and perhaps into small firms could be improved. Although labor market flexibility is certainly good for the economy, the CEA report calls this an ""increase in labor supply,"" but this is not the proper way to characterize this improvement. For instance, when a person leaves one job to accept another, there is no net increase in the labor supply; it is just transferred from one employer to another. Furthermore, this characterization neglects the possible offsetting reduction in labor supply. After all, a significant number of people take jobs primarily to obtain health insurance. For example, many spouses of entrepreneurs obtain ""minimal"" jobs because obtaining health insurance as a teacher's aide, for example, is easier and often cheaper than purchasing insurance on the individual or small-group market as an entrepreneur. If health insurance were easier to obtain outside of the employment relationship, these individuals might devote themselves to different jobs, household production, or their own or their spouses' entrepreneurial enterprises. The authors discuss the underwriting environment that makes it difficult or impossible for many people with health problems to obtain insurance in the individual market, but fail to note that the tax code exacerbates this problem by penalizing those who do not or cannot obtain insurance through their employers. They also fail to note that the link between employment and health insurance, which is responsible for so many other problems, actually provides a solution for vast numbers of people with health problems (pre-existing conditions) that are expensive to treat and thus make insurance in the individual market expensive or unobtainable, but that do not render them unable to work. [11] The report also neglects other important causes of uninsurance, such as state mandates for health benefits that increase premiums and make insurance unaffordable to many people [12] and community rating requirements that make individual insurance prohibitively expensive for many healthy people. The CEA's Unrealistic Assumption The health care system clearly has substantial inefficiencies, which means that, theoretically, the same level of health care could be delivered at a lower total cost. The key assumption behind the CEA argument is that not only is this possible in theory, but that health care reform will necessarily produce this result. The authors also assume that the savings be will manifested as a reduction in the growth rate of total health care expenditures, which will then be directly reflected in increased GDP in other sectors of the economy. [13] They simply guess at the savings that could be achieved from optimal reform -- whatever that might be -- and extrapolate the savings forward in time. They then divide those savings by arithmetically convenient multiples to ""calculate"" more conservative estimates. Basically, the authors assume that health care reform would reduce the growth rate of total health expenditures by 1.5 percentage points. They explicitly state the assumptions that the improvement would mean ""we can obtain the same health care outcomes"" using fewer economic resources and that the resources not spent on health care would be spent producing other useful output instead. The lack of conservatism in their assumptions lies not in the number they choose for the reduction in the rate of growth, but rather in the assumption that health care reform can, and necessarily will, achieve the same level of health at a lower total cost. As such, their estimates are necessarily ""best-case scenarios"" -- not numerically, in the sense that they assume some percentage improvement, but that a lower percentage would be more realistic -- but in the sense that whatever reform is implemented is assumed to achieve cost savings without degrading health care quality or health outcomes. The problem with this assumption is that it does not reflect health care reform reality. Nearly all of the health care reforms suggested by the Administration or by congressional Democrats either explicitly increase spending, or decrease spending in a way that would effectively guarantee reductions in health care quality, access, or outcomes. Specifically, the CEA paper's results would not apply to any health care reform that uses: Rationing or artificial resource limits of any kind; Waiting or queuing of any kind; ""Global budgets"" for the entire health care system or any part of it (including states and individual hospitals); Mandated minimum benefit levels for health insurance, which would force some people to pay for services that they know in advance they would not use; Restrictions on treatments based on age, remaining life expectancy, or a measure of cost-effectiveness that fails to take into account individual patient preferences; Reductions in payment levels or working conditions that induce health care professionals to leave their professions through earlier retirement or career changes or that discourage workers from choosing a career in health care; Restrictions in the choice of treatments, including limitations on the choice of prescription drugs; Restrictions on labor markets, such as requiring a minimum percentage of physicians to specialize in primary care or limiting the number of residencies; or Reduction in the rate of development and/or adoption of improved medical technology, such as new prescription drugs, new medical devices, and new diagnostic imaging modalities. Every health care reform proposal discussed favorably by the Administration or congressional Democrats contains at least one and usually several of these features, any one of which would adversely affect health outcomes and reduce health care quality and access, leaving patients worse off than they would be without this sort of ""reform."" The CEA paper does not discuss any specific health care reform proposals, let alone describe any reform that might achieve the results that it assumes are possible. The paper merely suggests that, if the best possible health care reform were discovered and enacted, substantial economic benefits would ensue. This is true, but unsurprising, uninformative, and almost tautological. Useful, But Incomplete The CEA report offers much useful and insightful analysis of problems in the American health care system and offers a tantalizing picture of the widespread economic benefits that might accompany solutions to these problems. However, the report fails to link any particular health care reforms with theoretically achievable economic benefits. Furthermore, the conditions required to achieve these economic benefits are conspicuously absent from current health care reform proposals. On the contrary, most reform proposals from the Administration and congressional Democrats contain provisions that would preclude the achievement of these widespread economic benefits, either by mandating lower levels of health care services, by requiring higher levels of involuntary spending, or both. To achieve the CEA's optimistic scenario, the U.S. needs health care reform that overcomes the fragmentation of the current system, enhances patient choice, and provides patients and providers with the information to make better-informed choices. This would harness market-based incentives to reduce prices and costs and, therefore, insurance premiums by encouraging both health care providers and patients to seek out the most beneficial and cost-effective treatments and preventive care. Health care reform is important to America's health and the health of the national economy, but that reform must address the most serious problems in the existing health care system and should be based on sound analysis rather than rosy assumptions. Otherwise, the U.S. will not achieve better health at lower costs for more people or give patients greater control over the health care decisions that affect them. Robert A. Book, Ph.D. , is Senior Research Fellow in Health Economics in the Center for Data Analysis at The Heritage Foundation. Appendix: Measuring Health Care's Contribution to GDP The CEA report notes [14] that there is a conceptual problem with how health care is counted in GDP. GDP is normally measured as the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country. It would be convenient to regard a particular industry's portion of GDP as a reasonable approximation of its contribution to the well-being of the population. However, in the case of the health care industry, the value (even the ""market value"") of the output is difficult to measure directly, or even to define, because its contribution to the well-being of the population -- ""improved health"" and ""elimination of disease"" -- is not something that can be bought and sold directly. Instead, unlike most industries, the health care industry's contribution to GDP is in practice calculated as the value of its inputs rather than its outputs : the total amounts spent on physician services, hospital treatments, drugs, and so forth. This means that if it became possible to achieve the same health outcomes by spending less, it would reduce health care's contribution to measured GDP, even though it would not reduce the well-being of the population, which is what we would like GDP to measure. For example, if a new technique were developed that allowed heart attacks to be treated at half the cost with the same level of effectiveness, ideally, the contribution of ""heart attack treatment"" to GDP should remain the same because the ""output"" of that activity is the same. However, because health care is measured based on expenditures on inputs, that contribution to measured GDP would be cut in half, making the health care industry appear less productive even though it became more productive. Under the CEA's assumption that health care savings would be entirely redirected to other industries, measured GDP would not change. The moneysaved treating heart attacks, for example, would be spent on something else besides health care. Therefore, the increases in measured GDP in other sectors of the economy would exactly offset the reduction in measured GDP in health care. The benefit to the population would be reflected in the value of other goods obtained with the savings achieved in the health care sector. The result would be no change in measured GDP or economic growth -- even though inefficiencies in the health care sector would have been eliminated and the well-being of the population would thereby have been improved. To get around this problem, the CEA report introduces the idea of ""conceptual GDP,"" which allows health care's contribution to GDP to remain constant even as less is spent in that sector, thus allowing total conceptual GDP to increase when health care spending is redirected to other sectors. While this is admirable in principle, the authors' application of this notion introduces a serious inconsistency. The authors ask that we compare measured GDP before reform to conceptual GDP after reform. This is not a valid ""apples-to-apples"" comparison. Furthermore, it is impossible to obtain the necessary data in practice with current data and measurement methods. In other words, even granting all of the assumptions and projections in the CEA paper, we are still asked to simply believe that conceptual GDP would increase. If the authors wish to make a valid comparison of this type, they should provide a precise definition of conceptual GDP and method for calculating it -- and most importantly, apply that method consistently -- both to actual GDP before reform and to projected GDP after reform. Such an endeavor is possible in principle and, if implemented properly, would provide a better basis for measuring the contributions of the health care sector to society.

SANTA ANA, Calif. (KABC) -- The Orange County Health Care Agency is closing several of its clinics due to federal funding cuts. Its clinics provide public health services across county communities through coordinating public and private-sector resources. Recent cuts will force the regional provider to close the children and family planning clinic and stop dental service at its 17th Street clinic in Santa Ana. ""The impacts are real. Once we reduce our funds, we have no funds in order to provide the service,"" said Dr. Veronica Kelley, director of O.C. Health Care Agency. So far, the Health Care Agency has lost five grants, totaling $13 million, due to federal funding cuts. ""These are for looking at disease, doing disease surveillance, figuring out what's causing the disease and then treating the disease as well as looking at the laboratory specimens of the disease,"" said Kelley. Dr. Kathy Cosentino is an OB-GYN at the 17th Street children and family planning clinic. She says when she found out the clinic was slated to close, she sat at her desk and cried. ""They know our clinic. They trust us. They're getting good preventative care here, and it's just a huge, huge loss for our community,"" said Cosentino. According to Kelley, O.C. Health Care Agency will also reduce the size of women, infants & children (WIC) clinics in Santa Ana and Buena Park. WIC is a federal program that provides families with free healthy food, nutrition education, breastfeeding support and referrals to health care services. Kelley says the Health Care Agency's WIC funding has been reduced by about $750,000. Amid the funding cuts, O.C. Health Care Agency plans to help impacted families transition to other community partners. ""The good thing is we have a very robust Medi-Cal system. Our managed care partners, CalOptima and Kaiser, can provide that care, and our community clinics can provide the care to people who might be unfunded and/or undocumented."" O.C. Health Care Agency says dental services at the 17th Street clinic will stop on May 6. The children and family planning clinic will close on June 30.

Today’s health care industry celebrates versatility, and hybrid professionals are redefining what it means to succeed. A hybrid health care professional combines skills and expertise from different fields, blending knowledge to create unique value in the health care space. Whether you’re a nurse with coding skills, a doctor with a passion for data analysis and research, or a biomedical engineer with a talent for design and business, hybridization is becoming the new competitive advantage. This article explores how early professionals can harness their diverse interests and talents to shape their careers and stand out in a rapidly evolving job market. Who is a hybrid health care professional? A hybrid professional is someone who integrates expertise from multiple disciplines into their work, creating a unique approach to problem-solving and innovation. These professionals often excel because they see connections others overlook and can operate effectively across different domains. Examples of hybrid careers in health care The health care data scientist. A professional with expertise in medicine, public health, and data analytics is positioned to interpret large health care datasets to enhance clinical decision-making, hospital efficiency, and patient outcomes. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in health care, this role is indispensable. These experts have the ability to predict disease outbreaks, personalize patient treatment plans, and improve operational workflows using real-time analytics, ultimately leading to better and more cost-effective health care solutions. The bioethics consultant. The ability to combine expertise in medicine, philosophy, and ethics to address complex moral dilemmas in patient care, research, and health care policies will be a necessary skill in shaping the future of modern health care practice. With advancements like gene editing, AI in medicine, and evolving end-of-life care debates, bioethics consultants are critical in shaping policies that balance innovation with ethical responsibility. Their role ensures that medical progress aligns with human rights, patient consent, and global health equity. The digital health innovator and entrepreneur. A health care professional who has the ability to merge clinical expertise with business and technology to develop and implement digital health solutions such as telemedicine platforms, wearable health tech, and AI-driven diagnostics will revolutionize patient care. The digital health boom, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has fast-tracked innovation in this field with developments in remote patient monitoring, AI-assisted diagnostics, and digital therapeutics. These all aim to make health care more accessible, efficient, and personalized. The medical entrepreneur and creative engineer . The ability to combine health care expertise with business acumen or combine engineering skills with design thinking to develop consumer products will create startups that solve pressing health challenges in the modern world. The hybrid professional is highly valued because they capitalize on the intersection of fields, where fresh ideas and unexpected solutions often emerge. Why are hybrid skills in demand in health care today? 1. Multi-disciplinary industry solutions. As health care becomes increasingly interconnected, hospitals, practices, and health companies need employees who can bridge gaps between departments. For example, a physician analyst who understands machine learning can automate processes and analyze big data to make better decisions. 2. Creative problem-solving. Multi-talented hybrid professionals bring fresh perspectives by blending insights from different disciplines. This diversity of thought leads to creative solutions that traditional specialists might miss. 3. Future-proofing your career. In a world where automation threatens routine tasks, jobs requiring interdisciplinary skills are harder to replace. Hybrid workers are naturally adaptable, making them less vulnerable to redundancy. ADVERTISEMENT 4. Leadership potential. Health care professionals with hybrid skills often become leaders because they can communicate effectively across teams, drive collaboration between departments, and simplify complex concepts. Here are five ways to start your journey to becoming a hybrid health professional 1. Identify your unique skills by reflecting on your interests and experiences. Ask yourself what disciplines excite you, what problems you are passionate about solving, and how your current skills can complement new ones. For example, if you’re a pharmacy or nursing graduate fascinated by technology, you could learn bioinformatics to analyze data for decision-making in research that will improve efficiency and overall performance. 2. Be a lifelong learner. Take advantage of online courses, certifications, and workshops to gain complementary skills. Many platforms offer flexible options to explore new fields. Here’s a tip: Focus on high-demand hybrid skills, such as: Tech + Business: Data analytics, AI programming, and digital marketing for health care. Design + Engineering: UX/UI design, 3D modeling, and human-centered design principles are relevant in fields such as biomedical and tissue engineering. Health + Technology: Telemedicine, health informatics, and wearable technology will only expand in the future. 3. Create a personal project. Combine your skills in a tangible way, such as launching a blog, designing an app, creating a podcast, or creating a consumer product business or service. Projects act as proof of your hybrid expertise and can be showcased in portfolios or interviews. 4. Network with purpose. Engage with communities in different industries and attend events outside your field. Look for mentors who exemplify hybrid success and ask them for insights. 5. Craft your own narrative. Your resume and online profiles should clearly highlight your hybrid abilities. Frame your skills as complementary rather than fragmented. For example: “I blend medical expertise with engineering principles and machine learning to develop products that improve functionality and health outcomes.” Becoming a hybrid professional does not come without challenges. Some challenges you might face include: The employer challenge. Some employers may struggle to understand hybrid roles. Be prepared to explain how your diverse skills add value and solve real problems. Finding the right fit. Not all organizations are ready for hybrid talent. Focus on companies with innovative cultures that value adaptability and interdisciplinary work. Keeping up. It can be challenging to maintain expertise in multiple areas. Prioritize your learning and stay updated on trends in both primary and secondary fields. The rise of the hybrid professional signals a shift in how we define expertise and value in the workplace. Instead of being limited to a single path, early professionals can now create careers that blend disciplines, trigger innovation, and defy traditional boundaries. Embrace hybridization as a strategy for growth and impact. After all, the most exciting jobs of the future may not exist yet, but hybrid professionals will be the ones who create them.

Vinmec representatives received two of the most significant accolades: “Hospital Group of the Year” and “Technology Innovation of the Year” at the Healthcare Asia Awards 2025. Organised annually, the Healthcare Asia Awards recognises leading hospitals, healthcare systems, and service providers across the region for their excellence, innovation, and commitment to improving patient outcomes. Judged against a comprehensive and stringent set of criteria — including internationally recognised clinical achievements, technological innovation, service quality, patient safety, and sustainable community impact — the Awards are among the most respected in Asia’s healthcare sector. Surpassing hundreds of nominations from across the continent, Vinmec stood out as a dual winner — an unprecedented achievement for a Vietnamese medical institution. Vinmec was awarded Hospital Group of the Year for its robust and integrated healthcare network, exceptional clinical standards, and internationally accredited excellence. Notable recognitions include JCI (Joint Commission International – the global gold standard for patient safety and healthcare quality), ACC (American College of Cardiology – for heart failure treatment and management), RTAC (Asia-Pacific’s gold standard in assisted reproductive technology), and AABB (a leading global accreditation in the field of cell therapy). Vinmec was also praised for its internationally standardised services, operational sustainability, and strong community health initiatives. In the Technology Innovation of the Year category, Vinmec earned recognition for performing Southeast Asia’s first successful 3D-printed titanium chest wall reconstruction — a groundbreaking procedure that not only saved a patient with a severe congenital defect but also opened new frontiers in personalised medicine. The achievement reinforces Vinmec’s pioneering role in the application of cutting-edge medical technology in Vietnam and across the region. A representative of the Healthcare Asia Awards 2025 Organising Committee commented: “ We are especially impressed by the strong and sustainable growth of Vietnam’s healthcare system – a country that is steadily establishing its position on Asia’s healthcare map. Among hundreds of nominations from across the region, Vinmec stood out not only for its internationally recognized medical expertise, but also for its spirit of innovation, pioneering technological approach, and comprehensive operational model. These strengths enabled Vinmec to fully meet our rigorous award criteria and become the first healthcare provider from Vietnam to be honored with both prestigious titles: Hospital Group of the Year and Technology Innovation of the Year .” Ms. Le Thuy Anh, CEO of Vinmec Healthcare System, shared: “This honour from the international medical community is a meaningful recognition of Vinmec’s continuous efforts to build a modern, compassionate, and benchmark-setting healthcare ecosystem. It is not only a milestone for Vinmec, but a proud moment for Vietnam’s healthcare sector as it steps confidently onto the regional stage. With humility and determination, we will continue to invest methodically and creatively, working to position Vietnam as a new centre of medical excellence in Asia.” The international recognition also highlights Vinmec’s growing appeal as a premier healthcare destination in the region. As Vietnam’s most recognised healthcare brand among foreigners, Vinmec has long earned the trust of the expatriate community. In March 2025, an independent survey conducted by Indochina Research Vietnam revealed that Vinmec is the most well-known healthcare system among foreigners living and working in Vietnam — and their top choice when seeking medical care. Vinmec is the first healthcare system in Vietnam to be honoured with two accolades at the Healthcare Asia Awards 2025. As the only academic healthcare system in Vietnam, Vinmec is also the country’s first and only institution eligible for membership in the Cleveland Clinic Connected network — affiliated with one of the top healthcare systems in the United States. On the technology front, Vinmec has heavily invested in advanced solutions including the Da Vinci robotic surgical system, MRI 3.0 Tesla, 2560-slice CT scanner, and AI-integrated hybrid operating rooms. In parallel, Vinmec leads the way in applying cutting-edge therapies such as stem cell treatment, CAR-T cell therapy, and 3D printing of personalised implants. In terms of specialised services, Vinmec is the first and only healthcare system in Vietnam to establish Centers of Excellence (CoEs) in four key areas: Cardiology, Oncology, Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine, and Clinical Immunology & Allergy. Vinmec has also achieved numerous world- and region-first clinical milestones — including the world’s first simultaneous 3D-printed pelvis and femur replacement; Southeast Asia’s first 3D-printed titanium chest reconstruction surgery ; the world’s second case of pseudotumour treatment caused by metal toxicity from an artificial joint; and Vietnam’s first use of stem cell therapy for conditions such as retroperitoneal Castleman disease and autoimmune encephalitis. In February 2025, Vinmec was honoured as “Best Country Exellence Vietnam,” “Best Community Progamme Award,” and “Best Workplace Practises” at the 17th Global CSR & ESG Summit — further affirming its commitment to quality, sustainability, and social responsibility. The Healthcare Asia Awards are organised annually by Healthcare Asia magazine, recognising outstanding achievements of healthcare organisations from 15 countries across Asia. Winners are selected by a judging panel comprising leading experts in the healthcare and life sciences sectors across the Asia-Pacific region.

https://www.newsweek.com/hospital-cybersecurity-tips-panel-access-health-2056380,,Cybersecurity Threats to Health Systems Getting More Aggressive : Experts,20250410T224500Z,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2624898/your-hospital-cyber-safe.png,newsweek.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Health care organizations, with their vast reserves of highly sensitive data, are often prime targets for ransomware groups . Last year alone, there were 677 health care cyber-attacks, including a massive Ascension breach that resulted in at least six class action lawsuits. To address a rising tide of cyber threats in the industry, Newsweek hosted the live webinar, ""Is Your Hospital Cyber-Safe? How to Anticipate Unseen Threats,"" on Thursday, April 10. Newsweek Health Care Editor Alexis Kayser moderated the panel discussion. Participants included Theresa Lanowitz, chief evangelist at LevelBlue, formerly AT&T Cybersecurity; Trent Sanders, vice president for U.S. healthcare for Kyndryl; and Michael Adams, chief information security officer at Zoom . During their opening remarks, the panelists recognized that while innovation is critical in the health care sector, innovation also increases risk and expose large networks to cybersecurity attacks. ""We're clearly seeing increasing sophistication, reach, efficacy of threat actors,"" Adams said. The chief information security officer at Zoom also said that while the labels for threat actors remain unchanged, their attacks continue to ""become more and more—not just technological savvy—but aggressive."" Using artificial intelligence as an example, Adams explained that while a lot of good can come from AI, it is also being leveraged by threat actors to expand the scope of cyberattacks. ... To respond to the growing threats being posed by new technologies, Lanowitz urged health care organizations to create a formalized response plan to a cyberattack, noting that LevelBlue's research has found that only 38 percent of health care organizations have one in place. ""You don't want to be formulating your plan on the fly as you're dealing with that breach. You want to make sure you're prepared, and this is where it has to be driven from the top down,"" she said. ""The CEO has to make sure that the CTO, the CIO, the CISO are communicating and that they understand the goals and objectives of each one."" Citing her company's research that 72 percent of health care organizations don't understand what cyber resilience is, Lanowitz said leaders may be hesitant to fund activities aimed at an organization's entire IT estate if they don't understand how those approaches boost their cybersecurity. She said that when cyber resilience is not prioritized, it can be difficult for organizations to get businesses back online. ""What you end up with is just an isolated cybersecurity team, working the best they can to make sure they're able to do what they can with the protocols and with the controls that they have in place,"" the LevelBlue chief evangelist said. ""This lack of communication is something that's really significantly impacting health care organizations. ""What we recommend is that there's this cross-functional communication that occurs."" For Sanders, the quickest and easiest way for health care organizations to step up their security is to identify and eliminate unnecessary enterprise equipment that can pose cybersecurity threats. ""Challenge your leaders to reduce systems in the environment, whether that be laptops, desktops, TC devices, et cetera,"" the Kyndryl vice president said. ""There's simple information that you can gather that says, 'No usage? Get rid of it.'"" Sanders added, ""Every piece of equipment that you can get rid of just is one additional checkmark on reducing the attack surface.""

Contributed / University of Minnesota Opinion by Rebecca Cunningham and Lori Carrell April 10, 2025 at 8:00 AM Comments Share Share this article Opinion Opinion Advocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data. The Trust Project What is this? Building tomorrow’s health care workforce requires an innovative approach and unwavering focus. The University of Minnesota Rochester, in educational collaboration with Mayo Clinic, is uniquely equipped to solve the state’s critical workforce shortages right here in Med City. A sobering statistic from the Minnesota Department of Health reveals that 79% of counties across the state face a shortage of primary care physicians. While the people of Rochester benefit from tremendous health care quality and access, we know that nearby communities struggle with the growing reality of this health care workforce shortage. Many Minnesotans encounter significant barriers to high-quality, affordable health care, particularly in their local communities, where they and their families need it most. ADVERTISEMENT More than 80% percent of UMR students hail from Minnesota, and most will build their health care careers here after graduation. Take Dr. Hannah Elsenpeter, for example. A graduate of UMR’s inaugural class, she left her rural hometown to pursue a career in medicine and now serves obstetrics and primary care patients in Crosby, just north of Brainerd. Health care professionals like Dr. Elsenpeter are needed now more than ever. Our UMR students graduate career-ready, prepared to meet the urgent health care workforce needs in Olmsted County, nearby communities and across the state. UMR's strong pre-med pathway, which embraces an innovative curriculum, hands-on experience and collaboration with the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, provides this preparation. A full 80% of our graduates have a meaningful experience with Mayo Clinic during their studies at UMR. Through this strong collaboration, our students can seamlessly transition from the classroom to clinics, labs and hospitals, where they are desperately needed. This transformational health care education experience, where students learn and work with leading researchers and health care providers, is something we are committed to not just continuing, but strengthening. Together, we can advance the health of all Minnesotans. The greatest health care challenges will not be solved in silos, but through collaboration, sharing valuable expertise, resources and facilities, as we have done with Mayo for so many years. In that same spirit of collaboration, the University of Minnesota has partnered with Essentia Health to propose a fully integrated, patient-focused and research-based health care model. This model will impact patients statewide and enhance the University’s role in educating Minnesota’s health care workforce. This new path forward seeks to provide comprehensive health care closer to home and fortify the crucial workforce development happening on University of Minnesota campuses every day, including here in Rochester. All Minnesotans need this new collaborative model to succeed. Without it, we risk training fewer physicians and health professionals at a time when we need more, and diminishing the essential and lifesaving research our families rely on in their toughest moments. Minnesotans are looking to us to improve the health of our society. We will answer their call and remain steadfast in our dedication to building a healthier Minnesota for everyone.

If the answer is no, you are probably among the “lucky” minority of people that have access to publicly funded health care. The vast majority of people around the world – 84 percent or 6.6 billion people – live in countries where access to health care is undermined in part by low public funding. Sometimes this is because of major constraints like war and natural disasters, but in most cases, governments just don’t prioritize it. Either way, people suffer. But health is a human right , not luck. Most governments are not spending enough to ensure health care systems can deliver on this right to health. Human Rights Watch analyzed the most recent World Health Organization data, including health care spending from 2022 for more than 190 countries around the world. We found that in 2022, 141 governments spent less than 5 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on health care through public means, a widely accepted international spending benchmark . This means, most people have little access to even healthcare services considered most “essential” by the United Nations. In many countries, including some of the world’s poorest, big parts of the population have no choice but to pay for health care costs themselves – or to or not receive care altogether. If people have to pay for their own health care, they often cannot pay for goods and services essential for the realization of other human rights , like housing, food, and education. In short: The data indicates there are vast inequalities in access to healthcare, and that it is at least in part the result of policy choices. These policy choices are not fulfilling obligations under international law. Countries must put as many resources as possible into the right to health. As global health systems worldwide struggle with the US sudden termination of most foreign aid and assistance, richer governments can and should step up. Those with more resources and power have a particular responsibility to ensure everyone is able to access quality health care. This could mean increasing contributions to development aid, of course, but also, most importantly, to change the rules that make it so difficult for some countries to raise public funds for health care. This could be fixed: countries will be negotiating at the UN over the coming years to increase cooperation on tax and avoid competition that harms the poorest countries. And the right to health of millions. Restructuring debt or relief combined with global tax cooperation can, and will, make a big difference for public health care. Essentials, such as health care, should not be expendable for billions of people, but should be equally available to everyone.

The government’s use of these weapons in populated areas may amount to war crimes. The United Nations Security Council should press South Sudan to stop the bombings and allow UN peacekeepers in to protect civilians.

According to a 2023 World Health Organization (WHO) report, Kenya had only 1.7 doctors for every 10,000 people, which is significantly below the recommended threshold. Additionally, 47% of Kenyans did not have access to essential healthcare services, which forced many to depend on expensive private hospitals or overcrowded public facilities. Many African governments have struggled to prioritise healthcare, often diverting limited resources to education, economic development, or infrastructure. While the public sector worked diligently to meet the rising demand, Jayesh Saini saw an opportunity for the private sector to fill the gap. His focus on innovative healthcare solutions aimed not only to address immediate needs but also to create sustainable, scalable solutions for the future. Jayesh Saini has been instrumental in bridging these gaps in transforming the healthcare sector. Through Bliss Healthcare , Lifecare Hospitals, and Dinlas Pharma , he has expanded medical facilities, modernized hospital infrastructure, introduced telemedicine, and integrated AI-powered diagnostics. His initiatives are redefining healthcare accessibility and affordability across Kenya. Bliss Healthcare : Expanding Access to Affordable Outpatient Care One of the greatest challenges in Kenya's healthcare sector is the geographical accessibility of medical services. Many rural and semi-urban communities struggle with long distances to hospitals and limited access to specialized care. Bliss Healthcare , led by Jayesh Saini , has responded to this need by establishing Kenya's largest private outpatient healthcare network. Today, Bliss Healthcare operates more than 65 medical centers nationwide, ensuring that Kenyans have access to affordable, high-quality medical services. The impact of this expansion is considerable: * Annual patient visits surpass 1.2 million, alleviating the pressure on public hospitals. * AI-powered diagnostics enhance early detection and treatment outcomes. * 20% of patients now use telemedicine services. It reduces the need for long hospital visits. * Partnerships with private insurance providers and government institutions, including the Teacher Service Commission (TSC) and the National Police Service (NPS), have enabled thousands of Kenyans to access affordable healthcare plans. Through technological advancements and strategic partnerships, Bliss Healthcare has enhanced outpatient care in Kenya, ensuring that more people can access quality medical treatment without financial burden or logistical challenges. Lifecare Hospitals: Strengthening Kenya's Hospital Infrastructure While outpatient care is vital, hospital infrastructure poses a significant challenge to Kenya's healthcare system. Many public hospitals are inadequately equipped with bed capacity, advanced medical equipment, and specialized treatment centers. To tackle this issue, Jayesh Saini established Lifecare Hospitals, a multi-specialty hospital network that has grown across several counties in Kenya. With hospitals strategically located in Bungoma, Eldoret, Kikuyu, Migori, Meru, and Mlolongo, Lifecare Hospitals now operates a network of state-of-the-art facilities that provide world-class medical services to previously underserved regions. The healthcare group has expanded its offerings to include advanced diagnostic tools, such as CT scans and MRIs, in areas that once lacked even basic healthcare infrastructure. Through these efforts, Lifecare has significantly improved both access to healthcare and the overall quality of care for thousands of patients. By expanding hospital capacity and medical expertise, Lifecare Hospitals has enhanced access to specialized healthcare within Kenya and decreased the necessity for medical tourism, allowing patients to receive advanced treatment locally. By 2026, the group plans to operate 10 hospitals throughout Kenya, with intentions to expand into Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. These facilities will provide world-class services, ensuring that patients across the region can access exceptional medical care without needing to travel abroad for treatment. Dinlas Pharma : Transforming Kenya's Pharma Industry Kenya has historically depended on imported pharmaceuticals, which makes essential medicines costly and at times challenging to obtain. A report by the Kenya Pharmaceuticals Association in 2022 revealed that over 70% of medicines in Kenya were imported, resulting in supply chain vulnerabilities, especially during global crises. Jayesh Saini founded Dinlas Pharma , a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer in East Africa, and has since made significant progress in reinforcing Kenya's pharmaceutical industry. Dinlas Pharma Africa Limited began manufacturing operations in 2018, with the capacity to produce large volumes of pharmaceutical products in various formulas. The installed capacities are 140 million tablets per month, 50 million capsules per month, 3 million bottles per month of suspensions and syrups, and 1.6 million tubes per month of creams and ointments. By improving access to essential medicines and ensuring price stability, Dinlas Pharma is helping Kenya achieve greater self-reliance in pharmaceutical production, thereby enhancing national health in the process. Revolutionizing Healthcare with Telemedicine and AI With Kenya's critically low doctor-to-patient ratio, Jayesh Saini has spearheaded the adoption of telemedicine and AI-powered diagnostics to enhance healthcare accessibility and efficiency. By integrating technology into healthcare services, Jayesh Saini is contributing to a shift from reactive treatment to proactive disease prevention, ensuring long-term health improvements for millions. The Economic and Social Impact of Saini's Healthcare Revolution Beyond healthcare, Jayesh Saini 's initiatives have made a significant economic and social impact. * More than 4,500 healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and pharmaceutical experts, have been employed. * Reduced treatment costs have made healthcare more accessible, diminishing the need for expensive medical tourism. * Stronger partnerships with key stakeholders in Kenya support the advancement of the country's universal healthcare goals. * Over 3 million Kenyans now have direct access to high-quality medical care at Bliss Healthcare and Lifecare Hospitals. These initiatives not only improve patient outcomes but also contribute to economic growth and the sustainability of healthcare in Kenya. Looking Ahead: The Future of Healthcare in Kenya Jayesh Saini 's long-term vision focuses on enhancing healthcare access and self-sufficiency in Kenya. He aims to expand life care hospitals into underserved counties, thereby improving access to specialized care for more individuals. Additionally, he plans to expand AI-powered predictive healthcare models to assist with early disease prevention. He also envisions boosting Kenya's pharmaceutical self-sufficiency by increasing local production at Dinlas Pharma . Saini emphasizes the importance of enhancing telemedicine accessibility for rural populations, ensuring that all Kenyans benefit from healthcare advancements. Through his dedication to innovation, accessibility, and affordability, Jayesh Saini is significantly influencing the future of healthcare in Kenya and beyond. By employing a data-driven approach, leveraging technological advancements, and making strategic investments, Jayesh Saini is tackling Kenya's most significant healthcare challenges. By enhancing hospital infrastructure, incorporating AI, and bolstering pharmaceutical production, he has emerged as one of the most influential figures in African healthcare. Kenya's healthcare transformation is still in progress, but with leaders like Jayesh Saini , the country is set to become a model of affordable, technology-driven healthcare in Africa.

https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/04/08/child-trafficking-victims-health-care/,,How the Health Care System is Failing Child Trafficking Victims,20250410T003000Z,https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trafficking1400.jpg,news.northeastern.edu,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"A new report from a team of Northeastern University experts sheds light on the under-discussed and under-researched issue of minor sex trafficking victims and their interactions with the American health care system. Sex trafficking, or commercial sexual exploitation, of minors is a major public safety and health issue in the U.S., but this is the first report to take a comprehensive look at the health needs of victims, says Amy Farrell , professor and director of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University. Every year, hundreds of cases related to the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, or child sex trafficking, are reported in Massachusetts alone. That is likely an undercount, Farrell says. Historically, health systems in the U.S. have focused on identifying victims, but the resistance of minor sex trafficking victims to even seek health care makes that an ongoing challenge. This report aims to address that, laying out the dire health needs of victims while recommending ways for health care providers to better address those needs. “Exploitation impacts health care needs so not only should doctors and nurses be identifying and then referring victims to services, they should be using the information about exploitation to actually provide better health care,” Farrell says. “Providing quality health care requires understanding a person’s exploitation history or risk for exploitation because exploitation has impacts on health.” The report is based on a nationwide study conducted by an interdisciplinary team of health care experts, criminologists, clinicians, psychologists and sociologists that also included Northeastern’s Carlos Cuevas , a professor of criminology and criminal justice, Alisa Lincoln , professor of health sciences and sociology and doctoral students Amelia Wagner and Sarah Lockwood. University of New Hampshire, Boston University and the Research Triangle Institute were also partners on the report. Based on a national survey of over 500 young people who are experiencing or have experienced exploitation and in-depth interviews, the report pinpoints the significant amount of health needs faced by minor sex trafficking victims. Minors who experience commercial sexual exploitation often are less likely to pursue health care because they have felt stigmatized by providers in the past, says Amy Farrell, director and professor of criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University and co-director of the Violence and Justice Research Lab. Photo by Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University “Young people that are being commercially sexually exploited are at very high risk of STDs,” Farrell says. “But we also found things like individuals needing to seek abortion medical care and then maybe having medical complications as a result of that abortion medical care [and] individuals experiencing violence during exploitation where they had broken bones or they have injuries to all different areas of their bodies.” Minor sex trafficking victims often also have chronic stomach pain stemming from stress and malnutrition, along with the kind of chronic headaches associated with post-traumatic stress.

This toy prototype is full of bacteria Hockey star David Sherlock leads 2025 Northeastern Athletics Hall of Fame class What Farrell and her team found is that despite all of these health concerns, young people who are being commercially sexually exploited often will not get health care. They might go to an emergency room or health clinic if there is an immediate need, but they are less likely to go to a doctor. “They know health is important, but they really struggle to get health care because of stigma and shame and discrimination that they’ve experienced, particularly during exploitation when they were seeking health care from emergency rooms and clinics where they were treated with real derision by health care providers for what was perceived as either their voluntary engagement in substance use or their voluntary engagement in commercial sex even though they were minors and being exploited,” Farrell says. For that reason, the most significant recommendation from the report is a need to reimagine the relationship health care providers have with young victims of sex trafficking. It has to start with reimagining how pediatric care is provided in the U.S., Farrell explains. “Sometimes pediatricians actually model relationships that are similar to exploitive relationships,” Farrell says. “‘You give me something, I give you something. I’m the authority, I tell you what to do,’ as opposed to giving children the ability to actually start being agents in their own health care and thinking about health providers as someone you could trust.” “That’s beneficial to all kids, not just for kids who are exploited,” she adds. “Seeing that relationship as agency building as opposed to just health serving, that requires more time, more resources for pediatricians.” However, addressing the urgent health needs of this vulnerable population also requires training health care providers to not only identify the signs of exploitation –– like addiction –– but to address immediate health needs of a young person who is being exploited, like access to birth control, STD testing and vaccines, Farrell advises. Once there are enough doctors who are trained to work with exploitation victims, improving health care navigation is “a critical element” of ensuring victims actually get help. “Training the right doctors and training the right clinics is that immediate part in the middle,” Farrell says. “That has to happen so that we get providers that understand the relationship between exploitation and health and understand exploitation. Then getting people to those providers is really important.” How does infant formula get contaminated with botulism?

The National Committee for Quality Assurance: Recommendations for the Trump Administration outlines a vision for evolving the current U.S. quality measurement ecosystem to support patient-driven, cost-effective, integrated care and highlights three key themes: alleviate chronic disease burden; create a digital health infrastructure to support health care innovation; and address the behavioral health crisis. ""For 35 years, NCQA has worked to improve health care quality through measurement, transparency, and accountability,"" said NCQA President Margaret E. O'Kane. ""We believe that advancements in quality measurement, care integration and interoperability are needed to create a more efficient and accountable health care system and urge the new administration to prioritize innovative care and payment models that align incentives with improved patient outcomes."" Optimize Value-Based Care & Alternative Payment Models to Alleviate Chronic Disease The U.S. health care system is fragmented and difficult to navigate, making decision-making both time-consuming and expensive. This issue is pronounced for the 133 million Americans living with chronic disease. While digital health technologies have the potential to improve communication, coordination, and care management, without appropriate integration and standardization, care may become even more fragmented. To address these issues, NCQA recommends that the administration expands the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) commitment to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries are in value-based arrangements by 2030. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's (CMMI) new leadership create models that prioritize integration through technology and dynamic care plans, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should introduce Medicare Advantage Star Ratings metrics that promotes standardized data exchange, and HHS should prioritize more effective use of patient-generated data, including person-reported outcomes measures. Create a Lasting Digital Health Infrastructure to Support Health Care Innovation While the availability of electronic health data has grown, the use and exchange of such data to foster health care innovation is impeded by misaligned policy incentives and payment programs. Stronger support from the administration, through government payment programs, can drive industry implementation, accelerate data exchange and stimulate innovation. To address these issues, NCQA recommends that HHS expedites adoption of a digital quality measures (dQM) reporting architecture, develops a comprehensive health care data quality framework that supports a digital health data exchange ecosystem, and accelerates alignment with the CMS Universal Foundation across HHS quality reporting and value-based payment programs. Address the Behavioral Health Crisis More than 20% of American adults live with mental illness, and recent estimates place the resulting economic strain at over $280 billion. To address this crisis, we must strengthen efforts by increasing funding for fundamental quality improvement, establish national standards, and advance technology. To address these issues, NCQA recommends that the administration work with Congress to incentivize behavioral health provider adoption of certified EHRs, expand access to medication for opioid use disorder as first-line, evidence-based treatment, and support states in evaluating prevention, treatment and recovery efforts through development, collection and reporting of opioid use disorder quality measures. Additionally, NCQA recommends that the administration instructs HHS to fund creation of a quality measures framework for substance use disorder care, require independent accreditation for SAMHSA's Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers certification, and urges the administration to collaborate with Congress to finalize policies that ensure telehealth and virtual care become permanent fixtures of American health care. ""The U.S. health care system faces numerous challenges including high costs, access to care, and varying degrees of quality of care,"" said NCQA Vice President Federal Affairs Eric Musser. ""By leveraging NCQA's expertise, evidence-based practices, and resources, the new administration could make significant strides in addressing the systemic issues within the U.S. healthcare system, ultimately leading to a more efficient use of resources, and better health outcomes for all Americans. We look forward to working with the new administration to realize our common goals."" NCQA is eager to collaborate with the Trump administration as it drives innovation and works to create a more cohesive, less fragmented experience for all stakeholders across the American health care ecosystem.

Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images More than 1 million noncitizen immigrants — one-third of them without legal status — work as doctors, nurses, nursing home aides and in other essential and increasingly hard-to-fill health care jobs in the U.S., a new analysis shows. As a result, President Trump's threatened mass deportations and tightened immigration restrictions, if carried out, could lead to bottlenecks, gridlock and compromised care throughout American hospitals, nursing homes and the entire health care system, warned Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a Hunter College health policy professor and one of the authors of a research letter published last week in JAMA. ""We already have shortages,"" she said. ""If we start deporting or scaring away 1.1 million noncitizen health care workers, things will get much worse. And that's going to affect the health care of all Americans."" After analyzing 2024 U.S. Census data, Woolhandler and her colleagues estimated that nearly 17% of the health care workforce, or roughly 3.4 million workers, were born outside the U.S. More than 5% of health care workers were noncitizens, with about 700,000 who were here legally and more than 366,000 immigrants without legal status, researchers found. Some regions of the U.S. rely particularly heavily on immigrants. Noncitizen immigrants comprised almost 13% of the health care workforce in New York, almost 10% in Florida and 9% in California, researchers estimated. Nearly a quarter of physicians working in the U.S. were born elsewhere, and more than 6% are here legally but are not citizens. One, Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University's medical school, was refused reentry into the U.S. from her home country of Lebanon at Boston Logan International Airport in March. The Department of Homeland Security said it found evidence that Alawieh attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, a political group that the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization. That the U.S. deported the Yale-trained physician who possessed a valid visa ""sent a chill down the spine of the entire foreign-born health care workforce,"" Woolhandler said. ""People are feeling very afraid if they're foreign born,"" she said. ""It's not good for the health care system for everyone to be afraid all the time."" Neither DHS nor the Department of Health and Human Services replied to a request for comment on this story. The Trump administration has enacted a series of measures and threatened others to end legal protections for millions of U.S. immigrants, creating uncertainty not only for immigrants, but for their employers. The administration suspended refugee resettlements and it revoked legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and ordered them deported later this month. In addition, uncertainty clouds the status of immigrants, including doctors and nurses, brought to the country illegally as children and who once received legal protection through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Anti-immigration policies and practices are likely to prompt physicians and nurses from outside the U.S. to consider seeking work in more welcoming countries, said Woolhandler. Janet Coffman, a health policy professor at the University of California, San Francisco agrees. Filipinos, for example, make up 4% of the U.S. nursing workforce and 24% of the nurses who died from COVID-19. ""Maybe we will see more of them preferring to go to Canada than to the United States,"" said Coffman, who was not involved with the new analysis. ""I think well-trained doctors who have good options elsewhere are going to be looking very hard and trying to go to other countries,"" Woolhandler said. With an aging population and a growing need for health care workers, the impact of Trump's immigration policies could well add pressure to projected shortages of doctors as well as registered nurses , Coffman said. Still, Coffman believes the most pressing problem likely to result from the immigration crackdown will be a shortage of aides to care for people in their homes and in nursing homes. ""These changes in immigration policy pose a very big challenge for home health and nursing homes, because of their reliance on immigrant labor,"" Coffman said. A 2024 survey from the American Health Care Association found that nearly half of nursing homes in the U.S. said they've had to limit new admissions because of staffing shortages. And researchers projected the need for an additional 800,000 home care workers over the next 10 years to care for older adults who want to remain in their homes. ""Even before President Trump was reelected, nursing homes and home health were struggling to recruit workers ,"" Coffman said. ""These decisions, if they're allowed to proceed, really will make it just that much more difficult … to care for some of the most vulnerable among us. These are seniors and younger people with disabilities, people who have multiple, complex health care needs."" Woolhandler fears that the anti-immigrant climate will compound the impact on hospitals from health worker shortages, creating ""bottlenecks."" Hospitals won't ""be able to admit new people because they're full with people who can't leave the hospital because they have no place to go,"" she said. ""They don't need to be in an acute-care hospital, but there's not a nursing home bed for them. And Trump is doing things that are going to make the situation worse."" trump administration immigration crackdown health care worker shortage Facebook Flipboard Email"

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Apr 08, 2025, 10:00am EDT Share Save FNU ANUPAMA | Senior Manager | Big 4 Global Consulting firm. getty The application of artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare is transforming patient treatment, from advanced analytics to computerized automated diagnosis. However, with the increased application of AI-powered solutions, healthcare industries are facing an increasing risk of compromising on patient PHI (protected health information) data. Healthcare organizations contain a high volume of medical data and must follow complex regulatory compliance. Business leaders must implement robust cybersecurity strategies to protect PHI, establish regulatory compliance and ensure AI-driven healthcare is an optimal solution. The Growing Threat Landscape In Healthcare Cybersecurity Healthcare organizations store copious amounts of medical, personal and financial data. Due to this high volume of data, cybercriminals are targeting healthcare organizations. According to the HIPAA Journal , the highest number of reported data breaches and exposed records occurred in 2023. A total of 725 data breaches were reported to the OCR, resulting in the exposure or impermissible disclosure of more than 133 million records. The increasing use of AI-driven technologies, such as diagnostic assistance, drug discovery, virtual assistants and robot-assisted surgery, further expands the threat surface. Common cyber threats in healthcare include: • Phishing scams involve sending seemingly harmless emails that trick someone into revealing sensitive data. • Ransomware attacks involve the use of malware to access patient data and demand a ransom for its release. • Data breaches occur when someone gains unauthorized access to patient records, which could result in financial fraud. Key Strategies To Enhance Cybersecurity In Healthcare To prevent AI threats, healthcare organizations must implement comprehensive cybersecurity measures. Business leaders should consider the following strategies: 1. Adopting A Zero-Trust Security Model: To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, a zero-trust approach is apt for AI-driven healthcare environments. This approach requires multiple and continuous verification of every user and device accessing patient data. 2. Enhancing AI Security And Algorithm Integrity: AI systems depend on massive amounts of data to make medical decisions. It is critical to protect the integrity of these AI algorithms. Healthcare institutions should implement robust AI modeling, rigorous model testing, continuous monitoring for anomalies, data validation and handling, access controls and regular audits to prevent data manipulation. 3. Strengthening Employee Training And Awareness: Human error is one of the biggest cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Guidelines on password hygiene, education on phishing emails and the definition of protocols can reduce the incidence of successful attacks. 4. Investing In Advanced Threat Detection And Response: Implement cybersecurity solutions that leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as behavioral analytics and AI-powered threat detection tools, to proactively identify and respond to cyber threats in real time. These tools can detect unusual patterns, analyze network traffic and mitigate potential risks. Enhance your organization’s ability to prevent data breaches by implementing security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. 5. Ensuring Compliance With Healthcare Regulations: HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR in Europe mandate strict data protection measures. Business leaders must ensure their cybersecurity frameworks align with these regulations to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage. The Business Case For Investing In Cybersecurity A robust cybersecurity strategy is not just a compliance requirement; it is essential for a business to prevent data breaches that could lead to financial losses, disruptions in operations and loss of patient trust. An IBM and Ponemon Institute study found that companies that actively prioritize cybersecurity measures tend to incur lower costs when a data breach incident occurs, and companies can recover from such incidents more quickly. In addition, as AI continues to advance, regulatory authorities may introduce stricter data security requirements. Healthcare leaders should take a long-term approach and stay ahead of emerging threats by shifting from a prevention-focused mindset to a resilience-first cybersecurity strategy. This approach enables them to adapt to evolving technological advancements more effectively. Conclusion AI-driven healthcare offers unparalleled opportunities for improving patient care, but it also introduces new cybersecurity risks. Business leaders must take the initiative in protecting patient data by implementing a zero-trust model, training employees, strengthening AI security with robust threat detection and ensuring compliance. By making cybersecurity a priority, healthcare organizations can build resilience, safeguard patient trust and fully harness the potential of AI in modern medicine.

A statement from the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) highlighted the importance of strengthening bilateral ties with Uzbekistan, particularly in healthcare.

Jalali emphasized the significance of Uzbekistan’s partnership in improving Afghanistan’s healthcare system. “To strengthen our healthcare sector, it is essential to enhance the skills of our healthcare workers and ensure access to modern medicines and equipment. Through strong bilateral cooperation, we can make significant progress and provide high-quality medical services to our patients,” he added. He also stressed that all medicines imported into Afghanistan, whether from Uzbekistan or other countries, must be registered with the MoPH’s Food and Drug Authority to ensure their quality and safety. In response, the Uzbek delegation expressed appreciation for the ongoing collaboration and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Afghanistan’s healthcare sector.

The statement said his resignation would be effective after Houston Healthcare and Emory Healthcare's merger. The statement did not specify when that merger may take place. ""Mr. Briscoe is incredibly excited about this next chapter for Houston Healthcare and is proud of the team’s dedication and hard work,"" the statement said. ""He fully supports Emory and the opportunities this collaboration will bring to the community."" The statement said that they appreciate Briscoe's ""outstanding leadership"" and his contributions over the past eight years he was with Houston Healthcare. During his tenure, he managed his staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, various staff shortages and a looming merger with Emory. He oversaw over 2,400 employees, including board members, physicians and various volunteers. Under him, Houston Healthcare's location in Perry set a national example by reporting zero healthcare-associated infections in 2024. The hospital has struggled recently, likely leading to the possible merger with Emory Healthcare. A report by Maine-based Stroudwater Company , which reviewed the hospital's finances last year, noted that the hospital had been losing money for years and was in bad debt. The report also said that it had been unable to keep up with community growth and that consultants criticized the system's management. The report said that decision-making has been ""problematic and non-collaborative."" While Briscoe will remain on staff until the merger, Houston Healthcare said in the release that they'll focus on making sure to create a ""smooth transition"" for the patients, employees and community members.

Dr. Scott Taggart Roethle, 47, pleaded guilty to health care fraud in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis. He admitted that from 2017 until 2020, he conspired with health care companies and others to order medically unnecessary durable medical equipment, pain creams and genetic tests for thousands of patients in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Dr. Roethle contracted with multiple health care companies as a telemedicine doctor. He ordered health care services for patients without evaluating them or their actual medical needs. Roethle did not have a prior doctor-patient relationship with the telemedicine patients and admitted that he provided no follow-up care after ordering the health care services. Dr. Roethle was typically paid about $30 for each of his fraudulent orders. He admitted to receiving payments of $674,000 from five companies. He also admitted that Medicare paid out at least $1.5 million while relying on his fraudulent orders. The U.S. Attorney’s Office believes that the total loss due to the health care fraud is between $7 million and $9.5 million. Dr. Roethle was licensed to practice in 22 states during the time of his crime and worked primarily as an anesthesiologist.

Facebook X LinkedIn Bluesky Copy to Clipboard Copy Health Health is wealth: A financial breakdown of 160+ ASX-listed healthcare leaders Here is an expert insight into where the Australian healthcare market is today and where it might be heading. Scott Middleton Apr 4, 2025 5 min read Share 0 Source: Adobe Stock The healthcare sector is particularly interesting at the moment with large-scale private hospital operator Healthscope facing down administration and significant restructuring. With reports that the healthcare industry needs structural changes, we thought it would be enlightening to do a sector research post analysing healthcare companies listed on the ASX to identify emerging trends, market dynamics, and investment opportunities within the industry. By examining financial metrics including market capitalisation, growth rates, valuation multiples, and profitability indicators across different healthcare sub-sectors, we provide insights into where the Australian healthcare market is today and where it might be heading. Introduction The Australian healthcare sector represents a meaningful component of the national economy ( 9.9% ). With an aging population, increasing chronic disease burden, and technological advancements transforming healthcare delivery, understanding the financial performance and market positioning of healthcare companies provides valuable insights into broader industry trends. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 288946 LaunchVic debuts $1 million medtech grants to find the next global giant David Adams This analysis examines data from over 100 ASX-listed healthcare companies spanning multiple sub-sectors including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare software, diagnostic services, and aged care.

The beauty of using data from public companies is we get a real view of what is happening on the ground. Methodology Our analysis utilises financial data from ASX-listed healthcare companies, including: Market capitalisation Revenue growth rates (One-year trailing 12 months) EBITDA growth and margins Valuation metrics (EV/Sales, P/E ratios) 5-year CAGR total returns Companies were categorised by healthcare sub-sectors to enable cross-segment comparison and identification of sector-specific trends. Key findings 1. Market capitalisation distribution The Australian healthcare market shows significant concentration, with a few large players dominating the sector. The top five companies by market cap are: CSL Limited (Plasma Therapeutics): $79.3 billion ResMed Inc. (Sleep & Respiratory): $34.1 billion Cochlear Limited (Hearing Implants): $21.0 billion Sonic Healthcare Limited (Pathology Services): $16.7 billion EBOS Group Limited (Healthcare Distribution): $8.1 billion These five companies account for approximately 75% of the total market capitalisation across the analysed healthcare stocks, indicating high market concentration. 2. Sub-sector performance analysis High-growth sub-sectors Several healthcare sub-sectors demonstrate strong revenue growth: Radiopharmaceuticals : Companies like Telix Pharmaceuticals (55.9% revenue growth) are showing exceptional performance, driven by the increasing adoption of targeted radiation products for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Healthcare Software : Pro Medicus (29.9% revenue growth) exemplifies the strong performance in this sub-sector, reflecting the increasing digitisation of healthcare services. Aged Care : Providers like Regis Healthcare (24.8% revenue growth) show solid growth as Australia’s aging population drives demand. Profitability leaders in healthcare Sub-sectors with the strongest EBITDA margins include: Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 304579 Doctors turned alchemists: How BrandScent’s founders created a multi-million-dollar business Mrinaal Datt Healthcare software : Pro Medicus demonstrates an impressive 72.6% EBITDA/Revenue ratio, highlighting the scalability and high margins of software business models in healthcare. Sleep and respiratory : ResMed maintains strong profitability with 34.8% EBITDA margins, benefiting from recurring revenue streams through device sales and consumables. Hearing implants : Cochlear shows solid profitability at 17.3% EBITDA margin, leveraging its market leadership position. 3. Valuation insights Valuation metrics reveal significant variation across healthcare sub-sectors: Healthcare software commands high multiples with Pro Medicus trading at 101.1x EV/Sales and 190.1x forward P/E, reflecting investor optimism about high-margin, scalable business models with recurring revenue. Radiopharmaceutical companies like Telix trade at 7.1x EV/Sales, indicating investor confidence in the growth potential of precision medicine. Traditional healthcare providers (hospitals, pathology, aged care) typically trade at lower multiples (1-3x EV/Sales), reflecting their more mature, capital-intensive business models. 4. Long-term returns analysis The 5-year CAGR total returns show divergent performance across companies: Top performers : Telix Pharmaceuticals (84.5%), Pro Medicus (68.8%), and Cryosite (65.4%) have delivered exceptional returns, indicating strong market validation of their business models. Underperformers : Several companies in the medical cannabis and early-stage biotech spaces show negative 5-year CAGRs, highlighting the risks in these segments. 5. Emerging healthcare trends The financial data reveals several key trends shaping the Australian healthcare landscape: Precision medicine acceleration Companies focused on personalised and targeted therapies are showing strong growth and attracting premium valuations. Radiopharmaceuticals (Telix), genetic testing, and advanced diagnostics companies are gaining traction as healthcare moves toward more precise, patient-specific approaches. Digital health transformation Healthcare software and digital health companies like Pro Medicus demonstrate the market’s recognition of technology’s transformative potential in healthcare. Their high growth rates and premium valuations reflect expectations that technology will continue reshaping healthcare delivery models. Consolidation in traditional healthcare Established segments like pathology (Sonic Healthcare), imaging diagnostics, and hospital operators show lower growth rates but maintain significant market share. These sectors appear ripe for consolidation as scale becomes increasingly important for profitability. Emerging therapies face challenges The data shows mixed results for companies developing novel therapeutics. While some demonstrate promising growth, many smaller biotechnology companies focused on areas like medical cannabis, psychedelics, and early-stage drug development show negative returns, highlighting the challenges of commercialising innovative therapies. Limitations Some of the limitations of this research are: Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 311732 The Laundry Lady eyes expansion with 100 new contractors Morganne Kopittke Concentration of market capitalisation in a small number of companies leads to a few insights that would ideally have information from more companies (eg there are software companies trading at lower multiples but Pro Medicus’s well-deserved dominance somewhat obscures this in this research) Company stage breaking out early-stage biotech companies may change the analysis but we didn’t segment the list by company stage. Conclusion The Australian healthcare sector presents a diverse landscape with varying growth, profitability, and valuation characteristics across sub-sectors. The financial data indicates a market that rewards companies demonstrating technological differentiation, scalable business models, and alignment with demographic trends like the aging population. The most promising segments appear to be those at the intersection of healthcare and technology, particularly in precision medicine, diagnostics, and healthcare software. These companies show superior growth rates, stronger profitability, and command premium valuations from investors. Meanwhile, traditional healthcare providers continue to provide essential services but face margin pressures and consolidation forces. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology spaces show significant variation in performance, with companies developing novel, targeted therapies outperforming more traditional approaches. For investors and industry participants, these trends suggest focusing on companies that leverage technology to improve healthcare outcomes, increase efficiency, or enable precision medicine approaches. The Australian healthcare sector’s future appears increasingly driven by innovation, digitisation, and personalisation, with financial markets already recognising and rewarding companies aligned with these trends.

https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/04/oregon-bill-would-mandate-health-care-employers-track-report-workplace-violence.html,,"Oregon bill would mandate health care employers track , report workplace violence",20250403T220000Z,https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/3UFJTEOUAJEE3LEPA7LNBA375E.JPG?auth=0add86de811127273fc2959d89c31f6d6f5ae6623fce25cb9b0cab0ac4c70bdf&quality=90,oregonlive.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"The emergency room at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Northwest Portland. Oregon lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 537 to fund prevention work in hospitals and mandate health care providers track and report violent incidents to the state. By Alan Cohen | Oregon Capital Chronicle Patrick Hennessy, a registered nurse, remembers being attacked by a patient while working at a homeless shelter in Maryland. The shelter was understaffed and he was the only medical provider present. After he declined to provide nutritional supplements to a patient who was not directed to take them, the patient got increasingly aggressive and attacked Hennessy. “No matter what I did, he just became angrier and angrier, to the point that he shoved me and I stumbled backwards and hit my back against the door,” he said. Hennessy’s experience is part of a growing trend of violence toward health care workers — injuries from workplace violence in hospitals nearly doubled in the last decade and 92% of nurses reported experiencing violence last year in an Oregon Nurses Association survey. After trying and failing to pass a law that criminalized workplace violence last year, Oregon lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 537 to fund prevention work in hospitals across the state, include union representatives in safety committees, increase training minimums and mandate health care providers track and report violent incidents to the state. A committee vote on the bill is scheduled for Thursday. Expanding protections Senate Bill 537 would expand existing protections against assault to all cases of workplace violence, including threats of physical violence, harassment, intimidation and verbal abuse. It would also extend protections from only hospitals and ambulatory centers to also home hospice programs and home health agencies. If passed, health care employers would have to implement a prevention and response plan that includes procedures for investigating violence and a protocol for victims to access medical care and trauma counseling. They would also have to compile data about each incident and submit yearly reports to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, including near-miss incidents, to gather information about the root causes of workplace violence in health care. The bill would also create a grant program to fund metal detectors, violence prevention training and other safety measures. Lawmakers have yet to set a specific amount to be allocated for the grants. If passed, health care employees would also have the right to present identification badges with only their first name, to protect their privacy. Most health care associations, including the Oregon Nurses Association and the Oregon Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, support the measure. “I personally have called the police for real violence on more than one occasion and received minimal assistance. At no point was a police report written,” Craig Rudy, former president of the emergency physicians group, said in written testimony. The Hospital Association of Oregon opposes the bill, and a representative testified that it “has not had sufficient stakeholder agreement.” “Getting a lot worse” Hennessy, now a nurse at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital in Portland, advocates for the bill as the chair of the Health Policy Cabinet at the Oregon Nurses Association, a group that represents over 15,000 nurses and health care employees statewide. He said the bill resulted from nurses and other health care workers recognizing that workplace violence is untenable and getting worse. Health care is the leading industry where employees have to miss work due to workplace violence, followed by education. In March, a patient was arrested for allegedly knocking a nurse to the ground and punching her repeatedly in Connecticut and another patient allegedly brutally attacked a nurse at Palm Beach County Hospital in Florida. In 2023, a security guard at Legacy Health in Portland was shot to death while protecting a maternity ward from an intruder. Hennessy thinks current prevention efforts are insufficient and there is very little research on the matter. “If we can really get more information on the problem, then we can actually help prevent it,” he said. He also believes that workplace violence in health care may be underreported and professionals often fear retaliation or job loss if they speak out about their experiences. “We’ve been conditioned to feel like this is just part of the job, that these things happen and you need to be a stronger person and just brush it off,” he said. Last year, the Legislature failed to pass a bill that would have made attacking a health care worker a felony. Some advocacy groups, including Disability Rights Oregon and the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, publicly opposed the bill, arguing that it punished those with mental illness. Senate Bill 537 exclusively addresses prevention and not punishment, but lawmakers are considering a bill similar to last year’s to punish violence toward health care workers. Senate Bill 170 passed the Senate unanimously and awaits a hearing in the House. State Rep. Travis Nelson, D-Portland, said he has been working to prevent workplace violence in health care for years, including as chief sponsor of last year’s violence prevention bill.

The decline follows the U.S.'s wide-scale implementation of tariffs . GE HealthCare is a truly global company, and the tariff actions will negatively impact its business. GE HealthCare and tariffs The company generated about $9 billion in revenue from North America in 2024, and $10.7 billion from the rest of the world (including $2.4 billion from China). It's a global company, competing with leading healthcare equipment companies like Siemens Healthineers and Philips Healthcare . With 53,000 employees around the globe (only 17,000 in the U.S.), including 7,000 in China, GE HealthCare is exposed to tariff actions in two ways.

Second, as acknowledged in the company's SEC 10-K filing, ""tariffs, and any future tariffs, including on products from Mexico or Canada, by the United States or other countries, will likely result in additional costs to us."" Indeed, back in mid-February, GE HealthCare management incorporated the then-tariffs into its full-year guidance. For reference, tariffs on China were at 10% then. With the latest tariff update, they now stand at a whopping 54%, and given the dynamism of the situation, it's far from clear where they will be in the future. Image source: Getty Images. What's next for GE HealthCare? The tariff actions are undoubtedly challenging for a company like GE HealthCare, which relies on ongoing demand from developed economies and extra growth from countries developing their healthcare provisions. Still, it's unclear whether these tariff actions will prove lasting, and in any case, tariffs could strengthen GE HealthCare's competitive positioning in its home U.S. market."

Effective as of Tuesday, April 1, MU Health Care’s more than 1,200 providers, 80 clinics and seven hospitals were removed from Anthem, Blue Cross Blue Shield—and HealthLink commercial plans that patients get through their employer or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. This means patients may have to pay more out-of-pocket to see their MU Health Care doctors and care teams or may need to find a new, in-network provider for their care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In February, Anthem made the decision to stop negotiating on a new Medicare Advantage contract and to remove MU Health Care from that network. Following this decision, MU Health Care said it continued negotiating with Anthem to remain in their commercial insurance network. “It is our highest priority to help our patients who currently have Anthem coverage navigate their care options including continuing care with MU Health Care, if possible,” said Dr. Stevan Whitt, MU Health Care chief medical officer. Patients with certain ongoing medical conditions may qualify for continuity of care to extend their in-network coverage. Anthem makes the final determination on eligibility, but MU Health Care has provided instructions for patients to help them determine if they are eligible, and how to apply. This network change does not impact Healthy Blue Medicaid or University of Missouri Student Advantage plans, prescriptions Anthem members get through Mizzou Pharmacy or patients who need medically necessary emergency care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement MU Health Care has also established a dedicated call center at 573-650-5409 available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST to answer patient questions and help them understand their options.

Access to health care could worsen as a result of immigrant deportations, according to a researcher. Perspective from Patricia Santos, MD, MS The deportation of immigrant workers and restrictions on immigration could negatively affect health care in the United States, according to study results published in JAMA. “Mass deportations and scaring away new immigrants will harm American’s medical care,” Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, distinguished professor of public health at City University of New York’s Hunter College and lecturer at Harvard Medical School, told Healio. “Everyone has an interest in assuring that immigrants to the U.S. are treated fairly. “The health care system is experiencing shortages of personnel, which have forced hospitals to operate below full capacity. Hospitals face a double whammy — they face shortages of staff to care for acute problems, but the limited availability of nursing-home or home care means they also are often unable to discharge frail patients after their acute problems improve,” she continued. “Mass deportations of immigrants — many of whom work in health care — will lengthen delays in admissions and discharges, worsening access to care for all Americans.” To estimate the number of immigrants in health care who could be affected by deportation or immigration restrictions, Woolhandler and colleagues pooled data from the March 2024 Current Population Survey (CPS), a source for U.S. workforce statistics. The researchers assessed person-level data on occupation, industry, demographics, citizenship, country of origin and receipt of public benefits among 144,265 CPS respondents, of whom 8,587 were health care workers — representing a weighted 20,050,162 individuals. This included 2,319,224 naturalized citizen immigrants and 1,064,147 noncitizens who worked in health care (697,584 documented; 366,563 undocumented). Overall, 161,405 noncitizens qualified for temporary protected status. The researchers found that 936,183 noncitizens worked in formal health care settings and 127,964 noncitizens worked in nonformal settings. Among the 55,802 noncitizen physicians included in the study, more than three-fourths worked in hospitals and accounted for 8.8% of all physicians. Moreover, 148,445 noncitizens worked as registered nurses and 443,958 as nursing aides or assistants, according to the researchers. Both documented and undocumented noncitizen immigrants accounted for at least 10% of personnel in home care agencies and nonformal settings, 7% of nursing home workers and nearly 4% of personnel in hospitals and outpatient settings. The researchers acknowledged study limitations, including the potential that CPS may undercount undocumented immigrants and nonformal workers. “Health professionals need to raise awareness that most immigrants are not criminals or freeloaders, but people who want to live here safely and to work,” Woolhandler said. “The 3.4 million immigrants, including naturalized citizens, working in American health care include not only highly skilled professionals, like physicians, medical researchers and registered nurses, but also many direct care workers, like nursing assistants and orderlies, who provide day-to-day care for frail patients.” For more information: Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, can be reach at swoolhan@hunter.cuny.edu . Perspective Back to Top Patricia Santos, MD, MS Patricia Santos, MD, MS This study underscores the essential role that immigrants play in the U.S. health care workforce, with findings that have direct implications in oncology, particularly as cancer care delivery continues its increasing shift away from inpatient and hospital-based settings to outpatient care and home-based settings. In this context, direct patient caregivers, including home health aides, will be indispensable for delivering consistent, compassionate cancer care — particularly for older adults, patients nearing end of life and those managing treatment-related disabilities. With that said, ongoing threats to immigrants, with and without legal status, risk exacerbating existing workforce shortages in oncology. These policies also destabilize the training pipeline, particularly for international medical graduates and researchers who form a key segment of the oncology trainee population. Ultimately these findings present an important call to action: Oncology leaders must advocate for immigration policies that support workforce sustainability, patient care continuity and equity across the cancer care continuum.

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Oregon lawmakers are considering more violence prevention training for health care workers. (Photo by Alan Cohen/Oregon Capital Chronicle) Patrick Hennessy, a registered nurse, remembers being attacked by a patient while working at a homeless shelter in Maryland. The shelter was understaffed and he was the only medical provider present. After he declined to provide nutritional supplements to a patient who was not directed to take them, the patient got increasingly aggressive and attacked Hennessy. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “No matter what I did, he just became angrier and angrier, to the point that he shoved me and I stumbled backwards and hit my back against the door,” he said. Hennessy’s experience is part of a growing trend of violence toward health care workers — injuries from workplace violence in hospitals nearly doubled in the last decade and 92% of nurses reported experiencing violence last year in an Oregon Nurses Association survey. After trying and failing to pass a law that criminalized workplace violence last year, lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 537 to fund prevention work in hospitals across the state, include union representatives in safety committees, increase training minimums and mandate health care providers track and report violent incidents to the state. A committee vote on the bill is scheduled for Thursday. Expanding protections Senate Bill 537 would expand existing protections against assault to all cases of workplace violence, including threats of physical violence, harassment, intimidation and verbal abuse. It would also extend protections from only hospitals and ambulatory centers to also home hospice programs and home health agencies. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement If passed, health care employers would have to implement a prevention and response plan that includes procedures for investigating violence and a protocol for victims to access medical care and trauma counseling. They would also have to compile data about each incident and submit yearly reports to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, including near-miss incidents, to gather information about the root causes of workplace violence in health care. The bill would also create a grant program to fund metal detectors, violence prevention training and other safety measures. Lawmakers have yet to set a specific amount to be allocated for the grants. If passed, health care employees would also have the right to present identification badges with only their first name, to protect their privacy. Most health care associations, including the Oregon Nurses Association and the Oregon Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, support the measure. “I personally have called the police for real violence on more than one occasion and received minimal assistance. At no point was a police report written,” Craig Rudy, former president of the emergency physicians group, said in written testimony. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Hospital Association of Oregon opposes the bill, and a representative testified that it “has not had sufficient stakeholder agreement.” “Getting a lot worse” Hennessy, now a nurse at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital in Portland, advocates for the bill as the chair of the Health Policy Cabinet at the Oregon Nurses Association, a group that represents over 15,000 nurses and health care employees statewide. He said the bill resulted from nurses and other health care workers recognizing that workplace violence is untenable and getting worse. Health care is the leading industry where employees have to miss work due to workplace violence, followed by education. In March, a patient was arrested for allegedly knocking a nurse to the ground and punching her repeatedly in Connecticut and another patient allegedly brutally attacked a nurse at Palm Beach County Hospital in Florida. In 2023, a security guard at Legacy Health in Portland was shot to death while protecting a maternity ward from an intruder. Hennessy thinks current prevention efforts are insufficient and there is very little research on the matter. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “If we can really get more information on the problem, then we can actually help prevent it,” he said. He also believes that workplace violence in health care may be underreported and professionals often fear retaliation or job loss if they speak out about their experiences. “We’ve been conditioned to feel like this is just part of the job, that these things happen and you need to be a stronger person and just brush it off,” he said. Last year, the Legislature failed to pass a bill that would have made attacking a health care worker a felony. Some advocacy groups, including Disability Rights Oregon and the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, publicly opposed the bill, arguing that it punished those with mental illness. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Senate Bill 537 exclusively addresses prevention and not punishment, but lawmakers are considering a bill similar to last year’s to punish violence toward health care workers. Senate Bill 170 passed the Senate unanimously and awaits a hearing in the House. State Rep. Travis Nelson, D-Portland, said he has been working to prevent workplace violence in health care for years, including as chief sponsor of last year’s violence prevention bill. Senate Bill 537 differs from last year’s as it addresses the root causes of workplace violence and is not approached as broadly, he said.

By Roxey Nelson PUBLISHED: April 3, 2025 at 5:30 AM EDT Our health care is under attack. The Trump administration and lawmakers at the state and federal level have proposed deep and dangerous cuts to Medicaid and other programs that would take essential health care away from Florida children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities and more to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires. Frontline caregivers across Florida, who protect the well-being of our families, friends and loved ones young and old, are vehemently against these cuts. They know first-hand the pain and suffering that will be felt in our communities with even greater shortages of accessible and affordable coverage and care. Roxey Nelson is executive vice president of Miramar-based 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, the largest union of hospital and nursing home caregivers in Florida. (courtesy, Roxey Nelson) In the very first days of his second term, Donald Trump immediately rescinded executive orders that had lowered the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, enhanced the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and strengthened protections for Medicaid enrollees. This callous action will especially hurt working families in our state, as Florida leads the nation with 4.6 million people enrolled in ACA health care coverage. It’s clear to caregivers that Trump’s “concept of a plan” for health care is to take it away. We can’t forget the first Trump administration tried to kill the ACA altogether and fell just one vote short in the U.S. Senate. From the start, the administration has prioritized slashing health care programs that serve working families, seniors and those in greatest need — with more attacks sure to come. So far, the Republican majority in Congress has collaborated in these attacks, recently approving budget resolutions that would trigger billions in health care funding reductions. These dramatic cuts to essential programs are designed to gift another massive windfall in tax breaks for billionaires and big business at the expense and health of working families. It is a blatant breaking our nation’s promises and investments in working people while lavishing more riches on the wealthy. Committed health care workers, who by nature wish to first care and nurture those in need, find this especially repugnant. Medicaid helps people at all stages of life. In our state, the program helps fund care for two of every five children, four out of seven of our elderly loved ones in nursing facilities, and millions of Floridians of every age in between. Our caregivers will lead the fight to fend off these dangerous policies. We will battle to protect and improve health care, such as expanding Medicaid to hard-working but low-paid Floridians. Tallahassee lawmakers have kept Florida as one of only 10 states failing to access these benefits that we’ve already paid for through our federal taxes, so we are working hard to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot. We are urging the Florida Legislature to pass bills that ensure care facilities are transparent with public funding and fully accountable for quality care for seniors, family members and fellow Floridians. Our 1199SEIU union of 35,000 active and retired health care workers in Florida has already launched this effort with letters, lobbying and much more to lawmakers in Tallahassee and Washington. This will be a difficult challenge, locally and our nation. The cynical assaults on health care already have been cold, swift and deep, with many others expected over the next four years. But as committed caregivers, we will lead the fight to protect our care and communities. Join us to tell Trump and Tallahassee, “Hands Off Our Health care!” Roxey Nelson is executive vice president of Miramar-based 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, the largest union of hospital and nursing home caregivers in Florida.

More than one-third of Americans -- an estimated 91 million people -- say they couldn't afford to access quality health care if they needed it today, according to the latest West Health-Gallup Healthcare Affordability Index. ""The rising trajectory in the inability to pay for healthcare is a disturbing trend that is likely to continue and even accelerate,"" said Tim Lash , president of West Health Policy Center, part of a group of nonprofit organizations focused on healthcare and aging. ""Policy action at both the state and federal level is urgently needed, or even more Americans will have to go without treatment or be forced to make painful tradeoffs between paying for medical care or paying for other necessities,"" Lash continued in a news release. ""The human and economic costs are enormous."" Related Trump announces 25% tariffs on autos, light trucks made outside U.S. Stock indexes suffer worst losses this year amid consumer, business economic fears Senate panel advances RFK Jr. nomination to become health secretary The Healthcare Affordability Index has been tracking health care access in the U.S. since 2021, researchers said. Its latest results show that 35% of Americans could not access quality health care if they need it. Rates were even higher among Black Americans (46%) and Hispanic Americans (52%), results show. Access to health care remained stable among wealthier Americans, but declined significantly among lower-income households. About two-thirds (64%) of people earning less than $24,000 said they can't afford health care, an 11-point increase from 2023, results show. Likewise, 57% of households with an annual income between $24,000 and $48,000 said they struggle to afford health care, up 12 points from 2023. In all, about half (51%) of Americans are considered ""cost secure,"" in that they have faced no recent difficulty affording either health care or prescriptions, researchers found. It's the lowest level observed since the index started in 2021. Hispanic Americans have experienced the greatest declines in such security, with 34% saying they have no problem affording health care - down 17 points from 2021. Black Americans experienced a 13-point drop in health care security, with 41% now saying they don't struggle with health care bills. Overall, about 11% of Americans, about 29 million people, are classified as ""cost desperate"" - meaning they are unable to afford either health care or prescriptions. ""Healthcare affordability and access continue to erode nationally, and this issue is especially acute among Black, Hispanic, and lower-income adults,"" Dan Witters , a senior researcher at Gallup, said in a news release. ""White adults and those in higher-income households, in contrast, remain largely insulated from these worsening trends,"" Witters added. ""Among these groups, this is the widest gap in access to care we have recorded thus far, with many Americans experiencing increased hardship year over year."" The survey was conducted online and by mail between Nov. 18 and Dec. 27 among 6,296 people 18 and older. Respondents were from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Current efforts by Congress to ""reform"" the health care system are centered on several flawed policy initiatives that will transfer more power and decisions to Washington and away from patients and families. Rather than create a massive government-based health care system and dislocate people from their existing private coverage, policymakers should focus on putting the health care system on a path where individuals and families are in control of their health care dollars and decisions. Shortfalls of the Health Care Bills The following five provisions are the cornerstone of the House and Senate bills and unavoidably result in legislation taking health care reform in the wrong direction. 1. New Public Plan and Federal Exchange. Both the House and Senate bills would create a new government-run health care plan through the establishment of a federally run national health insurance exchange. The result: widespread erosion of private insurance and substantial consolidation of federal control over health care through the exchange. [1] As is evident in the details of the House bill (H.R. 3200), there is no level playing field for competition between the government plans and private health plans. Plus, the incentives in the legislation guarantee that millions of Americans will lose their existing employer-based coverage. 2. Federal Regulation of Health Insurance. Both the House and Senate bills would result in sweeping and complex federal regulation of health insurance. Moreover, it would take oversight away from states and concentrate it in Washington. [2] 3. Massive New Taxpayer-Funded Subsidies. Both the House and Senate would expand eligibility for Medicaid, but they would also extend new taxpayer-funded subsidies to the middle class. Such commitments would result in scores of Americans dependent on the government to finance their health care. [3] This is unfortunate because Congress could have reformed the tax treatment of health insurance to enable people to keep their existing private coverage and buy better private coverage if they wished to do so. 4. Employer Mandate. Both the House and Senate bills would impose an employer mandate for employers who do not offer coverage and for those whose benefits do not meet a new federal standard. An employer mandate would hurt low-income workers the most and would also stifle much-needed economic growth. [4] Employer mandates are passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation. This is exactly the wrong prescription for businesses, especially during a recession. 5. Individual Mandate. Both the House and Senate bills would require all people to buy health insurance. There is no doubt that such a mandate would result in a tax increase on individuals and families whose health insurance does not meet the new federally determined standards. This means that Congress will, for the first time, force Americans to buy federally designed packages of health benefits, even if they do not want or need those benefits. It also means that health benefits will tend to become increasingly costly as powerful special interest groups and representatives of the health industry lobby intensively to expand the legally mandated health benefits, medical treatments and procedures, and drugs that all Americans must buy under penalty of law. A Better Direction for Health Care Reform Congress should stop and take a step back from these divisive House and Senate measures. Instead of trying to overhaul one-sixth of the American economy and seize an unprecedented amount of political control over health care decisions and dollars, policymakers should consider proceeding with smaller, incremental improvements. Policymakers need to proceed slowly and deliberately, making sure that the initial steps they take are not disruptive of what Americans have and want to keep, actually work, and do not result in costly and damaging and unintended consequences. There are three broad areas where Members can and should find consensus: 1. Promote State Innovation. Congress should preserve the states' autonomy over their health care systems and give them greater legal freedom to devise solutions that meet the unique characteristics of their citizens. In addition, individuals should also have the freedom to purchase coverage from trusted sources and not be restricted by where they happen to live. This means that Americans should be able to buy better coverage across state lines. Congress should respect and encourage personal freedom and diversity. 2. Establish Fairness in the Tax Treatment of Health Insurance. There is little disagreement that today's health care tax policy--which favors coverage obtained through the workplace--distorts the market and is inequitable. Instead of expanding government-run programs like Medicaid, policymakers should offer tax relief to those individuals who purchase private health insurance on their own, regardless of where they work. At the same time, Congress should make sure that tax relief goes only to taxpayers. Congress should also devise a voucher program, giving low-income citizens the opportunity to get private coverage if they wish to do so. There is a broad bipartisan consensus that Congress should help low-income working families with direct assistance to enable them to get health insurance. 3. Get Serious About Entitlement Reform. Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health care entitlement programs, are not only increasingly costly, but they are also not delivering value to the taxpayers. The best way to secure value to patients (not government officials) is to compel health providers to compete directly for consumer dollars by allowing seniors and the poor to choose the coverage that is right for them using the money that is already available to them in these programs. This will ""bend the cost curve"" while at the same time allowing private-sector innovation to flourish. Consumer-Driven Reform Americans want to fix the problems in the health care system--but not at the expense of their own coverage. It is time policymakers recognize the lack of support for a major overhaul. But instead of continuing to protect the status quo, Congress should advance improvements that put the health care system on a path to reform. Such improvements should be focused on increasing choice and competition not by turning control over to Washington but by empowering individuals and families to control their health care dollars and decisions.

The Improving Care in Rural America Reauthorization Act focuses on grants such as the Rural Health Care Services Outreach and Small Health Care Provider Quality Improvement, which Schrier noted as crucial for improving health care quality in rural areas. “The Eighth District is nearly 10,000 square miles, with many of my constituents living in rural communities that depend on a scarce number of medical providers in their area. In Congress, I’m focused on supporting rural health care to ensure that Americans can get care close to home,” said Congresswoman Schrier. “As a doctor, I understand the importance of rural clinics and hospitals. Without them, patients, including those in my district, would have to drive even farther to seek medical care. That’s dangerous in an emergency. That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to extend key federal grants that strengthen rural health care.” Schrier added that these grants are distributed across the United States to improve the quality and delivery of health care services in rural areas, and establish integrated health care networks.

C . health care sparks outcry,20250401T234500Z,https://images.dailyhive.com/20250401113323/mask-bc-healthcare.jpg,dailyhive.com,English,Canada,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Amir Ali/Daily Hive We’ve come a long way from the days of general mask mandates for the public, but a recent move to eliminate the requirement in B.C. health care settings is causing some outcry. According to a recent BC Ministry of Health release, “People are still encouraged to wear medical masks in health care settings as appropriate,” but it is not mandatory. Some groups, including Protect Our Province BC and DoNoHarm BC, are questioning the decision. This response comes after B.C. announced that it was launching the spring immunization campaign on April 8 . You might also like: BC confirms first measles case in five years and urges vaccination B.C. wants to recruit American doctors as trade war heats up Minimum wage is going up in these Canadian provinces in 2025 In January, as part of responding to the respiratory illness season, the ministry said, “Medical masks are required for health care workers, visitors, contractors and volunteers.” “On Friday, March 28, 2025, Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared the end of the 2024-25 respiratory illness season. So, extra measures in health care facilities are no longer required.” The ministry said that in some cases when additional precautions are required, health care workers will wear masks or respirators. “The standard that requires use of personal protective equipment and additional precautions based on point-of-care risk assessment remains in place,” the ministry said. Some groups suggest that the decision not to have masks as a general requirement in B.C. health care settings endangers vulnerable patients and frontline workers. DoNoHarm BC has spoken to health care professionals, patients and other medical experts who have shared their feelings about removing the mask requirement. Dr. Karina Zeidler, the founder of Protect Our Province BC, said, “The numbers don’t lie: when staff mask in hospitals, it cuts down respiratory illness transmission by a third , while N95 masks can eliminate 98% of exhaled viruses. ” DoNoHarm BC spoke to a cancer patient in Victoria, B.C., who said, “I don’t understand how people can work in cancer care and not want to take this simple step to protect patients.” There is also some concern due to a seeming rise in measles cases in some areas. B.C. confirmed its first case in five years last month. A Vancouver resident living with long COVID said removing mask mandates makes health care settings inaccessible to those needing it most. “Health care settings are now more essential to people like me living with compromised immune systems than ever,” they added. A B.C. cancer patient also chimed in, saying, “Why is an X-ray tech not required to be in an N95 when she’s literally in a cancer patient’s face?” One B.C. resident claimed they got infected with COVID for the first time after visiting LifeLabs. “I got infected with COVID-19 for the first time at Lifelabs while getting bloodwork during the summer of 2022. Only surgical masks were used by staff and patients alike, and it was not protective enough to keep me safe, especially in the poorly ventilated space. That infection left me with severe chronic headaches and memory issues.” The release from DoNoHarm also includes a link to a petition with nearly 30,000 signatures, asking for mask mandates to remain in health care settings. The demand from DoNoHarm and associated groups is to have a mask requirement year-round and to provide clear direction to all of the health authorities to enact that requirement. We’ve put these concerns to the BC Ministry of Health and will update this article when we hear back. Do you agree with the concerns of these residents and health care professionals that the mask requirement should remain in B.C. health care settings?

Charette 30 Mar 2025 16 min read iStock/IEEE Spectrum Red Cheryl Conrad no longer seethes with the frustration that threatened to overwhelm her in 2006. As described in IEEE Spectrum , Cheryl’s husband, Tom, has a rare genetic disease that causes ammonia to accumulate in his blood. At an emergency room visit two decades ago, Cheryl told the doctors Tom needed an immediate dose of lactulose to avoid going into a coma, but they refused to medicate him until his primary doctor confirmed his medical condition hours later. Making the situation more vexing was that Tom had been treated at that facility for the same problem a few months earlier, and no one could locate his medical records . After Tom’s recovery, Cheryl vowed to always have immediate access to them. Today, Cheryl says, “Happily, I’m not involved anymore in lugging Tom’s medical records everywhere.” Tom’s two primary medical facilities use the same electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing doctors at both facilities to access his medical information quickly. In 2004, President George W. Bush set an ambitious goal for U.S. health care providers to transition to EHRs by 2014. Electronic health records , he declared, would transform health care by ensuring that a person’s complete medical information was available “at the time and place of care, no matter where it originates.” President George W. Bush looks at an electronic medical record system during a visit to the Cleveland Clinic on 27 January 2005. Brooks Kraft/Corbis/Getty Images Over the next four years, a bipartisan Congress approved more than US $150 million in funding aimed at setting up electronic health record demonstration projects and creating the administrative infrastructure needed. Then, in 2009, during efforts to mitigate the financial crisis, newly elected President Barack Obama signed the $787 billion economic stimulus bill. Part of it contained the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act , also known as the HITECH Act, which budgeted $49 billion to promote health information technology and EHRs in the United States . As a result, Tom, like most Americans, now has an electronic health record. However, many millions of Americans now have multiple electronic health records . On average, patients in the United States visit 19 different kinds of doctors throughout their lives. Further, many specialists have unique EHR systems that do not automatically communicate medical data between each other, so you must update your medical information for each one. Nevertheless, Tom now has immediate access to all his medical treatment and test information, something not readily available 20 years ago. Tom’s situation underlines the paradox of how far the United States has come since 2004 and how far it still must go to achieve President Bush’s vision of a complete, secure, easily accessible, and seamlessly interoperable lifetime EHR. As of 2021, nearly 80 percent of physicians and almost all nonfederal acute-care hospitals deployed an electronic health record system. For many patients in the United States today, instead of fragmented, paper medical record silos, they have a plethora of fragmented, electronic medical record silos. And thousands of health care providers are burdened with costly, poorly designed, and insecure EHR systems that have exacerbated clinician burnout, led to hundreds of millions of medical records lost in data breaches , and created new sources of medical errors. EHR’s baseline standardization does help centralize a very fragmented health care system, but in the rush to get EHR systems adopted, key technological and security challenges were overlooked and underappreciated. Subsequently, problems were introduced due to the sheer complexity of the systems being deployed. These still-unresolved issues are now potentially coupled with the unknown consequences of bolting on immature AI-driven technologies. Unless more thought and care are taken now in how to proceed as a fully integrated health care system, we could unintentionally put the entire U.S. health care system in a worse place than when President Bush first declared his EHR goal in 2004. IT to Correct Health Care Inefficiencies Is a Global Project Putting government pressure on the health care industry to adopt EHR systems through various financial incentives made sense by the early 2000s. Health care in the United States was in deep trouble . Spending increased from $74.1 billion in 1970 to more than $1.4 trillion by 2000, 2.3 times as fast as the U.S. gross domestic product. Health care costs grew at three times the rate of inflation from 1990 to 2000 alone, surpassing 13 percent of GDP. Two major studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine in 2000 and 2001, titled To Err Is Human and Crossing the Quality Chasm , found that health care was deteriorating in terms of accessibility, quality, and safety. Inferior quality and needless medical treatments, including overuse or duplication of diagnostic tests, underuse of effective medical practices, misuse of drug therapies, and poor communication between health care providers emerged as particularly frustrating problems. Administrative waste and unnecessary expenditures were substantial cost drivers, from billing to resolving insurance claims to managing patients’ cases. Health care’s administrative side was characterized as a “ monstrosity ,” showing huge transaction costs associated with an estimated 30 billion communications conducted by mail, fax, or telephone annually at that time. Both health care experts and policymakers agreed that reductions in health care delivery and its costs were possible only by deploying health information technology such as electronic prescribing and EHR. Early adopters of EHR systems like the Mayo Clinic , Cleveland Clinic, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs proved the case. Governments across the European Union and the United Kingdom reached the same conclusion. There has been a consistent push , especially in more economically advanced countries, to adopt EHR systems over the past two decades. For example, the E.U. has set a goal of providing 100 percent of its citizens across 27 countries access to electronic health records by 2030. Several countries are well on their way to this achievement, including Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Lithuania , and Poland . Outside the E.U., countries such as Israel and Singapore also have very advanced systems, and after a rocky start , Australia’s My Health Record system seems to have found its footing. The United Kingdom was hoping to be a global leader in adopting interoperable health information systems, but a disastrous implementation of its National Programme for IT ended in 2011 after nine years and more than £10 billion. Canada , China , India , and Japan also have EHR system initiatives in place at varying levels of maturity. However, it will likely be years before they achieve the same capabilities found in leading digital-health countries. EHRs Need a Systems-Engineering Approach When it comes to embracing automation , the health care industry has historically moved at a snail’s pace, and when it does move, money goes to IT automation first. Market forces alone were unlikely to speed up EHR adoption. Even in the early 2000s, health care experts and government officials were confident that digitalization could reduce total health spending by 10 percent while improving patient care. In a highly influential 2005 study , the RAND Corp . estimated that adopting EHR systems in hospitals and physician offices would cost $98 billion and $17 billion, respectively. The report also estimated that these entities would save at least $77 billion a year after moving to digital records. A highly cited paper in HealthAffairs from 2005 also claimed that small physician practices could recoup their EHR system investments in 2.5 years and profit handsomely thereafter. Moreover, RAND claimed that a fully automated health care system could save the United States $346 billion per year. When Michael O. Leavitt , then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, looked at the projected savings, he saw them as “ a key part of saving Medicare .” As baby boomers began retiring en masse in the early 2010s, cutting health care costs was also a political imperative since Medicare funding was projected to run out by 2020. Some doubted the EHR revolution’s health care improvement and cost reduction claims or that it could be achieved within 20 years. The Congressional Budget Office argued that the RAND report overstated the potential costs and benefits of EHR systems and ignored peer-reviewed studies that contradicted it. The CBO also pointed out that RAND assumed EHR systems would be widely adopted and effectively used, which implies that effective tools already existed, though very few commercially available systems were. There was also skepticism about whether replicating the benefits for early adopters of EHR systems—who spent decades perfecting their systems— was possible once the five-year period of governmental EHR adoption incentives ended . Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a strong advocate for electronic health record systems, warned that health care was “ 30 times more difficult to fix than national defense .” The extent of the problem was one reason the 2005 National Academy of Sciences report , Building a Better Delivery System: A New Engineering / Health Care Partnership , forcefully and repeatedly called for innovative systems-engineering approaches to be developed and applied across the entire health care delivery process. The scale, complexity, and extremely short time frame for attempting to transform the totality of the health care environment demanded a robust “system of systems” engineering approach. This was especially true because of the potential human impacts of automation on health care professionals and patients. Researchers warned that ignoring the interplay of computer-mediated work and existing sociotechnical conditions in health care practices would result in unexpected, unintentional, and undesirable consequences. Additionally, without standard mechanisms for making EHR systems interoperable, many potential benefits would not materialize. As David Brailer, the first National Health Information Technology Coordinator, stated , “Unless interoperability is achieved…potential clinical and economic benefits won’t be realized, and we will not move closer to badly needed health care reform in the U.S.” HITECH’s Broken Promises and Unforeseen Consequences A few years later, policymakers in the Obama administration thought it was unrealistic to prioritize interoperability. They feared that defining interoperability standards too early would lock the health industry into outdated information-sharing approaches. Further, no existing health care business model supported interoperability, and a strong business model actively discouraged providers from sharing information. If patient information could easily shift to another provider, for example, what incentive does the provider have to readily share it? Instead, policymakers decided to have EHR systems adopted as widely and quickly as possible during the five years of HITECH incentives. Tackling interoperability would come later. The government’s unofficial operational mantra was that EHR systems needed to become operational before they could become interoperable . “Researchers have found that doctors spend between 3.5 and 6 hours a day (4.5 hours on average) filling out their digital health records.” Existing EHR system vendors, making $2 billion annually at the time, viewed the HITECH incentive program as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to increase market share and revenue streams. Like fresh chum to hungry sharks, the subsidy money attracted a host of new EHR technology entrants eager for a piece of the action. The resulting feeding frenzy pitted an IT-naïve health care industry rushing to adopt EHR systems against a horde of vendors willing to promise (almost) anything to make a sale. A few years into the HITECH program, a 2013 report by RAND wryly observed the market distortion caused by what amounted to an EHR adoption mandate: “We found that (EHR system) usability represents a relatively new, unique, and vexing challenge to physician professional satisfaction. Few other service industries are exposed to universal and substantial incentives to adopt such a specific, highly regulated form of technology, which has, as our findings suggest, not yet matured.” In addition to forcing health care providers to choose quickly among a host of immature EHR solutions, the HITECH program completely undercut the warnings raised about the need for systems engineering or considering the impact of automation on very human-centered aspects of health care delivery by professionals. Sadly, the lack of attention to these concerns affects current EHR systems. Today, studies like that conducted by Stanford Medicine indicate that nearly 70 percent of health care professionals express some level of satisfaction with their electronic health record system and that more than 60 percent think EHR systems have improved patient care. Electronic prescribing has also been seen as a general success , with the risk of medication errors and adverse drug events reduced. However, professional satisfaction with EHRs runs shallow. The poor usability of EHR systems surfaced early in the HITECH program and continues as a main driver for physician dissatisfaction. The Stanford Medicine study , for example, also reported that 54 percent of physicians polled felt their EHR systems detracted from their professional satisfaction, and 59 percent felt it required a complete overhaul. “What we’ve essentially done is created 24/7/365 access to clinicians with no economic model for that: The doctors don’t get paid.” —Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Poor EHR system usability results in laborious and low-value data entry, obstacles to face-to-face patient communication, and information overload , where clinicians have to wade through an excess of irrelevant data when treating a patient. A 2019 study in Mayo Clinic Proceedings comparing EHR system usability to other IT products like Google Search, Microsoft Word, and Amazon placed EHR products in the bottom 10 percent. Electronic health record systems were supposed to increase provider productivity, but for many clinicians, their EHRs are productivity vampires instead. Researchers have found that doctors spend between 3.5 and 6 hours a day (4.5 hours on average) filling out their patient’s digital health records, with an Annals of Internal Medicine study reporting that doctors in outpatient settings spend only 27 percent of their work time face-to-face with their patients. In those visits, patients often complain that their doctors spend too much time staring at their computers. They are not likely wrong, as nearly 70 percent of doctors in 2018 felt that EHRs took valuable time away from their patients. To address this issue, health care providers employ more than 100,000 medical scribes today—or about one for every 10 U.S. physicians—to record documentation during office visits, but this only highlights the unacceptable usability problem. Furthermore, physicians are spending more time dealing with their EHRs because the government, health care managers, and insurance companies are requesting more patient information regarding billing, quality measures, and compliance data. Patient notes are twice as long as they were 10 years ago. This is not surprising, as EHR systems so far have not complemented clinician work as much as directed it. “A phenomenon of the productivity vampire is that the goalposts get moved,” explains University of Michigan professor emeritus John Leslie King, who coined the phrase “productivity vampire.” King, a student of system–human interactions, continues, “With the ability to better track health care activities, more government and insurance companies are going to ask for that information in order for providers to get paid.” Robert Wachter is chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Christopher Michel/Wikipedia Robert Wachter , chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of The Digital Doctor: Hope, Hype, and Harm at the Dawn of Medicine’s Computer Age , believes that EHRs “became an enabler of corporate control and outside entity control.” “It became a way that entities that cared about what the doctor was doing could now look to see in real time what the doctor was doing, and then influence what the doctor was doing and even constrain it,” Wachter says. Federal law mandates that patients have access to their medical information contained in EHR systems—which is great, says Wachter, but this also adds to clinician workloads, as patients now feel free to pepper their physicians with emails and messages about the information. “What we’ve essentially done is created 24/7/365 access to clinicians with no economic model for that: The doctors don’t get paid,” Wachter says. His doctors’ biggest complaints are that their EHR system has overloaded email inboxes with patient inquiries. Some doctors report that their in-boxes have become the equivalent of a second set of patients. It is not so much a problem with the electronic information system design per se, notes Wachter, but with EHR systems that “meet the payment system and the workflow system in ways that we really did not think about.” EHRs also promised to reduce stress among health care professionals. Numerous studies have found, however, that EHR systems worsen clinician burnout , with Stanford Medicine finding that 71 percent of physicians felt the systems contributed to burnout. Half of U.S. physicians are experiencing burnout, with 63 percent reporting at least one manifestation in 2022. The average physician works 53 hours weekly (19 hours more than the general population) and spends over 4 hours daily on documentation. Clinical burnout is lowest among clinicians with highly usable EHR systems or in specialties with the least interaction with their EHR systems, such as surgeons and radiologists. Physicians who make, on average, 4,000 EHR system clicks per shift, like emergency room doctors, report the highest levels of burnout. Aggravating the situation, notes Wachter, was “that decision support is so rudimentary…which means that the doctors feel like they’re spending all this time entering data in the machine, (but) getting relatively little useful intelligence out of it.” Poorly designed information systems can also compromise patient safety . Evidence suggests that EHR systems with unacceptable usability contribute to low-quality patient care and reduce the likelihood of catching medical errors. According to a study funded by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , EHR system issues were involved in the majority of malpractice claims over a six-and-a-half-year period of study ending in 2021. Sadly, the situation has not changed today. Interoperability, Cybersecurity Bite Back EHR system interoperability closely follows poor EHR system usability as a driver of health care provider dissatisfaction. Recent data from the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy / Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology indicates that 70 percent of hospitals sometimes exchange patient data, though only 43 percent claim they regularly do. System-affiliated hospitals share the most information, while independent and small hospitals share the least. Exchanging information using the same EHR system helps. Wachter observes that interoperability among similar EHR systems is straightforward, but across different EHR systems, he says, “it is still relatively weak.” However, even if two hospitals use the same EHR vendor, communicating patient data can be difficult if each hospital’s system is customized. Studies indicate that patient mismatch rates can be as high as 50 percent, even in practices using the same EHR vendor. This often leads to duplicate patient records that lack vital patient information, which can result in avoidable patient injuries and deaths . The ability to share information associated with a unique patient identifier (UPI), like other countries that use advanced EHRs, including Estonia, Israel, and Singapore, makes health information interoperability easier, says Christina Grimes , digital health strategist for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS). But in the United States, “Congress has forbidden it since 1998” and steadfastly resists allowing for UPIs, she notes. Using a single-payer health insurance system, like most other countries with advanced EHR systems, would also make sharing patient information easier , decrease time spent on EHRs, and reduce clinician burnout , but that is also a nonstarter in the United States for the foreseeable future. Interoperability is even more challenging because an average hospital uses 10 different EHR vendors internally to support more than a dozen different health care functions, and an average health system has 16 different EHR vendors when affiliated providers are included. Grimes notes that only a small percentage of health care systems use fully integrated EHR systems that cover all functions. EHR systems adoption also promised to bend the national health care cost curve, but these costs continue to rise at the national level. The United States spent an estimated $4.8 trillion on health care in 2023, or 17.6 percent of GDP. While there seems to be general agreement that EHRs can help with cost savings , no rigorous quantitative studies at the national level show the tens of billions of dollars of promised savings that RAND loudly proclaimed in 2005. However, studies have shown that health care providers, especially those in rural areas, have had difficulty saving money by using EHR systems. A recent study , for example, points out that rural hospitals do not benefit as much from EHR systems as urban hospitals in terms of reducing operating costs. With 700 rural hospitals at risk of closing due to severe financial pressures, investing in EHR systems has not proved to be the financial panacea they thought it would be. Cybersecurity is a major cost not included in the 2005 RAND study . Even though there were warnings that cybersecurity was being given short shrift , vendors, providers, and policymakers paid scant attention to the cybersecurity implications of EHR systems, especially the multitude of new cyberthreat access points that would be created and potentially exploited. Tom Leary , senior vice president and head of government relations at HIMSS, points out the painfully obvious fact that “security was an afterthought. You have to make sure that security by design is involved from the beginning, so we’re still paying for the decision not to invest in security.” From 2009 to 2023, a total of 5,887 health care breaches of 500 records or more have been reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights resulting in some 520 million health care records being exposed. Health care breaches have also led to widespread disruption to medical care in various hospital systems, sometimes for over a month. In 2024, the average cost of a health care data breach was $9.97 million. The cost of these breaches will soon surpass the $27 billion ($44.5 billion in 2024 dollars) provided under HITECH to adopt EHRs. 2025 may see the first major revision since 2013 to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) Security Rule outlining how electronic protected health information will need to be cybersecured. The proposed rule will likely force health care providers and their EHR vendors to make cybersecurity investment a much higher priority. $100 Billion Spent on Health Care IT: Was the Juice Worth the (Mega) Squeeze? The U.S. health care industry has spent more than $100 billion on information technology, but few providers are fully meeting President Bush’s vision of a nation of seamlessly interoperable and secure digital health records. Many past government policymakers now admit they failed to understand the complex business dynamics, technical scale, complexity, or time needed to create a nationwide system of usable, interoperable EHR systems. The entire process lacked systems-engineering thinking. As Seema Verma , former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Fortune , “We didn’t think about how all these systems connect with one another. That was the real missing piece.” Over the past eight years, successive administrations and congresses have taken actions to try to rectify these early oversights. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was passed, which kept EHR system vendors and providers from blocking the sharing of patient data, and spurred them to start working in earnest to create a trusted health information exchange. The Cures Act mandated standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) to promote interoperability. In 2022, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) was published, which aims to facilitate technical principles for securely exchanging health information. “The EHR venture has proved troublesome thus far. The trouble is far from over.” —John Leslie King, University of Michigan professor emeritus In late 2023, the first Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) were approved to begin supporting the exchange of data governed by TEFCA, and in 2024, updates were made to the APIs to make information interoperability easier. These seven QHINs allow thousands of health providers to more easily exchange information. Combined with the emerging consolidation among hospital systems around three EHR vendors— Epic Systems Corp ., Oracle Health , and Meditech — this should improve interoperability in the next decade. These changes, says HIMSS’s Tom Leary, will help give “all patients access to their data in whatever format they want with limited barriers. The health care environment is starting to become patient-centric now. So, as a patient, I should soon be able to go out to any of my healthcare providers to really get that information.” HIMSS’s Christina Grimes adds that the patient-centric change is the continuing consolidation of EHR system portals. “Patients really want one portal to interact with instead of the number they have today,” she says. In 2024, the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy / Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT , the U.S. government department responsible for overseeing electronic health systems’ adoption and standards, was reorganized to focus more on cybersecurity and advanced technology like AI. In addition to the proposed HIPAA security requirements, Congress is also considering new laws to mandate better cybersecurity . There is hope that AI can help overcome EHR system usability issues, especially clinician burnout and interoperability issues like patient matching. Wachter states that the new AI scribes are showing real promise. “The way it works is that I can now have a conversation with my patient and look the patient in the eye. I’m actually focusing on them and not my keyboard. And then a note, formatted correctly, just magically appears. Almost ironically, this new set of AI technologies may well solve some of the problems that the last technology created.” Whether these technologies live up to the hype remains to be seen . More concerning is whether AI will exacerbate the rampant feeling among providers that they have become tools of their tools and not masters of them. As EHR systems become more usable, interoperable, and patient-friendly, the underlying foundations of medical care can be finally addressed. High-quality evidence backs only about 10 percent of the care patients receive today. One of the great potentials of digitizing health records is to discover what treatments work best and why and then distribute that information to the health care community. While this is an active research area , more research and funding are needed. Twenty years ago, Tom Conrad, who himself was a senior computer scientist, told me he was skeptical that having more information necessarily meant that better medical decisions would automatically be made. He pointed out that when doctors’ earnings are related to the number of patients they see, there is a trade-off between the better care that EHR provides and the sheer amount of time required to review a more complete medical record. Today, the trade-off is not in the patients’ or doctors’ favor. Whether it can ever be balanced is one of the great unknowns. Obviously, no one wants to go back to paper records. However, as John Leslie King says, “The way forward involves multiple moving targets due to advances in technology, care, and administration. Most EHR vendors are moving as fast as they can.” However, it would be foolish to think it will be smooth sailing from here on, King says: “The EHR venture has proved troublesome thus far.
