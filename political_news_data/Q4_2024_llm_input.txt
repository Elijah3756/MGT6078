Title: In 2025 , Israel Will Profit From A Rising Startup Baby Boom

Innovation Enterprise & Cloud In 2025, Israel Will Profit From A Rising Startup Baby Boom By Gil Press , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Gil Press writes about technology, entrepreneurs and innovation. Follow Author Dec 30, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save Comment Israeli food pioneer — using high-tech cultivation methods, tropical greenhouses and a data-guided curing process — says it has cracked its secrets to create the most potent vanilla flavours on earth. (Photo by MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images In 2024, the startup ecosystem in Israel mostly followed global private and public investment trends, a significant achievement given the ongoing war on multiple fronts throughout the year. In 2025, the incredibly resilient Israeli entrepreneurial spirit will produce a startup baby boom—many new company creations, some related to technologies emerging from the war, including new ventures of “retired” successful entrepreneurs. “We're going to see a lot of new company creation after the war, assuming that we are indeed in a de-escalation mode,” says Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central , a non-profit providing access for investors and companies to Israel’s tech economy. “There are reasons to believe that 2025 is going to be a good year for the tech sector and tech investments,” Hasson adds. One reason for cautious optimism is the sector's performance over the last year. It mirrored the somewhat subdued investment environment in the U.S. and did slightly better than Europe’s. Moreover, regardless of the war, 2024 has been a record year for Israel in terms of mergers and acquisitions. “The leading companies in the world, such as Nvidia, showed their confidence in Israeli tech by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire Israeli startups,” says Hasson. Private companies (e.g., Boomi acquiring data integration startup Rivery) and private equity investors also demonstrated their confidence in Israeli startups. Hasson highlights the acquisition by Blackstone of a majority stake in Priority Software for $800 million. Priority derives 80% of its revenues from the Israeli market and Blackstone’s investment will help it expand to other markets worldwide. In addition, Israeli companies showed their confidence in Israeli tech by acquiring Israeli startups, a trend that has accelerated in 2024. “It shows that when these companies think about growing and diversifying and scaling, they see Israel as a key part of their growth strategy,” says Hasson. MORE FOR YOU In 2025, AI will continue to attract top investment dollars worldwide, benefiting Israel due to its strong position in this sector. From 2014 to 2023, top multinational corporations acquired one Israeli AI startup for every four American AI acquisitions, showcasing Israel’s strong global appeal. “A key metric that sets Israel apart is its focus on applied AI solutions in areas like cybersecurity, health tech, and agriculture, which positions it as a leader in practical AI applications,” wrote Arik Kol, Head of Nvidia Inception Startups Program at Nvidia Israel, in the recent Startup Nation Central report on Israeli AI . The defense tech sector is expected to grow rapidly next year, driven by global geopolitical tensions. In Israel, it is driven by necessity and a strong, battle-proven foundation. Earlier this year, Startup Nation Central launched Israel’s first Defense Tech landscape map featuring over 160 companies. Israeli innovators are pioneering technologies that address critical challenges in air defense, homeland security, aviation, dual-use applications, space technologies and more. Startup Nation Central is about to publish an updated version of the map which will include about 300 companies, Hasson reports. Another area in which necessity drives innovation in Israel and war-related experience leads to successful commercial applications is health tech. “In the battlefield and in the hospitals we've seen some amazing technologies being applied in terms of rehabilitation, trauma and mental health to mention a few,” says Hasson. For example, psychiatrists at Israel’s Sheba Medical Center have developed “Liv,” an LLM-based platform that offers an interactive interface, and a personalized patient experience with voice and written communications. The application has been launched commercially by an independent startup with the promise to improve the productivity of mental health professionals while addressing acute understaffing worldwide. “Venture capitalists have been playing defense for the past 24 months,” says Hasson. He sees this changing in the coming year. “Seed activity will go up a notch because you can't play defense for three years.” In Israel, “we're going to see high-quality entrepreneurs going back into the game with good ideas and good teams. And the money will follow.” Consider, for example, Elad Schulman . After selling his cybersecurity startup in 2019, he settled into the comfortable life of an angel investor. The new market opportunity presented by the arrival of GenAI, however, took him out of “retirement” and with three former colleagues he established Lasso, focused on cybersecurity for generative AI. The tech sector is “basically the business plan of the country and the reason the Israeli economy came into the war so strong,” says Hasson. “It's also the source of capital for Israel to fund the growing defense budget in the next decade” and to fund the recovery of the North and South of Israel after the war ends.

Trump appears to side with Musk, tech allies in debate over foreign workers roiling his supporters 10 months 1 week 5 days ago Sunday, December 29 2024 Dec 29, 2024 December 29, 2024 7:38 PM December 29, 2024 in News Source: Associated Press By: Associated Press Share: News 4 (WOAI) San Antonio WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” Trump told the newspaper. He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20.

But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump’s movement have accused Musk and others in Trump’s new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump’s “America First” vision. Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated. Report a Typo

What Happened : 2024 wasn’t a year of financial prosperity for all, with some billionaires in the luxury retail sector experiencing substantial losses. A recent report revealed that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced growth of 25% and 33% respectively in 2024. This growth significantly benefited the ultra-wealthy, especially those with investments in tech companies. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , the collective net worth of the five wealthiest individuals in the tech sector surged by $542 billion. The rise in AI technology and a post-election rally pushed many tech stocks to record highs. One of the major winners was Elon Musk , whose net worth almost doubled to $468 billion, primarily due to the stock market rally following Donald Trump’s election victory. Musk’s wealth mainly comes from his stakes in Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms Inc saw an $85 billion increase in his net worth, thanks to a strong ad business and AI advancements, pushing the company's stock up over 70%. Similarly, Jensen Huang of Nvidia Corp. became a centibillionaire, gaining $78 billion as the company maintained its dominance in AI chips. Other winners included Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., whose wealth grew by $70 billion, and Jeff Bezos , Amazon's founder, who saw a $69 billion increase as Amazon's stock rose 45% following Trump's election win.

Those with investments in luxury retail saw their fortunes decline significantly due to the struggles faced by the sector in 2024. Billionaires tied to luxury goods and retail experienced significant losses. Bernard Arnault of LVMH lost $31 billion amid struggles in China's economy, while Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of L'Oréal and Francois Pinault of Kering faced losses of $25 billion and $14 billion, respectively, due to a global luxury slowdown. Carlos Slim and Colin Huang also faced sharp declines, with losses tied to telecommunications and fast fashion industries. Why It Matters : The tech sector’s performance in 2024 underscores the growing influence and wealth of tech billionaires. The significant growth in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, coupled with advancements in AI technology, created a favorable environment for tech stocks. This, in turn, led to a substantial increase in the net worth of tech billionaires. However, the luxury retail sector’s struggles highlight the economic disparities among billionaires. While tech billionaires saw their wealth increase, those invested in luxury retail faced significant losses. This divergence in fortunes underscores the varying impacts of market trends on different sectors and the billionaires invested in them.

Nation World Trump appears to side with Musk, tech allies in debate over foreign workers roiling his supporters Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. Credit: Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File FILE - Donald Trump and Elon Musk in Boca Chica, Texas, Nov. 19, 2024 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them," Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program," Trump told the newspaper. He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20. Trump's hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters. But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump's movement have accused Musk and others in Trump's new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump's “America First" vision. Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated. Copyright 2025 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

FILE – President-elect Donald Trump listens to Elon Musk as he arrives to watch SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Nov. 19, 2024. (Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File) By Michelle L Price | Associated Press PUBLISHED: December 28, 2024 at 3:34 PM EST | UPDATED: December 28, 2024 at 6:26 PM EST WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” Trump told the newspaper. He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20. Trump’s hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters. But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump’s movement have accused Musk and others in Trump’s new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump’s “America First” vision. Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated.

H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google Elon Musk. Image Credit: Reuters Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Friday vowed to go to ”war” to defend the H-1B visa program for foreign tech workers amid a dispute between President-elect Donald Trump’s longtime supporters and his most recently acquired backers from the tech industry. In a post on social media platform X, Musk said ”The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.” STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD ”I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” he added. The tech industry has consistently advocated for an increase in H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the United States. However, during Donald Trump’s first administration, the program faced restrictions in 2020, with claims that it allowed businesses to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign labor.

In a post, Loomer expressed concerns about Krishnan’s influence on immigration policies, referring to him as a “third-world invader” despite his status as a naturalised U.S. citizen. “It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda,” Ms. Loomer wrote on X, the social media platform owned by Mr. Musk.

H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Musk’s tweet was directed at Trump’s supporters and immigration hardliners, who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump has so far remained silent on the issue. The Trump transition did not respond to a request for comment on Musk’s tweets and the H-1B visa debate. In the past, Trump has expressed a willingness to provide more work visas to skilled workers. He has also promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens and severely restrict immigration. The issue highlights how tech leaders like Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base. The U.S. tech industry relies on the government’s H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens. The altercation was set off earlier this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration’s immigration policies. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued ”big tech oligarchs” for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization. In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration. Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies. With inputs from agencies.

The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hard-line immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration.

Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Advertisement Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mt. Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man, who has grown close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but also for his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas, used by software engineers and other skilled workers in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.

His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally, but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas. Advertisement As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

I’d be surprised if it’s true because at any given point there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs in tech.” Responding to Masad, Musk dismissed the notion of job displacement by foreign talent, highlighting the chronic scarcity of skilled engineers in Silicon Valley. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent.

Advertisement The conversation gains significance amidst controversy over the appointment of Indian-American businessman Sriram Krishnan as a senior policy advisor on artificial intelligence in the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. While some hail Krishnan’s appointment as a step forward for AI policy, others argue that foreign workers, particularly those on H-1B visas, are being hired at lower wages, allegedly displacing American talent. Musk rejected this perspective, labelling it as a “fixed pie” fallacy. “There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!” he said, urging a focus on innovation and growth rather than competition for existing roles.

Meetings at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate with tech leaders emphasize discussions on policies, manufacturing, and job creation. Musk faces backlash over his support for the H-1B visa program, highlighting the tension between tech industry priorities and Trump’s “America First” agenda. In a surprising development, President-elect Donald Trump shared on social media that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had requested a meeting with him. The post, which appeared to be directed at Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , highlights the increasing number of influential figures engaging with Trump as he prepared to take office. This revelation sheds light on the dynamics of high-profile meetings taking place at Mar-a-Lago , Trump’s Florida estate, which has become a hub for discussions with tech industry leaders. These interactions come amid significant developments in policy, criticism of key figures, and speculation about the influence of such meetings on the incoming administration. Bill Gates requests meeting with Donald Trump addressing Elon Musk In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump disclosed that Bill Gates had expressed interest in meeting him. Addressing Elon Musk in the post, Trump wrote, “Where are you? When are you coming to the ‘Center of the Universe,’ Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates asked to come, tonight. We miss you and X! New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!! DJT.” The post also made an apparent reference to Musk’s son, X Æ A-Xii, often affectionately called "X." Sources close to the situation revealed that Gates had reached out regarding a possible meet-up with Trump. However, no official confirmation about the meeting has been provided. This marks yet another instance of tech industry leaders seeking face time with Trump as he readies his administration for a January inauguration. Elon Musk and the visa program controversy The timing of Trump’s post coincides with mounting criticism directed at Elon Musk, who was recently named co-leader of Trump’s government efficiency program. Musk faced backlash for his support of the H-1B visa program, which facilitates the entry of highly skilled foreign workers into the U.S. While the program has been championed by many in the tech industry, it has also drawn criticism for potentially displacing domestic workers, a concern that aligns with Trump’s “America First” rhetoric. Despite the controversy, Musk has maintained his role in fostering discussions between the tech sector and the incoming administration. His involvement highlights the delicate balancing act faced by tech leaders navigating policy priorities and public sentiment under the new administration. Mar-a-Lago: A nexus for tech and policy discussions Mar-a-Lago has emerged as a focal point for meetings between Trump and prominent figures from the tech industry. In the weeks following his election victory, Trump has hosted several tech CEOs at his Florida estate, many of whom represent Fortune 500 companies. These leaders have reportedly donated significant sums to Trump’s inauguration fund, further emphasizing the high stakes involved in fostering relationships with the incoming administration. Sources familiar with these gatherings told CNN that the meetings often follow a strategic agenda. Many CEOs have tailored their discussions to align with Trump’s priorities, such as revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Amid these discussions, they have also used the opportunity to voice concerns about potential challenges posed by the administration’s policies. These efforts are widely viewed as an attempt to establish favorable relations with Trump before his presidency officially begins. The Gates-Musk-Trump triangle The post by Trump not only revealed Gates’ intention to meet but also underscored Musk’s proximity to the President-elect’s circle. Gates and Musk represent two of the most influential figures in the tech industry, and their interactions with Trump have drawn significant attention. While Gates’ agenda for a potential meeting remains unclear, his involvement adds another layer to the narrative of tech leaders actively engaging with the incoming administration. Similarly, Musk’s dual role as an entrepreneur and an adviser to the administration places him in a unique position. His actions and statements have been closely scrutinized as he navigates the complexities of supporting Trump’s initiatives while addressing the concerns of the broader tech community. Implications of high-profile meetings The ongoing meetings between Trump and tech leaders have sparked widespread speculation about their implications. For Trump, these engagements allow him to project an image of inclusivity and collaboration with industry leaders. For the tech executives, the meetings serve as an opportunity to influence policy decisions and establish rapport with the administration. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the transparency and motives behind these interactions. Questions about whether these meetings prioritize public interest or corporate gain remain unanswered. Furthermore, the involvement of major corporations in funding Trump’s inauguration has prompted scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the influence of money in shaping policy.

El presidente electo Donald Trump escucha a Elon Musk previo al despegue del megacohete Starship de la empresa SpaceX, propiedad de Musk, para un vuelo de prueba desde Starbase en Boca Chica, Texas, el 19 de noviembre de 2024. (Brandon Bell/Pool vía AP, Archivo) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: December 27, 2024 at 11:25 AM PST | UPDATED: December 27, 2024 at 4:37 PM PST By MICHELLE L. PRICE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Vivek Ramaswamy arrives at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024, to meet with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., and billionaire Elon Musk as they convene a meeting of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as envisioned by President-elect Donald Trump.

Scott Applewhite) Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

Immigration An online debate over foreign workers in tech shows tensions in Trump's political coalition By Michelle L.

An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.

Aimee Picchi December 30, 2024 at 11:39 AM 134 Copied Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers. Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations. The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers. That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture "has venerated mediocrity over excellence," leading to a nation that does "not produce the best engineers." "There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley," Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app. Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa. How did the most recent H-1B debate begin? The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be "not America First policy" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar." Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for. Who qualifies for an H-1B visa? U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge," and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field. Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working. How many workers receive H-1B visas? The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that. However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program. What countries do H-1B recipients come from? More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report. What's the debate about H-1B visas? Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Some investigations, including a 2017 report from CBS' "60 Minutes," have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers. What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas? Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has "always been in favor of the visas." "I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program," he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment. Still, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program "very bad" and "unfair" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.

After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. In 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.

By Associated Press PUBLISHED: December 27, 2024 at 12:25 PM MST | UPDATED: December 27, 2024 at 5:37 PM MST By MICHELLE L. PRICE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

(AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

By Bloomberg PUBLISHED: December 31, 2024 at 10:35 AM EST | UPDATED: December 31, 2024 at 10:51 AM EST “I will never lie to you.” So went the plain-spoken refrain of Jimmy Carter, the man from Plains, whose improbable century-long journey came to an end on Sunday. Carter became the 39th president in no small part because voters felt that simple offer of honesty was sufficient after the turmoil of the Richard Nixon era. Unfortunately for Carter and the country, it was never quite enough. Carter’s life spanned 10 decades of dizzying change. He was the first president born in a hospital and will surely be the last to remember life before electricity. His childhood farm in Georgia had been decimated by the Depression, then revived by the New Deal. He graduated from the Naval Academy the year before the Cold War began, and he took office shortly before the final Soviet invasion. His presidency bridged the end of FDR’s majority with the beginning of the Reagan Revolution. It also prefigured some of the defining challenges — energy dependence, climate change, partisan polarization — of the decades to come. Historians have generally ranked Carter in the middle-lower tier of U.S. presidents, amid the Garfields and Hayeses and Van Burens. They’ve at times overstated the case against him. Even so, at the center of Carter’s long life and short presidency lurked an enigma: How did this formidable man — widely considered tough, judicious, intelligent — end up by most accounts a disappointment in office? He wasn’t much of a politician, for one thing. Walter Mondale, his vice president, once said that Carter “thought politics was sinful.” The talent for trading favors, stroking egos, balancing coalitions — it eluded him entirely. Carter compounded this weakness by surrounding himself with loyalists and outsiders, fatally unwise to the ways of Washington. One result was that much of his ambitious agenda was thwarted. Although Democrats held huge majorities throughout his term, Carter struggled mightily to advance his goals. On taking office, he named Frank Moore, an obscure 41-year-old campaign hand, as his liaison to Congress; Moore soon became known as the “most maligned man” in Washington. Carter’s habit of dumping fully formed proposals on Congress routinely backfired. His tax reform of 1978, a major priority, was dead on arrival even among notional allies. (“He didn’t consult me when he was writing this bill,” recalled Democratic Sen. Russell Long, “so why should I consult him when I’m gutting it?”) There were successes, too. Carter secured peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David, a historic feat that helped end decades of violence. He agreed to an arms-limitation deal with Russia and came to support increased defense spending at a key moment in the Cold War. He normalized diplomatic relations with China, making the world safer and richer for decades. His efforts to deregulate industry — including the airlines, freight railroads and interstate trucking — helped lay the groundwork for the miraculous consumer economy of the 21st century. Yet it was Carter’s inability to effectively wield the powers of the presidency that would be his undoing. His failure to free 52 American hostages in Iran for more than a year became a microcosm of U.S. impotence. His response to the 1979 energy crisis — going on prime time, warning of the perils of “self-indulgence and consumption” — proved irresistible to his foes. In announcing his intention to challenge Carter for the 1980 Democratic nomination, Sen. Ted Kennedy said: “Now, the people are blamed for every national ill, scolded as greedy, wasteful, and mired in malaise.” (Thus did Carter’s address become the “malaise speech,” although he never uttered the word.) A year on, Ronald Reagan was asking voters two simple questions: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” and “Is America as respected throughout the world?” He would defeat the incumbent in a landslide. It is generally held that Carter was a better former president than president. Opinions may vary on his overseas activism or his tendency to criticize his successors. Undeniably, he was an energetic force for democracy and public service. More to the point: Who could deny the evocative power of an aging former president, stooped but vibrant, building homes for the poor, teaching Sunday school, simply getting on with the business of life after so many often-brutal setbacks? That, too, was Carter. That was no lie. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X RevContent Feed

Money Personal Finance U.S. Credit Card Defaults Hit Post-Great Recession High By Erik Sherman , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Erik Sherman reports on business, economics, finance, tech, and law. Follow Author Dec 31, 2024, 12:54pm EST Share Save Comment Depressed Asian young girl feel worry about financial problem in house. Stressed desperate young woman looking frustrated to paperwork and bills think of money debt, budget loss, bankruptcy at home. getty Economists and business leaders have regularly pointed to consumer spending as a good sign for the economy. Understandably why, because about 69% of gross domestic product — GDP, the typical economic measure — is consumer spending. A red flag of credit card defaults has gone up that should make everyone take much greater care. Why consumer spending is critical Without that seemingly indefatigable consumer spending engine, things would freeze up. Even worse, there would be chain reactions. Companies that did direct business with people would see their revenues drop. They would conserve resources by laying off employees and spending less with their vendors. Those vendors — business-to-business companies — would then protect themselves by similar actions. More people would become unemployed, face economic pressure, and reduce their own spending as much as possible, causing yet another round of spending reductions. In the parlance of control theory, you get a whopping positive feedback loop, which isn’t positive in the emotional or strategic sense. Actions keep moving things in a given direction until they might oscillate out of control, like driving a car that skids under icy or wet road conditions and then steering the wrong way and spinning. Credit takes place of income People have continued to spend, and for the wealthier that may be fine because they have the necessary resources to do so. A majority of U.S. households, however, have found themselves left behind over the last 40 years. Median wage growth has not kept pace with inflation , those at the economic 25 th percentile have lost value every year, and the people at the 75 th percentile and above have seen real earnings grow by around 10% a year. MORE FOR YOU What happens when people’s incomes don’t keep up with growing costs, especially during high inflation jumps that permanently increase the cost of living, is that they look to make up the difference in other ways, like credit cards and other forms of highly expensive revolving credit. The following graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis is of consumer loan data from the Fed’s Board of Governors. Growth of credit card and revolving consumer debt. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The more such credit use grows, the top-heavier the economy. A current major red flag indicates that things are more precariously balanced than is generally admitted. Credit card defaults skyrocket The Financial Times recently ran an article on how U.S. credit card loan defaults are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Using information from BankRegData, which regularly follows and collates data from regulatory agencies, the FT reported that credit card lenders wrote off $46 billion in seriously delinquent loan balances from January through September 2024. That was up 50% from the same period in 2023 and the largest amount in 14 years. As an example, Capital One said that as of November, the percentage of its overall loans marked as unrecoverable reached 6.1%, up from last year’s 5.2%. Overall, might mean a larger selection of loan types, not just credit cards. “High-income households are fine, but the bottom third of US consumers are tapped out,” Mark Zandi, head of Moody’s Analytics, told the paper. “Their savings rate right now is zero.” According to the FT , as of the end of September 2024, those who can’t pay off their credit card balances in full paid $170 billion in interest over the previous 12 months. The hope that the Fed would keep slashing rates, eventually resulting in lower credit card terms, disappeared just over a week ago when they projected that inflation would rise in 2025 and that there would be far fewer rate cuts next year. Maybe people can keep their credit use in safe hands, but with credit card defaults on the rise, concern about the economy is the least people can offer.

10 stocks retail investors craved in 2024 Brian Sozzi · Executive Editor December 31, 2024 4 min read PLTR AMD IBM CRM RIVN Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. While that is $25 billion less than the previous three years' average, based on Vanda Research's data, it's still within the post-COVID-19 range — indicating a healthy appetite for the average investor to be engaged with markets. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD ( AMD ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Palantir ( PLTR ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Amazon ( AMZN ). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Nvidia has pulled in $29.8 billion in retail net inflows this year, per Vanda Research's findings, up from $11.4 billion last year. Tesla's retail inflows dropped to $14.7 billion from $48 billion in 2023. Tesla still edged out Nvidia as the top holding in retail investor portfolios, however — representing a 10.58% average portfolio weighting compared to 10.33% for Nvidia. The other four top tickers were more index-based trades levered to popular themes such as AI: Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares ( SOXL ), Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ ( TQQQ ), and SPDR S&P 500 ( SPY ). "2024 was an eventful year for markets," Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said. "For the average retail investor, it was another great year of portfolio performance. Loyalty to tech names paid off." Retail investors' portfolios beat S&P, Nasdaq Indeed that tech loyalty did pay off. Vanda Research estimates that the average retail portfolio is up 40.74% this year, the second-highest performance since 2014. Only 2023's 41.94% performance was better over this 10-year time span. On a flow-adjusted basis, Vanda Research noted that this would mark the second time retail investors have beaten the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) in back-to-back calendar years and the first time since 2014 that the non-institutional crowd beat the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ). Whether the feel-good times for retail investors will continue in 2025 is anyone's guess. On the positive side, the incoming Trump administration has promised business-friendly policies such as cutting government spending through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and extending tax cuts. Story Continues “I’m not saying it’s going to be perfect, but I’m saying the possibilities of us doing very well over the span of the next few years is significant,” Joe Moglia , former CEO of TD Ameritrade, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below). But the markets are poised to enter January on a whimper despite potential pro-growth Trump policies as the outlook for Fed policy has become increasingly uncertain . The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year after its December meeting, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China . In a new interview on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid , San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly didn't rule out a potential rate hike. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2% and 5%, respectively, in December. The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.4%. Market leader Nvidia is down 1% in December. "The stock market in 2025 will likely experience fluctuations, but significant opportunities are seen in individual stock picks, especially in sectors like EVs, AI, healthcare, and quantum computing," MarketGauge chief strategist Michele Schneider told Yahoo Finance. "Tax cuts and deregulation could spur growth, although tariffs and inflation remain risks. The year may start under pressure but rally towards the middle to end of the year posting modest gains, with a potential stagflation environment prevailing until mid-2026." None of Schneider's top stock picks for 2025 would qualify as typical retail investor favorites: AbbVie ( ABBV ), Kratos ( KTOS ), International Business Machines ( IBM ), Salesforce ( CRM ), Coinbase ( COIN ), Chewy ( CHWY ), Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ), Alibaba ( BABA ), and Rivian ( RIVN ). But hey, maybe they will garner some retail investor attention. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market. Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

His efforts to deregulate industry — including the airlines, freight railroads and interstate trucking — helped lay the groundwork for the miraculous consumer economy of the 21st century. Yet it was Carter’s inability to effectively wield the powers of the presidency that would be his undoing. His failure to free 52 American hostages in Iran for more than a year became a microcosm of U.S. impotence. His response to the 1979 energy crisis — going on prime time, warning of the perils of “self-indulgence and consumption” — proved irresistible to his foes. In announcing his intention to challenge Carter for the 1980 Democratic nomination, Sen. Ted Kennedy said: “Now, the people are blamed for every national ill, scolded as greedy, wasteful, and mired in malaise.” (Thus did Carter’s address become the “malaise speech,” although he never uttered the word.) A year on, Ronald Reagan was asking voters two simple questions: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” and “Is America as respected throughout the world?” He would defeat the incumbent in a landslide. It is generally held that Carter was a better former president than president. Opinions may vary on his overseas activism or his tendency to criticize his successors. Undeniably, he was an energetic force for democracy and public service. More to the point: Who could deny the evocative power of an aging former president, stooped but vibrant, building homes for the poor, teaching Sunday school, simply getting on with the business of life after so many often-brutal setbacks? That, too, was Carter. That was no lie. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X RevContent Feed

Article Content:
By Views From the Nation’s Press PUBLISHED: December 31, 2024 at 5:00 AM MST “I will never lie to you.” So went the plain-spoken refrain of Jimmy Carter, the man from Plains, whose improbable century-long journey came to an end on Sunday. Carter became the 39th president in no small part because voters felt that simple offer of honesty was sufficient after the turmoil of the Richard Nixon era. Unfortunately for Carter and the country, it was never quite enough. Carter’s life spanned 10 decades of dizzying change. He was the first president born in a hospital and will surely be the last to remember life before electricity. His childhood farm in Georgia had been decimated by the Depression, then revived by the New Deal. He graduated from the Naval Academy the year before the Cold War began, and he took office shortly before the final Soviet invasion. His presidency bridged the end of FDR’s majority with the beginning of the Reagan Revolution. It also prefigured some of the defining challenges — energy dependence, climate change, partisan polarization — of the decades to come. Historians have generally ranked Carter in the middle-lower tier of U.S. presidents, amid the Garfields and Hayeses and Van Burens. They’ve at times overstated the case against him. Even so, at the center of Carter’s long life and short presidency lurked an enigma: How did this formidable man — widely considered tough, judicious, intelligent — end up by most accounts a disappointment in office? He wasn’t much of a politician, for one thing. Walter Mondale, his vice president, once said that Carter “thought politics was sinful.” The talent for trading favors, stroking egos, balancing coalitions — it eluded him entirely. Carter compounded this weakness by surrounding himself with loyalists and outsiders, fatally unwise to the ways of Washington. One result was that much of his ambitious agenda was thwarted. Although Democrats held huge majorities throughout his term, Carter struggled mightily to advance his goals. On taking office, he named Frank Moore, an obscure 41-year-old campaign hand, as his liaison to Congress; Moore soon became known as the “most maligned man” in Washington. Carter’s habit of dumping fully formed proposals on Congress routinely backfired. His tax reform of 1978, a major priority, was dead on arrival even among notional allies. (“He didn’t consult me when he was writing this bill,” recalled Democratic Sen. Russell Long, “so why should I consult him when I’m gutting it?”) There were successes, too. Carter secured peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David, a historic feat that helped end decades of violence. He agreed to an arms-limitation deal with Russia and came to support increased defense spending at a key moment in the Cold War. He normalized diplomatic relations with China, making the world safer and richer for decades. His efforts to deregulate industry — including the airlines, freight railroads and interstate trucking — helped lay the groundwork for the miraculous consumer economy of the 21st century. Yet it was Carter’s inability to effectively wield the powers of the presidency that would be his undoing. His failure to free 52 American hostages in Iran for more than a year became a microcosm of U.S. impotence. His response to the 1979 energy crisis — going on prime time, warning of the perils of “self-indulgence and consumption” — proved irresistible to his foes. In announcing his intention to challenge Carter for the 1980 Democratic nomination, Sen. Ted Kennedy said: “Now, the people are blamed for every national ill, scolded as greedy, wasteful, and mired in malaise.” (Thus did Carter’s address become the “malaise speech,” although he never uttered the word.)

Summary Monday Tee Up: Hello 2025! This will be another holiday-shortened week, as markets are closed on Wednesday for New Year's Day. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, the S&P 500 rose 0.7%, and Nasdaq was up 0.8%. Santa Claus has been nice to equity investors in 2024, but not so much in the final days of December. With just two trading days left in the year, the Dow is higher by 14%, the S&P is up 25%, and the Nasdaq has popped 31%. The new earnings season will kick off in mid-January with the big banks reporting first. For 2025, Argus forecasts 12% EPS growth for S&P 500 companies. This follows higher-than-expected 9% growth in 2024. On the economic calendar, there are only a few releases this week. On Tuesday, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index will be reported; on Thursday, Construction Spending; and on Friday, ISM Manufacturing. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja's Call of the Week is the ISM Manufacturing report, and he has offered the following thoughts. 'We are looking for Friday's report on Manufacturing New Orders to remain just above 50, signaling expansion. This is an important leading indicator and even modestly good news would be a welcomed sign for manufacturing -- which hasn't been pulling its weight in a strong consumer-driven economy.' Mortgage rates went up 13 basis points (bps) last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.85%, according to FreddieMac. The average price for regular gas held at $3.02 per gallon.

HOME NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET SPORTS GET AHEAD REDIFF-TV Follow Rediff on: Home » Business » AI & automation to play a crucial role for retail industry in 2025 AI & automation to play a crucial role for retail industry in 2025 By Kumar Rahul 4 Minutes Read Listen to Article Share: December 30, 2024 12:12 IST x With the rapid evolution of channels like quick-commerce and the emergence of ONDC, the Indian retail industry is 'cautiously optimistic' for 2025, in which new-age technologies such as AI and automation will play a crucial role, driving efficiency and personalisation. Photograph: Shailesh Andrade/Reuters The New Year could be a period of transformation for the Indian retail industry, one of the fastest-growing globally, where the contemporary retail landscape is rapidly evolving, influenced by the preferences of digital-first generation Gen Z and retail tech. Helped by tailwinds such as rising disposable income, rapid urbanisation, the rise of non-metro tier II cities, and growing middle class along with a digitally-savvy consumer base, the organised retail sector is poised to grow expanding its play further with a customer-centric approach. "FY25 is likely to see continued focus on building supply chain efficiencies, along with upgrades to logistics hubs and tracking systems to meet fast delivery demands. "Employment generation in quick commerce, logistics, and related sectors is also expected to continue," said EY India Tax Leader for Retail Practice Paresh Parekh. Indian consumers, influenced by global exposure and digital technologies, are prioritising higher quality and value for money. This has resulted in a shift in spending from luxuries to essentials or more affordable options. "Despite these challenges, the outlook for 2025 remains positive, driven by demographic trends, urbanisation, digital growth, and the aspirations of a young, dynamic middle class," he said. Parekh expects an increase in foreign investments in the retail sector and a continuance of consolidation led by PE firms and strategic acquisitions. According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), the Indian retail sector in 2024 has witnessed a mix of challenges and opportunities. "Growth was subdued in the first half, with marginal consumption increases and cautious consumer spending. "Many retailers struggled to achieve like-for-like growth, reflecting shifting consumer priorities," said its CEO Kumar Rajagopalan adding "Despite this, the year also brought innovation and resilience." Retailers have embraced technology to enhance operations and customer experience and initiatives like ONDC are creating exciting new opportunities, particularly in reaching untapped markets. "Looking ahead, the sector remains cautiously optimistic. The festive and wedding seasons have boosted momentum, and with strategic planning, retailers can sustain growth into 2025," he said. The Indian retail sector contributes around 10 per cent to its GDP and according to the latest annual report of leading retailer, Reliance it is expected to cross $1.4 trillion by 2027. It is also poised to become the third-largest market by 2030. Over the emergence of quick commerce, Deloitte India partner, consumer products and retail sector Anand Ramanathan said it is a "viable business model" and it is here to stay. 2024 has been disruptive for the retail sector, which besides the emergence of quick commerce, also saw the revival of mass consumption and the value retail segment for the first time since the pandemic. "100 million middle-income households will be added this decade to the economy. 2025 will continue to see the impact of this growth in middle-income households with further momentum in mass consumption. "This will have a positive impact across sectors including fashion, home and food services," said Ramanathan. Puneet Mansukhani, sector head - Retail KPMG said in 2024 retailers faced significant challenges due to inflation impacting profitability and supply chain disruptions. "These issues required strategic pricing adjustments and innovative solutions to maintain smooth operations. "The festive season did see some uptake as compared to the previous year but overall the customer was cautious. "The ecommerce spend in the tier 2 and 3 cities was stronger than urban and the trend is likely to continue which makes the retailers feel bullish and optimistic in 2025," he said. Over the outlook for 2025 for the retail industry, he said continued advancements in AI and automation are "expected to drive efficiency and personalisation" in retail, enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Moreover "increased use of data analytics will enable more personalised shopping experiences, catering to individual consumer preferences," he said. Retailers will likely focus more on sustainability and transparency in their supply chains, responding to consumer demand for ethical practices. However, Mansukhani also hinted towards economic uncertainty and said "Inflation and economic volatility may continue to pose challenges, affecting consumer spending patterns."

ANI Representative image. With the rapid evolution of channels like quick-commerce and the emergence of ONDC, the Indian retail industry is 'cautiously optimistic' for 2025, in which new-age technologies such as AI and automation will play a crucial role, driving efficiency and personalisation. The New Year could be a period of transformation for the Indian retail industry, one of the fastest-growing globally, where the contemporary retail landscape is rapidly evolving, influenced by the preferences of digital-first generation Gen Z and retail tech. Helped by tailwinds such as rising disposable income, rapid urbanisation, the rise of non-metro tier II cities, and growing middle class along with a digitally-savvy consumer base, the organised retail sector is poised to grow expanding its play further with a customer-centric approach. "FY25 is likely to see continued focus on building supply chain efficiencies, along with upgrades to logistics hubs and tracking systems to meet fast delivery demands. Employment generation in quick commerce, logistics, and related sectors is also expected to continue," said EY India Tax Leader for Retail Practice Paresh Parekh. Indian consumers, influenced by global exposure and digital technologies, are prioritising higher quality and value for money. This has resulted in a shift in spending from luxuries to essentials or more affordable options. "Despite these challenges, the outlook for 2025 remains positive, driven by demographic trends, urbanisation, digital growth, and the aspirations of a young, dynamic middle class," he said. Live Events Parekh expects an increase in foreign investments in the retail sector and a continuance of consolidation led by PE firms and strategic acquisitions. According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), the Indian retail sector in 2024 has witnessed a mix of challenges and opportunities. "Growth was subdued in the first half, with marginal consumption increases and cautious consumer spending. Many retailers struggled to achieve like-for-like growth, reflecting shifting consumer priorities," said its CEO Kumar Rajagopalan adding "Despite this, the year also brought innovation and resilience." Retailers have embraced technology to enhance operations and customer experience and initiatives like ONDC are creating exciting new opportunities, particularly in reaching untapped markets. "Looking ahead, the sector remains cautiously optimistic. The festive and wedding seasons have boosted momentum, and with strategic planning, retailers can sustain growth into 2025," he said. The Indian retail sector contributes around 10 per cent to its GDP and according to the latest annual report of leading retailer, Reliance it is expected to cross USD 1.4 trillion by 2027. It is also poised to become the third-largest market by 2030. Over the emergence of quick commerce, Deloitte India partner, consumer products and retail sector Anand Ramanathan said it is a "viable business model" and it is here to stay. 2024 has been disruptive for the retail sector, which besides the emergence of quick commerce, also saw the revival of mass consumption and the value retail segment for the first time since the pandemic. "100 million middle-income households will be added this decade to the economy. 2025 will continue to see the impact of this growth in middle-income households with further momentum in mass consumption. This will have a positive impact across sectors including fashion, home and food services," said Ramanathan. Puneet Mansukhani Sector Head - Retail KPMG said in 2024 retailers faced significant challenges due to inflation impacting profitability and supply chain disruptions. "These issues required strategic pricing adjustments and innovative solutions to maintain smooth operations. The festive season did see some uptake as compared to the previous year but overall the customer was cautious. "The ecommerce spend in the tier 2 and 3 cities was stronger than urban and the trend is likely to continue which makes the retailers feel bullish and optimistic in 2025," he said. Over the outlook for 2025 for the retail industry, he said continued advancements in AI and automation are "expected to drive efficiency and personalisation" in retail, enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Moreover "increased use of data analytics will enable more personalised shopping experiences, catering to individual consumer preferences," he said. Retailers will likely focus more on sustainability and transparency in their supply chains, responding to consumer demand for ethical practices.

Money Investing 4 Retail Sector Stocks Keep Making New Highs (But Not The ETF) By John Navin , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. John Navin is a Colorado-based journalist who writes about stocks. Follow Author Dec 29, 2024, 11:15am EST Share Save Comment Retail stocks getty The exchange traded fund that reflects the price movements of a host of retail stocks hit a new high in November but failed to make it quite that high in December. Certain individual retail equities, on the other hand, found a way to keep going and then established the higher highs. No one disputes the value of diversity when it comes to buying stocks but the investor who can discern which might be better than others could come out ahead. With that in mind, here is the retail ETF chart — and the charts of four individual names that have outperformed it lately. 4 Retail Stocks Outperforming The Retail ETF SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE: XRT) First, the underperforming fund: SPDR S&P Retail ETF daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The retail fund with 80 holdings took off in November, couldn’t make the new high in December and dropped to the 50-day moving average before bouncing. How the holiday revenue numbers come in will be interesting but it looks as if expectations for the sector in general might be coming down a bit. MORE FOR YOU Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE: BBW) Build-A-Bear Workshop daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com This is what is meant by “outperforming.” The stock went ahead and made it up to a new high this month, no problem. There has been no significant dip down toward the 50-day moving average. You can see how different this is than the pattern for the SPDR Retail ETF. The specialty retail company is relatively lightly traded with an average daily volume of 266,000 shares. Build-A-Bear Workshop has a market capitalization of $610 million. It’s a Russell 2000 component. Some people don’t like it: the short float is 10.03%, on the high side. Dillards (NYSE: DDS) Dillards daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in mid-December, thought to be a bullish kind of signal. The breakout above the July high came this month and buyers really came in at that point. The department store chain has a market cap of $7.26 billion. This is another one that’s lightly traded: average daily volume is 144,000 shares. With a short float of 14%, it’s likely that a good portion of this move came from shorts rushing to get covered. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) Tapestry daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The late December high is higher than the late November high as designated on this chart by the red dotted line. The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in early October, a sign of bullishness to come. From the August low to the recent high is almost a double. Tapestry is a luxury goods outfit whose brands include Coach, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. Market cap is $15.28 billion. The company pays a dividend of 2.14%. Urban Outfitters (NYSE: URBN) Urban Outfitters daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The late November gap up took the price above the previous price resistance from July of $49. Unlike the movement of the retail ETF, this one just kept making new highs in December. The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average mid-month. The short float is 10.43% — this is another of the retail stocks that may be benefitting from shorts being forced to cover their positions. Urban Outfitters is a retail apparel business with a market cap of $5.16 billion. The stock is a component of the Russell 2000. Brands include Anthropologie, Menus and Venues and Urban Outfitters.

Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian This article is more than 10 months old Nearly 170,000 UK shop workers lost their jobs in 2024 This article is more than 10 months old Collapse of chains such as Homebase and Body Shop contributed to big rise, and another tough year is on the cards Almost 170,000 retail workers lost their jobs during another challenging year for the UK high street, data suggests. The collapse of big chains such as Homebase and The Body Shop put thousands of jobs at risk and contributed to 169,395 retail jobs disappearing during 2024 – a 42% rise on 2023 levels. End-of-year figures compiled by the Centre for Retail Research registered the highest annual reading since more than 200,000 jobs were lost in 2020 in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced retailers to shut their stores during lockdowns. The centre said 38 big retailers went into administration in 2024, with further household names including Lloyds Pharmacy , Carpetright and Ted Baker . Administration accounted for about a third of all 2024 retail job losses – 55,914 in total – with the remainder axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small independent stores shuttering unprofitable stores. Homebase collapses into administration with thousands of jobs at risk Read more Retailing jobs form a sizeable portion of the country’s overall job market, with 2.87m roles representing about 8.5% of all UK jobs , according to the most recent figures from the British Retail Consortium. The trade body calculates that retail vacancies are about 30% lower than they were in the period immediately preceding the pandemic. Overall employment appears to have remained relatively steady, with a historical UK average of 2.77m retail jobs between 1978 and 2023, although the population has risen by 13m since the 1970s. Prof Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: “The comparatively low [job loss] figures for 2023 now look like an anomaly, a pause for breath by many retailers after lockdowns if you like. “The problems of changed customer shopping habits, inflation, rising energy costs, rents and business rates have continued and forced many retailers to cut back even more strongly in 2024.” Experts have said small high street shops could face a particularly challenging 2025 because of tax rises announced in this autumn’s budget as well as wage changes. Companies will see an increase in national insurance contributions as well as a reduction in discounts for business rates next year. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The British Retail Consortium has also predicted that an increase in employer national insurance contributions and a reduction in the threshold at which companies start paying will create a £2.3bn bill for the sector. Bamfield warned of another bleak year in 2025, predicting that as many as 202,000 jobs could be lost. “By increasing both the costs of running stores and the costs on each consumer’s household it is highly likely that we will see retail job losses eclipse the height of the pandemic in 2020.” Explore more on these topics Retail industry Job losses news Share Reuse this content

India household spending on non-food items rises as urban-rural gap narrows Published on 12/27/2024 at 10:59 am EST Reuters Share NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian household spending on non-food items such as transport, garments and entertainment rose in both rural and urban areas in 2023/24 while outlays on staples like wheat and rice dropped, a government report showed on Friday. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey for 2023/24, conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, showed non-food items accounted for about 53% of per capita spending in rural areas, up from about 47% in 2011/12, and 60% in urban areas, up from about 57%. The shift in spending patterns is expected to lead to a decrease in the weighting of food items in the consumer price index (CPI), which is used by the central bank to frame monetary policy. Officials from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have previously indicated plans to revise the base year for the retail inflation data from 2012 to 2024, incorporating these findings. Analysts said food is likely to have a smaller weighting in India's consumer price index in the near future. The urban-rural monthly per capita consumer spending gap narrowed to 70% in 2023/24 from 84% in 2011/12, the report noted. In nominal terms, rural consumer spending climbed 9.55% year on year to 4,122 rupees ($48.23) per month in the year through July from 3,773 rupees the previous year, while urban spending rose 8.31% to 6,996 rupees from 6,459 rupees, the report showed. Adjusted for inflation, rural spending grew just 3.5%, while urban spending remained subdued due to retail inflation of about 5.5% in the fiscal year that ended in March. Compared with 2011/12, rural consumer spending rose 45.4%, outpacing the 38.1% increase in urban areas, reflecting a slight convergence in consumption patterns. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 58% of India's economic activity, remains a critical driver of economic growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

The Year in Amazon vs Walmart, and a Look Into 2025 By PYMNTS | December 27, 2024 | As 2024 comes to a close , the retail sector remains defined by the intense rivalry between Amazon and Walmart . Over the course of the year, these industry titans fiercely competed for consumer loyalty, market dominance and innovation leadership. Here’s a recap of the major moments in this ongoing battle, as covered by PYMNTS.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions . Δ Market Share and Consumer Spending The year kicked off with Amazon strengthening its lead over Walmart in consumer spending . By the end of 2023, Amazon accounted for 10% of all U.S. retail sales and 4.4% of total consumer spending, while Walmart captured 7.3% of U.S. consumer retail spending . This momentum carried into 2024, with Amazon securing 3.5% of consumer spending in the second quarter, compared to Walmart’s 2.9%. Digital Advertising and Retail Media Both companies ramped up their investments in digital advertising . Walmart expanded its retail media network, Walmart Connect , by adding display ads to Sam’s Club ’s Scan & Go feature and exploring new opportunities for non-endemic brands to advertise on in-store screens. Meanwhile, Amazon enhanced the appeal of its advertising services, including offering lower prices for Prime Video ad placements compared to Netflix . Loyalty Programs and Membership Perks Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The battle for paid memberships continued to heat up in 2024. By midyear, Amazon Prime led with a 67% penetration rate among U.S. consumers, while Walmart+ had grown to capture 30% of the market. To fuel further growth and deepen engagement, both companies introduced new benefits. Walmart teamed up with Burger King to offer dining perks for Walmart+ members, while Amazon expanded its Grubhub partnership , offering Prime members added food delivery advantages. Sales Events and Consumer Participation Prime Day and Walmart+ Week remained key battlegrounds in the retail rivalry. Amazon’s Prime Day set new records, with sales jumping 11% to surpass $14 billion. Although Walmart+ Week had lower overall participation, it experienced a massive 71% increase from the previous year. Interestingly, Walmart+ Week shoppers outspent their Amazon counterparts , averaging $473 per person compared to $326 for Prime Day shoppers. Innovation in Physical Retail Both companies advanced their efforts to digitize the in-store experience. Walmart revealed plans to implement digital shelf labels in 2,300 stores by 2026, enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience. Meanwhile, Amazon refined its Just Walk Out technology and smart shopping carts , while also licensing these innovations to other retailers. Expansion Into New Categories The rivalry between Amazon and Walmart also extended into new markets. Amazon ventured into the auto sales sector with its Amazon Autos platform, while Walmart forged third-party partnerships to strengthen its position in the same space. Both companies also ramped up their quick commerce initiatives, with Amazon testing 15-minute grocery deliveries in India to compete directly with Walmart-backed Flipkart . Additionally, Amazon’s push into rapid delivery services reflects its broader strategy to challenge Walmart’s dominance in the eCommerce and delivery sectors. Discounting Strategies Price wars between Amazon and Walmart gathered steam as both retailers intensified their discounting strategies to appeal to budget-conscious consumers. Amazon was reportedly set to introduce a new section showcasing low-cost items shipped from China , while Walmart unveiled its “largest savings event ever” in July , aiming to capture more price-sensitive shoppers. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, the Amazon-Walmart rivalry shows no signs of slowing down. Both companies remain at the forefront of innovation, expanding their offerings with new technologies like Amazon’s MK30 delivery drone and Walmart’s gamified marketplace, Walmart Realm . These initiatives highlight their drive to redefine the retail experience and stay ahead of the competition. Neil Saunders , managing director , retail , at research firm GlobalData , told PYMNTS Walmart and Amazon were both “retail winners” this year. “They are two of the main powerhouses of U.S. retail and are driving good growth,” he explained. “The mainstay of Walmart’s success is in grocery which, interestingly, is an area where Amazon continues to struggle . Amazon’s success is mostly in general merchandise and making their delivery speed faster and more convenient. Both retailers are seeing growth among more price-sensitive consumers who are seeking value. Walmart and Amazon are well positioned for further success in 2025.” Meanwhile, Greg Zakowicz , senior eCommerce expert at Omnisend , agreed Walmart and Amazon were both winners in 2024. “Walmart took a long-term approach to building up its business to appeal to higher-income shoppers without alienating its core base, and the combination of economic challenges and improved offerings made 2024 a pivotal and successful year for the retailer,” Zakowicz explained to PYMNTS. “It managed to increase its share of higher-income households and reshape its brand perception through its product offerings and logistics infrastructure — something Amazon is best known for.” Memberships are key to customer loyalty, he added, and “Prime has been the dominant membership and I don’t see that changing in 2025, but Walmart has made substantial progress. Its perks, such as a Paramount+ subscription and same-day grocery delivery, make it an attractive offering that effectively counters what Amazon offers, especially as consumers look for value. I think Walmart has done a good job of creating perks useful and appealing for customers. This is their Trojan horse into becoming a first-choice retailer for goods once commonly associated with Amazon.” Walmart has an advantage over Amazon in groceries, particularly with membership services , Zakowicz added . Same-day, free delivery and expanded product lines, like organics, make Walmart appealing to all income levels. “I’m most curious to see how Walmart’s renewal rates are in 2025, especially for those who joined during their $49 promotion,” he noted. “This will be Walmart’s indication of how well they are creating value for their members and can impact their product strategy moving forward. Poor renewal rates could lead to choosing to reduce certain product lines, such as organics, which could lead to further defections.” In 2025, Zakowicz said key areas to watch include: Walmart’s membership renewal rates. Amazon’s increased ads in Prime Video, and whether they impact renewals or drive paid ad-free upgrades. The speed at which both companies adapt to new trends, like Amazon’s fast-follow of Chinese sellers with Amazon Haul versus Walmart’s more calculated approach. The impact of tariffs on each company, and which one is better insulated, will be crucial to monitor.

Business | Business News UK retailers on brink of collapse surges by a quarter, report warns The strain on the retail sector follows new data showing a drop in the number of people heading to the shops during Boxing Day sales. The report comes after data from MRI Software showed Boxing Day shopper footfall was down (Dominic Lipinski/PA) PA Wire Anna Wise 27 December 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . The number of UK retailers on the brink of collapse surged by a quarter in recent months, a new report has warned. The strain on the retail sector follows new data showing a drop in the number of people heading to the shops during Boxing Day sales. The latest Red Flag Alert report from insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor found 2,124 UK retailers were in critical financial distress between October and December 16. This was 25% higher than in the previous three months, between July and September, although marked a slight decline of nearly 1% compared with the same period a year ago. The latest figures include a 29% quarter-on-quarter surge in the number of general retailers on the brink of collapse, and a 17% jump among food and drug retailers. This year has highlighted the resilience and adaptability of some UK retailers, but the sector remains under significant strain Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor Online sellers, takeaway food shops and mobile food stands, and convenience shops were among the businesses struggling the most. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “This year has highlighted the resilience and adaptability of some UK retailers, but the sector remains under significant strain. “Clearly, some retailers have found ways to manage financial pressures effectively, but others, particularly in general retail, are struggling under the weight of rising operational costs and squeezed consumer spending.” The report from Begbies comes after data from MRI Software showed Boxing Day shopper footfall was down 7.6% across all UK retail destinations compared with last year.

We expect elevated insolvency levels across this sector during 2025 Julie Palmer Clothing and footwear retailers had a weaker November than previous years with sales volumes declining by 2.6% for the month, according to the latest official figures. Homebase was one of the household names to announce it had called in administrators last month, after being hit hard by an “incredibly challenging” three years for the DIY sector. Ms Palmer said this poorer performance in “traditionally a critical month for the sector, further underscores the tough trading conditions, as consumers hold off on purchases amid low confidence and rising prices”. “Adding to this uncertainty, the measures announced in the autumn Budget , including the planned increase to employers’ national insurance contributions, will significantly dial up the challenges faced by these businesses,” she added. “These changes, alongside increases to the minimum wage, will negatively impact cash flow and, consequently, we expect elevated insolvency levels across this sector during 2025.” Homebase called in administrators last month (Peter Byrne/PA) PA Wire Ms Palmer said that the marginal year-on-year decline in the number of retailers facing critical distress provided a “glimmer of home” with some businesses finding ways to adapt to financial pressures and changing shopping behaviours. But she said others were more “vulnerable” to online competitors such as Temu and Shein , which have drawn in swathes of shoppers attracted to low-cost fast-fashion. Meanwhile, a total of 28,747 retail businesses in the UK were also in significant financial distress over the latest quarter, dropping from 34,494 over the same period last year.

The sustained growth momentum, coupled with a reduced risk of rapid labor market cooling, has provided the Federal Reserve with justification for its recent hawkish policy shift. On December 19, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the final GDP growth rate for Q3 was 3.1% (annualized, seasonally adjusted), surpassing the preliminary estimate of 2.8% released a month earlier. This figure also exceeded the 2.9% forecast by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones. The final GDP data incorporates economic indicators not available during the preliminary estimate. The Department of Commerce attributed the upward revision to stronger-than-expected export and consumer spending figures. Exports rose by 9.6%, a 2.1 percentage-point increase from the preliminary estimate, while personal consumption expenditures grew by 3.7%, up 0.2 percentage points. The growth in consumer spending marks the highest increase since Q1 of last year (4.9%). Despite forecasts that consumer spending would slow in the second half of the year due to slowing wage growth and dwindling household savings, these predictions have proven inaccurate. With consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, it remains a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. With the Q3 data revised upward, the U.S. economy has now recorded annualized growth above 3% for two consecutive quarters, following a 3.0% growth rate in Q2. Unlike South Korea, the U.S. reports GDP growth rates as annualized figures based on quarter-over-quarter changes, seasonally adjusted. The data underscores the resilience of the U.S. economy and suggests that the labor market is less likely to cool rapidly. Bolstered by this positive economic news, U.S. stock markets ended the tumultuous third week of December on a high note. On December 20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 498.02 points (1.18%) to close at 42,840.26. The S&P 500 gained 63.77 points (1.09%) to reach 5,930.85, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 199.83 points (1.03%) to 19,572.60. This marked the first time in 11 trading sessions that all three major indices closed higher. The Dow Jones, which had endured a 10-day losing streak until December 18—the longest since 1974—managed a sharp rebound over the next two days. The S&P 500 also saw its biggest single-day gain since early November. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism in a post-Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference, stating, “The downside risks to the labor market appear to have diminished. The U.S. economy is remarkable.” The Federal Reserve initiated a rate-cutting cycle in September, citing easing inflation and a cooling labor market as justification for a 0.50% rate cut (the so-called "big cut"). However, with inflation stabilization slowing and labor market risks receding, the Fed has signaled a return to a more hawkish stance, indicating a slower pace of rate reductions. close close 건전한 댓글 문화 운영 원칙 댓글 안에 당신의 성숙함도 담아 주세요.

Title: US Consumer Confidence Drops Ahead of Holidays

... By Natalie Venegas Weekend Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member What's New U.S consumer confidence dropped in the month of December ahead of the month's holidays, according to data released Monday by the Conference Board. Why It Matters The latest data comes as economists had anticipated a climb from November's consumer confidence of 112.8 to 113.8, thus making the decline a notable shift following months of increasing optimism. Despite more positive reports in previous months, concerns remain about the economic outlook, leaving policymakers and businesses questioning whether the downturn in confidence will translate to slower growth in 2024. What to Know The board's consumer confidence index dropped to 104.7 this month, down from 112.8 in November. The index evaluates both current economic perceptions and expectations for the next six months, offering a snapshot of consumer sentiment. ... This month's most concerning figure came from a sharp fall in Americans' short-term outlook for income, business conditions and job opportunities. The metric plummeted over 12 points to 81.1, dangerously close to the threshold of 80 that signals a potential recession. Despite this drop, the proportion of Americans anticipating an economic downturn over the next year remained steady. Meanwhile, the board also reported that consumer assessments of current conditions slipped slightly, from 141.2 to 140.2. Other Reports on Consumer Spending Retail spending remained robust through November with a 0.7 percent monthly gain reflecting strong holiday shopping activity. Personal spending also climbed by 0.4 percent from October to November, bolstering broader economic momentum. Fueled by consumer spending, which drives nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, the nation's economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. Economists, however, are closely monitoring whether consumers can maintain this level of support amid a backdrop of rising uncertainties including President-elect Donald Trump 's return to the White House. Economists have previously raised red flags over Trump's plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent on imports from China, a move experts warn could drive inflation higher. What People Are Saying Amid November's consumer confidence, Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that households might be underestimating the potential cost increases from such trade policies, or they may believe Trump's campaign promises won't translate into actual policy. "Households for now seem to have their heads in the sand about the potential uplifts to consumer prices from tariffs and deportations, or they think Trump wasn't serious about his intentions during the campaign," Tombs wrote in a client note, according to The Associated Press. What Happens Next Despite the drop, the interplay between consumer confidence, spending and economic policy will shape the coming months, and the early days of Trump's presidency will likely play a pivotal role in determining whether previous upbeat expectations are justified.

Money | retail stores With All Stores Closing Now, Party City Cuts Off Workers 38-year-old retailer shuts down, ending pay and benefits immediately for corporate employees By Bob Cronin Posted Dec 20, 2024 2:11 PM CST Copied A shopper leaves a Party City store in Vernon Hills, Ill., in October 2020. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File) Party City has been unable to overcome its financial challenges, its chief executives told employees Friday, especially the inflation that has increased costs and reduced consumer spending. So the company, which still had more than 700 stores, said it's starting to wind down operations immediately, reports CNN , which watched the video meeting. Corporate employees were informed that Friday was their last day, that there would be no severance pay, and that their benefits are ending. "It's really important for you to know that we've done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome," Barry Litwin told them. The struggles aren't new, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2023, which let it cancel debt of almost $1 billion. Some stores closed after that as part of the restructuring, per Yahoo Finance . But $800 million in debt remained a drag on the company.

(AFP/Dziki Oktomauliyadi) Days before Christmas, retailers have expressed the hope for solid sales during the year-end festive season. Budihardjo Iduansjah, chairman of the Indonesia Retail and Tenant Association (Hippindo), told The Jakarta Post on Thursday that, notwithstanding widespread concerns about weaker consumer spending, sales remained stable and were expected to see a strong seasonal bump as the year draws to a close. “We think that this [weaker spending] will not reduce [sales]. [They] are not rising too much compared with last year, but there is an increase from the previous months,” Budihardjo explained, noting that the Christmas and New Year period tended to drive up sales in December by an average 20 percent. He added that businesses in the segments of food and beverages (F&B), fashion, salons, theaters and others stood to gain particularly from the year-end effect, driven by bonuses and benefits received by most workers, but this year also by more money circulation after the regional elections that were held in November. He went on to say that this had improved people’s spending power, helping businesses to bounce back from months of sluggish performance. The country has grappled this year with what some economists and business associations have pointed to as signs of weakening consumer spending power, such as a shrinking middle class, a rising share of expenditure going to groceries and a sharp drop in automotive sales.

Consumer Spending Lifts Q3 GDP, but Savings Rates Are Pressured By PYMNTS | December 19, 2024 | In the latest and final revision of how the economy fared in the third quarter — through the growth in gross domestic product — the headline is that growth was healthy.

Δ GDP was better than expected, and it’s almost always the case that GDP’s direction rests firmly on the shoulders of U.S. consumers’ spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of the figure. GDP increased at a 3.1% annualized pace in the third estimate by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis , up from the second estimate of 2.8%. The pace was up from the second quarter of this year at a 3% annualized growth rate. Consumer spending, as measured in the personal consumption expenditures metric, was up 3.7%, annualized. The PCE price index — a measure of inflation — rose by 1.5% in Q3, continuing its downward trend from 2.5% in Q2 and 3.4% in Q1. This slowing rate of inflation suggests that some of the earlier pressure points, such as supply chain disruptions and elevated commodity costs, have eased. Disposable Personal Income Growth Lags Outlays However, disposable personal income, the measure of what consumers have on hand to spend on goods in services, continued to grow at a pace that was outmatched by inflation and spending. The data showed that household disposable personal income increased by 1.1% in Q3, higher than the 1% increase seen in Q2. If prices and spending rise more quickly than income, then the logic follows that consumers save less. This is borne out by the latest data, where the personal saving rate settled at 4.3%, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers Continue to Struggle With High Interest Rates ” found that coming into September, the last month of the third quarter, struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers — who account for 23% of the population — averaged $2,447 in savings, while those living without difficulty averaged $7,558. Fifty-one percent of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers struggling with monthly expenses had no readily available savings. In the meantime, the latest retail spending data showed that the savings rate may see further pressure, while credit cards continue to be a key means of spending into the holidays. Meeting monthly debt obligations means that there’s even less disposable income to set aside. November’s consumer spending was buoyant, as eCommerce sales rebounded from a tepid pace in October. Census Bureau data released this week indicated that overall retail sales surged 0.7% in November, ahead of the consensus of 0.6% gains month over month and quickening from October’s newly revised 0.5% pace (up from the previous 0.4% report). The average credit card debt , as measured across all PYMNTS survey respondents, was over $5,000, but struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers are carrying balances of $7,000. In addition, 41% of financially struggling cardholders often or always reach their card limits. They are more than six times as likely as financially stable consumers to do so.

Updated / Thursday, 19 Dec 2024 14:42 US GDP increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualised rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of Q3 GDP The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending, new figures show today. Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualised rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter US GDP today. The economy was previously reported to have expanded at a 2.8% pace last quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending and export growth, which offset a downward revision to private inventory investment and upward revision to imports. The economy grew at a 3% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. The US Fed last night delivered a third consecutive rate cut, but projected only two reductions in borrowing costs next year compared to the four it had forecast in September, citing continued economic resilience and still-elevated inflation. There are also concerns that some of the incoming Trump administration's policies, including tax cuts, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and tariffs on imported goods, would be inflationary. The Fed's policy rate was reduced by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.5% range. It was hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that "it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession," adding that "the US economy has just been remarkable, I feel very good about where the economy is - and we want to keep that going." US consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7% pace. That was revised up from the previously estimated 3.5% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.4% pace. Final sales to private domestic purchasers were previously estimated to have risen at a 3.2% rate, while domestic demand increased at a 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $15 billion, or 0.4%. They were previously estimated to have risen $0.2 billion, or unchanged in percentage terms. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, lowered from the initially estimated 2.2% pace. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2% rate in the second quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions have sharply narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.6% rate. That was revised up from the 2.5% rate reported last month. Gross domestic output grew at a 2.5% pace in the April-June quarter.

AFP December 19, 2024 / 20:51 IST Business are likely to bring forward some imports ahead of potential tariffs. The US economy expanded faster than originally estimated in the third quarter, according to government data released Thursday, despite analysts' expectations that growth would remain unchanged. The world's biggest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the July-September period, up from earlier estimates of 2.8 percent, the Commerce Department said. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad This was due to "upward revisions to exports and consumer spending," the report said, although it noted that the increase was partially offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment. In the second quarter, GDP growth was 3.0 percent. The US economy has shown resilience even as consumers drew down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period and grappled with higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve battled to rein in inflation. Related stories US second-quarter GDP growth unexpectedly revised up to 3.8% US economy shrank 0.5% in Q1 on import surge ahead of tariffs Consumer spending in particular has been a key factor behind growth -- even as Americans felt the pinch from higher costs of living -- supported by a healthy jobs market. "Compared to the second quarter, the acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected accelerations in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending," the Commerce Department said on Thursday. A consensus estimate pegged third quarter GDP growth at 2.8 percent initially, unchanged from before, according to Briefing.com. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad "The composition of revisions does strengthen our conviction that the economy is on solid footing and that 2025 will be another good year," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. Despite the boost from consumer spending, Sweet warned of variations depending on household incomes. High-income households "are reaping the benefits of a tight labor market, increases in housing, and stock market wealth," while lower-income households remain under financial pressure, he said, adding that this is unlikely to change next year. He also cautioned that inventories and net exports "will be volatile, particularly in the first half of next year," amid the threat of tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump who takes office in January.

US third-quarter economic growth revised higher Published on 12/19/2024 at 09:04 am EST Reuters Share Euro / US Dollar (EUR/USD) -0.07% WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending. Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. The economy was previously reported to have expanded at a 2.8% pace last quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending and export growth, which offset a downward revision to private inventory investment and upward revision to imports. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday delivered a third consecutive rate cut, but projected only two reductions in borrowing costs next year compared to the four it had forecast in September, citing continued economic resilience and still-elevated inflation. There are also concerns that some of the incoming Trump administration's policies, including tax cuts, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and tariffs on imported goods, would be inflationary. The Fed's policy rate was reduced by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range. It was hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that "it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession," adding that "the U.S. economy has just been remarkable, I feel very good about where the economy is ... and we want to keep that going." Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7% pace. That was revised up from the previously estimated 3.5% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.4% pace. Final sales to private domestic purchasers were previously estimated to have risen at a 3.2% rate. Domestic demand increased at a 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $15.0 billion, or 0.4%. They were previously estimated to have risen $0.2 billion, or unchanged in percentage terms. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, lowered from the initially estimated 2.2% pace. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions have sharply narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.6% rate. That was revised up from the 2.5% rate reported last month. Gross domestic output grew at a 2.5% pace in the April-June quarter.

Title: PatientRightsAdvocate . org Calls on Gov . DeWine to Swiftly Sign Hospital Price Transparency Legislation

Article Content:
COLUMBUS, Ohio , Dec. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PatientRightsAdvocate.org (PRA) applauded today's bipartisan passage by the Ohio General Assembly of major legislation to deliver hospital price transparency for Ohioans and urged Governor Mike DeWine to sign the bill without delay. The legislation, originally introduced as House Bill 49 by Ohio State Representatives Tim Barhorst (District 85) and Ron Ferguson (District 96) in February 2023 , was passed unanimously by both chambers as an amendment to H.B. 173 . If enacted, it would require Ohio hospitals to post the prices of available services online for upfront public viewing. "By passing this strong price transparency bill, Ohio legislators ignored special interests and stood up for Ohio healthcare consumers who for too long have been blinded to prices and forced to pay for care with a blank check," said PRA Founder and Chairman Cynthia Fisher . "This historic bill makes Ohio the first state in the nation to require that hospitals publish upfront prices in dollars and cents, so patients can protect themselves from overcharges and choose affordable care. We applaud Reps. Barhorst and Ferguson for their steadfast leadership and tireless efforts as they overcame every obstacle for nearly two years to make this critical bill a reality. Every Ohio patient, employer, family, and healthcare consumer can now benefit from actual, upfront healthcare prices, empowering them to rip off the blindfold and only pay agreed-upon, fair-market rates and benefit from remedy and recourse if overbilled. We urge Gov. DeWine to sign this bill into law immediately to substantially reduce Ohio's healthcare costs and return these funds to workers, businesses, and public-sector budgets." The Barhorst-Ferguson legislation would codify the federal Hospital Price Transparency Rule first enacted in January 2021 by President Donald J. Trump . According to PRA's Seventh Semi-Annual Hospital Price Transparency Report released last month, only 13% of Ohio hospitals reviewed are fully complying with the rule. Of the 2,000 hospitals reviewed nationwide, just 21% are in full compliance. When initially considered by the Ohio House of Representatives in June 2023 , the bill (as H.B. 49) was passed by a bipartisan 90-5 landslide. As the legislation made its way through both chambers of the General Assembly, Ohioans negatively impacted by surprise hospital bills and hidden fees voiced their support for the bill's enforcement provisions, including patients like Tracey Owens and Drew White . Tracey Owens ( Norton, OH ) : "Price transparency, as articulated in the Ohio legislation, empowers patients to avoid such outrageous healthcare costs and choose affordable care. ... It forces hospitals to compete over price and quality, just like everywhere else in the economy, putting downward pressure on costs. ... Signing this bill into law will help prevent more people from falling victim to the predatory healthcare system like I did. It will finally reduce outrageous state healthcare costs." Drew White ( Cincinnati, OH ): "We urgently need upfront prices to identify affordable care and avoid medical bankruptcy. ... If hospitals were required to post their prices, I could have compared surgery charges and chosen the best quality care at the lowest possible price. Unfortunately, since I was blinded to prices, I had no other option than to proceed with the surgery at my local hospital with only a prayer that the bill would be reasonable. ... Price transparency will catapult the American health care system into today's pro-consumer economy. It will end the days of six-figure bills for moderate surgeries and four-figure bills for stitches." In support of advancing the strongest possible version of H.B. 49, PRA led multiple public awareness campaigns, including the launch of RealPricesForOhio.com , paid targeted digital media, and mobile billboards driven around the Ohio Statehouse and the Ohio State University campus. About PRA PatientRightsAdvocate.org (PRA) is a leading national healthcare price transparency organization dedicated to ushering in systemwide transparency through advocacy, testimony, media, legal research, and grassroots campaigns. PRA believes that the availability and visibility of actual, upfront healthcare prices will greatly lower costs for patients and employers through a functional, competitive healthcare marketplace.

Menu News Turbulent year for fine wine affects revenues at Berry Bros. & Rudd 17 December 2024 By Arabella Mileham The turbulence in the fine wine market and wider macro-economic landscape saw revenues at the UK’s oldest fine wine merchant fall by 3.3% on last year and EBITDA slide by 51.2% – but investment rose as CEO Emma Fox said the company looked to its “future growth and capabilities”. Group turnover for Berry Bros. & Rudd in the 12 months to 31 March 2024 fell by 3.3% to £245.98 million (excluding adjustments for en primeur), according to the documents filed at Companies House, down from £254.28 million the previous year, while the company also recorded a loss before tax and exceptional items of £1.2m down, from a profit of £9.46m the previous year (or £19.59m in the year to March 2022). CEO Emma Fox wrote it had been “a turbulent year” in both the global fine wine and spirits as well as the wider luxury consumer goods sector more generally, coming at a time of high inflation, high interest rates and falling prices. “Global uncertainty and challenging macro-economic headwinds, coupled with a year of planned high investment for BB&R results in an anticipated drop in EBITDA,” she wrote in the financial records. EBITDA before exceptional items was recorded at £10.08m, a 51.2% slide from the previous year (£20.67m), but the core fine wine and spirits business in the UK and Asia performed well “with a low digit increase” in revenue, Fox said. The records showed that en primeur grew by 15%, however sales of more mature wines and commission from the BBX platform fell “in line with the wider fine wine market”. Meanwhile revenue from events rose 16%, and the spirits business saw a “small but steady sales growth”. BB& R brands and UK distribution was up 11.8%, and the third-party brands also in growth. There was also a boost to income from fine wine storage, up 27%, due to the group’s increased storage capacity after the opening of its Andover facility in October 2022. Customer numbers – particularly customers who collect fine wine – rose, and there were also more frequent purchases, she said. US declines However performance on the other side of the Atlantic showed a different story, she noted, with sales down 8.8%. The US business had a challenging time fighting the “large headwinds” evident in a tougher consumer economy, she argued, followed last year’s double-digit growth, amid two years of tailwinds. Decline in the American spirits import business, Hotaling & Co – which saw EBITDA fall 41.7% – indicated that that “the post-Covid spirits boom” has well and truly halted, amid increased investment in advertising and promotional spending. Distributors were reporting lower operating profits and “unpredictable consumer behaviour”, which had led to heavy destocking and larger declines in shipments and depletions, Fox said. Overall, this had contributed to the wider group’s 51.5% decline in EBITDA and lower operating margins .

Chair Lizzie Rudd said the business had “adapted to the challenges posed by tough market conditions, high inflation and interest rates” while continuing to push the boundaries “of what it means to be the most trusted fine wine and spirits merchant in the world”, growing, adapting and innovating the business “when many of our competitors are scaling back”. She pointed to the company’s minority stake in Cotswold Distillery, which was acquired in April 2023 , as well as its partnership with Symington Family Estates in acquiring England’s oldest commercial vineyard, Hambleden Vineyards just over six months later. “We expect the market challenge of the past year to persist over the next twelve months, in an industry that has not seen stability in some time. Despite this, we have made a reasonable start to the financial year and I am confident that the group’s strategy and sound financial footing makes us well-place to make the most of the opportunities that inevitably arise from such times.” As a result, a dividend of 1310p per share was issued (640p in Oct and 670p to be paid out in Jan 2025) which the company said reflected the “sustainable underlying growth in the business”. “The underlying positive performance of this year, in spite of the challenging market conditions is a direct result of the talent, dedication and commitment of our employees past and present,” Rudd added.

Title: US retail sales beat expectations in November

AP U.S. retail sales increased in more than expected in November amid an acceleration in motor vehicle purchases, consistent with strong underlying momentum in the economy as the year winds down. Retail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, advancing 0.5% after a previously reported 0.4% rise in October. Estimates ranged from a 0.1% dip to a 1.0% jump. Labor market resilience, characterized by historically low layoffs and strong wage growth, is underpinning consumer spending and keeping the economic expansion on track. Strong household balance sheets, reflecting record stock market prices and high home prices, are also driving spending. Household savings remain supportive. Live Events The solid increase in retail sales came despite a late Thanksgiving holiday that pushed Cyber Monday into December, and was consistent with a strong start to the holiday shopping season. It was also in spite of a less favorable seasonal factor, the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data. Federal Reserve officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and were expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, the third reduction in borrowing costs since the U.S. central bank embarked on its easing cycle in September. Strong retail sales added to warmer inflation readings in recent months in suggesting that the Fed could pause rate cuts in January. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration's planned policies, including tariffs on imports and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, are also seen complicating matters for the central bank. "Sticky, above-target inflation will weigh on the Fed's decisions next year," said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "But with tariffs set to squeeze real after-tax incomes and undermine confidence, we think the Committee will be more worried initially about the labor market." The U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range, having been hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after an unrevised 0.1% dip in October. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, accounting for most of the economy's 2.8% pace of expansion during that period. The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

US retail sales beat expectations in November Published on 12/17/2024 at 08:40 am EST Reuters Share Euro / US Dollar (EUR/USD) -0.07% WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased in more than expected in November amid an acceleration in motor vehicle purchases, consistent with strong underlying momentum in the economy as the year winds down. Retail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, advancing 0.5% after a previously reported 0.4% rise in October. Estimates ranged from a 0.1% dip to a 1.0% jump. Labor market resilience, characterized by historically low layoffs and strong wage growth, is underpinning consumer spending and keeping the economic expansion on track. Strong household balance sheets, reflecting record stock market prices and high home prices, are also driving spending. Household savings remain supportive. The solid increase in retail sales came despite a late Thanksgiving holiday that pushed Cyber Monday into December, and was consistent with a strong start to the holiday shopping season. It was also in spite of a less favorable seasonal factor, the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data. Federal Reserve officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and were expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, the third reduction in borrowing costs since the U.S. central bank embarked on its easing cycle in September. Strong retail sales added to warmer inflation readings in recent months in suggesting that the Fed could pause rate cuts in January. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration's planned policies, including tariffs on imports and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, are also seen complicating matters for the central bank. "Sticky, above-target inflation will weigh on the Fed's decisions next year," said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "But with tariffs set to squeeze real after-tax incomes and undermine confidence, we think the Committee will be more worried initially about the labor market." The U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range, having been hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after an unrevised 0.1% dip in October. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, accounting for most of the economy's 2.8% pace of expansion during that period. The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.3% pace in the fourth quarter. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) © Reuters - 2024 Share

Lululemon Faces Challenges in Domestic Market Despite Global Success By PYMNTS | December 16, 2024 | For Lululemon , the third quarter of 2024 marked an interesting contrast in its performance across different regions. While the company saw impressive global growth, especially in international markets, its U.S. performance has raised concerns.

Δ By the Numbers The company’s net revenue rose 9%, reaching $2.4 billion, with a 33% increase in international sales, while U.S. sales remained relatively flat. Despite the strong overall performance, the Americas region — which accounts for the bulk of Lululemon’s business — saw a modest 2% increase in net revenue and a 2% decline in comparable sales. Lululemon’s struggles in the U.S. market can be attributed to several factors, including market saturation, according to Zachary Robichaud , instructor, School of Retail Management, Ted Rogers School of Management , Toronto Metropolitan University . “Lululemon’s U.S. presence is well-established and the athleisure category overall is highly competitive, with players like Nike , Adidas , and emerging direct-to-consumer brands offering similar products at competitive prices,” Robichaud explained to PYMNTS. Shifts in consumer behavior due to the economy is another factor, Robichaud noted, adding, “ while athleisure remains popular, U.S. consumers may be prioritizing budget-conscious purchases amid economic pressures like inflation, seeking lower-cost alternatives. Specifically in the athleisure category, many low-cost competitors have entered the market.” Still, brand perception challenges persist, he added. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “In a mature market like the U.S., staying fresh and innovative is critical,” Robichaud said. “Lululemon’s premium price point may limit its appeal in a cost-sensitive environment, especially if the brand isn’t perceived as consistently delivering newness or exclusivity.” Another factor impacting Lululemon’s performance in the U.S. is the economic landscape, according to Greg Zakowicz , senior eCommerce expert at Omnisen d . “The biggest challenge in the U.S. is price point,” Zakowicz told PYMNTS. “As we’ve been discussing for the past 18 months, consumers are trading down for value. Athleisurewear is an area where that tradedown happens. “Consumers still love the Lululemon brand, and its products have a reputation of lasting over time, which plays into the value equation. However, as a brand that doesn’t offer blanket deep discounts, they sell at a premium price. Until consumers feel confident in their personal economic positions, the price point will prevent quick growth.” Looking Ahead Despite these challenges, Lululemon officials remain optimistic about its U.S. prospects. CEO Calvin McDonald noted in the company’s Dec. 5 earnings call that Lululemon is working on strategies to revitalize its U.S. business. “Last quarter, I laid out our plans to drive improvement in our U.S. business,” McDonald explained. “These plans include implementing a new reporting structure within our product team, increasing the penetration of seasonal newness within our assortments by Quarter 1 2025, and chasing into updated colors, prints and patterns to provide guests with more options in the second half of this year. Our merchandising and brand teams are now more fully integrated, which leads to better coordination and faster decision-making regarding how we bring our innovation to life.” When looking at the composition of the company’s assortments, McDonald said “ we are on track with our efforts to increase the penetration of seasonal newness and expect to be in line with historical levels in quarter one 2025. I feel good about the quality and quantity of newness the teams have planned, and we are well-positioned for spring. “Our teams have been agile and have been chasing into seasonal colors, prints and patterns. These efforts have contributed to the sequential improvement in newness within our assortment in the back half of the year. We continue to see significant potential for growth in the U.S. Our guest retention remains high, and we see an opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with more newness in the assortment. We continue to grow our membership program, and we are now 24 million members strong.” Even given these efforts, some retail experts remain cautious about Lululemon’s prospects in the U.S. market. In an interview with PYMNTS, Neil Saunders , managing director , retail , at research firm GlobalData , said, “Lululemon’s slower American growth raises the question as to whether it is starting to bump up against a ceiling. “There is much more competition in the U.S. market, and even relatively loyal Lululemon consumers are shopping around more widely. This problem isn’t going to disappear over time. If anything, it’s going to intensify. Lululemon’s response to this needs to be to lean more heavily into more embryonic categories, including its men’s business.” As Saunders noted, while Lululemon’s brand loyalty remains strong, the increased competition and economic pressures are contributing to a shift in how consumers are allocating their spending. As shoppers become more selective, Lululemon’s challenge will be to continue offering compelling products that resonate with their core audience while also attracting new customers in a crowded market. “The other factor at play is a more constrained and pickier shopper,” Saunders added. “While most Lululemon shoppers are far from being hard-pressed, they are still impacted by inflation and have modestly reduced the volume of things they buy. This has a dampening impact on sales growth. The good news here is that this will automatically course correct as the consumer economy improves. So, the medium-term hope is that sales growth in the Americas will settle above current rates.” Recommended Stablecoin Issuers Race for Bank Charters as Fed Weighs Access Tariff Tally: Global Losses Eclipse $35 Billion Going Into Q3 Earnings Visa and Proof Team to Bolster Digital ID Verification Alibaba Unveils AI Chatbot and Prices AI Glasses at $659 See More In: athleisure , athleticwear , Calvin McDonald , Earnings , GlobalData , lululemon , Neil Saunders , News , PYMNTS News , Retail

Article Content:
Last week’s Q3 national accounts release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that real consumer spending stalled despite households receiving the stage 3 personal income tax cuts. The result suggested that households had saved rather than spent the Stage 3 tax cuts, which was also reflected in the rise in the savings rate. Advertisement Higher frequency data on household spending showed the trends continuing in Q4. The ABS Monthly Household Spending Indicator (MHSI) for October revealed that nominal consumer spending in trend terms eased to 0.1% in October from 0.2% in September, with the annual growth rate also easing to 1.9% from 2.3%. Advertisement Westpac’s monthly card tracker also reported a sharp fall over the two weeks to November 30, declining 2.6pts to 134.6. “The quarterly growth pulse eased further to +0.6%qtr, down from +1.2%qtr recorded four weeks ago” , noted Westpac. “Momentum has slowed back to the sluggish pace seen in late-August”. Advertisement CommBank’s Household Spending Indicator for November also recorded weak consumer spending, especially in per capita terms. Analysis from Justin Fabo at Antipodean Macro shows that Australians have used the windfall from Stage 3 tax cuts to pay down mortgage debts. Advertisement As illustrated below, household mortgage offset account balances rose more than usual in Q3 as tax cuts inflated after-tax take-home pay. The increase in Q3 was around $5 billion more than a year earlier, according to Fabo. This is good news from a financial stability and inflation perspective, as it will have lowered household and domestic demand, other things equal. Advertisement

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ( WHNT ) — A Madison County judge has reversed a decision to hold a self-defense hearing for a man charged in the Twin Peaks deadly shooting — before his preliminary hearing. Attorneys for Jeremiah Matkins say the issue of the immunity or self-defense, hearing has not yet been resolved, but the court has issued a new order setting his preliminary hearing for Jan. 8 and withdrawing its Dec. 17 order that set a Jan. 14 immunity hearing. NWS confirms additional surveys of storm damage across Tennessee Valley was ‘straight-line wind’ Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Matkins, 21, is charged with killing Ray’shun Markelle Bates, 23, of Decatur on Nov. 9 inside the restaurant. The Huntsville Police Department said the shooting took place during an altercation between two groups of people. Under Alabama law, if a defendant can successfully argue to a judge he was acting in self-defense in a deadly encounter, the murder case is over. Matkins’ defense attorney Larry Marsili has argued Alabama law does not require the self-defense hearing to take place after a preliminary hearing, but it is uncommon. The defense says the law doesn’t require a defendant to wait an extended period before being allowed to show he acted in self-defense. The Madison County District Attorney’s Office opposed the request. But District Court Judge Linda Coats ruled on Dec. 17 in favor of the defense, finding that she could hold the immunity hearing and not wait for the case move to Madison County Circuit Court following an indictment. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement POLICE: Huntsville woman arrested after man injured in shooting But on Dec. 19, Coats issued a new order saying the Dec. 17 order was withdrawn, the immunity hearing was canceled and the matter is under “further advisement by the court.” Last week she set Matkins’ preliminary hearing for Jan. 8. Marsili told News 19 today that Alabama’s self-defense law is unclear, but that it was aimed at preventing long delays before a person could make a self-defense argument in a murder case. “The spirit of that law is to shield people who act in self-defense from the tedious and costly process of being prosecuted for actions that are justified under the law,” Marsili said. “I can’t imagine the lawmakers meant for a person acting in self-defense to have to wait potentially several years to be exonerated.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Generally, during a preliminary hearing, prosecutors introduce police testimony that spells out the case against the defendant and asks the court to send to the case to a grand jury for an indictment. The defense can cross-examine witnesses and call their own witnesses. The court is charged with deciding if there is probable cause to send the case to a grand jury.

"I held important meetings with the supervisory boards of the State Rear Logistics Operator and the Defense Procurement Agency," the ministry's press service said on Monday, citing Umerov. As the minister reported, priorities for 2025 were discussed at the meeting with members of the supervisory boards. Namely, improving procurement mechanisms; monitoring and control over contract implementation; expanding cooperation with international partners; ensuring prompt and timely feedback for companies and suppliers; creating an effective internal control system. "Our common goal with both supervisory boards is to form strong and effective institutions capable of promptly fulfilling key strategic tasks. The strength and defense capability of our army depend on their work," Umerov said.

Umerov thanked the members of the supervisory boards for their work. "Only joint, coordinated actions between the Defense Ministry, supervisory boards and agencies can ensure the effectiveness of defense procurement and strengthen public confidence in this process," Umerov said.

close Video How will Trump’s Defense Department picks affect weapons development? Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on how President-elect Trump’s Defense Department picks could affect the United States keeping up with China on ‘Special Report.’ NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! As NATO member states struggle to meet their defense spending goals and war rages on Europe's eastern front, officials are struggling to agree on a plan to shore up hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster defenses. Eight NATO countries did not meet their 2% target for defense spending in 2024. And as many member states struggle with chronically stressed budgets, calls to meet those goals are not being heeded quickly. The European Commission estimates about 500 billion euros, the equivalent of $524 billion in investments, are needed in the coming decade to defend Europe against evolving threats. NATO LEADERS PREDICT ERA OF 2% DEFENSE SPENDING 'PROBABLY HISTORY' AS TRUMP REPORTEDLY FLOATS HIGHER TARGET The EU's budget cannot be used to fund defense directly, and some European officials and NATO experts are proposing a global defense bank to dole out funds for military modernization. A defense, security and resilience (DSR) bank would issue bonds backed by AAA ratings for financially strapped countries to upgrade their defenses and would provide guarantees for commercial banks to offer credit to defense suppliers. European officials are struggling to agree on a plan to shore up hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster defenses. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Ryan Parr) "This is not a substitute to raising defense spending in each of these countries. I think it should be a supplemental tool," Giedrimas Jeglinskas, chairman of the national security committee in the Lithuanian parliament and a former NATO official, told Fox News Digital. His remarks echo those of incoming President Trump, who has long threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO due to the number of nations missing the mark on the 2% goal for defense spending. "I think we have to look at it also as an opportunity for the U.S. as well," Jeglinskas added. "I understand the skepticism by Donald Trump of the World Bank and then the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and IFC [International Finance Corporation] and other institutions. I think there's been a lot of capital deployed and a lot of investments that these banks or institutions do. The real impact is, at best, questionable. So, I think we have to have very clear KPIs [key performance indicators]. We need to build defense." The United States' $824 billion defense budget in 2023 equaled half of total defense spending by all NATO member states combined at $1.47 trillion. PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA READY TO COMPROMISE WITH TRUMP ON UKRAINE WAR The return of Trump to the White House, coupled with a U.S. push to refocus on China, has left Europeans wondering whether the U.S. will have less of an appetite to defend Europe in years to come. More EU defense chiefs and foreign ministers have pitched the idea of issuing joint debt through bonds to finance military projects. But some countries like Germany have voiced concerns about maintaining their own sovereignty and a disproportionate financial burden on some countries. The DSR bank idea is explained at length in a new Atlantic Council report by defense fellow Rob Murray. The EU's budget cannot be used to fund defense directly. (Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP, File) "For allies across both the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, the bank could go beyond offering low-interest loans for defense modernization to facilitating equipment leasing, currency hedging, and supporting critical infrastructure and rebuilding efforts in conflict zones like Ukraine," Murray wrote. "An additional critical function of the DSR bank would be to underwrite the risk for commercial banks, enabling them to extend financing to defense companies across the supply chain." The goal would be to offer financing to small and medium-sized defense companies that often struggle with access to funds. "By providing loans with extended maturities, the bank would offer predictable and sustainable funding for defence modernisation. Its governance structures would align funding with collective security goals, such as upgrading arsenals and investing in emerging technologies," Jeglinskas wrote in a recent op-ed for the Financial Times. A defense, security and resilience (DSR) bank would issue bonds backed by AAA ratings for financially strapped countries to upgrade their defenses. (Alexandra Beier/Getty Images) Asked how the DSR bank would get countries to agree on defense funding priorities, Jeglinskas likened the idea to the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a military alliance that includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Jeglinskas noted the 33 trillion euros in European assets under management across the continent. "There's really no political will, no risk appetite to move them anywhere besides the kind of bond markets where they rest now," he said. "But several nations need to build that initial capital, and then, by using the sovereign rating to get to hopefully AAA in capital markets, raise that money from bond markets and to start funding defense programs." The European Investment Bank has doled out long-term loans and guarantees to European nations' projects that align with EU policy goals. "But even they are struggling with kind of shifting their mandate towards more dual-use technologies is still not allowed in their funding package," said Jeglinskas. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "Of course, every other bank in Europe is looking at EIB for their signals. That signaling hasn't been there yet. So, that's the point. We need to create some sort of mechanism, and that kind of global defense bank would be one of the tools that we could use to rally the capital and really direct it toward defense. So, it's really creating another multilateral lending institution." Fox News Politics Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

He urges opposition PTI to avoid politicizing the issue, while reiterating that military trials adhere to fair trial principles. File photo (Picture credit: ANI) ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister on Wednesday defended the military trial of civilians, saying that such courts were competent to deal with the cases related to attacks on army facilities. Information minister Attaullah Tarar also urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan to refrain from politicising or disputing the issue of military trials. "When an attack is carried out on a defence institution or its property is set ablaze, it becomes the responsibility of the relevant authorities to apprehend the culprits. Just as railway police handle crimes on railway premises, military courts address offences targeting military assets. So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced," he said while addressing a press conference. Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore. The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised. "The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts," Tarar said. He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials. The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years. Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.

Advertisement It marks the first major military-civilian joint initiative since a key Communist Party policy meeting in July called for progress in this area. A resolution passed at the meeting, officially known as the third plenum , pledged to “improve military-local contact mechanisms” and “refine military-local standardised work collaboration mechanisms”. Beijing is currently working to modernise the battle readiness and logistics capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army. This month the military disclosed that a joint directive issued by the Central Military Commission, the supreme command body, and China Railway had said: “Both parties should … strive to forge a new era of seamless cooperation between the military and civilian sectors in the realm of transport and logistics.” Advertisement It aims to establish a collaboration mechanism to transport military supplies and looks to incorporate military delivery into performance assessments for the civilian rail authorities. China National Defence News, an outlet owned by the PLA’s official newspaper, recently said that there are already examples of positive military-civilian cooperation on logistics, including an upgrade of a railway line used to transport military equipment to a port.

Title: Fewer Military Ballots Mailed from Overseas Ahead of 2024 Election Compared to 2020

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways About 20,000 fewer military ballots were cast by mail from overseas in the weeks leading up to this year's election than in 2020, according to data obtained by Military.com. By the week before Tuesday's election, 36,898 overseas military ballots had been mailed in, as tracked by a mailing label unique to military ballots, compared to the 57,049 that were cast in the same time frame in 2020. While representing only partial data on the total number of military voters this year, the number for ballots mailed from overseas in the weeks prior to the election provides a snapshot of participation by service members and their families in a year in which military ballots became a political football ahead of Election Day. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Read Next: Air Force Removes Commander Who Oversaw Nuclear Missile Maintenance at Montana Base Complete numbers on 2024's military voters, including how they were distributed geographically, won't be available until states submit data to federal authorities after the states are done counting every vote. But postal agencies are able to track military ballots sent in from overseas using what's called the Label 11-DOD, which was created to provide military voters an expedited way to mail in their ballots. Depending on the state, military voters can also submit their ballots by email, fax or other electronic means but, historically, mailing is the most common way service members send their ballots back. For example, in 2020, about 76.4% of service members who voted absentee submitted their ballots by mail, according to the Election Assistance Commission's post-2020 election report. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In total in 2020, about 330,000 uniformed service members voted by absentee ballot, according to the commission. In addition to being lower than in 2020, the number of mailed overseas military ballots cast ahead of this year's election also dropped off from 2016. That year, there were 49,413 overseas military ballots mailed with the Label 11-DOD tracking label in the weeks leading up to the election. The data on military ballots mailed from overseas for this year, 2020 and 2016 was obtained by Military.com from a source who requested anonymity to disclose information on a politically sensitive topic. This year's number is a big increase from the 2022 congressional elections , but it is common for voter turnout in presidential election years to eclipse midterm elections. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The data on this year's election comes as feared post-election challenges of ballots cast by service members, their families and other U.S. citizens overseas did not materialize after former President Donald Trump secured a relatively quick victory to return to the White House. Prior to the election, Republicans in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan -- all key swing states -- sued to stop military and overseas ballots from being counted as part of a broader effort to lay the groundwork to challenge the election results if Trump lost. All three lawsuits were dismissed by judges . But military family advocates had warned that just the act of filing the lawsuits could have a chilling effect on military voter turnout this year since it could discourage service members and their families from voting if they thought their votes wouldn't count. "We know that when there is a lack of confidence in voting, there is less likelihood to vote," Khiet Ho, a Marine Corps spouse who is the lead researcher at Secure Families Initiative, a military families organization that in part works to expand military voting, told Military.com in October. "And so these lawsuits in effect are going to decrease even more military service members and military family members from voting." Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While Trump's win in the presidential race was called by The Associated Press the morning after the election, several congressional races were still too close to call on Friday, including more than a dozen involving veterans . Absentee ballots, including those cast by military voters, are often among the last counted, meaning those votes could be decisive in the remaining uncalled races.

PITTSBURGH , Nov. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viqtory has announced the launch of its Military Friendly® Employer Memberships at www.militaryfriendly.com . The creation of Memberships come at the behest of employers who have long sought access to a more strategic approach to tapping talent from the military community. Continue Reading "Since 2003, Military Friendly® has been the gold standard in collecting data on and rating Military Friendly Employers. With Memberships, we're now able to offer employers unique tools that help them promote their career opportunities to members of the military community," said Viqtory CEO Chris Hale . Trust, Training and Talent are the three primary benefits of Employer Membership. Trust is anchored in a vetting process that ensures Military Friendly® Employer Members pledge to a program to recruit, retain and advance members of the military community as employees in their companies. "The training blogs, webinars, tools and data insights provide employers with leading best practices on how to recruit, retain and advance veterans and military spouses. This is essential to really connect with this valuable labor pool of 12 million people ," said Kayla Lopez , VP of Memberships. Talent gives Members access to a military community-centric job board on www.militaryfriendly.com to post jobs, search resumes and promote their employer profile and vetted status in a more exclusive way. "The labor shortage in this country is not a short-term problem. It's generational. Leading employers are committing as many resources to recruiting talent as they are to recruiting customers. Military Friendly Employer Members will be able to separate themselves from the millions of other employers who are competing for that talent," said Hale. The Employer launch, which starts today on the eve of Veterans Day weekend, enables Employer Members to populate their employer profiles and job postings in advance of the public launch on December 12. The public launch will be held on the weekend of the annual Army-Navy football game to honor this historic moment.

Title: South Korea Sells Itself as the  Best Partner  for Saudi Arabia on Defense

Article Content:
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol told a senior Saudi official in Seoul on Tuesday that his country is potentially a “best partner” to cooperate on a variety of issues of mutual interest, most prominently defense development and technology. Yoon has prioritized the bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia since taking office in 2022, focusing particularly on selling Riyadh South Korean weapons and defense gear. Yoon became the first South Korean president to visit Saudi Arabia in 2023, cutting deals to both sell Korean technology and jointly develop new defense materials. Yoon met with the head of the Saudi National Guard, Abdullah bin Bandar Al Saud, in the South Korean presidential office in Seoul on Tuesday, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported . The Korean government put on a show for Abdullah before the meeting, organizing a display of novel weapons systems, an honor guard event, and what Yonhap referred to as an “integrated firepower drill.” “The defense collaboration between the two countries would not only strengthen Saudi Arabia’s defense capabilities but deepen bilateral ties,” Yoon was quoted as saying during his meeting with the Saudi official, describing South Korea as Saudi Arabia’s “best partner.” The South Korean Defense Ministry separately published photos of meetings between Abdullah and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who celebrated the two countries as “future strategic companions” and noted that Saudi Arabia is South Korea’s largest Mideast trade partner. Kim emphasized Yoon’s message of South Korea as a “best partner” to Saudi Arabia, particularly on military matters. “Minister Kim Yong-hyun mentions that the Saudi Ministry of Defense and the Korean Defense Ministry are currently working together to introduce ground equipment,” the Defense Ministry noted, “and the Republic of Korea is the best partner for joint cooperation, such as joint research and development.” The branding of South Korea as a “top” partner for Saudi Arabia is a unique feature of Yoon’s presidency designed to capitalize on the rift between Riyadh and the United States under outgoing President Joe Biden. Biden – who promised to turn Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. partner, into a “pariah” while campaigning for the presidency – cut off sales of offensive weapons to the country in 2021, leaving a significant void in the country’s defense demands. “The defense industry is emerging as a blue ocean in our cooperation with Saudi Arabia,” Kim, then serving as Yoon’s national security adviser, said during Yoon’s trip to Saudi Arabia in 2023. “Large-scale defense industry cooperation discussions are in the final stage, in various areas such as antiaircraft defense systems and firearms.” During that visit, Yoon described South Korea as an “optimal partner” for the Saudis not just in defense, but in the “post-oil era” generally, including in developing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” strategy. “Vision 2030” is a holistic plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil that includes massive urban development, including the construction of the entirely new “green” city of Neom. South Korean companies have gotten in on the ground floor of Neom development, including major global corporations such as Hyundai. Mohammad bin Salman, the de facto leader of the country, agreed with Yoon’s assessment of his country as a viable collaborator. While Yoon emphasized cooperation outside of the fossil fuel industry, in December 2023, the publication Energy Intelligence reported a dramatic surge of South Korean purchases of Saudi crude oil in the months following Yoon’s visit to the country. By February, the two countries were openly announcing defense deals, including a memorandum of understanding on jointly developing weapons technology. “South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Saudi defense ministry signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to pave the way for cooperation in the defense industry and joint weapons development,” Yonhap reported at the time. “Under the MOU, the two sides will launch a bilateral committee to jointly conduct research and development of weapons systems for continued cooperation in the defense industry, DAPA said.” The Saudi government also purchased South Korea’s Cheongung M-SAM II surface-to-air missile system that month, worth $3.2 billion and an increasingly popular option for Middle East nations. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) purchased the Cheongung II system from South Korea in January 2022 for $3.5 billion. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Report us Related Topics Laser Defense Ministry Iron Beam The Defense Ministry announced Monday a major deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (around $500 million) to boost its acquisition of advanced Iron Beam laser interception systems. Defense Ministry Director-General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, who signed the agreement Sunday, said, “This deal heralds a new era—the era of laser defense,” adding that the first operational capability of the ground-based laser system is expected to be deployed within the next year.

The Iron Beam system, designed to intercept various aerial threats such as rockets, mortar shells, drones and cruise missiles, has demonstrated its capabilities in recent trials and is set to join Israel’s multi-tiered defense network as a cost-effective addition to the Iron Dome. “Since the outbreak of the war, the Defense Ministry has signed hundreds of procurement orders worth billions to bolster Israeli-manufactured defense capabilities and ensure Israel’s self-reliance,” said Zamir. 2 View gallery The Iron Beam laser defense system ( Photo: Defense Ministry ) The ministry’s statement noted that the integration of Iron Beam will significantly enhance Israel's defensive capacity against current and future threats at a fraction of conventional interception costs. 'Global superiority' "The Iron Beam is yet another testament to the professionalism, creativity and innovative prowess of our defense industries, supported by partnerships between defense companies and startups," DDR&D head Brig. Gen. (res.) Dr. Danny Gold said. He noted that Israel's capability to develop and deploy advanced laser interception technology on the battlefield is a reflection of both technical mastery and effective project management. 2 View gallery The Iron Beam laser defense system ( Photo: Defense Ministry ) Rafael CEO Yoav Turgeman highlighted that after years of research, the Iron Beam laser system—the first of its kind worldwide—is set for deployment. "Rafael is proud to lead the development of this high-powered, versatile laser interception system. Following a series of rigorous tests, the Iron Beam will soon reach operational maturity," Turgeman said. Elbit President and CEO Bezhalel Machlis (Butzi) Machlis called the development "a significant leap forward in defense against diverse threats." Elbit, known as Israel's "laser powerhouse," collaborated closely on Iron Beam’s development. "Our teams at Elbit have played a critical role in advancing this groundbreaking defense capability, which we believe will set a new standard in strategic defense for Israel," Machlis said.

With him are Senate President Francis Escudero; Speaker Martin Romualdez; Senators Miguel Zubiri, Jinggoy Estrada, Win Gatchalian and Imee Marcos; Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro; Iloilo 5th District Rep. Raul Tupas and Ilocos Norte 1st District Rep. Sandro Marcos. STAR / File MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos yesterday signed a law that seeks to strengthen the Philippines’ self-reliant defense posture and to develop the local defense industry, a measure that he said would support the country’s needs in the face of volatilities and evolving threats. The Self-Reliant Defense Posture (SRDP) Revitalization Act or Republic Act 12024 aims to promote and spur the growth of an independent national defense through a program that will develop the Philippines’ national defense capabilities. The program involves the development of a local defense industry through partnerships between the government and private manufacturers to achieve domestic production capability for weapons and other defense materiel for the military. It is designed to support policies, research, maintenance and installments while crafting strategies to boost production competitiveness and actively lobbying for more effective defense policies. “With the signing of the Self-Reliant Defense Posture Revitalization Act, we are anchoring our defense strategy firmly in the strength of our own resources and capabilities,” Marcos said during the signing ceremony at Malacañang. The President said the Philippines’ defense capabilities have relied upon what it could acquire from abroad for decades. He pointed out that every purchase, negotiation and partnership was a reminder that the country’s strength depended on the supply chains and interests of other parties. According to him, the self-reliant defense posture program, which was implemented under his father, the late president Ferdinand Marcos Sr., was a call to tap into the country’s own resources and capabilities. Marcos said the program successfully met the basic materiel requirements of the military in the early years as the country was able to manufacture ammunition, mobility equipment and tactical communication sets; produce vehicles from jeeps to boats and supply the armed forces’ clothing requirements. AFP, DND laud law Both the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) lauded and welcomed yesterday the signing into law of the SRDP Revitalization Act. DND spokesman Arsenio Andolong said that the revitalization of the country’s SRDP Program aims to develop and establish an independent and dynamic defense system that relies on the country’s own capabilities and resources to support the weapon and materiel requirements of the AFP and other law enforcement agencies. “The SRDP law represents a structured and innovative approach to defense development, focusing on enhancing the Philippines’ research and production capabilities. It aligns closely with the country’s strategic objectives, ensuring that defense systems are not only modernized but also tailored to meet dynamic security landscape,” added AFP public affairs office chief Col. Xerxes Trinidad. Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri, principal author and co-sponsor of the SRDP Act, yesterday expressed his confidence that the new law would fortify the country’s defense capabilities while reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers. “This will be a great boon both for our defense forces and for our economy. It lays the foundation for a strong, self-reliant defense industry. We can now start manufacturing our own defense equipment instead of merely buying from other nations,” Zubiri said. He highlighted the necessity of building a self-reliant defense system, especially in light of potential geopolitical challenges that could disrupt the supply of military equipment. “What if there’s a war, if there’s a breakdown and suddenly we can’t buy from them anymore? How can we defend ourselves?” Zubiri pointed out. “We need to build our own, to arm our own.” “We have great Filipino minds, skilled professionals who can drive the growth of our local defense sector,” he concluded. — Cecille Suerte Felipe FERDINAND MARCOS JR.

Ennore thermal station expansion required for grid stability, to meet increasing power demand: T.N. govt. To meet the increasing demand, projects like ETPS and Udangudi Super Critical Thermal Project have been planned, and work is underway. These projects would not impact the environment, the State Electricity department said in a statement Updated - December 20, 2024 05:25 pm IST - CHENNAI The Hindu Bureau READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Ennore Thermal Power Station in Chennai. File | Photo Credit: K. Pichumani The Tamil Nadu government on Friday (December 20, 2024) said the 660-MW Ennore Thermal Power Station (ETPS) expansion project would help ensure grid stability and increase power generation. The State’s power demand is increasing by 10% every year, and to meet the increasing demand, projects like ETPS and Udangudi Super Critical Thermal Project have been planned, and work is underway. These projects would not impact the environment, the State Electricity department said in a statement. It also said Tamil Nadu was a leading State in terms of green energy. Green energy initiatives With 11,000 MW of wind energy capacity, Tamil Nadu ranks second in the country, and in terms of solar energy capacity, the State ranks third with a capacity of 9,400 MW, the statement noted. The State government has formed the Tamil Nadu Green Energy Company Ltd. to oversee its green energy initiatives, it said. The State has set a target of adding additional green energy capacity of 100 billion units by 2030. This includes wind and solar energy, pumped storage and battery energy storage systems, bio-mass and cogeneration projects, the statement added. It has set a target that 50% of its energy needs should be met by green energy by 2030. Due to the infirm nature of green energy sources, there is a need for the State’s energy mix to have a certain portion of conventional energy sources, according to the Electricity department.

Article Content:
Agencies NEW DELHI: Oil and Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC ) is negotiating with Shell-owned Sprng Energy to acquire the latter's 125 MW operating solar energy asset in what could be a Rs 500-crore deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Sprng Energy, which has 2.3 GW of operational renewable energy capacity, has put some of its assets on the block. For one 125 MW solar asset in Rajasthan, it received multiple bids in which state-run ONGC turned out to be the top bidder, people cited above said. ONGC's bid is learnt to have valued the Sprng's asset at around Rs 500 crore. Sprng Energy has now entered into an exclusive arrangement with ONGC to negotiate the final deal, these people said, adding that a closure may take months. Investment bank HSBC is advising Sprng Energy on the deal. Sprng Energy and ONGC didn't offer comments for the story. Live Events Shell acquired renewable energy platform Sprng Energy from private equity investor Actis in August 2022 for an enterprise value of $1.55 billion. Sprng then operated 2.1 GW of renewable energy assets. Shell aims to stay invested in Sprng Energy while selling out some of its operational and under-construction projects, according to people cited earlier. Several renewable energy projects are on the block in the country today, with some early private equity investors seeking exit and some promoters looking to recycle capital. ONGC, the nation's largest oil and gas producer, seeks to build a green portfolio using a mix of greenfield buildout and acquisitions. The cash-rich oil company, in partnership with NTPC Green, is seeking to buy Ayana Renewable Power, which has a portfolio of 4.6 GW of operational and under-construction renewable energy assets. ONGC, which aims to have a renewable energy portfolio of 10 GW by 2030, acquired PTC Energy Ltd for Rs 925 crore in September. PTC Energy has 288 MW wind generation capacity. Shell, meanwhile, has globally recalibrated its energy transition strategy. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Today I am standing here to share my views on an important topic “Energy Conservation”. Energy is the basis of our life. We fulfill our daily needs by using electricity, petrol, coal, gas and other energy sources. But have you ever thought that these energy sources are not infinite? Importance of Energy Conservation Conservation of energy is not only our responsibility but it is a necessity for our future generations. If we do not adopt measures to save energy today, then there may be a shortage of these resources in the future. This will not only make our life difficult but will also have a serious impact on the environment. Simple Tips to Save Energy Save electricity: Switch off lights and fans when there is no one in the room. Use solar energy: Get solar panels installed at home and make maximum use of natural light. Stop wastage of water: Use water pumps and geysers judiciously. Right use of vehicles: Walk or use a bicycle for short distances. Benefits of energy conservation Saving energy not only benefits the environment but also leads to economic savings. Along with this, it helps in keeping our earth healthy and green. Conclusion Let us all pledge that we will adopt energy conservation measures in our lives. It is not only an individual's responsibility but it is our collective responsibility. Remember, "Save energy, save future". Thank you. 5 Minutes Speech On Energy Conservation Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about the importance of energy conservation. Energy Conservation Day is celebrated in India every year on 14 December. The purpose of this day is to motivate people to save energy and use it wisely. Energy is an important part of our lives. We use it daily in our homes, schools, offices and industries. But if we spend it without thinking, it can get exhausted quickly. Saving energy helps us protect the environment. When we save electricity, less coal and petroleum is burnt, which reduces air pollution and global warming. We can take many small steps to save energy. For example, turn off lights and fans when not needed. Use power-saving devices and use renewable energy like solar energy. Energy conservation does not only mean saving electricity but also not wasting water and fuel. With small efforts, we can save our country from the energy crisis and make the environment safe. On this Energy Conservation Day, let us all pledge to use energy wisely and save it for the coming generations. Thank you! 10 Minutes Speech On Energy Conservation Good morning, respected Principal Sir, teachers, and my dear friends. Today I stand in front of you all to share my views on energy conservation. Energy conservation means the proper use of energy and not wasting it. It is our responsibility to save energy so that future generations can also benefit from it. The importance of energy conservation can be understood from the fact that every year "Energy Conservation Day" is celebrated on 14 December. The purpose of this day is to make people aware of the importance of saving energy. Energy Conservation Day was first celebrated in India on 14 December 1991. It was organized by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, which aims to ensure that energy is used properly and is not wasted unnecessarily. Saving energy not only reduces the electricity bill but also protects the environment. When we use energy properly, it helps in reducing climate change and pollution. For example, if we switch off unnecessary bulbs, use fans and ACs properly, and adopt energy efficient appliances, we can save a huge amount of energy. Another big aspect of energy conservation is the use of renewable energy. Resources like solar energy, wind energy, and hydro energy provide energy without harming the environment. We should promote these resources. Energy conservation starts from our small habits. Like switching off lights and fans while leaving the room, switching off water motors at the right time, and reducing the use of vehicles and walking or cycling. So friends, let us all pledge that we will make every possible effort to save energy. Saving energy is not only our responsibility, but it is also our duty towards the environment and humanity. Thank you. Hope you liked these suggestions and got thoughts about your speech. Refer to links below for more related information.

A closer examination of India’s energy landscape, along with global practices in hybrid contracts, highlights the rationale behind these policies and creates a roadmap to drive energy capacity of the nation. What Are Hybrid Projects? Hybrid projects integrate multiple energy sources—typically thermal and renewable energies like solar and wind—into a single procurement process. This approach is designed to: Improve energy generation efficiency. Lower operational costs. Expedite project timelines. By blending energy sources, hybrid projects address the intermittency challenges associated with renewables while ensuring a reliable power supply to meet growing energy demands. India’s Energy Needs and the Case for Hybrid Projects India’s energy demands are rapidly increasing, driven by economic growth and ambitious renewable energy targets. The government has committed to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. Hybrid projects support this goal by facilitating the integration of renewable sources into the energy mix, ensuring stability, and reducing dependence on a single energy type. For instance, Rajasthan's solar-wind hybrid projects demonstrate how this model can optimize resource use and generate cleaner energy, setting an example for other states. Committed to fostering a Transparent, Competitive, and Inclusive Energy Sector Competitive Landscape: India’s renewable energy sector is home to numerous domestic and international players, including Tata Power, Adani Energy, and Brookfield Renewable Partners, creating a highly competitive environment. Transparent Processes: The government has implemented strict guidelines to ensure transparency and fairness in tendering, with competitive bidding mechanisms that prevent undue advantage to any one entity. Global Practices: Hybrid Contracts are a standard practice worldwide, underscoring their effectiveness in balancing energy needs. Global Examples of Hybrid Projects Countries across the globe have adopted hybrid projects to address complex energy challenges: United States: States like California integrate renewables with traditional power plants to ensure grid reliability during peak demand. Germany: The Energiewende policy links onshore wind and solar projects to maximize efficiency and resource sharing. Australia: Hybrid projects combine renewable sources with backup generators to stabilize the grid. United Kingdom: Hybrid Projects for offshore wind with battery storage ensure consistent energy supply despite the intermittency of wind energy. Advantages of Hybrid Contracts Energy Security: A diversified energy portfolio reduces dependency on single sources and enhances reliability. Cost Efficiency: By combining renewable energy’s declining costs with traditional energy infrastructure, hybrid projects lower overall energy costs for consumers. Innovation and Development: Hybrid systems foster advancements in energy storage and operational technologies, driving research and innovation. Environmental Sustainability: By promoting cleaner energy options, Hybrid Systems align with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Hybrid Contracts: A Strategic Policy for India Hybrid Contracts reflect a forward-thinking approach tailored to India’s unique energy landscape. The policy aligns with international best practices and positions India as a leader in innovative energy solutions. By focusing on a diversified energy mix, the government aims to ensure sustainability, economic growth, and reliable power supply for the nation. By leveraging hybrid models, India is building a robust, future-ready energy framework that addresses current challenges and sets the stage for the nation to be a shining light in innovative energy solutions.

SHREVEPORT, La. ( KTAL/KMSS )— CenterPoint Energy says they recognize customers who use these tips to reduce their energy use and save money. CenterPoint wants to remind customers of the benefits of having an energy-efficient home: Check your furnace maintenance, service your furnace annually, and check the air filter monthly; Adjust your temperature: To maximize potential savings, use a smart thermostat to automatically adjust your cooling or heating when you’re asleep or away from home; Seal air leaks: Use caulking and weather stripping around windows and doors to seal air leaks and reduce drafts inside the home; Use the sun: If it’s hot outside, cover the windows for a cooler indoor temperature. When it’s cold outside, open your shade/blinds to capture the warmth from the sun; Choose energy smart appliances: upgrading appliances that are ENERGY STAR certified can potentially qualify for ‘ energy efficient rebates ‘ Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Energy-efficient appliances are more cost-effective because they typically use less natural gas. Gas stoves produce emissions that can harm humans, pets, and the environment. One study conducted by Standford University found that more than three-quarters (one out of 53 stoves) did not leak methane when turned off, exposing families to nitrogen dioxide that can aggravate respiratory conditions (asthma, coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing). Carbon Capture: what is it and is it dangerous? “At CenterPoint, we have tips, tools, and programs to help customers save energy and manage their bills. We encourage our customers to take steps to increase the energy efficiency of their home so that they can continue to stay comfortable inside year-round while reducing their energy use,” said Tony Gardner, Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer at CenterPoint. “By taking some small and easy actions, customers can make a big difference in reducing their monthly energy bills.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Customers can learn more about energy saving and see their monthly costs and emissions on their website .

All On Partnerships for Energy Access (All On) and the United States African Development Foundation (USADF) are pleased to announce the renewal of their partnership to expand off-grid energy access in Nigeria, with a focus on underserved communities. Building on the success of their collaboration from 2017 to 2022, this new initiative will see both organizations commit a combined $10 million over the next three years to support innovative, African-owned businesses providing sustainable energy solutions. To commemorate the renewal, a signing ceremony was held in New York, attended by All On CEO, Caroline Eboumbou and USADF President and CEO, Travis Adkins, alongside representatives from both organizations. The ceremony marked a significant step forward in their joint mission to drive increased energy access and socio-economic development in Nigeria. Through the All On-USADF Nigeria Energy Challenge, the partnership will continue investing in off-grid energy companies to increase access to clean energy for low-income communities, while contributing to Nigeria’s socio-economic development. The program will drive the localization of the energy value chain. The initial cycle of the Challenge delivered US$3.6 million in blended finance to 36 companies. Since then, the companies have gone on to establish over 100,000 connections, improving more than 500,000 lives through access to clean energy. USADF President and CEO, Travis Adkins, emphasized the importance of the partnership, stating: “Our collaboration with All On has shown the transformative impact of off-grid energy solutions in improving lives and livelihoods in rural and underserved regions of Nigeria. We are excited to continue this partnership’s important work, advancing clean energy technologies while addressing essential needs like health, education, gender inclusion, and economic empowerment.” The new funding will target both existing grantees and new businesses, focusing on addressing key challenges identified from previous cohorts. USADF will provide up to $250,000 in grant funding per selected project, while All On will contribute up to $750,000 per recipient through a range of investment mechanisms to support businesses in Nigeria’s energy sector. Caroline Eboumbou, CEO of All On, highlighted the program’s impact, saying “We are thrilled to renew our partnership with USADF, which has already made a significant impact on energy access in Nigeria. By combining our resources and expertise, we aim to empower more local businesses and communities with sustainable energy solutions. This collaboration is not just about providing power; it’s about creating opportunities for economic growth and lasting development across sectors throughout Nigeria.” The partnership will focus on empowering women in energy, enhancing agricultural productivity, and promoting digital innovation, while also addressing energy needs in healthcare and education.

Representative Image Mumbai: Promoter-driven strategic investment firms and hospital operators are scouting for stressed healthcare assets that they can acquire through the insolvency and bankruptcy process, as private equity firms often edge them out in the race for good assets by offering lofty valuations. Despite the potential risks of lengthy litigation and financial and operational issues, assets facing bankruptcy proceedings are much cheaper in a market where hospital properties command premium valuations — an enterprise value (EV) of more than 25 times the Ebitda on an average. The average valuation of listed hospitals is around 27 times. There have been several such deals in the past year and a half where strategic investors have acquired stressed assets. In mid-December, the bankruptcy court in Mumbai approved Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Ltd’s Rs 202 crore bid to acquire Karkinos Healthcare Ltd under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Karkinos is building a 150-bed multispecialty cancer hospital in Imphal, Manipur. Reliance Industries Ltd owns Reliance Strategic Business Ventures. In October, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal closed the insolvency proceedings against Jaypee Healthcare Ltd after hospital chain Max Healthcare settled the dues of financial creditors by paying Rs 1,035.29 crore. Live Events In August, Nishkala Healthcare announced the acquisition of Suash Health Care Foundation, which runs a 400-bed multi-speciality hospital in Navi Mumbai, for Rs 189 crore through an insolvency resolution process. Large healthcare chains such as Narayana Healthcare too had shown interest in Suash Health. “We are seeing an increasing interest from some of our clients to acquire functioning hospitals, diagnostic firms or other ancillary healthcare firms through the insolvency resolution process,” said Nishith Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP & Legal. “In a post-pandemic era, people have realised the importance of healthcare and further penetration of mediclaim and insurance have drawn investors’ interest in the sector.” In July, Chennai-based MGM Healthcare acquired 300-bed SevenHills Hospital in Visakhapatnam for over Rs 170 crore. Investors and strategic buyers are also closely observing the resolution process of SevenHills Healthcare Pvt Ltd's 1,500-bed Mumbai hospital as well as that of Mumbai-based Four Care Hospital Pvt Ltd and Uttung Health & Wellness Pvt Ltd. “The clean slate theory (the acquirer doesn’t have to worry about previous claims) and promising returns of the healthcare industry are attractions for the desired,” said Nipun Singhvi, managing partner of law firm NSA Legal. “Further, a large number of schemes launched by the government have also given impetus for buying in this sector.” "We have M&A teams that closely look at each and every hospital asset, including those under IBC," said an executive at a large South Indian hospital chain. The executive, who didn't want to be named, said the assets under IBC could be turned around through infusion of capital, branding and operational efficiencies of a large hospital chain. On the flipside, not all assets under the IBC come cheap. Max has agreed to acquire Jaypee Healthcare at an enterprise valuation of Rs 1,660 crore which was 24 times of Ebitda. "We stay away from auction processes. Auctions can lead to what is called the winner's curse. You may end up paying a valuation which is not justified," said Abhishek Kabra, chairman, Marengo Asia Healthcare and Partner, Samara Capital. "Our model is very clear, we look for existing hospitals in good locations, doing good clinical work but not running to full potential," he added. Marengo Asia is a hospital platform built on a string of acquisitions. The healthcare sector, particularly hospitals, witnessed major expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, after the situation eased, it became difficult for many standalone hospitals to sustain their businesses. Now, such hospitals are seeing interest from two sets of bidders — those already in the industry and seeking to expand and those who want to turn around such entities before they sell to someone else. Last year, the bankruptcy court’s Chennai bench approved ASG Hospital’s Rs 520 crore revival plan for debt-laden Vasan Eye Care, a chain of eye care hospitals across the South. Vasan's other suitors included MGM Healthcare, Maxivision Eye Hospital and Dr Agarwal's Health Care. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Synopsis AI is transforming healthcare by improving efficiency, reducing delays, and enabling research, as highlighted and therefore, AIIMS, Delhi is investing over Rs 300 crore in digital infrastructure to ensure that every stakeholder is benefitted. Experts emphasized AI's potential to simplify health communication, empower patients, and ensure accessibility. However, they stressed the need for balancing technology with human empathy for compassionate, patient-centred care. ET Online Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising everything from patient care to health communication and AIIMS, Delhi, is investing over Rs 300 crore in digital infrastructure to ensure that every stakeholder -- patients, doctors, and researchers -- benefits from this innovation, the premier institute's director Dr M Srinivas said. "By integrating AI, we can improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enable world class research," he said at a recently held event at AIIMS here. Dr Srinivas also emphasised that leveraging AI to simplify and disseminate health information will empower patients and improve their engagement with healthcare systems, ultimately leading to better health outcomes. At the event, leaders in healthcare, technology, and policy shared insights into how AI is poised to bridge critical gaps in health communication, making information more accessible, reliable, and patient-centric. Dr Kavita Narayan, senior technical advisor, HRH for Health Systems at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said that a good health system is one that isn't reliant on individuals. "AI can play a vital role in making healthcare more accurate, compassionate, and equitable. To truly make a difference, we must integrate technology thoughtfully and ensure collaboration between policymakers, technologists, and healthcare providers," Dr Narayan said. A standout example of AI's application in healthcare communication is Humeta, a custom-trained AI model introduced by Mr Daleep Singh Manhas, cofounder and CEO of Healthpresso. Speaking about its potential, he explained, "Healthcare is a sensitive field where credibility is paramount. Humeta is trained on over a million data points from trusted medical sources like The Lancet and PubMed, ensuring that the information it generates is both accurate and up-to-date." Manhas further elaborated on how Humeta tackles the challenge of accessibility. He said 63 % of people find it difficult to understand medical content. "With Humeta, we simplify complex medical concepts into digestible and credible formats -- text, visuals, and interactive tools -- ensuring that patients are empowered with reliable information they can trust," he said. By combining accuracy, real-time data retrieval, and compliance with global healthcare standards, AI tools like Humeta are paving the way for a more inclusive and informed healthcare ecosystem. Although AI offers unprecedented potential, experts caution against overdependence on technology at the expense of human connection. Dr KP Kochhar, Head of the Physiology Department at AIIMS, stressed the importance of balancing innovation with empathy in healthcare. She remarked, "While AI can enhance precision and efficiency, we must preserve the human touch in healthcare. Compassion and technology must work together to create systems that prioritise the well-being of patients." The insights shared by experts at AIIMS underscored the emerging and pivotal role of AI in transforming health communication. By addressing long-standing challenges in accessibility and trust, AI promises to empower patients with knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions about their health. The discussions culminated in a collective call to action for responsible and ethical integration of AI in healthcare systems, urging policymakers, technologists, and healthcare providers to collaborate in leveraging AI for the greater good. As AI continues to evolve, experts agree that its thoughtful application has the potential to create a future where healthcare communication is more inclusive, reliable, and patient-centric. By bridging gaps in health awareness and patient education, AI is shaping a more informed and healthier society. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Title: What steps will Donald Trump take to address healthcare infrastructure challenges ?

Article Content:
Donald Trump’s return to the White House has reignited intense discussions about the future of healthcare in the United States. As part of his second-term agenda, Trump has pledged to address significant challenges within the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. While his proposals aim to modernize healthcare facilities and expand access, critics remain skeptical about their feasibility and impact. Trump’s Vision for Healthcare Modernization Trump has positioned healthcare reform as a cornerstone of his administration’s second-term priorities. His plans reportedly include a substantial increase in federal funding to upgrade aging hospitals, expand telehealth services, and strengthen rural healthcare networks. Additionally, Trump’s team has indicated that partnerships with private companies will play a critical role in accelerating innovation and improving healthcare delivery. One of the key proposals involves allocating resources to repair and modernize existing facilities, particularly in underserved areas. Advocates for the plan argue that this focus could significantly improve outcomes for millions of Americans. “Healthcare infrastructure is long overdue for a transformation,” said Dr. Linda Matthews, a healthcare policy expert. “If these initiatives are executed properly, they could bridge longstanding gaps in access and quality.” However, critics have expressed concerns over funding sources and the potential redirection of resources from other vital programs. “Infrastructure improvements sound great on paper, but the details of execution will determine their success,” said Matthews. Mixed Reactions from Public and Experts Reactions to Trump’s healthcare initiatives have been mixed, with some expressing optimism and others cautioning against potential pitfalls. Public debates online have further amplified the divide. User @HealthcareHero tweeted, “If Trump delivers on healthcare infrastructure, it could transform rural communities. This is exactly what we need right now!” Another commenter, @PolicyCritic, countered, “Bold promises, but where’s the money coming from? We’ve seen grand plans fall apart before.” Others focused on the potential benefits for telehealth services. “Telehealth expansion is critical. Rural America needs these advancements yesterday,” wrote @RuralHealthAdvocate. Meanwhile, @SystemicFix pointed out, “Infrastructure isn’t the only problem. Without addressing affordability, these changes won’t help the people who need it most.” Veterans’ healthcare also emerged as a hot topic. “Our VA hospitals are in desperate need of upgrades. This could be Trump’s chance to truly support our veterans,” tweeted @VetCareChampion. Conversely, @HealthRealist questioned, “Will veterans really see change, or is this another hollow promise? Action speaks louder than words.” Challenges on the Horizon Despite the ambitious scope of Trump’s healthcare agenda, significant hurdles remain. Securing bipartisan support in Congress could prove difficult, particularly given concerns about funding and implementation. Furthermore, experts have highlighted the complexity of addressing systemic issues, such as workforce shortages and inequities in healthcare access. The success of these initiatives will ultimately depend on effective collaboration between federal, state, and private stakeholders. As details of Trump’s healthcare policies continue to unfold, the nation remains divided on whether these proposals will meet the country’s pressing needs.

The new services offered by Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy are set to advance women's wellness and address pelvic health needs. Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy Expands Women's Physiotherapy Services Get the latest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . The new services offered by Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy are set to advance women's wellness and address pelvic health needs. Advertisement Wynnum. Australia, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pelvic floor prolapses, pelvic pain syndrome, endometriosis, and urinary incontinence were once almost treated as taboo subjects. Many women suffered in silence or, worse, were ignorant of any treatment options available. The increase in awareness of pelvic health needs has led women to physiotherapists who specialise in these health conditions, such as the women's health physiotherapists at Advantage Healthcare and Physiotherapy. With the increase in demand for skilled women's health physiotherapists, the leading women's wellness centre has decided to take on additional women's health physiotherapists. Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy Advertisement Anna Oh, one of the specialists at Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy , began her career as a general physiotherapist but found her passion in addressing women's health issues. Inspired by the profound impact physiotherapy could have on women's lives, Anna transitioned into the field of women's health physiotherapy, dedicating her practice to improving her patients' well-being. Anna works alongside Eleni Cody, a highly experienced pelvic floor physiotherapist who specializes in tailoring treatments to meet individual needs. Together, they assist patients with a range of concerns, including fitting and managing pessaries for pelvic support, retraining overactive or underactive bladders, strengthening pelvic floor muscles, and treating urinary incontinence. With a team of expert physiotherapists, the clinic is committed to providing compassionate, effective care that empowers patients to regain control and confidence in their daily lives. Pelvic floor exercises are widely recommended as the first line of treatment for urinary incontinence, often proving effective before more intensive measures like medication or surgery are needed. After childbirth or with aging, many women mistakenly accept a little leakage when laughing or coughing as a normal part of life. As a result, they often rely on pads to manage these leaks, even though such measures may be unnecessary. While it may be a little embarrassing to seek help, many cases can be improved after a few sessions and a little direction from Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy. By adopting certain habits and performing targeted exercises, women can achieve transformative, life-changing results. Advertisement Those receiving physio during pregnancy or postpartum (post-childbirth) often benefit from another of Advantage Healthcare's specialised services: paediatric physiotherapy. This relatively new offering was introduced a few years ago when two physiotherapists expressed a keen interest in helping children reach their full potential. Advantage's Paediatric Physiotherapists address conditions like developmental delays, toe walking, and general clumsiness, which can sometimes leave children lagging behind their peers in school or social activities. These challenges may lead to social isolation, difficulty keeping up with schoolwork, or exclusion from games and sports. However, the dedicated pediatric physiotherapists at Advantage Healthcare, Amie Rice Mooyman and Jenny Kim, have witnessed remarkable improvements in the children they treat. Many young patients achieve milestones their parents once thought unattainable. Advantage Physiotherapy also works with children facing more complex challenges, including cystic fibrosis, head trauma, or other conditions such as autism. Advertisement "Helping children with disabilities is a fulfilling job,” said Jenny. "Helping make a difference in their lives and seeing the joy on their faces when they achieve what they previously couldn't is amazing.” Learn more about Advantage Healthcare & Physiotherapy by visiting their website at https://advantagehealth.net.au/ .

Innovation Data Lockdown: The Hidden Barrier To Affordable Healthcare By Virgil Bretz , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Dec 30, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save Virgil Bretz is co-founder and CEO of MacroHealth , a healthcare fintech platform. getty Your mission (should you choose to accept): Create a detailed budget for you and 10 of your closest friends for all the food you will collectively consume over the next year. How much will this cost? Which sellers will you buy food from? How do you estimate the needs of each person? This seems like a tough mission. Fortunately, you have something to make your task easier. You have magically gathered your friends’ detailed grocery, restaurant, DoorDash and other food-related receipts from the past two years and compiled them into a tidy database. Using this data, you could analyze their purchasing habits and create a budget for the year to come. Now imagine scaling this concept to the $4.5 trillion U.S. healthcare marketplace . That sounds like an impossible mission. This would be quite possible if you had access to healthcare purchasing data similar to the detailed grocery receipts in our analogy. Fortunately, there is an abundance of this exact type of data throughout healthcare, but it is not systematically organized or delivered where it is needed to support market efficiency. This data, properly leveraged, opens opportunities for massive cost savings, innovation and better care outcomes. Leveraging Marketplace Strategies In Healthcare We often treat healthcare services differently than other industries, assuming healthcare is too important for normal market mechanisms that efficiently balance supply and demand. In certain cases, this might be true, such as the rules ensuring that adequate emergency services are available close to wherever people live, without regard to the ability to pay . However, considering our food analogy, access to nutrition is at least as important to life and health in our society as healthcare. While we rightly provide targeted social support for access to food, the marketplace for food is predominantly structured as a free market, with market-based demand and supply mechanisms such as the ability to compare prices and easy access to product availability information. In the food industry, detailed market transaction data is employed to inform suppliers what to sell, stock and distribute. Further up the supply chain, market data guides what to produce and grow. Extensive data is provided to buyers, whether they are individual consumers or bulk buyers like restaurants or stores, in the form of granular availability, price and quality data. This helps buyers create their purchasing strategies. At more than three times the size of the food industry and representing more than 17% of the U.S. economy , we need every successful tool and strategy possible to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. This includes leaning harder into adopting free market practices that help other industries more effectively balance supply and demand. Healthcare Markets' Need For Market Data These market principles can apply in healthcare. With a shift to market-based thinking, consumers can evolve from "I need to go to a doctor" to “I need to make a critical, informed purchase of healthcare." A claims manager at a health insurance company can elevate from “reactively paying millions of dollars in medical claims” to “intelligently purchasing millions of dollars of healthcare services.” In these examples of healthcare marketplace decision making, these buyers need to optimize their decisions for access, cost and quality. This information needs to be accurate, timely and understandable at the moment of their decision. Ubiquitous Healthcare Data, Everywhere The healthcare market data we need is everywhere, all around us. But it reminds me of the line " Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink ." We can start with the healthcare bills we receive as consumers—all the bills from medical providers, all the "explanations of benefits" (which confuse more than explain) from our insurers. Billions of these documents are created every year. For the health market professionals working at America’s provider and insurer organizations, this data is pervasive, almost unavoidable. But exposing and organizing this information to use at the points of decision making has been difficult so far. Barriers To Health Market Data Hoarding: Quality, access and especially price information has been carefully guarded by healthcare payers and providers for decades. The price of a medical treatment is typically unknown until well after a treatment has been completed, and the patient has guaranteed they will be responsible for the unknown charges. Generally, health market information has only been provided when mandated by governmental regulation. Complexity: The U.S. healthcare system generates exabytes of data annually, spanning patient records, insurance claims and billing codes. There are more than 9 billion healthcare claim transactions annually; the average hospital manages 50 petabytes of data in electronic health records, imaging and billing systems per year; and there are 71,000 diagnostic and 82,000 procedural codes . Inertia: Legacy IT systems are deeply embedded in healthcare. Seventy percent of healthcare organizations still use fax machines to send and receive many medical records. Most data is transmitted using 40-year-old EDI protocols that would make modern, real-time marketplace applications found in other industries—like Uber—impossible. Trust: Much of the data that needs to be cleaned, shared and analyzed is patient data. This data must be anonymized and secured. Utilizing Ubiquitous Data In Micro And Macro Settings The scale, heterogeneity and regulatory complexity of healthcare data make it uniquely challenging to manage and analyze. Reducing this complexity can be accomplished with standardized data-sharing protocols, AI-driven tools for automation and investments in consumer experience. When this data is simplified and provided to consumers when they need it most—at the micro point of making a personal healthcare purchasing decision—that consumer’s use of this information for their own benefit immediately contributes to a more rational healthcare marketplace. At a macro scale, payer and provider access to this data pinpoints demand and supply mismatches, reduces pricing inconsistencies and optimizes costs, leading to a smarter and more affordable healthcare system. Our industry’s health market professionals can leverage data, technology and relationships to measurably improve healthcare access, cost and quality. To make this happen, we have a lot of work and opportunity ahead of us. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Health care in New Mexico ranks near the bottom in the country for nearly all of the key health care metrics used to judge states and populations, such as mortality rates, affordability of and access to health care, avoidable deaths, infant mortality, women’s mortality and life expectancy. New Mexico’s overall health care ranking is 43rd out of the states, an ongoing issue that needs improvement. It is necessary to expand New Mexico’s statewide health care programs, prepare more medical professionals, increase funding, upgrade equipment and improve telehealth and facilities. These changes would encourage and provide an incentive for doctors, nurses and specialists to stay in New Mexico and improve the state’s medical system. Additionally, these expansions would provide more financial support and attract health care providers to New Mexico and hopefully allow the state to retain the providers trained in New Mexico. While many communities have limited access to health care, others have none, which creates an issue that requires continuous efforts to improve. Many people in New Mexico do not have equal or timely access to health care facilities and need to travel long distances to access care, causing them to spend excessive amounts of time traveling, even crossing state lines, to seek care. Shaping the future of health care is essential for New Mexicans to be able to receive the health care services they need. To do so, it is crucial to better coordinate and strengthen the state’s health care network and patient outreach. Setting the goals of shortening the time it takes to schedule appointments with primary care physicians and making it easier to find a primary care physician and obtain timely referrals to specialists in larger health care systems should also be considered. Nearly all counties in New Mexico are facing health care professional shortages. Nursing shortages in New Mexico, for example, can be considered significant when compared with national trends. Shortages can result in New Mexicans not being able to receive proper care. In Las Vegas, N.M., efforts have been made to improve the nursing shortage that the Alta Vista Regional Hospital is experiencing. These efforts include providing a place for the local nursing students from New Mexico Highlands University and Luna Community College to receive training while the hospital staffers seek potential future nurses. Generally, New Mexico can expand more residency programs in all parts of the state to prepare future providers as well as add and enhance the quality- of-life opportunities for families of health care professionals to keep them in New Mexico communities, regardless of size. Complex community needs in New Mexico come with additional challenges because of the need to expand clinical education and clinical research. In addition, culturally competent care is required for the diverse population that exists within New Mexico. Taking care of the aging and youth populations is an important aspect to consider when shaping the future of health care. Mental and physical health is also important for all patients, as there has been a growing need for mental and behavioral health care within communities. Communication is a key aspect in shaping the future of health care in New Mexico. Medical and legal teams must work together with the public for improvements in health care to occur. This is going to take consistent and continuous efforts from all sides of the political spectrum, given that improving and shaping the future of health care is not an easy fix. As technology is set to continue advancing, it is important the state continues to use validated, evidence-based technology within the health care system. Technological advances regarding health care, such as telehealth, can grant more New Mexicans access to the health care services they need. All areas of the state have unique offerings to attract and retain health care professionals. When we work together, solve health issues affecting us and build a strong system of care, New Mexico’s families and its economy benefit. Sen. Pete Campos, a Democrat from Las Vegas, N.M., has served in the state Senate since 1991.

Health-tech innovators in India expect 2025 to be a crucial year in healthcare transformation. Mudit Dandwate, CEO and co-founder of Dozee, observed that health AI is poised to drive the next wave of innovation and impact. “For Indian startups, the opportunities are immense,” he said. “The country’s diverse and demanding healthcare landscape serves as fertile ground for developing solutions that can drive global transformation. While healthcare challenges vary across regions, innovations proven effective in India have the potential to address critical healthcare needs worldwide. The time is ripe for positioning India not just as a participant but as a launchpad for scalable, world-class innovations that can make a significant global impact,” added Dandwate. Typically, new technologies take time to penetrate the healthcare industry and gain a patient-centered focus. The experts noted that the AI wave, which began in recent years, is being recognized for its potential in the health sector. Padmini Janaki, CEO and co-founder of the health tech company Mind and Mom, noted the growing understanding of AI’s ability to bring meaningful improvements. “Patients, doctors, and healthcare providers are becoming more open to its applications. I see 2025 as the year of widespread acceptance for AI and technology in healthcare,” she said. Surjeet Thakur, Founder & CEO of TrioTree Technologies, notes that India's healthcare market, valued at over $370 billion in 2022, is projected to exceed $610 billion by 2026. “This growth is driven by increased private equity and venture capital investments, which exceeded $1 billion in the first five months of 2024—a 220% rise from the previous year. Key areas attracting investment include healthcare delivery, pharmaceuticals, and health-tech innovations. The preventive health-tech sector, for instance, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21%, reaching a market size of $197 billion by 2025. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare is anticipated to reach $1.6 billion by 2025, enhancing diagnostics and patient care.” Health tech founders reflected that 2024 was a challenging year for startups across sectors, including healthcare and pharma. “However, it also underscored the resilience and strategic vision of organizations dedicated to innovation and meaningful impact,” said Dandwate. He added that although many startups faced funding constraints, companies with a clear vision, robust foundation, and focus on tangible outcomes demonstrated that even the most turbulent times can be navigated successfully. ALSO READ What is the MagRail Booster? How it could improve bulk cargo movement at Deendayal Port Overweight older adults fare better after surgery According to Dandwate, 2024 highlighted the importance of prioritizing scalable, impactful innovations that address real healthcare challenges. Looking ahead, Dandwate predicted a growing demand for healthcare services in tier-2 cities, driven by key hospital acquisitions in 2024, signalling a shift toward decentralizing access to quality care. “Consolidation within the hospital market and the rapid expansion of hospital bed capacity underscore the sector’s readiness for large-scale transformation. Additionally, the eldercare and chronic care management markets are experiencing unprecedented growth, fueled by India’s ageing population and the rising prevalence of long-term health conditions. Health insurance penetration is on an upward trajectory, though it still offers immense opportunities for expansion,” he explained. Dr Santosh Bhargav D.B., co-founder and director-CTO of SpOvum Technologies, noted that 2025 promises to be a pivotal year for witnessing significant strides in personalized medicine. “To fully leverage the potential of AI analytics, robotics, and genomics in healthcare, we need scalable solutions that foster collaboration, address real-world challenges, increase accessibility for all, and ultimately improve health outcomes for individuals and communities,” he said. Dr Bhargav observed that robotics and automation in embryology will improve precision and scalability, time-lapse imaging systems will enhance clinical decision-making, and AI-powered remote consultations will expand access in underserved areas. “Genomic integration in treatments will further revolutionize personalized care,” he said. Janaki, meanwhile, highlighted the potential for significant growth in preventive healthcare in 2025. “Until now, healthcare was often seen through a reactive lens—people visited doctors only when unwell or facing a problem. However, this mindset is shifting. With advancements like AI, though it’s just one tool, people are increasingly focusing on prevention and longevity. It’s not just about living to 80 or 90 years but living those years healthily and vibrantly,” she said. This shift was driving interest in preventive measures, starting with basics like regular blood tests and proactive health monitoring. She cited the growing popularity of health rings, watches, and other tracking devices as reflections of this increased awareness. According to Dr Bhargav, the ‘Make in India’ initiative will play a transformative role in this journey, driving domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge medical technologies and fostering an ecosystem of innovation. “By promoting local production of advanced medical devices, eco-friendly materials, and sustainable practices, the initiative aligns with global ESG standards while creating cost-effective solutions tailored to India’s unique healthcare needs,” he added. However, health tech experts cautioned that challenges persisted in the sector. “Patient safety remains undervalued across the industry, compromising outcomes and escalating costs. Technology adoption, though improving, still lags behind expectations, with only 35% of Indian hospitals currently utilizing EMR systems. Addressing these gaps is essential to unlocking the full potential of healthcare innovation,” Dandwate asserted.

Indeed, it has emerged as one of the best investment opportunities in 2024, with investors increasingly being drawn to innovations in diagnostics and treatments that tackle critical health challenges while offering robust financial returns. The cancer crisis in India: A growing concern India faces a cancer burden. Alarmingly, it is now being detected in younger populations, a shift driven by lifestyle changes, environmental factors, and limited awareness of preventive measures. Despite these challenges, India’s healthcare infrastructure remains underdeveloped, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This gap highlights the urgent need for investment in critical healthcare, particularly in early detection technologies. Bridging these gaps presents an unparalleled opportunity for profitable healthcare investments that combine purpose with profit. Previu Health: Transforming cancer care Previu Health is one such company that is transforming cancer diagnostics with its solutions.

Richard Brown , health coverage , health industry , health insurance , health insurance companies , healthcare , Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America Health insurance companies have been growing in influence since the professionalization and centralization of American healthcare in the early 20th century. By the 1970s, health insurance companies had begun challenging other corporate interests for more economic and political power over the medical industry. The unrestrained influence health insurance companies have over medicine has driven healthcare spending up to catastrophic levels – and employers expect costs to keep increasing in 2025. Health insurance companies continue to prioritize profits by shifting the burden of costs onto hospitals and patients through a variety of strategies, including denying claims and leaving hospitals with billions in unpaid medical bills. The dominance of health insurance companies in the American healthcare industry is one of the major reasons for massive health spending – and its roots can be traced to the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Without significant reforms, healthcare costs are expected to continue surging into 2025 . This is according to the book "Rockefeller Medicine Men: Medicine and Capitalism in America" by E. Richard Brown . First published in the late 1970s, the book chronicles the history of American healthcare and the massive growth in spending that Americans at the time were already experiencing – an average of around $4,300 per person in 1979, adjusted for inflation . Brown argues that, in the late 19th century, American medicine remained decentralized: Medical professionals lacked power, wealth and status, and the state of healthcare was determined by its distance to sources of power and wealth, making it heavily fragmented and at times ineffective and poorly regulated, with low earnings for healthcare practitioners. (Related: Mike Adams calls for DECENTRALIZATION of America's collapsing health care system .) From the 1900s to the 1930s, medicine entered an era of massive change, becoming a tightly controlled profession through licensure, accreditation and the growing influence of the American Medical Association and the groundbreaking changes brought about by the 1910 Flexner Report which reported on the poor state of medical education in the United States. Physicians started gaining higher incomes and started gaining a higher social standing due to the sudden exclusive nature of medicine and the fact that this new generation of medical professionals were solidly in the middle and upper classes. By the 1970s, physicians reached the top of America’s class structure, with median incomes placing them in the top percentiles. They became highly trusted and, Brown argues, ranked alongside Supreme Court justices in occupational status. However, soon the authority of medical professionals started getting challenged by corporate interest groups, namely hospitals, medical schools , government agencies seeking to rationalize and bureaucratize healthcare and, most importantly, health insurance companies. Lack of control over health insurance companies leading to massive growth in healthcare costs Hospitals, now under the purview of special interests, especially health insurance companies, became central to healthcare, consuming 40 percent of health expenditures. At the same time, health insurance companies started gaining significantly more economic and political influence. The unrestrained influence of health insurance companies in American healthcare has led to the massive explosion in healthcare costs – and U.S. employers only expect costs to increase. In 2025, employers reportedly are bracing for an eight percent increase in costs, according to a survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. This projection surpasses the seven percent increases seen in 2022 and 2023, signaling a continued upward trend in healthcare expenses. Furthermore, health insurance corporations are figuring out new strategies to further shift the burden of spending to hospitals and patients . Excessive prior authorization, fail-first policies and nearly insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles not only prevent patients from receiving care, but it also shifts the burden of spending away from insurers all the while driving up healthcare costs. One report indicated that more than half of all hospitals in the U.S. have more than $100 million each in accounts receivable for claims older than six months, and over a third of American hospitals have reported over $50 million in foregone payments because of denied claims .

ARTICLE 30 December 2024 Client Alert: Compliance Date Approaches For HIPAA Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule FL Feldesman Leifer More Contributor Explore Firm Details As the December 23, 2024, compliance date approaches for the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule ("Final Rule")... United States Food, Drugs, Healthcare, Life Sciences Dianne Pledgie To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. As the December 23, 2024, compliance date approaches for the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule ("Final Rule"), below are three areas where HIPAA covered entities, including health centers and behavioral health care providers, should focus: Identify the protected health information (PHI) related to reproductive health care in your organization : The Final Rule requires covered entities and business associates ("HIPAA regulated entities") to obtain an attestation when they receive a request for PHI potentially related to reproductive health care when the care is lawful and when the request is for certain purposes (described below in more detail). The Final Rule defines reproductive health care as "health care...that affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes" (45 C.F.R. 160.103). Covered entities should identify the PHI they consider to be related to reproductive health care. Such PHI might be identified by ICD-10 code (encounters for contraceptive management, general counseling and advice on contraception, etc.), by provider type (OBGYN) or by the type of visit (gender affirming care). Understand reproductive health care that is legal in your state and develop a procedure for tracking changes at the state and federal level: Under the Final Rule, HIPAA regulated entities are prohibited from using and disclosing PHI related to reproductive health care for investigations and imposing liability when the reproductive health care: Is lawful under the law of the state in which the health care is provided; Is protected, required or authorized by Federal law, including the U.S. Constitution; or Was provided by another provider and fits within the presumption of lawfulness. For multiple reasons, covered entities should provide clear guidance to staff on the types of reproductive health care that are legal in your state and on the federal level (for example, contraception) and designate a process for tracking changes and challenges to the lawfulness of such care. Changes may come through state and federal law and regulation, and challenges may come through lawsuits at the state and federal levels. Attestation requirement: HIPAA regulated entities are required to obtain an attestation when they receive a request for PHI potentially related to reproductive health care when the request is for the purposes of health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, and disclosures to coroners and medical examiners. To comply with this requirement, HIPAA regulated entities should develop an attestation form and procedure. Earlier this year, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released a model attestation . The procedure may be part of a separate policy and procedure or may be incorporated into current procedures on disclosures for health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, and disclosures to coroners and medical examiners In early December, OCR sent an email reminding HIPAA regulated entities about the compliance date for most provisions of the Final Rule. It is not yet clear whether the Final Rule will survive the current legal challenges ( see State of Texas v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, et. al. ) or how it will be modified by the incoming Trump Administration. HIPAA regulated entities should stay tuned for updates from OCR via their webpage on HIPAA and Reproductive Health . To support health centers in meeting their compliance requirements, the Confidentiality for Health Centers Toolkit has been updated to include the following: New document: Attestation for Use and Disclosure of PHI Potentially Related to Reproductive Health: Sample Policy and Procedure Revised documents: Disclosures about Victims of Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence: Sample Policy and Procedure Uses and Disclosures for Health Oversight Activities: Sample Policy and Procedure Disclosures for Judicial and Administrative Proceedings: Sample Policy and Procedure Disclosures for Law Enforcement Purposes: Sample Policy and Procedure Uses and Disclosures about Decedents: Sample Policy and Procedure Designation and Authority of Personal Representatives: Sample Policy and Procedure Contents of the Notice of Privacy Practices: Sample Policy and Procedure The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Dianne Pledgie

Dr. Boateng highlighted how the integration of AI and big data analytics is revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnostics, treatment planning, and disease management. He explained that as healthcare systems face increasing pressure to enhance efficiency and accessibility, AI has emerged as a crucial tool to address these challenges. Dr. Boateng, also an AI researcher, noted in a media interaction that his work in medical diagnostics—particularly the creation of SqueezeCapsNet, an advanced AI framework—positions him at the forefront of this transformative process. He explained that SqueezeCapsNet enhances diagnostic accuracy, enabling the early detection of diseases such as pneumonia, cancer, and COVID-19. This reduces diagnostic errors and expedites treatment decisions. Dr. Boateng underscored how AI empowers healthcare professionals with data-driven insights, leading to improved patient outcomes and cost reduction. Beyond diagnostics, he noted that AI models are used for patient monitoring and predictive analytics, identifying high-risk individuals and facilitating preventive care. Moreover, Dr. Boateng emphasized the profound economic impact of AI in healthcare, noting that it automates routine tasks, reduces operational costs, and allows medical staff to focus on critical care. Additionally, he highlighted how AI technologies support telemedicine, extending quality healthcare to rural and underserved areas. This aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which focuses on Good Health and Well-being. Dr. Boateng concluded that his groundbreaking research serves as a testament to the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, ensuring healthier communities and a more efficient medical infrastructure.

Article Content:
As we step into 2025, the healthcare market is poised for notable changes, influenced significantly by evolving lifestyle patterns. Increasing awareness about the impact of daily habits on health is encouraging people to adopt more proactive approaches to their well-being. This shift from focusing solely on treatment to emphasising prevention is gradually shaping the industry. Demand for solutions such as wearable health monitors, fitness applications, and wellness programs is on the rise. Alongside advancements in medical technology, these changes are paving the way for a more consumer-driven and personalised approach to healthcare. Increased focus on preventive health and wellness Consumers are becoming more proactive about their health, emphasising preventive measures over-reactive treatments. This shift is driven by a growing awareness of the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent chronic diseases. The wellness industry is responding with products and services that promote longevity and overall well-being. For instance, the popularity of health-tracking devices and supplements aimed at enhancing life quality is on the rise. Adoption of digital health technologies The integration of technology into daily life has led to the widespread adoption of digital health tools. Telehealth services, wearable fitness trackers, and mobile health applications enable individuals to monitor their health in real-time and access medical consultations remotely. This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the convenience and necessity of remote healthcare services. The telehealth industry, for example, has seen substantial growth and is expected to continue expanding, offering cost-effective and accessible healthcare solutions. Emphasis on mental health There is a growing recognition of the importance of mental health, leading to increased demand for mental health services and support. Employers and healthcare providers are prioritising mental well-being, integrating mental health services into primary care, and offering digital mental health platforms. This focus is reshaping healthcare offerings to include comprehensive mental health support, acknowledging its integral role in overall health. Personalised and consumer-centric healthcare Consumers are seeking personalised healthcare experiences tailored to their individual needs and preferences. This demand is driving the healthcare market towards more customised services, including personalised medicine, individualised wellness programs, and patient-centred care models. The shift towards consumer-centric healthcare is fostering a more responsive and adaptable healthcare system that prioritises patient satisfaction and outcomes. Rise in health-conscious consumer behaviour Post-pandemic, consumers are more intentional about their spending, focusing on products that offer immediate and long-term health benefits. This behaviour is evident in the popularity of wellness trends and products that promote health and balance. The wellness industry is thriving, with consumers seeking products and services that enhance their quality of life, indicating a shift towards health-conscious consumption. Ageing population and chronic disease management The ageing global population is increasing the prevalence of chronic diseases, necessitating effective management strategies. Lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, are essential in managing and preventing chronic conditions. Healthcare providers are focusing on integrated care models that address the complex needs of older adults, emphasising preventive care and lifestyle interventions to enhance quality of life. Integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and streamlining administrative processes. AI-driven healthcare information delivery is becoming more prevalent, providing patients with tailored health guidance and improving overall healthcare delivery. The integration of AI is expected to continue shaping the healthcare landscape, offering innovative solutions to complex healthcare challenges. Shift towards value-based care There is a growing emphasis on value-based care, which focuses on patient outcomes rather than the volume of services provided. This approach encourages healthcare providers to offer high-quality, efficient care that improves patient health. Lifestyle changes that promote health and prevent disease are integral to value-based care models, aligning incentives with positive health outcomes. Health policy and regulatory changes Health policies are evolving to support the integration of technology in healthcare and to address rising healthcare costs. Regulatory changes are facilitating the adoption of telehealth and remote patient monitoring, enabling more flexible and accessible healthcare delivery. Staying informed about policy developments is crucial for healthcare providers and consumers to navigate the changing healthcare landscape effectively. Economic factors influencing healthcare access Economic considerations, including rising healthcare costs and inflation, are influencing consumer behaviour and access to healthcare services. Employers and policymakers are seeking strategies to manage costs while ensuring access to quality care. Lifestyle changes that reduce the risk of chronic diseases can alleviate some of the economic burdens associated with healthcare, highlighting the importance of preventive health measures. In a nutshell, lifestyle changes are set to influence the healthcare market in 2025 significantly. A focus on preventive health, the adoption of digital technologies, increased attention to mental health, and consumer-driven demand for personalised care are among the key factors driving this transformation. The healthcare industry is adapting to these changes, striving to provide accessible, efficient, and patient-centered care to meet the evolving needs of society.

Title: Biden administration proposes new cybersecurity rules to limit impact of healthcare data leaks

AJ Vicens December 27, 2024 at 5:39 PM 1 Copied By AJ Vicens (Reuters) -Healthcare organizations may be required to bolster their cybersecurity, to better prevent sensitive information from being leaked by cyberattacks like the ones that hit Ascension and UnitedHealth, a senior White House official said Friday. Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters that proposed requirements are necessary in light of the massive number of Americans whose data has been affected by large breaches of healthcare information. The proposals include encrypting data so it cannot be accessed, even if leaked, and requiring compliance checks to ensure networks meet cybersecurity rules. The full proposed rule was posted to the Federal Register on Friday, and Department of Health and Human Services posted a more condensed breakdown on its website. The healthcare information of more than 167 million people was affected in 2023 as a result of cybersecurity incidents, she said. The proposed rule from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS would update standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and would cost an estimated $9 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in years two through five, Neuberger said. "We've made some significant proposals that we think will improve cybersecurity and ultimately everyone's health information, if any of these proposals are ultimately finalized," an OCR spokesperson told Reuters late Friday. The next step in the process is a 60-day public comment period before any final decisions will be made. Large healthcare breaches caused by hacking and ransomware have increased by 89% and 102%, respectively, since 2019, she said. "In this job, one of the most concerning and really troubling things we deal with is hacking of hospitals, hacking of healthcare data," Neuberger said. Hospitals have been forced to operate manually and Americans' sensitive healthcare data, mental health information and other information are "being leaked on the dark web with the opportunity to blackmail individuals," Neuberger said.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways By AJ Vicens (Reuters) -Healthcare organizations may be required to bolster their cybersecurity, to better prevent sensitive information from being leaked by cyberattacks like the ones that hit Ascension and UnitedHealth, a senior White House official said Friday. Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters that proposed requirements are necessary in light of the massive number of Americans whose data has been affected by large breaches of healthcare information. The proposals include encrypting data so it cannot be accessed, even if leaked, and requiring compliance checks to ensure networks meet cybersecurity rules. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The full proposed rule was posted to the Federal Register on Friday, and Department of Health and Human Services posted a more condensed breakdown on its website. The healthcare information of more than 167 million people was affected in 2023 as a result of cybersecurity incidents, she said. The proposed rule from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS would update standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and would cost an estimated $9 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in years two through five, Neuberger said. "We've made some significant proposals that we think will improve cybersecurity and ultimately everyone's health information, if any of these proposals are ultimately finalized," an OCR spokesperson told Reuters late Friday.

Innovation Mobile Threats, AI Innovation, Third-Party Risks: Trends Shaping Healthcare In 2025 By Fran Rosch , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Dec 27, 2024, 07:00am EST Share Save Fran Rosch is the CEO of Imprivata, a digital identity company for life- and mission-critical industries. getty Despite ramping up cybersecurity investments, a March 2024 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report found that healthcare systems experienced a 264% increase in ransomware attacks over the previous five years. Healthcare spends the most compared to other industries when remediating attacks, with the average cost of a data breach in healthcare exceeding $9.7 million . These attacks also lead to disruptions in care, risks to patient safety, compliance infractions and reputational damage. As the industry continues navigating this rapidly evolving landscape in 2025, the situation will only worsen unless organizations can effectively improve cybersecurity. To be truly effective while working with limited budget and resources, healthcare IT and security leaders will look to innovate with solutions that make improving security simple—with technologies like passwordless authentication, mobile devices, AI and third-party security rising in popularity. Increasing Health IT Budgets Signal Push For Digital Maturity I attended the CHIME24 Fall Forum, a conference led by the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) that brings together digital health leaders to develop initiatives to advance healthcare. At the conference, CHIME released its 2024 National Trends Report evaluating the progress of digital health in the U.S. The findings predicted a future with greater IT budget allocations, more focus on cybersecurity and infrastructure, and continued expansion in technology use to improve healthcare outcomes and efficiency. As I spoke to healthcare professionals about their organizational challenges and initiatives, I was left with an overarching takeaway: Healthcare organizations, now more than ever, need simple and effective security. With increased health IT budgets, it's crucial for organizations to not just invest in technology but to do so strategically by tailoring their cyber strategy to healthcare's unique and complex characteristics. The Need To Enhance Efficiency, Mobility And Security A 2024 Verizon report found that mobile malware and phishing attacks targeting devices have increased , with attackers exploiting weaker defenses on these platforms. This is a growing concern for IT and security leaders, especially as a 2024 Ponemon Institute research report we sponsored found that 64% of healthcare organizations are unable to protect data and privacy by locking down devices between each use. Security measures must secure access to protected health information (PHI) without impeding the workflow of clinicians. However, this is a delicate balance to achieve, as security protocols effective in other sectors may not be suitable for a healthcare environment. The Ponemon report found that only 40% of healthcare organizations described the end-user experience on mobile devices as satisfactory. AI Innovation Takes Center Stage To no surprise, GenAI has become a widely popular time-saving tool, being used in many ways like clinical decision-making and predictive analysis. However, GenAI also raises concerns about data privacy breaches due to the large amounts of sensitive patient data needed to utilize it. In addition to GenAI, all forms of AI are becoming more pervasive in healthcare, underscoring the need for greater education about the risks and opportunities associated with it. For example, AI and machine learning (ML) tools can be leveraged to improve threat detection and response times. However, with so many unknowns surrounding this new technology, any AI strategy must be carefully tailored to the unique cybersecurity and compliance needs of the healthcare industry, being mindful of stringent regulatory requirements like HIPAA. Vendor Security Is Paramount The CHIME report also underscores the need for improved vendor security in healthcare, as recent supply chain attacks indicate. From vendors to partners to contractors, third parties are a vital and inevitable part of today's business environment. While all industries use vendors, healthcare is especially reliant on help from outside vendors given the global shortages of healthcare staff and other resources. Each of these interactions introduces potential vulnerabilities, especially if third-party providers do not adhere to stringent cybersecurity practices themselves. The increasing reliance on third parties for critical services amplifies the risk of breaches through external entities, as 56% of organizations reported having experienced a third-party data breach in 2022. Yet despite the significant and acknowledged risk, more than half of organizations say they do not have effective controls for mitigating third-party access risk. Preparing Healthcare For The Threats Of Tomorrow, Today As healthcare organizations adapt their tech strategy for the trends of 2025, it is paramount for IT and security teams to collaborate cross-functionally with clinicians during this process. This is essential to ensure any technology deployed to enhance security is tailored to meet the unique clinical workflow needs required for patient care. For instance, while complex passwords are a common cybersecurity best practice, they slow down clinicians who may access the electronic health records (EHR) system and other applications hundreds of times per shift. Each access requires authentication, and if this involves manually typing a username and complex password on a mobile device, it can create barriers and frustrations. To overcome these challenges, IT teams should look for solutions that streamline and secure access. Passwordless authentication can help by eliminating the need for time-consuming logins. IT teams should ensure their access management strategy is capable of enforcing identity-based security policies, monitoring device usage and ensuring compliance. Tools leveraging AI and ML can also help organizations make informed decisions about workflow improvements by providing visibility into user behaviors and system usage. This includes addressing failed login attempts, adoption issues and user efficiency—which can help track security risks, drive technology adoption and save on IT operational costs. This ultimately contributes to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. To address the risks that an increased reliance on vendors introduces, healthcare organizations must adopt a comprehensive vendor access management strategy. This should include a rigorous vetting and procurement process and a thorough security assessment for any new vendor. Organizations can also reduce risk by considering vendor consolidation where possible as well as implementing strict access controls, monitoring third-party activities and employing the principle of least privilege access. By taking a strategic, collaborative approach, the healthcare industry can build a resilient environment that protects patient data, ensures compliance and maintains trust—safeguarding patient care and organizational reputation.

This staggering growth highlights the rapid adoption of innovative technologies and the increasing demand for accessible, personalized healthcare solutions. Having developed mobile apps for the healthcare domain, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges involved—and what it will take for mobile health tech companies/telehealth companies to succeed moving forward. Key Trends In Digital Healthcare Platforms One of the main trends in the mobile health app space is arguably telehealth. For a large number of patients, telehealth is their preferred way to seek care. According to one study , 43% of U.S. adults with healthcare visits in 2022 turned to telemedicine. Some of the biggest names in the mobile health app space offer a way for patients to manage at least some aspects of their care virtually, such as by enabling them to check their symptoms and access a physician directory and by giving them a way to quickly access their medical records and more. Another significant trend in the health app space? The use of artificial intelligence. I foresee that increasingly, AI will be leveraged by health apps. For example, some mobile health apps are leveraging AI to scan user’s bodies and pinpoint issues, such as potential skin cancer . Recognizing The Limitations Of Health Apps Health apps can help patients. In particular, telehealth and AI alike have various benefits in patient care. However, health apps have their limitations as well. For instance, not every medical issue is diagnosable virtually, and AI won’t always provide accurate scan results. Health apps can offer great starting points for care, but patients should not solely rely on them. Predictions For The Future Of Digital Healthcare Platforms Technology and other factors are shaping the industry’s future: 1. AI-Powered Diagnostics AI in healthcare is projected to grow at a CAGR of 38.5% between from 2024 to 2030. AI stands to significantly contribute to diagnostics, with AI tools analyzing data with greater speed and accuracy to predict health conditions early and aid with decision-making. 2. Seamless Telehealth Integration The telehealth market was estimated to be valued at $101.15 billion in 2023—and from 2024 to 2030, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.3% . Virtual consultations, IoT devices, and remote monitoring systems stand to revolutionize care, making hybrid healthcare models the norm and reducing patient wait times. 3. Personalization Through Big Data The global healthcare analytics market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 21.1% from 2024 to 2030, enabling platforms to deliver hyper-personalized care. Big data will provide actionable insights, ensuring patients receive tailored treatment plans. In turn, this can improve patient outcomes. 4. Blockchain For Data Security Blockchain in healthcare is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.3% from 2024 to 2030. This technology will revolutionize data security, ensuring patient records are immutable and accessible across interoperable systems, reducing breaches. 5. The Rise Of Preventive Care Wearable tech, which accounts for a significant portion of the digital health market, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2023 to 2030. These devices, paired with predictive analytics, will empower individuals to monitor health metrics and prevent chronic conditions, potentially significantly reducing hospital visits. 6. Expanded Mental Health Solutions The mental health app market, valued at $6.25 billion in 2023, is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 15.2% from 2024 to 2030. Virtual therapy and AI-powered mental wellness tools will make mental health support more accessible, addressing the global mental health crisis . 7. Integration With Insurance And Payments The global healthcare IT market, including payment and claims processing, has an expected CAGR of 15.8% from 2024 to 2030, and can simplify administrative processes and improve cost transparency. Real-time pricing tools will help reduce unexpected healthcare expenses, a key pain point for many patients. 8. Global Accessibility Digital healthcare platforms are closing the healthcare gap in underserved regions. Mobile-first platforms are expected to increase global access , bringing essential services to rural and low-income areas. 9. Sustainability Through Smart Systems The healthcare industry’s carbon footprint (which data indicates is “ between 4.4 and 5.2 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions ”) can be reduced significantly through smart platforms. By adopting AI and automation, healthcare systems could lower operational costs and environmental impact. Patient-Centric Approach: Empowerment And Protection As health apps move into the future, in addition to focusing on solving the right problems, being patient-centric and providing integrated solutions, they should keep patient empowerment and protection top of mind. Patient empowerment comes down to education. Health apps should connect patients with the resources they need to make informed decisions about the next steps in their care, such as offering in-app guides to different conditions, live chat options with registered nurses, robust technical support and so forth. As for patient protection, health apps should do their due diligence to make sure they are in full compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws, such as HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe. Ultimately, by taking a patient-first approach as they design and implement their health apps, health apps can create solutions that help vast amounts of people get the care they need in an accessible way.

Article Content:
Written by Eddie Canales Interview View Article in Online Reader Interview: Dr George Cheriyan, CEO and Chief Medical Officer, American Mission Hospital In what ways is the transformation of health care in Bahrain improving delivery and raising standards? DR. GEORGE CHERIYAN: Recent advancements in Bahrain’s health care infrastructure have significantly raised standards and quality. Facilities like the King Hamad University Hospital, and specialised cardiac and cancer care centres enhance the provision of specialised medical services across the kingdom. These institutions provide centralised, high-quality care for critical health issues and embody the integration of advanced technological practices that are pivotal for future health care delivery. At the same time, we are at a moment when the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies marks an inflection point in health care, fostering a shift towards more predictive, pre-emptive and personalised services. This evolution will enable a transition from traditional in-hospital care to community-based health management, emphasising preventive health and patient-centric home care. Which benefits do you foresee from the increased involvement of the private sector in health care? CHERIYAN: The trend towards privatisation in Bahrain’s health care sector has the potential to bring several benefits, especially in enhancing service quality and resource management. As the government increasingly delegates routine and specialised health care services to the private sector, there is an opportunity to alleviate the financial and operational burden on public resources, allowing the government to concentrate on managing more complex health issues. Moreover, privatisation is expected to drive competition among providers, improving service quality and patient care standards. This competitive environment fosters a higher standard of care, encouraging a more patient-centric approach. This type of approach is aligned with global best practices and enhances the overall attractiveness of Bahrain’s health care system as a model of efficient and effective service delivery. In which ways are new technologies boosting the development of health care services? CHERIYAN: Technology enhances connectivity, convenience and cost efficiency. Integrating AI and digital technologies, such as telemedicine and remote monitoring, is crucial for the next phase of Bahrain’s health care evolution. These technologies ensure continuous patient engagement and personalised care, streamline operations and predict health care needs – fundamentally changing patient interactions. Future developments should focus on expanding these technologies to cover more aspects of health care, thereby improving the user experience and system integration. How do you assess private health care in Bahrain as a destination for investment? CHERIYAN: The health care sector presents an attractive landscape for investment, bolstered by government initiatives aimed at privatisation and enhancing infrastructure. The private sector is set to play a greater role, with the government looking to decentralise health care services and shift more responsibilities to private entities. This transition allows for a greater focus on efficiency and quality in service delivery, making the sector appealing to local and foreign investors. However, given the country’s relatively small size and population, the health care market does not have room for a high number of players. This necessitates strategic and innovative investment to ensure sustainability and profitability. Mergers and acquisitions could offer opportunities for consolidation, creating more robust and financially stable entities capable of competing and thriving in a competitive market. Furthermore, there is potential for developing specialised services that cater to both the local population and the regional market. Such specialisations can attract investment and foster the growth of centres of excellence, which in turn are able to serve as models for high-quality health care provision across the region.

IoT: Connecting Patients, Devices And Providers IoT refers to a network of connected devices that exchange data seamlessly, allowing for real-time insights. In healthcare, IoT bridges the gap between patients, providers and healthcare systems. Real-Time Patient Monitoring IoT-enabled devices such as wearable sensors, smartwatches and implantable monitors are transforming patient care. These devices continuously track health metrics like heart rate, blood glucose levels and oxygen saturation, providing patients and providers with real-time data. For example, a patient with a cardiac condition can use a wearable device to monitor their heart rhythm. If irregularities are detected, the device sends an alert to both the patient and their physician, enabling early intervention. Such solutions not only empower patients but also reduce the need for frequent hospital visits. Smart Medical Equipment IoT is also enhancing hospital operations. Connected infusion pumps can adjust medication dosages automatically based on patient vitals, minimizing errors. IoT-enabled hospital beds monitor patient movement, notifying staff of potential risks like falls or pressure sores. This technology ensures patient safety while allowing healthcare professionals to focus on more critical tasks. Medication Adherence One of healthcare’s persistent challenges is ensuring patients adhere to prescribed treatments. IoT-enabled devices such as smart pill bottles track whether medications are taken on time and send reminders when doses are missed. These solutions support better compliance, improving outcomes for patients with chronic conditions. AI: Turning Data Into Insights And Action While IoT collects data, AI provides the intelligence needed to interpret it. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of information to identify patterns, predict risks and recommend personalized treatments. Predictive Analytics For Early Intervention AI excels at predictive analytics, using data from IoT devices to anticipate health issues before they become critical. For instance, AI can analyze data from wearable heart monitors to predict the likelihood of a heart attack, enabling proactive care. Similarly, AI-powered imaging tools can detect early signs of diseases like cancer, improving survival rates through timely diagnosis. Personalized Treatment Plans AI’s ability to process complex data enables it to create customized treatment plans. By analyzing IoT data alongside medical records and genetic profiles, AI can recommend therapies tailored to individual patients. For example, a rehabilitation patient might use an IoT-enabled device to track their progress. AI analyzes this data and adjusts the therapy regimen in real time, optimizing recovery. This personalized approach ensures better outcomes and enhances patient satisfaction. Streamlining Operations AI is also revolutionizing hospital operations by optimizing workflows. Predictive models help hospitals anticipate patient volumes, manage staffing and allocate resources efficiently. In a world where healthcare systems are stretched thin, AI provides much-needed support to deliver care at scale. From My Experience Having worked closely with life sciences and MedTech organizations for almost two decades, I have witnessed firsthand how these technologies are reshaping healthcare. One project that stands out involved integrating IoT devices for remote patient monitoring. By combining IoT with AI-driven predictive models, we enabled care teams to detect early warning signs for chronic diseases, reducing hospital readmissions by over 30%. This experience reinforced the potential of these technologies to deliver not just operational efficiencies but also significant improvements in patient outcomes. The integration of IoT and AI is not just a technological advancement—it’s a shift toward patient-centric care. For a deeper dive into the transformative impact of IoT and AI on MedTech, I recommend the “Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Healthcare AI Market Report” by Frost & Sullivan. This report highlights how these technologies are driving innovations across patient monitoring, diagnostics and hospital management. Sources project a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.5% for the IoMT market by 2028, emphasizing the rapid adoption and expansion of these tools in healthcare systems worldwide. A Smarter Healthcare Landscape IoT and AI are redefining what is possible in MedTech. They are moving healthcare from a reactive model to a proactive, personalized and efficient system. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to deliver smarter, more accessible care to patients worldwide. The digital prescription is clear: IoT and AI are not just transforming healthcare—they are saving lives. The MedTech revolution is here, and its impact will be felt for decades to come.

'Catalyst': Luigi Mangione's supporters brave 11-degree arctic blast to air healthcare grievances Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Monday. By Peter Charalambous December 23, 2024, 9:01 PM Manhattan, New York -- As Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to murder charges in Manhattan Criminal Court this morning, protesters from all walks of life assembled outside the courthouse to show their support for the alleged killer. While their reasons to bear the 11-degree weather varied -- including personal healthcare issues, concerns about inequality and distrust of the media -- they were seemingly united in their support for the 26-year-old whose alleged actions have ignited a nationwide conversation about healthcare. Pushing her 1-year-old son, Emmanuel, in a stroller, 37-year-old Alicia Thomas from the South Bronx said her experience giving birth while on Medicaid helped her relate to Mangione's grievances with the healthcare industry. Suffering from a postpartum hemorrhage, she said she wanted to spend more than two days in the hospital after giving birth but couldn't afford care beyond what Medicaid provided. People demonstrating against the healthcare industry stand outside Federal Criminal Court as Luigi Mangione, suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, appears during an arraignment hearing, Dec. 23, 2024, in New York. Charly Triballeau/POOL/AFP via Getty Images Thomas said she believes Mangione is innocent -- framing him as a victim of the healthcare industry and justice system -- but said his case has brought light to the need to improve healthcare. "It sparked a catalyst to think about what kind of world we are going to leave our children," she said, showing a Justo Juez prayer candle she plans to light for Mangione. "Our generation has seen so much devastation throughout the years, and our children are going to suffer at the hands of corporate greed." Prosecutors allege that Mangione meticulously planned and carried out the murder of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel on the morning of Dec. 4 before fleeing the state to Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days later at a McDonald's. According to the federal complaint, Mangione was in possession of a notebook in which he expressed hostility to healthcare executives, described the insurance industry as his target because it "checks every box," and laid out his intent to "whack" Thompson at UnitedHealthcare's investors conference. While Mangione did not have family in court on Monday, about two dozen women attended the arraignment in the public section of the gallery, many of them voicing support for Mangione. "This is a grave injustice, and that's why people are here," one of the women, who said she arrived at the courthouse at 5 a.m., told ABC News. Outside court, protestors rallied for Mangione, chanting "Eat the rich," "Hey, hey, ho, ho, these CEOs have got to go," and "Free, free Luigi." Nicholas Zamudio, 33, said he came to the protest after spending over $100,000 out of pocket for his treatment after an electric injury in 2021. Holding a sign that read "United States Healthcare Stole My Livelihood. Prosecute Malicious Profiteers," Zamudio said he doesn't know if he will be able to afford his ongoing treatment for nerve damage. "I don't have insurance, I've drained my 401K. I've drained everything that I have, and come January I will be trying to keep a roof over my head by couch hopping amongst friends. I've lost everything and that's what brought me out here," he said. MORE: Luigi Mangione's attorney blasts police, mayor for using the accused CEO killer as 'political fodder' Zamudio said he found comfort in Mangione's writings about his spinal injury, noting they both received similar spinal fusion operations. "He talked about not being able to sleep, laying in pain, things like that," he said. "I guess a lot kind of resonated with me in regards to the pain and not getting help with the healthcare system. I think murder is obviously wrong, but it did bring us to a point we needed to get to." Law enforcement has raised concerns about the outpouring of support for Mangione and hostility towards healthcare industry since Thompson's killing, with multiple police bulletins warning about the increased risk to healthcare executives. UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty appeared to acknowledge the public sentiment, writing in an opinion essay in the New York Times earlier this month that he "understand people's frustrations" with healthcare and vowed to "to find ways to deliver high-quality care and lower costs."

No employees — be they the people who answer customer calls or nurses who visit patients in their homes — should have to fear for their and their loved ones' safety," Witty wrote. While the specifics of Mangione's grievances with the healthcare injury remain unclear -- and we do not know if his personal issues with the healthcare system motivated his alleged actions -- many of the protesters came to their own conclusions about what motivated the alleged killer. A 26-year-old woman from Queens who preferred to go unnamed said she related to Mangione after she fell off her parent's healthcare plan and couldn't afford COBRA coverage. Having gone uninsured for months, she said she believes the healthcare system is broken based on her inability to find a good plan despite days of effort calling different insurance companies. Protestors hold signs outside of Manhattan Criminal Court on December 23, 2024, in New York City. Adam Gray/Getty Images "I spent an entire month -- 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with three phones in front of me -- waiting on the phone on hold to get access to these people. They put me through circles and circles and circles," she said. Another woman from Brooklyn said she came to court because she believed Mangione was bringing attention to the need for universal healthcare in the United States . She added that she didn't trust the media coverage of Mangione's case and wanted to see the proceedings with her own eyes to draw conclusions. "There was a lot of support from where we were in the back [of court]," she said after attending the arraignment in person. "I believe it's a conversation that a lot of people are having now, and whatever we can do to help progress this conversation is worthy of participating in." Bill Dobbs, who lives in Manhattan, said he was motivated to support Mangione after federal prosecutors charged the 26-year-old with a crime that carries the death penalty. He held a sign that read "Justice not Vengeance." "It's very alarming there could be a death penalty," he said. "Punishment has got to leave a chance for change, and the death penalty doesn't." MORE: Defense fund established by supporters of suspected CEO killer Luigi Mangione nears $200K Mangione's disdain for the healthcare industry only added to his reasons to support the alleged killer, Dobbs said. "What's going on in the private healthcare industry is scandalous," he said. While most of the protestors said they believed Mangione was innocent, their support for Mangione carried an implicit incongruence -- Is Mangione an innocent victim or a martyr for confronting the healthcare industry through his alleged actions? Many protestors who spoke with ABC News reconciled the beliefs by referencing the plague of mass shootings impacting the United States, claiming that the attention on Mangione and terrorism label is evidence of a broken justice system. "He's an alleged shooter, but how many school shooters are labeled with terrorism. How many?" asked one protestor.

Title: Health care looks cheap going into 2025 . How to play it with options

Article Content:
Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu The health-care sector is looking cheap heading into 2024, but uncertainty looms in the new year as the Trump administration takes the reins. We'll describe an options play to capitalize on the price action as 2025 kicks off. Over the past 10 to 20 years, the health-care sector in the United States has grown significantly relative to the broader economy, as measured by its share of gross domestic product. Health-care spending accounted for approximately 15.7% of U.S. GDP in 2003. Over the next 10 years, that share grew by roughly 1.7% to 17.4% of GDP in 2013. Today, it is estimated to be about 18.4% of GDP, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates health-care spending could represent approximately 20% of U.S. GDP by 2030. This steady increase reflects the growing demand for health-care services, advancements in medical technology and rising costs. An aging population — baby boomers entering retirement — significantly increases demand for health-care services, and longer life expectancies have led to more years of health-care utilization. Another important cause of increased costs is the burden of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity, which also drives higher health-care costs, and the latest innovations in diagnostics, treatments and pharmaceuticals tend to be more expensive. XLV YTD mountain The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) in 2024 Expanding insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid increased access to health care. Most would agree that's a good thing. However, as demand for goods and services increases, so do prices. Hospital services, physician fees, prescription drug prices, and administrative expenses have often outpaced those in other sectors of the economy. Macroeconomic, political, and regulatory factors, not just demographics, influence the profitability of health-care stocks. The health-care industry's percentage of the economy has grown, and health-care companies' revenue growth has outpaced that of the broad market over the past five years, up nearly 61% versus revenue growth of just over 38% for the S & P 500 overall during the same period. However, the sector has materially underperformed the broad market index, which benefited from the explosive growth in the technology sector. As 2025 approaches, investors may ask themselves: If the health-care sector is growing faster than the economy, why have these stocks underperformed, and does this represent an opportunity to play the group as a possible catch-up trade in the new year? As the charts above reveal, part of the problem is margins. Profit margins within the health-care sector have fallen over the past five years and are now well below the 20-year average. Another concern? President-elect Donald Trump and some of those closest to him, such as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have emphasized cost-cutting and "efficiency." The burden of health-care expenses may rank highly on the cost-cutting agenda. The health-care sector has underperformed the S & P 500 by more than 10% since the presidential election. Indeed, the incoming Trump administration's efforts to curb government spending and improve efficiency could have mixed effects. Streamlining approval processes at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could expedite drug and device launches, benefiting innovative companies. Tax cuts and deregulation could boost profitability and cash flow across the sector. On the other hand, reduced government health-care spending could pressure hospitals, Medicare-reliant companies and insurers. Pushback on drug pricing and efforts to curb wasteful expenditures could hurt profit margins, especially for large pharmaceutical companies. Uncertainty regarding the Affordable Care Act, long a target for Republicans on Capitol Hill, could create unpredictability for insurers. The options trade On balance, if an investor assumes that well-managed companies can stabilize margins here, or better yet, even return them to 6% or so, still well below the long-term average, the sector looks cheap relative to the broad market. Of course, while fundamentals are important from a long-term investing perspective, they are not a very good short-term trading signal, and the short-term technicals, as of Friday's close, remain weak. A call calendar offsets the cost of a longer-term purchase by selling nearer-dated calls against it. This strategy anticipates the price action to be range-bound in the near term. If technicals improve, one might adjust the short strikes higher when it comes time to roll or hold the long call position, depending on the technical setup.

John B Hewitt/Shutterstock Elena Vaughan , University of Galway Author Elena Vaughan Research Fellow, Health Promotion Research Centre (HPRC), University of Galway Disclosure statement Elena Vaughan received funding from the Irish Research Council for her research on HIV stigma in Irish healthcare settings. Partners University of Galway provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.xqeg9qspj Speaking at the 16th International Aids Conference in 2006, the then UNAids executive director, Peter Piot , remarked: “Since the beginning of the epidemic, stigma, discrimination and gender inequality have been identified as major causes of personal suffering, and as major obstacles to effective responses to HIV.” Now, in the fourth decade of the HIV crisis, this statement remains largely true. Despite the leaps and bounds that have been made in the treatment and prevention of HIV, stigma and discrimination continue to harm the lives of people living with HIV, and hinder efforts to stem the epidemic globally. HIV today: a changed landscape HIV is now an extremely treatable condition with excellent outcomes. Those living with HIV who are on treatment can expect to live a healthy life with a normal lifespan . Crucially, medications are so effective that they reduce the amount of the virus in the body to undetectable levels. This means people living with HIV cannot pass on the virus to others – a condition known as “U=U”, or undetectable equals untransmittable . The evidence supporting this is robust and spans over 20 years . The most comprehensive evidence for U=U stems from the Partner and Partner II studies, which aimed to determine the risk of transmission between HIV positive and HIV negative partners when the positive partner is virally suppressed. These large observational studies tracked a combined 2,020 couples – both heterosexual and gay – over several years of follow-up. Between the two studies, participants reported 134,000 acts of condomless sex, however no HIV transmissions between couples were recorded. The evidence was incontrovertible and study authors concluded the risk of transmission when a person is virally suppressed is zero. This is extremely reassuring for people living with HIV, who can feel confident that they cannot pass the virus on to their partners. It is also good news for public health, with the World Health Organization endorsing the U=U message and affirming the importance of treatment as a vital preventative tool in the ongoing HIV epidemic. Stigma: a persistent obstacle Despite these extraordinary medical advancements, HIV-related stigma remains a persistent obstacle that negatively affects the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV . The first European-wide community survey of people living with HIV , published by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) in 2023, reported that among the 3,272 respondents, one in three had not told a single family member their diagnosis for fear of rejection. In the same study, a third of respondents also reported experiencing stigma in healthcare settings, with almost a quarter reporting having healthcare refused or delayed as a result of their HIV status. A subsequent ECDC study of HIV-related stigma among over 18,000 European healthcare workers, published in July 2024, found that almost two-thirds worried about drawing blood from patients with HIV and a quarter reported using double gloves with such patients. That HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings is so prevalent and commonplace is particularly troubling. Such experiences create distrust between people living with HIV and their healthcare providers This can lead people living with HIV to avoid attending healthcare services, which has obvious knock-on effects for health. Moreover, there is evidence that experiences of HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings are associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral medication and treatment failure. This is bad for individual health, but also may have negative impacts on public health , given that treatment is such a vital prevention tool. Reducing HIV stigma in healthcare settings A range of factors including fear of HIV, negative attitudes, lack of policies and a lack of training of healthcare workers can drive HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. In Ireland, where my research is based, as part of a wider project in 2022 we carried out a survey of 295 healthcare workers to measure stigma in Irish healthcare settings. Our findings , published earlier this year, provide tentative new evidence for the potential of the U=U message to reduce HIV-related stigma. Like other studies, we found that fear of HIV was a major driver of stigma in healthcare settings in Ireland. Just over half of our survey respondents said they would worry about drawing blood from a patient living with HIV, and over a quarter reported using special measures they would not use with other patients, such as double-gloving. What was unique about our study was that, for the first time, we also measured knowledge of U=U among healthcare workers. We found that, while other factors were relevant, knowledge of U=U was the most powerful protective factor against fear of HIV and stigmatising behaviour. In other words, healthcare workers who are confident in the U=U message are much less likely to stigmatise against people living with HIV. Stigma is a complex social phenomenon, and no single intervention will be fully effective against it. However, our research suggests that increasing awareness and acceptance of U=U would be an effective, low-cost and scalable action that might inch us closer to a stigma-free future.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the composition of the committee to develop a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI) in the Financial Sector, on December 26. The nation’s central bank had announced the committee on December 6 as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies. While the bank noted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) had the potential to automate complex processes and improve efficiency, it came with risks like algorithmic bias and data privacy. “To harness the benefits, it is critical to address the attendant risks early in the adoption cycle,” said the RBI. Accordingly, the committee was set up to “recommend a robust, comprehensive, and adaptable AI framework for the financial sector.” The committee would include the following members: Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay (Chairperson) Ms. Debjani Ghosh, Distinguished Fellow, NITI Aayog; Independent Director, Reserve Bank Innovation Hub; and Ex-President, NASSCOM Dr. Balaraman Ravindran, Professor and Head, Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI, IIT Madras Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India Rahul Matthan, Partner, Trilegal Member Anjani Rathor, Group Head and Chief Digital Experience Officer, HDFC Bank Ltd. Sree Hari Nagaralu, Head of Security AI Research, Microsoft India (R&D) Suvendu Pati, CGM, FinTech Department, Reserve Bank of India (Member Secretary) The terms of reference for the committee are: To assess the current level of adoption of AI in financial services, globally and in India. To review regulatory and supervisory approaches on AI with focus on financial sector globally. To identify potential risks associated with AI, if any and recommend an evaluation, mitigation and monitoring framework and consequent compliance requirements for financial institutions, including banks, NBFCs, FinTechs, PSOs, etc. To recommend a framework including governance aspects for responsible, ethical adoption of AI models / applications in the Indian financial sector. Any other matter related to AI in the Indian financial sector. Background: This development comes as the government is moving to regulate AI with greater scrutiny, especially in the financial sector. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently informed Regulated Entities (RE) that they would be fully responsible for any AI programs the develop or deploy, including data privacy, compliance with existing laws and even the output of such models. The agency had previously asked Investment Advisers and Research Analysts who used AI tools to reveal the extent of the usage to clients. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has also opened a second round of bids for projects under the “Safe & Trusted AI” pillar of the government’s IndiaAI mission. This is after it selected eight proposals during the first round.

slider html RBI Sets Up 8-member Committee on Ethical Use of AI in Financial Sector Moneylife Digital Team 26 December 2024 0 To bookmark you need to sign in Economy & Nation The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the setting up of an eight-member committee to develop a framework for responsible and ethical enablement of artificial intelligence (FREE-AI) in the financial sector. In the December monetary policy review, RBI's former governor Shaktikanta Das mentioned setting up the committee on FREE-AI , especially looking at the rapid transformation in the financial sector enabled by technologies such as AI, tokenisation, and cloud computing. The FREE-AI committee will be headed by professor Pushpak Bhattacharyya from the department of computer science and engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B). The committee will assess the current level of adoption of AI in financial services globally and in India. Other members in the committee include Debjani Ghosh (distinguished fellow of the NITI Aayog and independent director of Reserve Bank Innovation Hub), Dr Balaraman Ravindran (professor and head, Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI, IIT Madras), Abhishek Singh, (additional secretary in the Union ministry of electronics and information technology-MeitY), Rahul Matthan (Partner at Trilegal), Anjani Rathor (group head and chief digital experience officer of HDFC Bank Ltd), and Sree Hari Nagaralu ( head of security for AI research at Microsoft India (R&D)). Suvendu Pati, the chief general manager (CGM) in RBI's financial technology (fintech) department, is the member secretary of the committee. The committee on FREE-AI will also review regulatory and supervisory approaches to AI, focusing on the global financial sector.

Dr. Ernest Addison, Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) BoG Governor explains UT, Capital Bank license revocations Richard Osei Boateng Business News Dec - 24 - 2024 , 13:21 The Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG), Dr. Ernest Addison, has attributed the revocation of licenses for UT Bank and Capital Bank to stringent reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise Ghana's financial sector. Speaking at the Governor’s Day dinner organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers, Dr. Addison revealed that the IMF had identified critical weaknesses in the banking system and set specific "prior actions" as prerequisites for financial assistance. Among these conditions was the dissolution of the two banks. “The IMF requires certain actions to be completed before even convening a board meeting to discuss a country’s situation or release funds,” Dr. Addison said. “One of these prior actions was the revocation of licenses for UT Bank and Capital Bank. This was unprecedented for many Ghanaians and came as a shock.” The two banks had their licenses revoked in August 2017, the same year Dr. Addison took over as Governor. He explained that the decision, though difficult, was necessary to prevent further destabilization of the financial sector. Dr. Addison further noted that the financial sector cleanup, which included the closure of several distressed institutions, has strengthened Ghana's banking system. He credited these reforms with enabling the sector to withstand external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Title: BSI Predicts National Sharia Finance Will Break IDR 3 . 430 Trillion by 2025

REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- PT Bank Syariah Indonesia Tbk (BSI) predicts Islamic banking will grow positively in 2025. This is supported by the prospect of growth in the distribution of financing and the accumulation of third-party funds (DPK) to double digits. It is estimated that next year, the national sharia financial sector will grow to IDR 3,430.9 trillion. Chief Economist of PT Bank Syariah Indonesia Tbk (BSI) Banjaran Surya Indrastomo said that sufficient economic development throughout 2024 could be the basis for maintaining the positive growth of the national economy in 2025.

Aset Perbankan Syariah Segera Capai Rp 1.000 Triliun Although the world economy is still faced with the threat of economic turbulence and geopolitical uncertainty, he believes that the national economy, including the sharia economy in the country, has strong potential to continue the growth trend. “By 2025, the national sharia financial sector is expected to grow to the range of IDR 3,157.9 trillion - IDR 3,430.9 trillion from the asset side,” Banjaran said at the Sharia Economic Outlook 2025 event at BSI The Tower Building on Monday (23/12/2024). For the record, the realization of sharia financial assets in September 2024 was at the level of IDR 2.744 trillion, or up 11.9 percent year-on-year/yoy. Banjaran believes that the sharia financial sector is also expected to continue positive growth, amid the challenges of the domestic economy in 2025, with the sharia banking sector being the main driver. Amid this positive outlook, Banjaran said, BSI as Indonesia's largest sharia bank has strong potential to become a major actor driving the movement of the sharia finance industry and the national halal economy by 2025. Because, he said, since its birth, BSI has consistently performed the functions of more than just a sharia bank with its intermediary function, but rather beyond banking. “During this time, BSI has played an active role in connecting and moving the national halal economic ecosystem. By strengthening its role, as well as innovations that continue to be developed, BSI can further strengthen its role in moving the financial sector and the national economy. This role is increasingly important as that (global) economic turbulence still looms,” he said. On the same occasion, BSI Director of Treasury & International Banking Ari Rizaldi said, 2025 will be the momentum for BSI to continue growing. This is not separate from the uniqueness factor that Indonesia's largest sharia bank has. “One of BSI's greatest opportunities is in the halal business, this which needs to be enhanced and deepened as a form of BSI's active and positive role for economic growth domestically and even globally,” he said.

ENTERPRISE How the cybersecurity landscape affects the financial sector by Jenny Darmody 18 Dec 2024 Save article Image: © Deenanath/Stock.adobe.com The team at William Fry take a closer look at upcoming cybersecurity regulations and what they mean for the financial sector. Cyberattacks continue to cause problems for companies in every sector, from tech companies to critical infrastructure. If personal data is affected by a cyberattack, companies must notify the relevant data protection authority and inform those affected under GPDR and these obligations are widening further under the NIS2 Directive and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). So, what does all this mean for the financial sector, which holds significantly valuable personal data and has a reputation for lagging behind when it comes to technical adoption? Claire O’Connor, a senior associate in the technology department of William Fry, says the evolution of cybersecurity laws has forced the financial sector to significantly enhance its capabilities in this space. “The Central Bank of Ireland published a guidance paper in 2016 outlining its expectations on IT and cybersecurity governance, focusing on risk management and resource allocation. The GDPR has been in effect since 2018 and imposes strict data protection requirements for personal data,” she said. “DORA will come into effect on 17 January 2025 and further mandates that financial entities in scope implement comprehensive ICT risk management standards, ensuring preparedness against cyberthreats.” Despite these advancements, O’Connor said challenges remain, especially with the continuous need to adapt and the ongoing training and awareness needed. “Overall, while Ireland’s financial sector’s ability to handle cybersecurity threats is improving through improved systems and procedures as well as these legal and regulatory obligations, ongoing vigilance is essential to sustain resilience in a constantly changing landscape,” she said. “In our experience, organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to hire individuals with the skillsets they need in terms of IT and cybersecurity.” The impact of DORA With DORA coming into effect in January 2025, the financial services sector must raise their standards significantly. Conor Forde, an associate at William Fry, said the current third-party framework consists mainly of regulatory guidelines from the Central Bank of Ireland and the European supervisory authorities. “While non-compliance with such guidelines would cause difficulty in ensuring resilience and mitigating outsourcing risks, such guidelines are not generally mandatory law,” he said. This differs from DORA, which is a sector-specific legislation that covers a wide range of financial entities and mandates that they implement robust ICT risk management frameworks. “The DORA regulation also introduces strict incident reporting obligations, compelling financial entities to report significant ICT-related incidents to national authorities, which fosters greater transparency and quicker regulatory responses,” said Forde. “By aligning with existing regulations like the GDPR and the NIS2 Directive, DORA creates a cohesive framework for cybersecurity across the financial sector.” For financial entities and third-party ICT service providers, this means putting in place comprehensive contractual arrangements that align with DORA’s requirements, including service level agreements, requirements around subcontracting, security standards, audit and incident reporting protocols. “This complexity can be particularly daunting for smaller providers, who may lack the financial and human resources to facilitate these requirements,” said John O’Connor, a partner at William Fry. “It is therefore essential for financial entities to engage with their third-party ICT service providers without delay ahead of the 17 January 2025 deadline.” Forde added that while some of DORA’s requirements may be familiar to financial entities that have had to comply with regulations such as the Central Bank of Ireland cross-industry guidance on outsourcing, and the European Banking Authority guidelines on outsourcing arrangements, it goes much further in its contractual provisions. “Notably, DORA also introduces the requirement to include mandatory contractual provisions for ICT services which do not support critical or important functions, which is a novel aspect of the regulation,” said Forde. “DORA enhances existing standards by mandating a more structured approach to third-party risk management.” O’Connor said that DORA provides a comprehensive framework for managing third-party ICT risks in the financial sector. “By focusing on third-party risk management, DORA not only protects individual institutions but also enhances the stability of the entire financial ecosystem,” he said. “This holistic approach represents a significant evolution in regulatory expectations, compelling financial entities to prioritise operational resilience and cybersecurity in their dealings with third-party services, ultimately seeking to enable a more secure financial services environment.” Don’t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) launched the new Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), in line with the Third Financial Sector Strategy, and as a continuation of the QCB's ongoing efforts to develop the payment systems infrastructure in Qatar to keep pace with the latest technical developments. This system is part of the pioneering initiatives that the QCB is working on to upgrade the payment and financial transfer system in the country, as it represents a qualitative shift in Qatar's financial infrastructure, which increases the flexibility and efficiency of the financial system. The Real-Time Gross Settlement system plays a vital role in Qatar's banking sector, as it is the core banking system that processes and settles financial transactions between banks directly. It complies with the latest international messaging standards ISO 20022 to enhance technical integration between banks. The system also aims to improve the efficiency and speed of financial transfers and liquidity management in Qatar's banks to increase operational efficiency and add more flexibility to the banking system in general in light of technological developments, which have resulted in banking and financial services that require keeping pace with this progress by developing an infrastructure for payment systems that ensure the speed of implementation of financial settlements, transfers and banking transactions, while maintaining the highest standards of financial safety and stability.

New Delhi, Dec 11 (PTI) Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran on Wednesday said there is a need to differentiate between regulation of financial and non-financial sectors as competition in financial sector can lead to excessive risk taking and bring instability. "We do need to make a distinction between regulation with respect to financial sector and regulation with respect to non-financial sector of the economy," Nageswaran said at the CII Global Economic Policy Forum 2024. He said in non-financial sector, except in case of natural utilities where one needs a regulator to protect customer interest, competition or market forces will take care of what the regulators do. In financial sector, regulators have the tendency to lean towards excessive regulations, as if things go wrong in this sector the state is expected to bail out and the effects are systemic. " In financial sector, competition sometimes leads to excessive risk taking and competition can be a source of instability rather than stability, which is not the case for non-financial sector of the economy. And the manifestation or climaxing of that was the 2008 global financial crisis," Nageswaran said.

Title: Meet the Best - Performing Low - Cost Vanguard ETF in 2024 . Here Why It May Still Be a Buy for 2025 and Beyond .

Article Content:
Mutual fund giant Vanguard Group offers over 60 equity-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are ETFs for growth stocks, value stocks, and dividend stocks. Some ETFs focus on small-cap shares, while others focus on mega-caps. Some ETFs invest in momentum and others are more balanced. You may think that Vanguard's best-performing ETF in 2024 holds a lot of Nvidia stock, such as the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF , which has a whopping 12.5% weighting in Nvidia. And while that ETF is up a lot on the year -- 31% at the time of this writing -- an even better-performing ETF has been the Vanguard Financials ETF ( VFH +0.45% ) which invests purely in the financial sector. That's right, and its top holdings are stodgy blue chip stocks like JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway . And yet, the ETF is up some 37% year to date. Here's why the financial sector could still be worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. Meteoric rise The financial sector had a rocky 2023, driven by the March 2023 banking crisis that saw some small to midsize banks fail and pressure the entire sector. The Vanguard Financials ETF was down 2.9% through the first three quarters of 2023. But in the last quarter, it roared 14.9% higher and carried that momentum into 2024. Since Oct. 1, 2023, the ETF is up a staggering 57.2%. It's rare to see a traditionally value- and income-driven sector rally this much in a relatively short period of time. But there's reason to believe the rally is justified and could even carry momentum into the new year. An earnings-driven rally The financial sector is being driven by earnings growth and valuation expansions. Across the sector, price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios have gone from being below their historical levels to being at or above their historical levels. The following table shows the P/E ratios of top payment processors and investment banks -- which are all top 10 holdings in the Vanguard Financials ETF. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio 3-Year Median P/E Ratio 5-Year Median P/E Ratio 7-Year Median P/E Ratio 10-Year Median P/E Ratio Mastercard 40.3 36.8 36.6 38 40 36.8 Visa 32.4 28.1 30.7 32.1 33.2 32.6 American Express 22.4 22.5 17.1 17.8 18 16.4 Goldman Sachs 17.9 16.4 12.2 11.5 11.6 12 Morgan Stanley 20.1 18 14.6 12.6 12.2 12.3 Data source: YCharts. For the most part, the forward P/E ratios of the payment processors are around their historical averages. Still, there has been a noticeable valuation expansion from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have gone from sector laggards to leaders. The new administration could bring lower regulations and encourage more dealmaking, mergers, and acquisitions -- and that could lead to a sustained boom for the investment banking industry. Here's a look at the P/B ratios of top diversified banks and Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway. Company P/B Ratio 3-Year Median P/B Ratio 5-Year Median P/B Ratio 7-Year Median P/B Ratio 10-Year Median P/B Ratio Berkshire Hathaway 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 JPMorgan Chase 2.2 2 12 2.1 1.9 Bank of America 1.3 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.5 Wells Fargo 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.6 Citigroup 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Data source: YCharts. All five companies have P/B ratios right around their historical ranges. A year ago, many of these companies traded at a discount to their averages. In sum, the financial sector was dirt cheap but has since caught up and become more reasonably valued -- but not necessarily overvalued. 2024 was the perfect storm for the financial sector to take off because it was undervalued and entered a period of rapid expansion across multiple industries within the sector. A good value in an otherwise expensive market From diversified banks to payment processors, investment banks, asset managers, insurance companies, and financial services companies, the entire financial sector is thriving right now. With the exception of Bank of America, the top 10 holdings in the Vanguard Financials ETF are all within just 3% of their all-time highs. JPM data by YCharts Buying a stock or an ETF at an all-time high can feel counterintuitive because it goes against our instincts to buy at a discount. And yet, the sector remains a surprisingly good value. The Vanguard Financials ETF sports a P/E ratio of 18.6 and a dividend yield of 1.7%. For context, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500 -- has a P/E ratio of 30.2 and a yield of 1.3%. Other traditionally value-oriented and income-producing pockets of the market have also gotten more expensive. The Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF has seen its P/E ratio soar to 28.4 and its yield drop to 2.6%. Even the Vanguard Utilities ETF now yields under 3% and has a P/E ratio of 25.5. Valuations across virtually every sector have gone up. And since stock prices are outpacing dividend growth rates, sector yields have also fallen . So while the financial sector isn't as cheap as it used to be, it's definitely not overvalued compared to the rest of the market. The Vanguard Financials ETF remains a balanced buy With just a 0.1% expense ratio, the Vanguard Financials ETF offers a fairly inexpensive way to invest in the financials sector. This industry is an excellent way to gain exposure to continued economic growth. But keep in mind that it could also be prone to a sell-off if there is an economic downturn. Credit card companies would be hit hard if transaction volume and frequencies decline. Diversified and investment banks could face declining profits or returns on equity if consumers and companies struggle to afford their expenses or asset values fall. The cyclical nature of the financial sector and a history of noteworthy crashes are the primary reasons it tends to trade at a discount to the broader market. It's a similar dynamic as the energy sector, where oil and gas companies often sport inexpensive valuations because of their dependence on commodity prices and vulnerability to fluctuations in earnings. Still, the Vanguard Financials ETF could be a good buy even at an all-time high because it remains a good value, and many companies are delivering record earnings with few signs of slowing down.

November 25, 2024 Call For Public Comment: A Report on AI Use in the Financial Sector Zvi Gabbay , Avishay Klein , Masha Yudashkin Barnea Jaffa Lande & Co. + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: This month, an interim report on artificial intelligence in the financial sector was published for public comment. The report was written by the Ministries of Justice and Treasury, the Competition Authority, the Securities Authority, the Capital Market Authority, and the Bank of Israel. The report includes first-of-their-kind recommendations regarding regulation of the use of AI technology in the financial sector. The report is open for comments until December 15th. General Approach and Principles for Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Sector The report centres on encouraging innovation and AI adoption, while addressing associated risks and establishing appropriate regulation as needed. It proposes adopting flexible regulatory tools that can respond to technological developments, such as administrative directives and temporary regulations, alongside granting discretion to supervised entities to implement self-regulation tools. According to the report’s authors, Israeli regulation should adapt to global regulation in the field, while avoiding establishing a local standard. The report advocates for a risk-based approach and removing unnecessary regulatory barriers, with the aim of encouraging a competitive, innovative, and efficient market. Additionally, the report reviews challenges in the field of artificial intelligence generally, unique risks related to the financial sector, and impacts in three activity areas – investment consulting and portfolio management, credit in the banking system, and insurance underwriting. We have previously outlined the general risks of AI use by companies in the legal guide published this year. Artificial Intelligence Challenges in the Financial Sector The report outlines unique challenges of AI in the Financial sector: Financial Stability Risks – Reliance on a limited number of common artificial intelligence models by various players in the financial sector could potentially lead to a situation where many actors operate similarly and potentially impair independent and diverse decision-making capabilities. This also means that during an operational failure in these systems, many actors may be compromised, creating widespread impact on the sector. Report Recommendations : to continuously monitor AU use and map sensitive activities relying on AI, while ensuring relevant regulation. Cyber and Fraud Risks – AI could potentially serve as a tool for spreading disinformation and financial fraud, through the use of deep fakes or other impersonation methods. Report Recommendations : to expand regulatory monitoring and oversight of these risks, guiding financial entities in risk mapping and increasing public awareness. Risk to Competition – Using artificial intelligence systems may enhance market concentration and create entry barriers for new actors, especially in where a few suppliers control base model development. Report Recommendations : Strengthen fair competition practices in accordance with competition laws and improve access to information required for AI model training, to ensure equal opportunities and market concentration reduction. Discrimination and Individual Harm – errors due to AI use could lead to significant damages to customers relying on AI data processing. For example, credit request rejections, incorrect suspicious transaction identification, AI-based trading preferences, and more. The team recommends promoting solutions to examine AI outputs for reducing biases and discriminatory results. Financial Sector recommendations The report focuses on three financial domains: investment consulting and portfolio management, banking system credit, and insurance underwriting. Investment Consulting and Portfolio Management AI can reduce costs and make consulting and portfolio management services accessible to a broader audience. Report Recommendations: Encourage investment consulting and portfolio management license holders to integrate AI technology in their activities to increase accessibility to financial services. Add a chapter in online services guidelines addressing contemporary AI technology and examine chatbots’ activity in investment consulting and portfolio management. Promote research to examine the behavior AI systems users to understand technology’s impact on investor behavior. Banking Credit AI applications in credit are used, among others, for customer needs identification, underwriting, and credit rating. In some cases, this represents an evolution of existing models, however, given AI’s operation, there are concerns about discrimination alongside aggressive credit marketing to customers. Team Recommendations: To minimize risks of discrimination and exclusion, the report recommends clarifying that AI uses are not exempt from existing law, and financial institutions must ensure that before using AI tools, they have the means to strictly adhere to the regulatory requirements. The report recommends that companies include AI issues in their corporate governance process to realize management and board responsibility regarding unique risks. Implementing data review processes used to determine credit risks is essential to ensure data privacy and use of only relevant data in training processes. Insurance Underwriting AI can streamline underwriting processes, premium pricing, and insurance coverage management, but raises transparency, privacy, and bias risks in automatic decisions. The report recommends adhering to general principles of existing regulation and updating it as needed. Next Steps To ensure responsible integration of AI in financial services, the report recommends several important steps: Strengthen explainability for models requiring provision of reasoning, creating significant consumer risks or where reliance on AI in the decision is significant. Ensure human involvement in the decision-making processes where relevant. Ensure notification and disclosure about the use of AI tools and their impact on the consumer services or products. Enhance personal data protection in AI uses. Prevent discrimination in service, credit, and insurance provision. Expand financial entities’ responsibility towards their customers to include activities performed through AI. Develop risk assessment and corporate governance mechanisms that enable fair and transparent AI activity, including establishing oversight mechanisms, creating relevant policy documents, and appropriate vendor assessment. Recommendations for Financial Sector Companies We recommend all financial sector companies to not wait, and take steps to ensure responsible and safe AI use, including: Map and identify AI processes in use within the organization. Conduct a risk assessment regarding these uses. Formulate internal policy for AI use and identify the stakeholders responsible for its implementation. Implement protective measures to ensure responsible and fair system activity.

Europe Spain’s devastating floods cost financial sector over $20B Bank of Spain estimates 0.2 percentage point decline in Spanish GDP after floods in Q4 Senhan Bolelli | 20.11.2024 - Update : 21.11.2024 MADRID Spain’s devastating floods, especially in the Valencia province, cost the country’s financial sector over $20 billion, according to the Bank of Spain. The eastern and southern regions of Spain were hit by floods on Oct. 29 and the damage caused to the financial sector is estimated to be around €20.5 billion ($21.6 billion), while some 561,210 people were directly affected by the floods. Bank of Spain Governor Jose Luis Escriva said the total cost of the disaster to the financial sector is equivalent to 1.8% of the total loan volume of Spanish banks, noting that the bank has no concerns for the Spanish financial sector. Escriva said that, of the $21.6 billion, $14.2 billion was for homes and $7.4 billion was for businesses. The process of recovering banknotes soaked or damaged by the floods continues, while the first deposit of some 22,700 banknotes is worth $760,100. He mentioned that 9% of ATMs in the flood zones were out of service and 37 of 298 damaged banks were still closed, though the use of credit cards is slowly returning to normal after the cash withdrawal chaos at the beginning of the floods. The Bank noted that the floods are likely to result in a 0.2 percentage point decline in Spain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter. The autonomous Valencian Community’s government requested $33.1 billion in aid for damages in its region alone, while the Spanish central government has decided to provide a total of $14.7 billion in two packages so far. The death toll from the floods reached 226 since Oct. 29, while 13 people are still missing. *Writing by Emir Yildirim Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Home Business Islamic banking a must for financial system Experts call for aligning banking practices with Islamic values GOHAR ALI KHAN November 15, 2024 2 min read facebook twitter whatsup linkded email PHOTO: FILE KARACHI: Shariah scholars, bankers and business leaders have called for the promotion of Islamic banking by offering interest-free loans. They argue that Islamic banking has become unavoidable in the current financial landscape when various countries are forming alliances to safeguard their economic interests, strengthen their currencies, and elevate their economies to new heights. Speaking at the Islamic Banking Seminar, organised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) at the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industries (HCST&SI) Secretariat, BankIslami Pakistan senior Shariah scholar Mufti Noman emphasised that only financially strong Muslims could build a strong Islamic society. "Islamic banking is necessary for society as it operates free from interest, gambling and unethical practices. In contrast, conventional banking is interest-based and, therefore, incompatible with Islamic ethics," he said. He pointed out that according to the Federal Shariat Court's ruling, all commercial banks in Pakistan must switch to the Islamic banking system by December 2027. Mufti Noman urged the alignment of banking practices with Islamic values, adding that the banking sector in Pakistan was swiftly moving towards Islamic banking. The SBP has taken revolutionary steps and this year alone it has received over 1,000 applications for branch conversions into Islamic banking. Islamic banking operates on a profit-and-loss-sharing basis, with mechanisms like Murabaha, Salam and Istisna contracts governing asset and service exchanges, while Mudarabah and Musharakah are used to share both profits and losses. Acknowledging that all the suggestions given by the HCST&SI were valuable, SBP Deputy Director Adil Zahoor said the central bank was working tirelessly to promote Islamic banking through revolutionary initiatives. He noted that the concept of Islamic banking had already been adopted by many Muslim countries, while Pakistan was still in the implementation phase. Speaking on the occasion, HCST&SI President Muhammad Saleem Memon remarked "as Muslims, conducting interest-free trade is our duty, with no room for compromise. Islamic banking has become an essential need of the time, with its growing trend worldwide." He stated that Islamic banking could be immensely beneficial for Pakistani traders and industrialists, offering non-interest financial services aligned with Islamic principles, which could enhance trade and allow the business community to expand their activities through Halal means. HCST&SI Vice President Shan Sehgal pointed out that despite the launch of numerous schemes by the SBP and National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) for the welfare of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many bank staff members lacked knowledge of the schemes, preventing traders and the public from accessing them. He said any policy formulated by the central bank had a direct bearing on the business community. Therefore, it is essential to give traders representation in the SBP board of directors to allow them to provide critical recommendations for policy formulation. facebook twitter whatsup linkded email COMMENTS (1) Muhammad Sabir Shaikh | 11 months ago | Reply Still it is difficult for SUE S to get Business loans from Islamic Banks need good and easy excess between Islamic Banks and entrepreneurs for interest free Business loans Replying to X Saved !

Title: Global alliance of banks supports fossil fuel treaty at COP29

Article Content:
Baku, Nov 14 : As the UN climate conference (COP29) is underway in Baku in Azerbaijan, the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) on Thursday announced that 25 of its member banks have endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty initiative, marking the first collective endorsement of the initiative by financial institutions. The treaty is a proposal for a global binding plan to end the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and manage a global transition away from fossil fuels. Founded in 2009, the GABV is a network of 70 sustainable banks operating across all major world regions, united by a mission to "finance change and change finance". By endorsing the proposal for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, these 25 GABV members are urging the financial sector to take meaningful action in the fight against climate change by ending finance for fossil fuel expansion. They collectively manage $117 billion in assets and serve over 11.3 million people worldwide. The GABV's member banks represent some of the most ambitious examples of sustainable finance. For instance, Triodos Bank, the first bank in the world to sign up to the treaty initiative, has been the leading lender for clean energy projects for eight consecutive years. GABV members are setting ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions as early as 2035, demonstrating that sustainable finance is not only possible but essential. Martin Rohner, Executive Director, GABV said, "Despite frequent and often high-profile commitments, many mainstream banks continue to finance the fossil fuel industry, fuelling further unpredictable climate impacts. If the financial sector is serious about its sustainable commitments, it should support initiatives like the treaty that are creating real solutions to the crisis. "A treaty will help create a resilient business climate, built on a long-term perspective and a level playing field, which is in the interest of businesses and financial institutions wherever they are in the world." Tzeporah Berman, Chair and Founder of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: "The support from a growing number of banks for the Fossil Fuel Treaty reflects true leadership in the financial sector and a recognition that phasing out fossil fuels is not only desirable but achievable. "These visionary banks are boldly stepping up as leaders in the fight against the climate crisis, recognising their vital role in driving a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels." The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement recognised the financial sector as an enabler of the most ambitious climate-related goals. Since then, every COP (Conference of Parties) has explicitly referenced the financial system's role in supporting the just transition. Moreover, this COP29 has been dubbed the "Finance COP," marking the critical moment for wealthy countries to fund the fight against climate devastation.

Corporate 2 min read Bandhan Financial Services acquires global IT company Genisys Bandhan Financial Services Ltd (BFSL), promoter of Bandhan Bank, has ventured into the IT sector by acquiring Genisys group of companies for nearly Rs 100 crore. This strategic move aims to leverage technology for business solutions and enhance shareholder value. Genisys, specializing in AI-enabled solutions for various sectors, will operate under BFSL with expanded capabilities. Atmadip Ray ET Bureau Updated On Nov 5, 2024 at 10:51 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Bandhan Financial Services Ltd (BFSL), the promoter of Bandhan Bank, has acquired global information technology and business process services provider Genisys group of companies, which has its origin in London. This marks Bandhan group's strategic foray into the IT sector. It completed the acquisition just ahead of Diwali paying nearly Rs 100 crore in an all-cash deal, two people familiar with the matter said. "The entry into the technology sector is in confirmation with the applicable guidelines for core investment companies, which are allowed to invest in non-financial sectors," BFSL managing director Arvind Agrawal told ET. Advt " Bandhan Financial Services had surplus cash, which has been deployed to acquire the tech services group with an aim to enhance shareholders' value. Technology is something which integrates everything together. The potential for IT-driven solutions to address business challenges, especially in the banking and financial services sector, is enormous, and we anticipate significant growth in this area.” Agrawal said The IT services group had three separate companies under it -- Genisys Software Ltd (UK), Genisys Software Ltd (US) and Genisys Information Systems India Pvt Ltd. BFSL acquired the all three separately and has now brought them under one entity -- Genisys Information Systems India Pvt Ltd, which is located in Bengaluru and will become the head office. The London and New York units will be turned into subsidiaries of it. The IT group provides AI-enabled solutions to banking and financial services companies as well as to sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, retail & e-commerce, travel & hospitality, media, marketing & advertising. "With the support of the Bandhan Group, we can now expand extensively and build new capabilities, particularly in AI-driven solutions ," Genisys group chief executive Satish Subramaniam said. This is the third acquisition by BFSL but the first one in the non-financial sector. . In the previous two years, it acquired IDFC Asset management Company and Aegon Life Insurance respectively to broaden its interest in the financial services space. Advt Incidentally, the latest acquisition got completed after Bandhan group founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh was back in the fray as the chairman of BFSL about a month back. He retired from Bandhan Bank as managing director on July 9, this year. RBI regulation says that core investment companies would require prior approval from it for investing in the financial sector while there is no such rule for investment in the non-financial sector. The investment in the non-financial sector only needs to be reported to the regulator within a month of making it.

The limited effect is attributed to lower levels of debt holdings among banks and more favourable restructuring terms, with several impairments having already been booked in 2022. Banks also showed a strong recovery in financial performance for 2023. The report highlighted that in August 2023, the Ghanaian government restructured bond holdings of pension funds totalling GH¢30.01 billion in a separate arrangement. However, the review cautioned that ongoing external debt restructuring, especially concerning Eurobonds, could lead to additional impairments for banks and other participating financial institutions. “The regulatory reliefs implemented by financial sector regulators, alongside recapitalisation plans and the establishment of the Ghana Financial Stability Fund, will help cushion the financial sector from the impacts of the government debt operation,” the report noted. Furthermore, the Financial Sector Strengthening Strategy (FSSS), introduced in 2023, coordinates regulatory interventions to promptly address risks in the financial system. While the domestic debt restructuring has created fiscal space and lowered the debt-to-GDP ratio, further adjustments loom. On July 14, 2023, Ghana launched the second phase of its DDEP, which included the restructuring of GH¢8.1 billion in Cocoa Bills and $808.99 million in locally issued U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

UK Seeks to Boost Financial Sector Competition with New Reform By CPI | October 28, 2024 Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is set to emphasize the pivotal role of the financial sector and commit to reducing regulatory obstacles in her upcoming Mansion House speech on November 14. As part of the Labour government’s broader goal to bolster the UK’s international competitiveness, Reeves intends to reinforce support for finance firms, pledging concrete steps to make London a more attractive global financial hub.

Δ According to sources close to the Treasury, Reeves will also unveil fresh guidelines for the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) either during her address or shortly thereafter. These guidance documents, known as remit letters, aim to clarify how regulators should navigate their duties under a mandate to elevate the UK’s global financial standing. Insiders familiar with the policy discussions noted that the new instructions are intended to refine regulatory processes, making them less obstructive to business growth and more attuned to the sector’s competitive needs, per Bloomberg. In what promises to be a strategic pivot in Labour’s approach to the financial sector, Reeves’s address is widely seen as a crucial opportunity for the party to reset its relationship with finance leaders. Since taking office in July, Labour has had a mixed rapport with business heads, compounded by a recent Budget announcement that included tax hikes. Reeves’s November speech represents a chance for the government to demonstrate its commitment to fostering a vibrant financial sector. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has hinted at these forthcoming reforms, recently telling attendees at Labour’s international investment summit that his administration would be “marching through the regulators” to eliminate excessive bureaucratic constraints. This approach underscores Labour’s intention to streamline oversight while also creating conditions conducive to sustainable growth. Read more: UK Regulators Investigate Google’s Investment in AI Startup Anthropic Ambitious Reforms on the Horizon Building on measures initiated by the previous Conservative government, which introduced similar remit letters in December 2022, Reeves is anticipated to take an even more assertive stance. Her plan is expected to address potential overlaps in regulatory roles, as well as to cut unnecessary rules and costs that are hampering the industry’s expansion, according to sources who declined to be named. This could mark a significant shift from the traditional regulatory approach, emphasizing a more collaborative dynamic between government and financial institutions. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed, “At Mansion House, the chancellor will set out how she will work in partnership with industry and regulators to deliver growth. This will include providing the stability the financial services sector needs to grow and delivering the reform it needs to prosper.” The spokesperson added that Reeves’s vision includes aligning the sector’s expansion with broader investment goals that span the UK. There appears to be considerable support from industry executives for this “competitiveness regime,” as it is being called. However, some advocates are pushing for more aggressive measures, including the possibility of making competitiveness a central consideration in regulatory decision-making. Another proposed reform involves the reinstatement of the so-called “call-in” power—a controversial mechanism that would allow ministers to override regulatory bodies. Although dropped last year, insiders suggest that revisiting this power would require legislative changes and might not be immediately implemented, per Bloomberg. Consideration of Structural Changes Reeves’s speech may also address longer-term considerations, including potential structural shifts in the FCA and PRA. Labour reportedly examined the possibility of restructuring these regulatory bodies before the July general election, a move that could be re-evaluated if regulators are not seen as fully embracing the government’s competitiveness agenda. While opinions in the financial sector differ, with some advocating for a complete overhaul of regulatory structures and others favoring a more measured enhancement of existing rules, the objective remains clear: to support a financial ecosystem that can both compete internationally and fuel domestic economic growth.

Dr. Ernest Addison , Governor, BoG Audio By Carbonatix Phase 2 of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) had a relatively low impact on the 2023 audited financial performance of banks, then Bank of Ghana has disclosed in its 2024 Financial Stability Review. This is due to the lower levels of holdings and better restructuring terms. In addition, some impairments had already been booked by banks in 2022 while banks generally reported a strong rebound in financial performance in 2023. The report revealed that in separate arrangements, the Government of Ghana negotiated and restructured bond holdings of pension funds totalling GHS30.01 billion in August 2023. Looking ahead, it said the external debt restructuring, particularly, the Eurobonds, will have implications for further impairments by banks and other participating financial institutions. “The regulatory reliefs put in place by financial sector regulators, the implementation of recapitalisation plans and the establishment of the Ghana Financial Stability Fund will help mitigate the impact of the GoG [Government of Ghana] debt operation on the financial sector”, it mentioned. “Additionally, the Financial Sector Strengthening Strategy (FSSS) was developed in 2023 by financial sector regulators to coordinate their policy regulatory intervention in ensuring that risks to the financial system are promptly identified and addressed”, it added. On the other hand, the report pointed out that the domestic debt restructuring has created some fiscal space for the government and contributed to lowering the debt to Gross Domestic Debt ratio. On July 14, 2023, the Government of Ghana launched the second phase of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP). It involved the restructuring of Cocoa Bills (GH¢8.1 billion) and locally issued US dollar denominated bonds ($808.99 million).

Despite various reforms aimed at strengthening the financial system, it remains underdeveloped, characterized by limited access, shallow financial depth, and inefficiencies. The study employs the IMF’s Financial Development Index to measure financial sector performance and examines key factors hindering progress in the sector, including macroeconomic instability, political fragility, weak institutional frameworks, low levels of financial literacy and large informal sector. Empirical evidence shows that these factors are significant obstacles to the progress of the financial sector. However, opportunities exist for improvement, particularly through sustained financial literacy programs, legal and regulatory reforms, and macroeconomic stabilization efforts. The paper concludes by recommending prioritized interventions by the government and international development partners to address these challenges, with a focus on strengthening institutions and fostering a stable economic environment conducive to long-term financial development.

Introduction A large body of literature has established a strong link between financial sector development and economic growth (see King & Levine, 1993: pp. 717-737 ; Rajan & Zingales, 1998: pp. 559-586 ). This relationship is evident globally, where well-developed financial systems underpin the success of advanced economies, while underdeveloped financial systems often characterize poorer nations. Many developing countries have embarked on financial reforms to enhance sector performance and, in turn, promote economic growth, with mixed results. Financial sector development is typically measured by how effectively the financial system performs its core functions. However, various factors influence its performance. Ngouala, Ghislain and Bongo (2021: pp. 452-468) and Johnson (2011) highlight the importance of the institutional environment, which encompasses contract enforcement and property rights. Legal traditions, as established by La Porta et al. (1997: pp. 1131-1150; 1998: 1113-1155) , may also impact financial development, while Acemoglu et al. (2001: pp. 1369-1401) and Beck et al. (2003: pp. 137-181) point to the role of endowments. Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) and Baltagi et al. (2009: pp. 285-296) suggest that trade and financial openness are crucial to banking sector development, while Ang and Kumar (2013: pp. 43-56) emphasis on cross-border barriers to financial innovation explain differences in financial sector development. The financial system in Sierra Leone has evolved since the establishment of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL, 2018) in 1964, which was tasked with maintaining price stability and ensuring the financial system’s stability. However, the civil war of 1991-2001 disrupted economic activities and damaged financial infrastructure, including bank branches in key cities (see Johnson, 2022: pp. 3500-3517 ; UNDP, 2008 ). Post-war financial reforms, initiated under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), liberalized the financial system to some extent, with market-determined interest rates and a growing presence of foreign banks (see World Bank 2017 ; IMF, 2004 ). The banking sector, dominated by 14 commercial banks (10 foreign and 4 local, including 2 state-owned), comprises over 70 percent of total financial assets ( Bank of Sierra Leone, 2022 ). Non-bank financial institutions, such as pension funds, microfinance, and community banks, represent a smaller share, while the capital market, established in 2007, remains stagnant. Despite the ongoing reforms, Sierra Leone’s financial sector remains shallow and underdeveloped, limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy. Financial innovation, rapidly transforming global financial systems, has had little impact on Sierra Leone’s rudimentary financial services. According to IMF (2008) , the country’s financial development is hindered by physical barriers, weak financial infrastructure, and institutional and legislative challenges. Kargbo and Adamu (2008: pp. 30-61) further argue that poor enforcement of creditor rights and commercial contracts has undermined banks’ ability to recover loans, impairing the financial system’s ability to allocate credit efficiently. This paper seeks to analyze the challenges to financial sector development in Sierra Leone and identify the scope for improvement. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives the theoretical basis of the study; Section 3 outlines the data and methodology; Section 4 provides an overview of the financial sector’s evolution; Section 5 discusses the challenges and opportunities for financial sector development; and Section 6 concludes with policy implications. 2. Theoretical Basis The study is grounded in several key theoretical frameworks and empirical findings from the broader literature on financial development and economic growth. These theories provide a foundation for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing Sierra Leone’s financial sector. A substantial body of literature, including seminal works by King and Levine (1993: pp. 717-737) and Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) , has established a strong link between financial sector development and economic growth. This relationship underscores the importance of a well-functioning financial system for economic progress, particularly relevant for developing countries like Sierra Leone. Similarly, the work of Gurley and Shaw (1960) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983: pp. 401-419) on financial intermediation explains how financial institutions, particularly banks, facilitate the flow of funds from savers to borrowers. This theory is crucial for understanding the role of Sierra Leone’s banking sector, which dominates the country’s financial landscape. La Porta et al. (1997: pp. 1131-1150 ; 1998: pp. 1113-1155) emphasize the importance of institutional factors, including legal traditions and property rights, in shaping financial development. This perspective is particularly pertinent given Sierra Leone’s challenges with weak institutional frameworks and the rule of law. Boyd et al. (2001: pp. 137-181) found a strong negative association between inflation and financial sector development, emphasizing the importance of macroeconomic stability for financial growth. This relationship is evident in Sierra Leone’s experience with high and volatile inflation rates. Gulde et al. (2006) provide evidence that inadequate property rights and poor judicial performance can stifle banking sector development, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings are directly applicable to Sierra Leone’s challenges with weak rule of law and institutional quality. Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) and Baltagi et al. (2009: pp. 285-296) suggest that trade and financial openness are crucial to banking sector development. This perspective is relevant when considering Sierra Leone’s efforts to integrate into regional and global financial systems. Ang and Kumar (2013: pp. 43-56) emphasize the role of cross-border barriers to financial innovation in explaining differences in financial sector development across countries. Their study highlights the significance of these barriers in the context of financial innovation and development. This can help explain Sierra Leone’s challenges in adopting and benefiting from global financial innovations. Overall, these theoretical frameworks provide a comprehensive basis for analyzing the challenges and opportunities in Sierra Leone’s financial sector development. They highlight the complex interplay between institutional factors, macroeconomic conditions, and financial sector performance, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations. 3. Data and Methodology This study relies on secondary data sources. The table in Appendix 1 provides a comprehensive list of the variables used, including their definitions and sources. Given the multifaceted nature of financial development, which encompasses various dimensions such as depth, access, and efficiency, accurately measuring it can be challenging. To address this, the study employs the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Financial Development Index as the primary indicator of financial development. This index offers a robust and comprehensive measure that captures key elements of financial sector performance across different dimensions. In addition to the Financial Development Index, several other variables are examined to identify the key obstacles to financial sector development in Sierra Leone. The inflation rate is used to gauge macroeconomic stability, serving as a proxy for the broader economic environment. Institutional strength is captured through variables such as political stability, the rule of law, and key indicators from the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report. These proxies are crucial for understanding how institutional weaknesses may undermine financial sector development. Furthermore, financial literacy is included in the analysis to assess the extent to which a lack of public... [truncated]

This is particularly the case in the financial sector, where AI has the potential to bring operational efficiencies and even improved investment performance, but also brings with it risks due to the inherent unknowns that come with new technology. AI (as now defined) has in reality been widely adopted for many years in the financial sector, including for text transcription, chatbots and helpdesks and data analytics.

Heavy reliance on AI could lead to concentration risks in the financial sector: RBI Governor ANI | Updated: Oct 14, 2024 11:44 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [India], October 14 (ANI): The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday cautioned that heavy reliance on artificial intelligence ( AI ) could lead to concentration risks in the financial sector. The Governor was speaking at the 90th High-Level Conference organized by the Reserve Bank of India in New Delhi. He noted that the increasing use of AI might allow a few technology providers to dominate the market, which could pose systemic risks. "The heavy reliance on AI can lead to concentration risks, especially when a small number of tech providers dominate the market," said Governor Das. The Governor also pointed out that AI introduces new vulnerabilities, including increased susceptibility to cyberattacks and data breaches. The opacity of AI systems further complicates matters, making it difficult to audit or interpret the algorithms driving financial decisions. "Additionally, AI 's opacity makes it difficult to audit or interpret the algorithms which drive decisions. This could amplify systemic risks, as failures or disruptions in these systems may cascade across the entire financial sector" Das added. Governor Das emphasized the importance of banks and financial institutions implementing strong risk mitigation strategies to address these risks. He noted that while AI and Big Tech offer significant advantages, financial institutions must ensure they do not become overly dependent on these technologies. "In the ultimate analysis, banks have to ride on the advantages of AI and Big Tech and not allow the latter to ride on them," Das warned. He urged financial institutions to remain vigilant, highlighting the need for a balanced approach in leveraging AI 's potential while addressing its inherent risks. The Governor 's remarks come at a time when AI and machine learning are increasingly being integrated into financial services, enhancing efficiency but also raising concerns about cybersecurity, transparency, and regulatory oversight. With the rapid advancements in technology, the RBI is focused on ensuring that the financial sector remains resilient to both traditional risks and the emerging risks posed by AI and Big Tech. (ANI)

World Former China deputy central bank head gets suspended death sentence for taking bribes Listen Listen Text Size Print General view of the People's Bank of China headquarters in Beijing, China, Thursday. EPA-Yonhap Published Oct 10, 2024 9:34 pm KST Updated Oct 10, 2024 9:39 pm KST China's former deputy central bank governor, Fan Yifei, has been sentenced to death for taking bribes with a two-year reprieve, state media said on Thursday, amid a sweeping anti-graft drive in the financial sector. Fan was found guilty of illegally accepting property worth more than 386 million yuan ($54.55 million), taking advantage of his senior positions at the central bank and other financial institutions, including China Construction Bank, according to the report, citing a Chinese court. Following the two-year reprieve, Fan's death sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment, with no possibility of commutation or parole, state media cited Huanggang Intermediate People's Court in Hubei province as saying. "Fan Yifei accepted bribes of an extremely large amount, the circumstances of his crimes were extremely serious, the social impact was extremely bad, and the interests of the state and the people suffered extremely heavy losses," the court was quoted as saying. Fan, 60, is the highest-ranking official at the People's Bank of China to be arrested under President Xi Jinping's anti-graft drive in the past decade, in a campaign aimed at weeding out corrupt officials in the financial sector. Fan was placed under investigation by Chinese authorities in late 2022, and was expelled from the Communist Party in 2023. Reuters was not able to contact Fan for comment. China's anti-graft watchdog has in recent months launched a sweeping crackdown on the financial sector that has ensnared some of the country’s biggest names, including Liu Liange, former chairman of state-owned Bank of China, and Wang Bin, former head of state-owned China Life Insurance. In April, Liu, who stepped down in March 2023, pled guilty to accepting bribes totaling more than 121 million yuan, according to state media. Tang Shuangning, ex-chairman of China Everbright Group, has also been charged with bribery and corruption. (Reuters) Go to Top

Audio By Carbonatix As Ghana's banking landscape continues to evolve, one name that stands out for embracing cutting-edge technology and driving financial innovation is the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Ghana. The bank has become a trailblazer in the digital banking revolution, providing a wide range of innovative solutions that have reshaped the financial experiences of Ghanaians, particularly in underserved and remote areas. UBA Ghana has taken bold steps to integrate technology into its core operations, focusing on mobile banking, internet banking, and strategic partnerships with fintech firms to deliver seamless banking services. These efforts have not only enhanced customer convenience but have also expanded access to financial services across the country. Pioneering Mobile and Internet Banking UBA Ghana has been at the forefront of mobile banking, recognizing the crucial role mobile technology plays in expanding financial inclusion. With the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile networks in even the most remote parts of Ghana, UBA seized the opportunity to launch UBA Mobile Banking. Through its user-friendly mobile app, the bank provides customers with an extensive range of services—from balance checks and money transfers to bill payments and airtime purchases—all at their fingertips. Customers no longer need to visit physical branches to conduct transactions, a game-changer in rural and remote areas where banking infrastructure is limited. The UBA Mobile App is designed to cater to both smartphone users and feature phone users, ensuring that a large segment of the population can access banking services regardless of the type of device they own. This innovation has proven particularly valuable in areas with minimal banking facilities, empowering people to participate in the financial ecosystem without the need for brick-and-mortar branches. In addition to mobile banking, UBA Ghana has introduced robust Internet banking services, which allow customers to manage their accounts online securely. Through UBA’s Internet banking platform, customers can perform transactions, make investments, and track their finances from the comfort of their homes or offices, further reducing the need to visit a bank in person. Fintech Partnerships and Financial Innovation UBA Ghana's focus on financial innovation has also seen the bank engage in strategic partnerships with fintech companies. These collaborations are designed to tap into the technological expertise of fintech firms to develop customized products and services for specific market segments. One such partnership is UBA’s integration with various mobile money services, making it easier for customers to transfer funds between their bank accounts and mobile wallets. In a country where mobile money has become a preferred method of transacting, this integration has made UBA a vital player in driving financial inclusion. Additionally, UBA Ghana has rolled out chat banking services, such as Leo, an AI-powered chatbot that enables customers to perform banking transactions through social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. This service has garnered attention for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly among tech-savvy customers who prefer the convenience of digital interaction. Leo allows users to transfer money, check balances, and even open new accounts—all via a simple chat, reducing barriers to accessing banking services. Reaching Remote Areas and Enhancing Financial Inclusion One of the most remarkable impacts of UBA Ghana’s digital banking efforts has been its ability to reach remote areas where traditional banking services are scarce. By leveraging mobile technology and internet-based solutions, UBA has successfully brought banking to people in rural communities who previously lacked access to financial services. This digital shift is helping to bridge the financial gap in Ghana, where a significant portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked. UBA's mobile and internet banking platforms allow customers in remote areas to receive remittances, pay for goods and services, and save money securely. This not only empowers individuals and households but also contributes to the broader goal of national economic development by facilitating commerce and entrepreneurship in underserved regions. Innovating for the Future As the digital banking landscape continues to evolve, UBA Ghana remains committed to staying ahead of the curve. The bank is continuously exploring new technologies, including blockchain and artificial intelligence, to enhance its service offerings and improve operational efficiency. These advancements, coupled with UBA’s dedication to customer-centric innovation, are positioning the bank as a leader in the future of banking in Ghana. Through its various initiatives, UBA Ghana has demonstrated how a forward-thinking approach to digital banking and financial innovation can transform the banking experience, foster financial inclusion, and drive economic growth. Whether through mobile banking, fintech partnerships, or internet banking, UBA is ensuring that all Ghanaians—regardless of location—have access to modern financial services that meet their needs. In a rapidly changing digital world, UBA Ghana’s role in promoting digital banking serves as a blueprint for the future of banking in Ghana and beyond.

Firoza Finance Firoza Finance is a joint venture between Liberty Finance and HAQQ Network. Islamic Coin on X/Screenshot KEY POINTS Firoza Finance's pilot program will feature three investment pools holding a TVL of over $2 million Investors can pool their crypto assets and generate diverse returns with varying levels of risk The Mudarabah smart contract is a Shariah-compliant microfinancing solution backed by ethical blockchain On-chain microfinancing platform Firoza Finance, a joint venture between pioneering financial services and technology company Liberty Finance and EVM-equivalent ethical blockchain HAQQ Network , on Wednesday announced the launch of its pilot program that introduces "the world's first real-world Mudarabah smart contract." What is a Mudarabah Smart Contract? In Islamic traditional finance, a Mudarabah is a profit-sharing agreement between a business manager and a capital provider. With Dubai-based Firoza Finance , the decentralized finance (DeFi) world now has its first-ever Mudarabah smart contract that will allow consumers to invest with confidence across diverse risk profiles. Aside from delivering the world's first-ever Mudarabah smart contract, the platform empowers the global Muslim community by providing ethical, Shariah-compliant investment opportunities through its DeFi solutions, including private credit funds and customizable investments. Pilot Program for First Movers Firoza Finance has opened a join waitlist for investors who want to pool their crypto assets and generate a diverse range of returns with varying risk levels. The pilot program will feature three distinct investment pools, collectively holding a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $2 million. The pools are expected to deliver a significant Annual Percentage Yield (APY) while contributing revenue to Liberty Finance's Amana Vaults, which facilitate the delivery of Islamic lending services to traditional financiers, Islamic banks, and peer-to-peer lenders. A New Era of Shariah-Compliant Crypto Investments The collaboration between Liberty Finance and HAQQ Network marks a significant milestone in the Islamic Finance and DeFi spaces, as Firoza Finance addresses the inherent limitations within existing DeFi platforms. The Mudarabah smart contract offers a Shariah-compliant microfinancing solution that merges ethical finance principles with the many advanced benefits of blockchain technology. Aside from helping resolve the ethical dilemmas of DeFi offerings that often do not align with some consumers' religious and ethical beliefs, Firoza Finance also tackles some key issues within conventional financing, including high borrowing costs due to intermediaries and administrative overheads. "We are excited to offer this unique investment opportunity through our collaboration with HAQQ Network and their esteemed Shariah scholars. The development and deployment of the Mudarabah smart contract represent a significant advancement in combining traditional Islamic financial principles with modern blockchain technology," Patric Devereaux, CFO at Liberty Finance, said in a press release shared with International Business Times . Capital Accessibility for Smaller Businesses Small business owners have had struggles with capital due to the various limitations in traditional finance. By eliminating the unnecessary intermediaries and automating processes through smart contracts, Firoza Finance significantly reduces borrowing costs, allowing smaller players and entrepreneurs around the world to have access to capital. Furthermore, by utilizing Liberty Finance's innovative technology engine and capitalizing on HAQQ Network's robust blockchain infrastructure , Firoza Finance has opened a door for transparent, secure transactions with reduced overhead costs.
