    "article_text": "Health care is a big business — for Boston’s lobbying shops. The sector again dominated the state lobbying firms’ focus in 2024, per records released by the Secretary of State’s office, as total lobbying spending in Massachusetts rose 5 percent to $104 million. Of the five biggest corporate spenders on lobbying, three are in health care. Again. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state’s largest health insurer, led the way for another year, spending $460,000. (That’s down slightly from the $495,000 that the Boston-based insurer spent on lobbying in the previous year.) Beth Israel Lahey Health and Mass General Brigham, the state’s two largest hospital chains, traded places in the rankings, with BILH spending $417,000 last year compared to MGB’s $390,000. The other biggest corporate spenders were commuter rail operator Keolis ($427,500) and simulcasting hall owner Sterling Suffolk Racecourse ($420,000). Advertisement Blue Cross spokeswoman Amy McHugh said the year was extremely busy with many health care related bills filed and debated before the end of the legislative session. In particular, she said Blue Cross lobbyists were heavily engaged with the Legislature in the drafting of a bill aimed at curbing pharmaceutical costs and another one for strengthening oversight of the state’s health care system. “Our focus during these discussions was our employer customers and members, ensuring that their voices were heard during the process, and emphasizing the need to improve health care access, quality and affordability here in Massachusetts,” McHugh said in an email. Health care and pharmaceuticals also dominated the focus of trade group lobbying. Most health insurers other than Blue Cross belong to the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, which had the biggest lobbying spend of any business group last year, $1.3 million, compared to the runner-up, the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association ($1.1 million). The drug industry’s local trade group, MassBio, came in third ($866,000). Advertisement And Smith, Costello & Crawford held onto the top spot among the city’s busiest lobbying firms, reporting $6.2 million in lobbying revenue, up from $5.5 million in 2023. No surprise, then, that some of the agency’s biggest clients are in health care, including Tufts Medicine, Shields Health, and UMass Memorial Health.

    "article_text": "Home Economy Healthcare services outsourcer Omega plans to increase Philippine staffing to 5,000 Economy Editors' Picks One News By Justine Irish D. Tabile, Reporter OUTSOURCED medical services provider Omega Healthcare Management Services Private Ltd. said it is planning to increase its workforce in the Philippines to 5,000, citing growing demand for healthcare outsourcing services. Omega Healthcare Country Head Santosh Kesari told BusinessWorld that the company currently employs 2,800 professionals in the Philippines. “Omega Healthcare plans to double its workforce to 5,000 employees by 2026, reflecting confidence in the growth trajectory of the healthcare outsourcing industry,” Mr. Kesari said. “This expansion underscores the company’s commitment to leveraging the skilled Filipino workforce to deliver high-quality healthcare support services to clients worldwide,” he added. According to Mr. Santosh, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telehealth solutions, which has led to a shift to remote consultations and digital health management. “Several factors contribute to the rising demand for remote healthcare services, including technological advancements, patient preference for convenience, and the need for cost-effective healthcare delivery,” he said. “This trend underscores the importance of scalable, remote healthcare services to meet evolving patient needs,” he added. Challenges faced by healthcare providers are also pushing them to avail of various outsourced services. In particular, he said that healthcare providers face stringent regulatory compliance, escalating operational costs, and the imperative to enhance patient outcomes. “Outsourcing non-core functions like medical billing, coding, and revenue cycle management allows organizations to focus on patient care while ensuring compliance and operational efficiency,” he said. “Specialized outsourcing firms offer expertise in navigating complex healthcare regulations, mitigating risks, and reducing administrative burdens,” he added. Amid growing demand, he said that the Philippines’ strong pool of nursing professionals and medical coders will solidify the Philippines’ standing as a key player in global healthcare outsourcing. He cited competitive operational costs and cultural compatibility in understanding Western healthcare systems, and ability to service international clients. However, he said that healthcare providers outsourcing healthcare services in the Philippines face challenges in talent retention and data security. “High global demand for healthcare professionals can lead to attrition, necessitating continuous investment in employee engagement and development,” he said. “Ensuring compliance with international data protection standards requires robust cybersecurity measures and ongoing staff training,” he added. To support the growth of the industry, he said that the government can extend tax benefits and provide grants for technology upgrades, invest in specialized training programs, streamline compliance processes, and ensure alignment with international healthcare standards. “The future of healthcare outsourcing in the Philippines is promising, with anticipated growth in telehealth, artificial intelligence integration, and personalized medicine,” he said.

    "article_text": "Agencies Healthcare professionals can improve their career prospects by acquiring the following digital skills. In today's fast-evolving healthcare landscape, digital skills are no longer optional—they're a key advantage. The demand for healthcare professionals extends beyond traditional roles, creating opportunities in fields like telemedicine , medical research, health informatics , and biotechnology. Dr. Sandip Patel, senior healthcare consultant and founder of Docthub, highlights the shift in career trends: \"Healthcare is no longer confined to hospitals and clinics. The rise of digital health platforms and AI-driven diagnostics has paved the way for technology-focused healthcare careers. Professionals who embrace these advancements will be better positioned for the future.\" He also emphasises the importance of continuous learning: \"The healthcare sector is evolving rapidly. Those who consistently update their skills and specialize in new areas will have the best career prospects in the years ahead.\" Key digital skills for healthcare professionals Healthcare professionals can improve their career prospects by acquiring the following digital skills: Electronic Health Records (EHR) Management Healthcare facilities use EHR systems to store and manage patient data. Professionals should be skilled in documenting, retrieving, and analyzing patient information efficiently. Understanding data security and compliance regulations, such as HIPAA for those working with US-based systems, is also crucial. Telemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring Live Events In the era of telehealth, healthcare professionals ought to be acquainted with virtual consultation platforms. Training in how to conduct remote assessments, understand various patient data coming from wearable devices, and apply telemedicine as a complementary tool to conventional care will improve service delivery. Data Analytics and AI Applications Healthcare today is experiencing a paradigm shift owing to data-driven decision-making. There is a growing need for professionals who will analyse trends from patient data, forecast healthcare outcomes, and use AI tools. The applications of AI in diagnostics, treatment planning, and administrative automation are proliferating, making it worthwhile to understand these tools. Digital Health Tools and Mobile Applications Mobile health applications aid patients in managing their conditions and following prescribed treatments. These are the potential means through which healthcare professionals share with patients with such innovative technology as adopted by health fitness trackers, reminding patients for medication taking, and symptom checkers. Awareness on Cybersecurity With more and more patient information going online, the healthcare worker knows the possible risks posed by cybersecurity. Training to recognize phishing scams, use strong passwords, and ensure compliance with data privacy law can help prevent breaches while ensuring patient privacy. Emerging Medical Technologies and 3D Printing Latest innovations like prostheses, implants, organ models, and so forth use 3D printing. Medical professionals continue to learn about these advances to improve patient care and medical research. Robotics and Automation in Healthcare Robotic-assisted surgeries and AI have automated many activities in hospitals making them more efficient and bringing down human error. Social Media and Digital Marketing for Healthcare Medical professionals should consider this in their marketing strategy to make their name prominent while using digital channels to outreach their potential patients. Social media would also help them educate and tell the layman about the latest health happenings while establishing credibility. Technology is shaping the future of careers in Health Care Digitalisation in healthcare brings opportunities for careers to professionals who are investing in digital skills, and thereby patients are expected to benefit from such improved care. For one's own success in modern health care, one should adapt to the best technologies. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

    "article_text": "Single payer is the only solution. Everything else is a tweak. In its March 18 editorial, “Four concrete ways Mass. can lower health care costs,” the Globe offers a few areas that are “ripe for changes”: eliminating low-value care, reducing administrative waste, addressing prescription drug prices, and tackling excessive variation in what providers charge. Yet initiatives of this type have not only failed; they’ve also spawned an industry of corporate gamesmanship and harmed patients. For at least the past 10 years, efforts to raise awareness about low-value care have not succeeded in eliminating it. Meanwhile, as health care costs have continued to rise dramatically, blocking referrals for unproven procedures has resulted in a growing bureaucracy of for-profit insurance administrators making medical decisions, adding administrative expense and delaying or denying care. Pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit mangers are adept at dodging regulations. For front-line providers, this creates a time-draining search — not for which medicine the patient needs but, rather, which one is covered on that particular week. Transparent pricing relies on sick people to shop for the lowest price. Can’t we do better? Advertisement With all the recent coverage of Steward Health Care and frustrated physicians organizing for better conditions, we were surprised to see no mention of a single-payer health system in the editorial. Medicare for All eliminates the waste of insurance company administrative duplication, creates a system with power to negotiate with pharmaceutical corporations, and has one mission: not profit, but health care as a human right. All developed countries have concluded this is the best solution. All have better outcomes and spend less. Dr. Barbara Ogur Cambridge Ellen Israel Jamaica Plain Ogur was a primary care physician for 46 years. Israel holds a bachelor of science in nursing and a master of public health and is a certified nurse midwife. Your editorial about how to fix the Massachusetts health care system offers a series of stopgap measures that will do little to address the fundamental problem: We have a for-profit health care system that is run by insurance companies. Our health care spending should go toward health care, not insurance companies’ bottom line. Advertisement The solution is right in front of us in the Legislature with bills to establish Medicare for All in Massachusetts. This legislation would eliminate the need for insurance companies and create a board that would set prices and consolidate billing into one agency. A moderate tax on employers and residents would fund the system and eliminate the enormous monthly premiums that employers and employees now pay. The health insurance industry is drowning our residents in medical debt and obscene monthly payments. The Legislature is terrified of this industry and its deep pockets. Until residents demand that legislators do their job and enact this legislation, we will continue to see editorials that look past the clear answer to the problem. Instead of suggesting cost cutting that could limit our access to health care, focus on slashing corporate profits. Louise Johnson Jamaica Plain Address regional needs and invest in social equity The Globe editorial board rightfully highlights the urgency of addressing skyrocketing health care costs. These costs continue to strain the budgets of individuals, families, businesses, and municipalities, not to mention the state itself, crowding out spending on other priorities and hindering the state’s affordability and competitiveness. Massachusetts’ per capita health care expenditures are among the highest in the country, yet significant gaps exist in health outcomes and access to care, especially for certain regions. Health care reform efforts must avoid exacerbating regional inequities. Savings from reducing the growth of health care spending should be redirected toward investments in primary care and upstream social determinants of health, such as transportation and housing, especially in regions that have faced chronic underinvestment. These strategic investments can build the foundation for a healthier and more resilient Commonwealth, yielding a far greater return on investment over the long term. For example, The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts’ investment in the Quaboag Connector, a rural micro-transit service in the area around the town of Ware, has provided more than 76,000 rides since 2017. This service has enabled residents to access health care, groceries, jobs, and social activities either for free or a $2 fare per ride. The positive impact on the health and economy of the region goes beyond what investments in downstream health care could have achieved alone. Advertisement The urgency to address the state’s health care affordability challenges presents us with an opportunity to reimagine how and where we invest our limited resources to optimize health and well-being across the Commonwealth. Amie Shei President and CEO The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts Worcester The writer holds a doctoral degree in health policy. Too many patients confuse more care with better care I read your editorial on health care costs and found a missing element: patients’ expectations. We are a country where more, quicker, and convenient is considered to be better. This is not just for online shopping; it applies to health care as well. Patients often view more care as better care, but often that is not the case. This includes the low-value testing and services your editorial seeks to see eliminated. When providers use clinical judgment, honed over decades, to recommend care without running a specific test first, this is often viewed as inferior care. At a systemic level, this contributes, for example, to redundancy in CT and MRI scans. Such services are expensive upfront, and costs need to be recouped. While I agree with the elements detailed in the editorial, I strongly believe that changing patients’ expectations about health care will be necessary to really hold down costs. Dr. Ferdinand Venditti Newburyport The writer is a retired hospital executive. Arts-based prescription reduces social isolation, yields results I read “Four concrete ways Mass. can lower health care costs” with great interest. I applaud the Globe for highlighting the need for innovative approaches that improve health outcomes while reducing costs. In that spirit, I want to add one more proven solution — one that’s already making a difference in Massachusetts. Last year, Mass Cultural Council and Art Pharmacy launched the nation’s first statewide arts prescription initiative, known as arts-based social prescribing. This practice connects patients to community-based arts and cultural activities to improve overall health. It has been shown to support mental health, reduce social isolation and loneliness, and improve adherence to treatment plans, all at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical interventions. Advertisement Though unconventional, social prescribing is backed by strong evidence and economic benefits. In Canada, for example, data show every dollar invested in social prescribing yields an estimated return of $4.43. Social isolation is linked to anxiety and depression. Addressing these challenges requires creative solutions, and Massachusetts’ cultural sector is ready to help. We believe in the power of culture and know that innovation thrives through creativity. Michael J. Bobbitt Executive director Mass Cultural Council Boston The Mass Cultural Council is the Commonwealth’s arts agency."

Article Insights Parsons Behle & Latimer are most popular: within Tax topic(s) with readers working within the Advertising & Public Relations and Construction & Engineering industries The Health and Human Service Office of the Inspector General (OIG) exists to detect and remedy fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. Last year, Medicaid Fraud Control Units recovered $1.4 billion from healthcare industry members for alleged fraud and abuse. The majority of the OIG's resources go towards the oversight of Medicare and Medicaid — programs that represent a significant part of the federal budget and that serve some of the country's most vulnerable citizens. The OIG regularly oversees audits of healthcare providers. This includes audits of hospitals, practice groups, individual practitioners, pharmacies, home health agencies and other healthcare industry members and providers. These audits are typically conducted to determine whether a healthcare provider was overpaid by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or if they committed Medicare fraud. The OIG's oversight extends to other arenas as well. The OIG may pursue punitive measures for actions such as failing to evaluate and stabilize an emergency patient, abuse/neglect in nursing homes, HIPAA violations, Anti-Kickback and Stark law violations and medical identity theft. The OIG can also \"exclude\" individuals from participating in the Medicare program for having had a criminal conviction or discipline to their medical license, among other things. Providers can also render themselves and their practices ineligible to receive Medicare reimbursement if they hire individuals who have been excluded by the OIG. The prohibition for hiring excluded individuals includes medical assistants, receptionists, nurses, etc. or healthcare providers. What will subject a healthcare provider to an audit ? Many healthcare audits are random. However, the OIG may also look for \"red flags\" to conduct an audit, such as providers that seek high-dollar reimbursement amounts for a small number of patients; data analysis of medical records that reveal billing errors or unusual trends; or whistleblower reports. Providers who are statistical outliers from their peers are at higher risk of an audit. What steps can healthcare providers take to prevent an audit ? The OIG has set forth guidelines to help healthcare providers comply with relevant federal law. The most recent comprehensive guide was published in November 2023. This guide is generally applicable to all healthcare providers. Some of the relevant takeaways from this guide include: Healthcare providers must monitor their business activities for potential violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Physician Self-Referral (aka Stark) laws. Key steps that providers can take include avoiding improper inducements to either provide or receive referrals and making sure all healthcare transactions are billed at fair market value. Develop a policy to comply with the recently enacted Information Blocking Act. This law requires healthcare providers to refrain from engaging in a practice that is likely to interfere with, prevent or materially discourage the access, exchange or use of electronic health information. Penalties for violating this act may include Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) of up to $1 million per violation. Regularly review the OIG's exclusion list to ensure that potential healthcare employees are not on the list. The OIG has the legal authority to impose CMPs on individual and entity employers that arrange or contract (by employment or otherwise) with an individual or entity whom the employer knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program. Develop and implement a policy to ensure that all record-keeping and billing practices are compliant with current CMS standards, including compliance with Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). Assess your practice's risk level for potential Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations. The OIG anticipates publishing additional specific guidelines for hospitals, Medicare advantage providers and clinical laboratories in 2025. Healthcare providers can also sign up to receive notices of OIG exclusion updates here . In November 2024, CMS finalized the 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, bringing a 2.83% across-the-board cut to physician reimbursement. The reduction immediately triggered concerns throughout the medical community, with many healthcare organizations pushing for Congressional intervention. Although there was optimism that Congress would act in late 2024 to avert or soften the cut, those efforts ultimately failed. Healthcare providers should therefore continue to be cautious about their submissions for reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS and Congress have made their intentions to cut costs clear, yet healthcare providers can prepare for a potential audit or CMS action by proactively implementing the above guidelines from the OIG. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Chelsea Hintze J. Kevin West"

    "article_text": "Leaders from the Emory WHSC Office of Well-Being (L to R) Dhaval Desai, Krystyna Morgan and Evan Thoman in Washington, DC for the Health Workforce Well-Being Day. On March 11, 2020, after more than 118,000 diagnoses in 114 countries and 4,291 deaths, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Few could have foreseen the long-term impacts the pandemic would have on the physical and mental wellness of the nation’s health workforce. As the world observed the fifth anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this month, a group of health care professionals from across the country convened in Washington, DC to advocate for health care workers’ well-being and mental health. On March 18, the Healthcare Leadership Collaborative brought together leaders and professionals from across the nation for a series of insightful sessions, workshops and discussions aimed at fostering a culture of support and trust within health care organizations. Organized by Johns Hopkins in partnership with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes Foundation, the event coincided with the National Academy of Medicine’s annual Health Workforce Well-Being (HWWB) Day. Emory representatives at the event included Evan Thoman, Emory’s Chief Well-Being Officer, Dhaval Desai, MD, hospital medicine physician and the co-lead of the EmWELL Physicians Workgroup, and Krystyna Morgan, EmWELL’s director. HWWB Day is an annual event marking the date the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act was signed into law in 2022. Named after Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency medicine physician who tragically died by suicide during the peak of the first COVID-19 surge, the act provides federal funding for mental health education, awareness campaigns and resources to support the well-being of health care workers. Key themes of this year’s event included transforming the culture of health care and medicine through listening, storytelling and authentic leadership. \"Our participation in this summit underscores Emory's commitment to fostering a culture of well-being,\" says Thoman. “As leaders, we must be intentional in our efforts to create environments where our team members feel that their well-being is protected and supported.\" Keynote speaker Michael C. Bush, CEO of Great Place To Work ® , highlighted the role of trust in exceptional workplaces and encouraged health care leaders to embrace change to attract top talent and achieve long-term success. Other panelists and guest speakers presented on topics including leading culture transformation, creating systems where health care workers thrive, improving listening skills to enhance leadership effectiveness and interpersonal interactions, and the power of storytelling in building connections and supporting effective advocacy. \"As health care providers, our well-being directly impacts patient care,” says Desai, who also serves as the ambassador for the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes Foundation. “This summit has reinforced the importance of empathy and honest communication in our daily practice.\" For more information about recent advances in health care workforce well-being, please read the EmWELL FY24 Year in Review report here or visit their website at Office of Well-Being (EmWELL) | Emory University | Atlanta GA .

For years, the Hinduja family has been a stalwart in nation-building, social responsibility, and philanthropy. Their commitment to delivering the best medical care is above and beyond any business interest; therefore, the healthcare sector is one area in which they have excelled. Prakash Hinduja supports universal access to high-quality healthcare irrespective of financial situation Prakash Hinduja, Managing Trustee of the Hinduja Foundation, has been a steadfast supporter of universal access to high-quality healthcare, irrespective of financial situation. The Hinduja family's healthcare vision is influencing the direction of medical services in India through the founding and ongoing funding of the hospitals in Bangalore and Mumbai. A Legacy Rooted in Service Their forays into the health sector were based on the principle of the Hinduja family's founder, Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja: \"Work to give.\" Such was the concept behind the P. D. Hinduja National Hospital & Medical Research Centre. This not-for-profit venture aspires to provide leading-edge medical care while still maintaining a humanitarian nature. Over the years, the hospital has grown into a premier institution known for its excellent medical treatment, research capabilities, and patient-centered philosophy. The Hinduja family is also supporting a charity hospital in Bangalore as part of their healthcare mission after seeing the urgent need for high-quality care outside of Mumbai. These institutions are more than just medical centres—they are symbols of commitment to improving the well-being of Indian society by delivering top-tier healthcare services to all segments of the population. Prakash Hinduja on the Importance of Accessible Healthcare Prakash Hinduja firmly believes that world-class healthcare should not be a privilege but a fundamental right. He highlights that the foundation of an effective healthcare system must be excellence, affordability, and accessibility. \"Healthcare is about giving people the tools they need to live better, more satisfying lives, not only about curing diseases. Through our hospitals, we are committed to ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder anyone from receiving quality medical treatment,” he says. P. D. Hinduja Hospitals: A Benchmark for Medical Excellence The P. D. Hinduja Hospitals in Mumbai and Bangalore are known for their highly qualified staff, state-of-the-art medical facilities, and specialty treatment. These institutions offer cardiology, cancer, neurology, orthopedics, and other medical specialties which makes them among the best hospitals in the nation because of their dedication to research and innovation, which promotes advances in medical science while upholding a strong patient-first philosophy. These hospitals prioritize community health awareness, early diagnosis, and preventative healthcare in addition to treatment. Their goal of creating a healthier India is mostly dependent on initiatives like vaccination drives, public health awareness campaigns, and free health check-up camps. A Focus on Preventive Healthcare A Focus on Preventive Healthcare Prakash Hinduja is constantly highlighting the importance of preventive healthcare that will alleviate the burden on India’s medical infrastructure. “We must shift our focus from reactive to preventive healthcare. Our hospitals are actively engaged in promoting early detection of diseases, lifestyle management, and wellness programs that encourage people to take charge of their health before complications arise,” he explains. The P. D. Hinduja Hospitals, owned and managed by the Hindujas, are trying to incorporate preventative healthcare practices into standard medical practice by partnering with international medical organizations, NGOs, and government agencies. Initiatives like regular tests for chronic illnesses, mental health awareness campaigns, and the encouragement of sustainable lifestyle choices are examples of this. A Vision for the Future The hospitals are constantly changing to satisfy the needs of contemporary healthcare under the direction of the Hindujas. In order to reach rural places, future plans call for improving digital healthcare solutions, integrating AI-driven diagnostics, and growing telemedicine services. Prakash Hinduja envisions a future where healthcare is not only more accessible but also more personalized, ensuring that every patient receives care tailored to their specific needs. With an unwavering dedication to social responsibility, the Hinduja family’s healthcare initiatives stand as a testament to the power of philanthropy in driving positive change. Their hospitals are not just medical institutions; they are beacons of hope, offering healing, support, and a vision for a healthier, more equitable future. Prakash Hinduja and his family have been strong advocates for health care. Part of the Hindujas' overall mission is to uplift society through meaningful, impactful initiatives. Prioritizing medical excellence, affordability, and preventive healthcare, P. D. Hinduja Hospitals continue to raise the bar for patient care. With the ever-changing healthcare scene in India, the Hinduja family legacy gives hope for the future. The legacies proven to be possible with dedication, vision, and compassion are world -class medical care, accessible to all.

    "article_text": "63,000 public healthcare staff to get salary jumps of up to 7% Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox The Health Ministry said healthcare staff will continue to receive annual pay increments to keep salaries in pace with inflation. PHOTO: ST FILE Lee Li Ying Follow topic: Healthcare Published Mar 27, 2025, 03:42 PM Updated Mar 27, 2025, 11:54 PM SINGAPORE – Some 63,000 healthcare professionals in the public sector will get an increase of up to 7 per cent on their monthly base salaries from July 1 as the sector strives to better attract and retain staff. Specifically, 37,000 allied healthcare professionals (AHPs), pharmacists, and administrative, ancillary and support staff will get the maximum salary increase of up to 7 per cent. The last salary increase for this group of healthcare professionals was in 2021. Another group of 26,000 public healthcare nurses will also have their monthly base salaries bumped up, but the cap is at 4 per cent. The adjustments are on top of the Award for Nurses’ Grace, Excellence and Loyalty (Angel) scheme launched in September 2024 to attract and encourage nurses to build a lifelong career in nursing. The Angel scheme will see about 29,000 nurses receiving up to $100,000 each in payouts over a 20-year period. “With these salary increases, which are over and above the annual increments, we will enable the public healthcare sector to better attract and retain staff,” the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on March 27. The ministry said that healthcare staff will continue to receive annual pay increments, aimed at keeping salaries in pace with inflation. It added that healthcare workers are the driving force behind good care, and salary reviews are conducted regularly to ensure pay remains competitive. “Beyond remuneration, we will continue to review our manpower development initiatives and improve opportunities for our healthcare workers through job redesign and career development,” said MOH. Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung had in January announced the pay increase for the 37,000 allied healthcare professionals (AHPs), pharmacists, and administrative, ancillary and support staff. The pay adjustments come amid rising demand in Singapore for healthcare workers, who will be attending to a greying population. Nurses form the biggest group of professionals within Singapore’s healthcare system. But global competition for nurses intensified following the Covid-19 pandemic, especially after the borders started to reopen in 2021. Among local nurses, the attrition rate was 7.4 per cent in 2021, up from 5.4 per cent in 2020. For foreign nurses, attrition more than doubled year on year to 14.8 per cent in 2021. AHPs are also key healthcare workers here. They include physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists and medical social workers – all of whom work alongside doctors and nurses in hospitals to support patients. The proportion of AHPs who left the public healthcare sector rose from 8.9 per cent in 2018 to 11.6 per cent in 2022. Singapore is planning to unveil a strategy later in 2025 that will better carve out the roles AHPs will play in the healthcare sector. Dr Tan Wu Meng, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that increasing their salaries by up to 7 per cent is an important first step in attracting and retaining talent. However, more needs to be done to raise public awareness of the importance of AHPs in healthcare, said Dr Tan, who is also an oncologist at the National Cancer Centre. For instance, caregivers of elderly patients need not quit their jobs if a physiotherapist can help the seniors regain mobility. “That kind of value is very important, and there is room to recognise that better,” said Dr Tan. Professor Tan Bhing Leet, cluster director of health and social sciences at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), said there is also a need to enhance career development opportunities for AHPs. SIT, for one, has been working closely with MOH to provide the necessary clinical and professional training for AHPs to advance in their jobs. Professor Liaw Sok Ying, head of the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, hopes that the higher salaries for nurses will attract more school-leavers to pursue nursing as a career. “Given the global demand for nurses, it is inevitable that many of our nursing graduates will be attracted to opportunities abroad. This salary increase will not only improve the local job market for nurses, but also highlight that nursing provides competitive pay and opportunities for a global career,” said Prof Liaw. In a statement, Healthcare Services Employees’ Union president K. Thanaletchimi thanked the three public healthcare clusters for their close collaboration to improve the wages of public healthcare workers. Besides salary rises, other good outcomes like increases in salary ranges, as well as improved medical, dental and hospitalisation benefits, were also achieved, she said. “Our healthcare workers are dedicated in their care for us. By recognising their dedication with wages and benefits that are both fair and competitive, we are reinforcing our commitment to their well-being. These enhancements will enable Singapore to continue attracting and retaining top talent, while strengthening our public healthcare system for the future,” said Ms Thanaletchimi.

By Elliot Hughes The Minnesota Star Tribune March 27, 2025 at 2:42AM Jennifer DeCubellis, pictured in 2017 while serving as deputy county administrator for Hennepin County, is stepping down as the leader of the Hennepin Healthcare System. (The Minnesota Star Tribune) Comment Gift Share Listen Jennifer DeCubellis, the chief executive of Hennepin Healthcare System, announced Wednesday she will step down from her role in May. Hennepin Healthcare System operates HCMC in downtown Minneapolis and other clinics in the county. “Every leader has a season,” DeCubellis said in a statement. “We are all destined for a specific purpose, and a strong leader passes the baton when the time is right. That time for me is now.” The health care system, which is the state’s largest safety-net hospital for vulnerable populations, credited DeCubellis with leading it through the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest that rocked the Twin Cities in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. “We are grateful for Jennifer’s leadership over the past five years,” Hennepin Healthcare Board Chair Mohamed Omar said in a statement. “She has gone above and beyond for the organization during the most challenging period in healthcare in the last century.” The board will announce an interim CEO on Thursday and will launch a national search for a permanent successor. DeCubellis assumed the chief executive role two weeks before Minnesota’s first COVID-19 case in 2020 . Under her leadership, the health care system prioritized patient access to lifesaving care, promoted the safety of staff members and secured support from the National Guard. DeCubellis was also credited with improving staff retention. The health care system has a multi-year $2.5 billion overhaul planned for HCMC that includes plans to build a new 450-bed inpatient tower .

TAMPA, FLORIDA / ACCESS Newswire / March 26, 2025 / Black Book Market Research LLC, a leading independent healthcare IT survey and polling organization, today released the results of its annual 2025 Patient Engagement and Healthcare Consumer Communication Technologies Survey. The nationwide study, conducted over a six-month period, captured insights from 2,518 verified users, including clinical, administrative, and IT professionals across the care continuum, as well as more than 1,000 healthcare consumers. In the 2025 report, InteliChart received the highest client experience ratings across 14 of 18 key performance indicators (KPIs), earning the #1 overall ranking among end-to-end patient engagement solution vendors for the third consecutive year. The survey results reflect input from: 1,511 provider-side users representing 1,444 hospitals, health systems, ambulatory centers, physician groups, and long-term care organizations 1,007 patients and healthcare consumers offering firsthand feedback on their experience with provider engagement tools 188 independent EHR and healthcare IT implementation consultants from vendor-neutral firms with direct technical and operational expertise The 2025 evaluation introduced an updated KPI framework, developed in collaboration with healthcare CIOs, HIT consultants, and academic leaders in digital health. These newly defined indicators replace outdated general performance metrics, offering more targeted and meaningful assessments in areas such as interoperability, automation, patient usability, platform scalability, and clinical communication outcomes. Participants evaluated 25 patient engagement vendors based on this refined set of KPIs, including categories such as User-Friendliness, Customization Capabilities, Integration Efficiency, Communication Effectiveness, Data Security, Cost-Effectiveness, Future-Proofing, and Operational Impact. \"The healthcare industry is undergoing a major transformation in how it approaches patient engagement. What were once peripheral tools are now mission-critical technologies enabling accessible, coordinated, and highly personalized care,\" said Doug Brown, Founder of Black Book Research. \"Next-generation platforms-powered by AI-driven communication, mobile-first design, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation-are fundamentally changing how patients connect with their providers and manage their health.\" \"As healthcare shifts toward value-based care, and interoperability frameworks like FHIR mature, organizations need engagement solutions that not only meet rising consumer expectations but also integrate seamlessly across ecosystems to support real-time data exchange and population health strategies. While EHR-native tools offer foundational features, providers are increasingly adopting best-of-breed platforms that deliver greater agility, deeper functionality, and retail-grade digital experiences across every patient touchpoint,\" said Brown. The InteliChart platform received top recognition for its comprehensive, fully integrated suite of patient engagement tools, including digital intake workflows, self-scheduling, AI-powered outreach, secure messaging, virtual care, population health capabilities, and intuitive patient portals-all delivered through a seamlessly unified, EHR-integrated architecture. Survey participants consistently cited InteliChart's ability to streamline engagement workflows, enhance communication, and support scalable, real-time digital interactions across the healthcare ecosystem. The Black Book methodology is built on a rigorous, crowdsourced polling process using a double-blind format to ensure impartiality and accuracy. All rankings are independently produced, with no vendor involvement in funding or influence, and are based solely on validated end-user feedback. As patient engagement becomes a cornerstone of digital health strategy, healthcare organizations are increasingly prioritizing platforms that enable secure, accessible, and consumer-centered experiences. The 2025 survey results reflect a rapidly evolving market, where leading vendors are reshaping how healthcare is delivered, experienced, and sustained-across both provider operations and patient lives.

    "article_text": "Careers in health care have long been seen as sure bets, especially given growing numbers of older Americans. There’s fresh evidence, courtesy of Stanford economist Neale Mahoney, for just how much those jobs are paying off. For instance, earnings for U.S. health care workers as a group have risen almost twice as fast as those in other industries, based on data spanning more than four decades. In 2009, the American health care sector overtook retail as the country’s largest source of jobs. Here’s another revelation from the new working paper by Mahoney, the Trione Director at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) and economics professor in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences: Despite talk of U.S. cities hard hit by manufacturing declines pivoting to health care to boost local employment, Mahoney and his co-authors find that it’s not happening as hoped. Health care jobs have only slightly offset job losses in manufacturing – and not at all among workers who aren’t white and for those lacking college degrees. Other takeaways from the study of U.S. Census data from 1980 to 2022: Wage hikes in health care haven’t benefited workers equally. The big winners relative to the rest of the U.S. labor force have been middle-class and upper-middle class health care employees. Compensation for nurses, for example, have risen approximately 82%, compared to nearly 37% for all U.S. workers. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other so-called “midlevels” provide more than half of primary care services in the U.S. Since 2010 – when the job category became large enough to track consistently – the number of midlevel positions has more than doubled. There are now more midlevels than primary care doctors in the U.S. About three-quarters of health care jobs are held by women, a level unchanged since 1980. What’s different now is that there are three times as many female physicians than there were four decades ago (though male doctors remain the majority). The share of males who work as nurses and aides has also increased. The proportion of physicians and aides born outside the U.S. has grown at a faster rate than it has for foreign-born workers generally. The share of foreign-born nurses and midlevels, meanwhile, has grown at smaller rates than the economy-wide average. Overall, Mahoney and his collaborators – Joshua Gottlieb of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy; Kevin Rinz of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, and Victoria Udalova of the U.S. Census Bureau – say the study findings have important policy implications. Health care, the study authors write, has been one of the largest trends in the U.S. labor market in a generation – and a “modern middle-class ‘jobs engine.’” Why that engine hasn’t reached economies hit hard by manufacturing’s decline, the researchers say, could be because “manufacturing-to-meds” policy proposals haven’t received the necessary resources or, if they did, they have not produced the desired results. “Now that we have a clearer reading on what’s happening in the health care job market,” Mahoney says, “understanding what’s behind the trends will be crucial as the industry continues to expand and technology changes.” For more information This story was originally published by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

    "article_text": "Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Gov. Ron DeSantis signs the \"Live Healthy\" bill package on March 21, 2024. (Screenshot/Florida Channel) A House budget committee wants to slash a 10-year, $500 million health innovation loan program and a 15-member council charged with recommending how to spend the money. The House Health Care Budget Committee released a 12- page proposed budget conforming bill late Monday night, in advance of releasing its proposed health care spending blueprint for state fiscal year 2024-25. The bill makes additional conforming changes to the state Medicaid program meant to help implement the proposed health care budget. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Specifically, PCB HC 25-01 eliminates a recently-enacted law championed by Sen. Gayle Harrell that was considered part of former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo’s “Live Healthy” initiative , a multi-pronged approach to bolstering the state’s health care workforce and infrastructure to provide for an aging population. Passed in 2024, Harrell’s SB 7018 created the 10-year revolving loan program within the Florida Department of Health (DOH). The law directs the state’s chief financial officer to appropriate $50 million to the DOH annually to fund the loan program, meaning the program would receive $500 million in state funds over its lifetime. Sen. Gayle Harrell (Photo via the Florida Senate.) Harrell told the Florida Phoenix Tuesday that she was surprised by the move and was “not happy.” “I’m seriously concerned about it. I don’t think it is appropriate to do that. We just passed it last year. It’s going to take several years for the Innovation Council to be up and running. We’re just starting to get the first look at the kinds of things that are really going to change the state.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement When asked if she thought it was being eliminated because of the hefty state commitment Harrell replied: “It’s an investment, and it’s going to change the direction of health care through innovation.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX The goal was to provide low-interest loans to applicants to implement one or more innovative technologies, workforce pathways, or service delivery models that: Increase efficiency in the delivery of health care; Reduce the strain on the health care workforce; Increase public access to health care; Improve patient outcomes; Reduce unnecessary emergency department visits; Reduce costs for patients and the state without reducing the quality of patient care. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement SB 7018 also declared legislative intent to “harness the innovation and creativity of entrepreneurs and businesses, together with the state’s health care system and stakeholders.” I think everyone's going to weigh in and I think when it's all said and done we're going to come to the right place. – Sen. Kathleen Passidomo A 15-member Health Care Innovation Council was established in the DOH and charged with making recommendations to the department for the administration of the loans. Among the council members are the lieutenant governor, who serves as the chair, the secretaries of the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Children and Families, and the Department of Elderly Affairs; the director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities; the state surgeon general; and the chair of the Council of Florida Medical School Deans, among others. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to a staff analysis of the budget conforming bill , the Health Care Innovation Council has met twice since its inception and its last meeting was Nov. 19. The House budget conforming bill also makes changes to the Casey DeSantis Casey DeSantis Cancer Research Program, requiring it to consider specialty hospitals for children when awarding cancer research grants. The proposed budget bill doesn’t make the broad changes to cancer funding t hat the DeSantis administration has called for . While Harrell says she’s “seriously concerned” about the proposal, Passidomo is not. Sen. Kathleen Passidomo (Photo via the Florida Senate) “It’s not set in stone and I’m not really involved in the budget process right now,” Passidomo, chair of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, told the Florida Phoenix Tuesday evening. “I think it’s all part of the process. We are going to be going to conference and we’re going to be discussing so many issues.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement She added: “The (budget) conference process is unique and it never ends up the way it starts. I think everyone’s going to weigh in and I think when it’s all said and done we’re going to come to the right place.” This story has been updated to include comments from Sens. Kathleen Passidomo and Gayle Harrell. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE About Our Ads"

Education is Your Right! Don’t Let Social Norms Hold You Back. Learn Online with TUKO. Enroll Now! Image for illustration purposes only. Photo: James Wakibia. Source: Getty Images Yet, amidst the chaos, a golden opportunity exists - one that we are woefully underutilising. The country has doctors and clinical doctors who have transitioned into law, professionals uniquely positioned to tackle the legal and administrative bottlenecks strangling our healthcare sector. Why, then, are we failing to tap into this expertise? Maroa Rioba, a clinical medicine graduate and advocate, shares her opinion on the issue. Having walked the wards as a clinician and now argued cases in court as an advocate, I have seen the failures of both systems up close. PAY ATTENTION: TUKO is in WhatsApp Channels now! Subscribe and read news in favourite messenger. The problems facing healthcare in Kenya are not just about a lack of medicine or personnel; they are deeply rooted in poor governance, weak legal frameworks, and a lack of accountability. Read also Reviving Moi University: 5 strategies to restore lost Glory of Eldoret-based premier institution If we are serious about reform, we must stop treating symptoms and start curing the disease at its root. Healthcare on life support The problems in our healthcare sector are well documented. Public hospitals are underfunded, medical staff are overworked and underpaid, and corruption remains rampant. Meanwhile, doctors and nurses frequently engage in industrial strikes over poor working conditions, while patients, especially in rural areas, face devastating medical negligence with little legal recourse. The law, which should provide solutions, often does the opposite. Medical malpractice claims take years to resolve, healthcare professionals are prosecuted without proper legal defense, and policies affecting the sector are drafted by people who have never set foot in a hospital’s emergency room. It is absurd. We need legal minds that understand medicine—those who have stitched wounds, diagnosed illnesses, and dealt with the ethical dilemmas of medical practice—to guide these decisions. Why medical-legal professionals are the missing link An old African proverb says, “A chick that will grow into a rooster can be spotted the very day it hatches.” Read also Gen Z's unyielding voice: A new political challenge for William Ruto Similarly, the solution to our healthcare crisis has been in plain sight all along—medical professionals who have ventured into law. These individuals can provide practical, experience-driven legal guidance in several key areas: i) Fixing weak healthcare policies Many of our healthcare laws are outdated or ambiguous, leaving room for misinterpretation and mismanagement. A medical advocate understands both the letter of the law and the realities of medical practice, making them the best candidates to draft, amend, and interpret policies that work. ii) Defending Medical Practitioners The rising number of medical professionals facing criminal prosecution for medical errors is alarming. While accountability is necessary, we must differentiate between negligence and unfortunate medical outcomes. A lawyer with medical training can argue these cases with the nuance they deserve, preventing unjust convictions while ensuring genuine malpractice is addressed. iii) Protecting Patient Rights Many Kenyans suffer in silence after receiving poor medical care, either because they do not know their rights or because they lack the resources to pursue legal action. Medico-legal professionals can play a key role in advocating for these patients, ensuring that hospitals uphold ethical standards and deliver quality care. Read also Moi University sacks over 300 workers, cites operational costs: “Hatujafurahia” iv) Mediating Healthcare Disputes Legal battles between healthcare workers and government institutions often drag on for years, leaving hospitals in limbo and patients suffering. Instead of endless court cases, why not have specialized medical-law tribunals where disputes can be resolved quickly and fairly? v) Strengthening Hospital Governance Public hospitals continue to bleed funds through corruption and mismanagement. Having medical-legal experts in hospital boards and government health agencies can help close these loopholes, ensuring transparency and proper accountability in the allocation of resources. What is way forward for Kenyan health workers? It is time to rethink how we approach healthcare governance. We have trained professionals who understand both the complexities of medicine and the intricacies of the law. Why aren’t we giving them a seat at the decision-making table? The government should: Establish medical-legal advisory boards to provide expert guidance on healthcare legislation and dispute resolution. Appoint medical advocates to hospital management boards and regulatory bodies. Read also Nairobi doctor explains link between diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure Encourage universities to introduce medical-law training programs to equip more healthcare workers with legal expertise. Support alternative dispute resolution for medical cases to avoid unnecessary criminalisation of medical practitioners. Final thoughts Kenya’s healthcare system is at a crossroads. We can either continue on this path of inefficiency and legal chaos, or we can embrace the expertise of those who understand both medicine and law to bring about real change. The choice is clear. If we truly care about saving lives and ensuring justice, we must start utilizing medical-legal professionals to fix the broken system.

    "article_text": "iStock The Delhi government on Tuesday allocated Rs 12,893 crore for the health sector in the 2025-26 budget to support flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, set up two new medical colleges, and add 16,186 beds in government hospitals. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta presented the 2025-26 budget in the Assembly, announcing a significant push to strengthen the capital's healthcare infrastructure. A major portion of the budget will support flagship schemes like Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), aimed at providing financial protection and affordable healthcare to more families in the capital. In her budget speech, Gupta said the government is committed to transforming Delhi's healthcare system by strengthening critical care services, expanding primary healthcare facilities, and modernizing medical infrastructure. \"Our goal is to ensure no one is left behind when it comes to quality healthcare,\" she added. The budget earmarks Rs 1,666.66 crore under the Pradhan Mantri - Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) to boost critical care blocks and diagnostics, alongside Rs 320 crore for setting up 400 Health and Wellness Centres (HWC), also known as Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM). Live Events Additionally, Rs 9.92 crore has been allocated for the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, aiming to digitize patient records and improve accessibility to healthcare services. With a total outlay of Rs 12,893 crore for the health sector - including Rs 3,421 crore for capital projects - Gupta said the government is determined to make Delhi a hub of quality healthcare and medical education. The government has also allocated Rs 147.64 crore to expand financial protection under the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), ensuring more families benefit from free, cashless treatment for serious illnesses. \"We are determined to transform Delhi's healthcare system with sustainable reforms, modern infrastructure, and digital innovation. Every citizen - rich or poor, young or old - deserves access to affordable, high-quality healthcare,\" Gupta said. She also announced that two new medical colleges will be established in Delhi to improve healthcare services and boost medical education. \"This will provide high-quality medical education to Delhi's youth and create new employment opportunities in the healthcare sector,\" she said, adding that the previous AAP government \"never took strong steps\" in the health sector. \"It is our aim to make Delhi a hub of health and education, and this initiative will give our youth an opportunity to excel in the medical field,\" Gupta added. Highlighting the current shortfall in hospital beds, Gupta cited World Health Organization (WHO) norms, which recommend 5 beds per 1,000 people. \"At present, Delhi has only 2.7 beds per 1,000 people--far below the required standard. This is why patients face long queues for OPD services, medicine, and diagnostic tests. The shortage of doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff, combined with limited radiology facilities like CT scans, MRIs, and PET-CTs, further strains the system,\" she said. To address this, the government plans to complete 24 pending hospital projects, including 7 ICU hospitals, 4 new hospitals, and the expansion of 13 existing facilities. Once completed, these projects are expected to add 16,186 new beds to Delhi's public healthcare system. Promoting holistic healthcare, Gupta announced the establishment of the Delhi State AYUSH Society (DSAS) to encourage alternative medicine systems like Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The total budget outlay for the health sector stands at Rs 10,295 crore, including Rs 3,421 crore for capital projects and Rs 6,874 crore for various health schemes, programs, and infrastructure development. \"Our goal is to provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality healthcare to every citizen of Delhi - whether rich or poor, young or old,\" Gupta said, emphasising that sustainable reforms and modern infrastructure will pave the way for a healthier, more resilient capital. Presenting the Rs One lakh crore budget - a 31.5 per cent increase from the previous year - Gupta said the government is committed to ensuring quality healthcare for all. Criticising the previous administration's performance, she claimed it \"failed to provide basic healthcare facilities.\" The last government started 24 projects that ended up being of no use. Our goal is to make Delhi's health system stronger and more accessible to all, she said. The Chief Minister also announced plans to fast-track the construction of 10 to 13 new hospitals, with Rs 1,000 crore allocated specifically for the initiative. \"We are determined to build a robust, modern healthcare system for Delhi - one that serves everyone efficiently,\" Gupta added. This is the first budget presented by a BJP-led government in Delhi in over 26 years, following the party's victory over the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in last month's Assembly elections.

This year's edition offers an unprecedented look at patient engagement solutions, ranging from end-to-end comprehensive platforms to specialized niche, EHR-agnostic applications. The guide explores cutting-edge trends including AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, omnichannel communication, enhanced interoperability, cybersecurity innovations, and the surge in personalized healthcare engagement tools. It may be download without cost at https://blackbookmarketresearch.com/2025-black-book-of-patient-engagement-and-healthcare-consumer-communications-technology. Key findings reveal that 85% of healthcare organizations are now investing in AI-powered patient engagement technologies, while 78% of consumers prefer digital communication channels. Additionally, 43% of health systems plan to transition away from legacy engagement platforms by Q3 2026, signaling a significant shift towards advanced, integrated solutions. Doug Brown, founder of Black Book Research, emphasized, \"Patient engagement technology is rapidly evolving into an essential component of healthcare delivery. Our 2025 report underscores that healthcare organizations that strategically integrate AI, interoperability frameworks, and secure, consumer-focused solutions will be best positioned to enhance patient outcomes and improve operational efficiency in an increasingly digital healthcare environment.\" Comprehensive Vendor Profiles and Market Insights The guide includes detailed profiles of 224 vendors across 14 solution and niche categories, providing clarity on the strengths and market positioning of industry-leading providers. These profiles highlight solutions tailored to various healthcare settings including hospitals, health systems, payers, and physician practices, enabling informed comparisons and strategic decisions. New Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Focused on Emerging Technologies Traditional performance metrics - such as Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and generic online satisfaction ratings - have long been used to assess healthcare IT vendors, but in the realm of Patient Engagement and Healthcare Consumer Communication Technologies, these measures have proven inadequate. They fail to capture the complexity of digital patient interactions, interoperability effectiveness, AI-driven personalization, and secure data exchange. As a result, healthcare IT leaders have often lacked the nuanced, actionable insights needed to make informed vendor decisions - limiting innovation and overlooking truly high-performing solutions. To solve this, Black Book led an extensive, multi-stakeholder initiative involving CIOs, vendor executives, academic researchers, and digital health leaders to develop a new, purpose-built set of KPIs specifically for this rapidly advancing sector. These new metrics account for technological innovation, including AI-powered engagement, FHIR-based interoperability, cybersecurity resilience, and patient-centered communication outcomes. The 2025 guide now applies this rigorous framework to identify top-performing vendors with real-world impact - empowering decision-makers to move beyond outdated benchmarks and adopt solutions that truly enhance patient experience, care delivery, and digital transformation outcomes. In-Depth Coverage of AI, Cybersecurity and Interoperability Trends The report provides extensive analysis of AI integration in patient communication, showing administrative workload reductions of up to 60% through chatbot adoption and increased patient adherence rates by as much as 38%. It also addresses the critical issue of cybersecurity, noting a 42% rise in cyberattacks on healthcare organizations, underscoring the urgency for blockchain-based patient identity solutions and biometric security advancements. Additionally, the document explores interoperability trends with over 90% of major healthcare organizations projected to implement FHIR-based APIs by 2027, significantly reducing manual errors and improving care coordination. Analytics and Data Science in Patient Engagement Newly featured analytics and data science sections emphasize the growing role of predictive analytics in patient engagement. Organizations leveraging these advanced tools report a 30% reduction in patient no-shows and a 24% decrease in preventable ER visits, demonstrating the clear financial and clinical benefits of data-driven patient engagement strategies.

The United States spends billions of dollars on basic science research, drug development, and clinical trials, but after that, it leaves it up to the health care system to make sure that effective treatments get in the hands of patients who need them. It can take 17 years for research evidence to make it into routine clinical practice. In the meantime, patients needlessly suffer. Moreover, it is a waste of those billions of dollars spent on medical research. As an example, despite the known effectiveness of medications such as buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder, only a quarter of patients who need such medications receive them. Advertisement There is, however, one branch of science dedicated to solving the last mile problem in health care. It is called health services research , and it examines and seeks to improve the effectiveness of health care delivery, i.e., the extent to which it provides care based on the best evidence available. It also seeks to improve the quality of health care delivery in other ways, making sure it is safe, efficient, equitable, timely, and patient-centered . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, is the federal agency that funds health services research, but the Trump administration has proposed defunding it or eliminating 80 to 90 percent of its workforce, similar to what it has done to the US Agency for International Development. This will cripple the agency’s ability to improve the health care system, which is in dire need of improvement. Advertisement I am a physician and health services researcher, and AHRQ has been the major funder of my research for the past 25 years. As a hospitalist — a general internist who cares for acutely ill medical patients in the hospital — my concern is the quality of health care for patients regardless of the disease they have. Indeed, most of my patients have multiple chronic diseases, and often new conditions as well. Unlike the various institutes of the National Institutes of Health, which concern themselves with one disease at a time, AHRQ focuses on patients as a whole and acknowledges that many patients have more than one condition. Over the years, AHRQ has funded my research in a number of areas, such as how to make sure patients take their medications safely and correctly when they leave the hospital, how to improve electronic medical records so they make care better and not worse, how to improve handoffs in the hospital (such as when a medical resident goes home for the night), and how to reduce diagnostic errors and delays in the hospital. Most of my colleagues depend on AHRQ funding as well. Over the past decade, AHRQ has funded some of the most significant health services research conducted in the United States, from how to prevent hospital-acquired infections to how best to treat opioid use disorders in rural populations , how to improve communication among health care workers , how to improve patients’ health literacy , and how to speed time to admission from the emergency department . It is estimated that implementing just one AHRQ-funded study on reducing hospital-acquired conditions prevented an estimated 20,500 deaths and saved $7.7 billion in health care costs from 2014 to 2017. Advertisement So if the administration’s stated goal is to “Make America Healthy Again,” why cut the only federal agency whose sole mission it is to improve the quality and safety of health care delivery? AHRQ has in fact been a target of Republican administrations for years, and the reasons have varied over time . This time, it could be part of broader anti-DEI efforts (since some health services research focuses on disparities in care by race, ethnicity, and gender). Or it could be part of a general attack on federally funded medical and scientific research. Most likely, it is the false belief that studies of what works in health care will lead to rationing and government overreach. It is true that some AHRQ-funded research concerns itself with identifying care that is ineffective or inferior to other alternatives. As for rationing, well, insurance companies ration health care all the time by not covering certain medications and procedures or by denying care. Wouldn’t it be better if decisions about what care is worth receiving were based on the best evidence of what works and who benefits? Regardless of political affiliation, we can agree that patient safety and effective health care should be protected — not politicized. The Trump administration may cynically assume that no one will miss AHRQ if it’s gone. After all, most people have never heard of it. And its half a billion dollar budget is small potatoes compared with $50 billion for NIH. But you will indeed miss it if the quality and safety of health care delivery deteriorates because of a lack of knowledge of how to improve them. Congress must step in and safeguard AHRQ’s funding, and citizens should speak out, urging their representatives to support this vital resource. Given the current state of health care in this country, AHRQ’s budget should be increased, not eliminated. By protecting AHRQ, Americans can choose a health care system driven by evidence, guided by safety, and committed to the best outcomes for all. Advertisement"

    "article_text": "New ‘Game Changer’ Health Care Bill Would Make Health Sharing Payments Tax Deductible The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other’s health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans. United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (photo: Vlad / Shutterstock) Madalaine Elhabbal/CNA Nation March 24, 2025 Three U.S. representatives have introduced a bill that supports American taxpayers who choose to participate in health sharing, a care option favored by Christians and pro-lifers for its religious freedom protections. If passed, the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act would designate health sharing payments as tax deductable, alleviating costs for families who opt for health sharing over traditional health coverage, many of whom do so for religious reasons. The act was introduced by U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Greg Murphy, R-North Carolina; and Chris Smith, R-New Jersey. “Unfairly, Americans have been historically penalized by the tax code when they chose to use faith-based health care sharing ministries to meet their health care needs. The Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act will remedy this problem, ensuring Americans are no longer disadvantaged by the tax code for their religious beliefs,” Smith said in a press release on March 14 . Health sharing became a popular alternative to mainstream insurance coverage over a decade ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which included a mandate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requiring insurance plans to fund contraception, sterilizations, and early abortion pills. The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other’s health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans. Legal disputes over religious freedom violations that precipitated from the Affordable Care Act continue today, with the Supreme Court set to hear a case in June regarding a part of the law governing preventative care. “Americans should have choices when it comes to their health care. For many families, traditional insurance is a great option. For some, however, particularly people of faith, alternative options such as health care sharing ministries more closely align with their values,” Kelly said in the release. “This legislation preserves that choice for families by allowing them to deduct payments made as part of their ministry membership in their taxes by classifying regular ministry expenses as medical care expenses,” he added. “It’s time we focus on initiatives that reintroduce freedom and dignity back to our health care system.” Solidarity HealthShare collaborated with the three congressmen on the legislation. Founded in 2012 in wake of the Affordable Care Act, Solidarity HealthShare facilitates health sharing among individuals and families across the country who are looking to opt out of traditional insurance for a more faith-centered option. “Solidarity is grateful for the leadership and support of Congressman Mike Kelly and his team, who have consistently taken the lead in working for tax parity for health care sharing ministry members,” Solidarity HealthShare President Chris Faddis and CEO Brad Hahn told CNA in a statement. “His introduction of the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act has the potential to be a game changer for families who have chosen to escape the troubled landscape of traditional health insurance but have been unable to benefit from tax deductions available to other Americans,” the executives added. “This bill is the culmination of an industry-wide effort to provide tax relief to members of health care sharing ministries,” they said, adding: “We are also thankful for the support of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing and other health care sharing ministry partners for advancing this effort.” Keywords: catholic healthcare Toggle Comments Show Comments"

With a commitment to excellence, HCT is transforming health care training through advanced technology, immersive learning experiences and strategic international partnerships. The HCT, the Philippines’ largest health care skills training center, is at the forefront of transforming health care education through advanced technology, strategic global partnerships and a steadfast commitment to bridging the gap between academia and industry. Upholding the highest worldwide training standards, HCT has been leading health care education advances since its founding in 2007. By incorporating best practices from international health care organizations, HCT has produced generations of Filipino medical professionals who are equipped to handle the challenges of a constantly evolving field. “The world knows Filipino nurses to be the best. What you don’t often see or hear is that the first six months of employment are the worst, as stated by many medical doctors,” said HCT president Armand del Rosario. In order to keep its training programs in line with international standards, HCT works closely with leaders and organizations in the health care industry worldwide. To keep up with new developments and industry best practices, especially when it comes to incorporating technology into instruction, the institute attends international conferences. “We’ve witnessed how the Western world has incorporated virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) into health care education,” Del Rosario said. “Now, we’re making sure Filipino nurses gain access to the same innovations.” A testament to this commitment is HCT’s recent three-year partnership with UbiSim, the world’s leading virtual reality simulation platform for nurses. Exclusively run on Meta Quest VR headsets, UbiSim provides immersive, hands-on training that enhances clinical judgment, decision-making and confidence among students. While the UbiSim partnership marks a major milestone for HCT, the institute is also exploring future collaborations to expand its impact beyond the Philippines. According to Del Rosario, “We have pending partnerships in Europe, Canada and the US. At this time, we are concentrating on optimizing the potential of virtual reality training, but we are also considering how we can apply our knowledge to other healthcare domains and regions in the future.” Through consistent innovation, bolstering international collaborations and ensuring that training aligns with real-world needs, HCT is reinventing the future of health care education. The institute’s innovative work is shaping the next generation of medical professionals and enhancing the Philippines’ standing as a world leader in health care education.

    "article_text": "Dozens of Lifespan employees gather for the announcement of the health system's name change to Brown university Health during a press conference in the lobby of Hasbro Children’s Hospital on June 20, 2024. Rhode Island has nearly 15,000 unionized health care workers. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) The Rhode Island health care system faces a number of significant threats to its viability. In Washington, D.C., Congressional Republicans are proposing significant cuts to Medicaid spending , while locally, for-profit hospital owners are filing for bankruptcy protection and state leaders grapple with the fallou t. As labor leaders, we share the concerns of many Rhode Islanders about the condition of our health care system. In our small state of just over 1 million people, over 50% of us are insured through either Medicare or Medicaid . In our hospitals, over 70% of patients are covered by public health care plans. That leaves only 25% of hospital patients covered by commercial insurance, well below our neighboring states of Massachusetts (30%) and Connecticut (29%). What most Rhode Islanders might not know: The next largest group of insured Rhode Islanders get their health care from a union-negotiated health insurance plan, whether they are a union member or not. Even though there are about 9,000 unionized state employees, approximately 33,000 people are insured through union plans. It’s not only because of the dependents we cover, but also because our plan also covers non-union workers like managers and supervisors, as well as their families. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the Ocean State, there are close to 15,000 unionized health care workers; so, not only are our members consumers of health care services, but we are also providers of health care. We have a vested interest in making sure our health care system is as strong as possible. That is why we believe all Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the state of our health care system should encourage more workers to join labor unions where they work. To us, increased unionization is a key component to a strategy ensuring every Rhode Islander has access to affordable health care services while simultaneously addressing a health care funding crisis that seems to get more precarious by the day. As a recent poll commissioned by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO found, there is strong public support for unions in the Ocean State, with more than eight in 10 Rhode Islanders agreeing that unions “are necessary to protect the working person.” There are just over 500,000 Rhode Island based non-farm jobs in the state according to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training . About 80,000 of these jobs are protected by collective bargaining agreements. We know from sources like the U.S. Department of Treasury that not only do unions raise the wages of their members by 10 to 15%compared to similar non-union jobs, but that all workers in markets with a heavy union presence see economic improvements. On top of that, 96% of union members have employer- provided health insurance compared to just 69% of non-union workers. We have a vested interest in making sure our health care system is as strong as possible. That is why we believe all Rhode Islanders who are concerned about the state of our health care system should encourage more workers to join labor unions where they work. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now imagine there were 10,000 more union members in Rhode Island by the end of 2025. If the average wage paid to a Rhode Island worker averages $65,000 per year , and these workers, through collective bargaining, could increase their wages by 10%, that would mean the individual worker would see a salary increase of $6,500. In a state with just over 1 million people, that means an additional $65 million in economic activity, leading to increased tax revenues from income and sales taxes. It would also mean these 10,000 workers, and their dependents, would be much more likely to have commercial health insurance. This could equate to as many as 25,000 fewer people on Medicare, meaning our hospitals would receive adequate payments for the services they provide, instead of relying on low reimbursement rates from public health insurance plans. Please don’t misunderstand our point of view. As trade unionists, we believe that in a perfect world, there would be some form of national health care system where every American’s health care would be provided for without concern for the cost to the patient and their family. But we don’t live in a perfect world, and Rhode Island is confronting a crisis today. According to Rhode Island General Laws § 28-7-2 , “…it is declared to be the public policy of the state to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.” This section of law refers not only to the public sector workers, but to those in the private sector as well. It is why the AFL-CIO refers to Rhode Island as a “labor state” and why, we think, we can use the power of organized labor to help address Rhode Island’s health care crisis. That is why we are calling on the collective leadership of the state — elected officials, business, community, and other civic leaders — to join with us during the next few months as the General Assembly debates next year’s state budget and encourage as many Rhode Islanders as possible to join with their coworkers and negotiate for better wages and benefits. The entire state of Rhode Island would be better off if more of our proudly working-class state were part of organized labor. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Idaho Governor Signs Bill to Protect Religious, Conscience Rights of Doctors and Nurses Religious-freedom protections are bolstered. Idaho Capitol (photo: Shutterstock) Tyler Arnold/CNA Nation March 21, 2025 Idaho Gov. Brad Little this week signed legislation that bolsters religious-freedom protections for doctors, nurses and other medical professionals when they object to performing certain procedures or providing certain services. The new law , signed on Wednesday, amends the Medical Ethics Defense Act to clearly establish that Idaho recognizes “that the right of conscience is a fundamental and inalienable right” whether one’s conscience “is informed by religious, moral, or ethical beliefs or principles.” Under the law, no health care professional, health care institution, or health care payer can be forced to participate in or pay for any medical procedure, treatment, or service to which he or she objects as a matter of conscience. The law also prevents employers from retaliating or punishing an employee based on his or her conscience objections to any medical service. It states that a person should communicate his or her conscience objection to the employer as soon as reasonably possible to ensure necessary staffing adjustments can take place. Under the law, a health care provider cannot be held criminally or civilly liable for refusing to provide a medical service because of the institution’s conscience objection. Some objections from Catholic institutions or health care professionals could include procedures and services related to abortion, contraception, and transgender drugs and surgeries. Greg Chafuen, who serves as legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement that “patients are best served by health care professionals who are free to act consistent with their oath to ‘do no harm.’” “Unfortunately, doctors and nurses have been targeted for caring for their patients by refraining from harmful and dangerous procedures,” he said. “What may be worse, countless young professionals are kept out of the health care field because of fear that they will be forced to violate their conscience.” Chaufen added that the Idaho law “ensures that health care professionals are not forced to participate in procedures that violate their ethical, moral, or religious beliefs.” Idaho’s law also establishes stronger free speech protections by prohibiting departments and regulatory boards from punishing health care providers for engaging in speech, expression, or association that is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution from government interference. The law also creates a framework for health care institutions and health care professionals to file lawsuits to remedy any violations of the new regulations.

[Photo/Xinhua] Hainan province, one of China's most popular tourist destinations, recently launched a three-year action plan to boost its healthcare sector, with the unveiling of various supportive measures, such as transforming existing buildings into healthcare facilities and reducing land leasing costs for businesses. According to the plan, some existing buildings could be redeveloped, allowing for the transformation of facilities including vacant commercial spaces, factories, school buildings, offices and training facilities into those for healthcare services. Hotels and resorts could launch such services if their operational conditions meet regulatory standards. Enterprises are also being encouraged to redevelop residential properties into such service facilities after necessary checks. Gao Min, president of the Hainan Health and Wellness Tourism Association, highlighted the potential of the plan. \"The transformation of existing properties into healthcare service facilities can boost the development progress of the province's healthcare sector,\" Gao said. \"With the measures transforming more existing facilities into healthcare facilities, Hainan will be better able to meet the ever-upgrading demands from tourists.\" The plan also advocates for the development of rural collective construction land. Sun Xiangtao, executive director of the Hainan Rural Holiday Tourism Association, said: \"Over the past few years, rural tourism in Hainan has seen significant improvements in terms of infrastructure and services, along with a refreshed ecological environment, making Hainan an ideal choice for travelers looking for healthcare services. \"The plan will also boost village homestays and lift the occupancy rate of rural tourism accommodation, contributing to the development of Hainan's rural healthcare tourism.\" The island province aims to build a niche market by launching healthcare projects that leverage its natural conditions, and medical and cultural resources. Hainan has the charm to attract investment and major enterprises to this end, experts said. \"Flexible land supply, along with policies promoting the transformation of existing properties, have lowered the barriers for entry, making it particularly attractive among small and medium-sized enterprises as well as newcomers,\" Gao said.

    "article_text": "Audio By Carbonatix The Ghana Chamber of Private Medical Groups (Chamber of Health) has expressed its readiness to work with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) to improve private healthcare delivery and strengthen Ghana’s health insurance system. The Chamber, led by its president, Dr Andre Kwasi Kumah, On Thursday paid a courtesy call on NHIA Chief Executive Officer, Mr Victor Asare Bampoe at the head office of the Authority in Accra. The meeting introduced the newly formed Chamber and provided an opportunity to discuss concerns affecting private healthcare providers. It also explored ways for the private sector to work more effectively with the NHIA. Dr Kumah explained that the organisation was created to unite private healthcare service providers and give them a stronger voice in engaging policymakers. “When we assumed office two years ago, we realised the private health sector was fragmented, making it difficult to engage effectively with policymakers,” he said. “At our AGM, we decided to bring all players in the private health sector together under one umbrella to strengthen our discussions with stakeholders.” He welcomed the NHIA’s recent policy measures, including the uncapping of the National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL) and ongoing tariff reviews, expressing hope that these would lead to timely and adequate reimbursements for healthcare providers. Private sector concerns The delegation raised several issues affecting private healthcare providers, including tariff reviews, payment delays, and the role of private facilities in national health initiatives. Mr Charles Fordjour, a representative of the Healthcare Federation of Ghana and a member of the delegation said private health facilities play an important role in the country’s healthcare system. He noted that in many sub-Saharan African countries, private providers deliver over 60% of health services. “We need to change the perception that healthcare solutions should only centre on the public sector,” he said. “Private hospitals, pharmacies, and diagnostic centres are a major part of the system, and policies must reflect that reality.” Dr Mrs Rebecca Acquaah-Arhin, another member of the delegation, called for fair tariff structures under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), arguing that private hospitals provide crucial services under the scheme and should be adequately supported. “If NHIS is covering patients in private hospitals, then the tariffs must reflect the actual cost of service delivery,” she said. “We are not just running businesses; we are contributing to national healthcare.” NHIA’s response NHIA Deputy CEO (Operations), Dr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, acknowledged the role of private health facilities in expanding access to healthcare. While private providers operate as businesses, he noted that they also serve public health needs and should be included in national healthcare planning. “For us to achieve universal health coverage, government and the private sector must work together,” he said. “We recognise the role of private facilities, and ongoing discussions will help address challenges such as the fair distribution of health services and human resource allocation.” Dr Bampoe welcomed the Chamber’s initiative and assured the delegation that the NHIA was open to engaging private healthcare providers. He said the Authority was working to improve efficiency, transparency, and service delivery, particularly through technology-driven solutions. “A major challenge for us is addressing illegal co-payments, which erode public confidence in the NHIS,” he explained. “We recognise that this issue is tied to tariff levels and payment timelines, and we are working on solutions to address it.” Mr Bampoe outlined the NHIA’s priorities, including improving claims processing, tackling illegal co-payments, and advancing the government’s plans for free primary healthcare and the Mahama Cares initiative, which deals with non-communicable diseases. “We are working to ensure that NHIS payments are prompt and that tariffs are realistic,” he said. “But beyond that, we must strengthen controls to eliminate illegal charges and build a system where basic healthcare is accessible to all,” he added. The meeting ended with both parties agreeing to continue discussions to strengthen Ghana’s healthcare system.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news ‘Everyone' over 18 should make this 1 estate planning move, attorney says—you can do it for free By Judy Lagrou, CNBC • Published March 21, 2025 • Updated on March 21, 2025 at 9:13 am BOOKMARKER Goodboy Picture Company | E+ | Getty Images Estate planning isn't just for the rich or the elderly . Anyone can die or become incapacitated — and without the right legal documents in place, your family and loved ones may be left struggling to make important decisions and paying thousands of dollars in legal fees. There's one simple estate planning move anyone can make to help your family avoid costly and time-consuming court battles, says Zach Wiegand, an attorney at Gold Leaf Estate Planning in Burnsville, Minnesota. \"Everyone over the age of 18 should have a health-care directive,\" Weigand says. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Simply put, a health-care directive — otherwise known as an advance directive — is an umbrella term for legal documents in which you name a specific person to make decisions about your health care if an injury or illness renders you unable to do so. Without these documents, the state decides who will make medical decisions on your behalf, which may not be the person you want. \"If something happens to you, your parents can't just step in; they need legal authority,\" says Eido Walny, attorney and founder of Walny Legal Group in Milwaukee. That's why a health-care directive is so important, he says. This is also critical to have if you're engaged, in a same-sex partnership or wish to appoint a close friend to make health-care decisions on your behalf. Without a health-care directive, your loved ones may have to petition the court for guardianship, which might require them to \"pay thousands of dollars for an attorney to go to court,\" Weigand says. The process could go on until you either recover or pass away. \"That can be a huge burden on a family,\" Weigand says. How to complete a health-care directive for free A health-care directive consists of a living will and a health-care power of attorney. Although the exact definition of each varies by state, a living will generally explains your health-care wishes, particularly concerning end-of-life care. A health-care power of attorney names an individual to make health-care decisions on your behalf, whether or not your condition is terminal. Good news: You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to put these documents in place. The National Alliance for Care at Home and AARP both offer free health-care directive forms for every state that you and your loved ones can complete and print out in minutes. Once completed, most states require your health-care directive to be either notarized or signed in front of witnesses. No matter your state's specific rules, the National Institute on Aging recommends that you provide copies of your health-care directive to your chosen health-care proxy , family members and doctor. Most hospitals also provide free health-care directives upon request, says Weigand. They'll place a copy in your medical records to make sure it is honored in an emergency. If you would rather have someone else handle this planning for you, Walny recommends scheduling a consultation with a local estate planning attorney to understand all of your options. \"Many estate planning attorneys are happy to sit down with you [to discuss your health-care directive] and not charge you for it,\" Walny says. \"Having that conversation can be very, very helpful, and if you don't like the fee, you can walk away.\" An attorney can also help you complete a durable power of attorney, which allows a loved one to pay your bills and manage your finances should you become incapacitated. \"If you're in a coma in the hospital, and someone needs to access your bank account to pay your cell phone bill or pay your rent, having a power of attorney document in place is really important,\" Weigand says.

    "article_text": "By Allison Perry March 21, 2025 LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 21, 2025) – After extensive efforts to negotiate a new agreement, UK HealthCare announced that its contract with insurance company Cigna Healthcare will end on May 1, 2025. This change means that, as of that date, UK HealthCare facilities and providers will no longer be part of Cigna’s medical insurance network. Despite numerous proposals over the past several months to establish a fair and sustainable fee schedule, UK HealthCare and Cigna have been unable to reach mutually agreeable terms. As a result, and following Cigna's expressed desire to conclude negotiations, UK HealthCare will no longer be an in-network provider for Cigna members after April 30. About 4,500 patients at UK HealthCare are anticipated to be impacted by the change. UK HealthCare remains committed to ensuring these patients receive uninterrupted, high-quality care during this transition. Cigna patients will continue to have in-network access to UK HealthCare services through April 30. Affected patients are encouraged to contact Cigna for guidance on care options and to stay informed about how this change may impact their health care services. UK HealthCare is also seeking further information from Cigna to assist patients requiring continuity of care for ongoing treatment after the contract ends. After April 30, access to UK HealthCare’s emergency departments will still be available to patients for covered emergency services, regardless of network status. Learn more about what emergency services are covered under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. For additional information, patients can visit UK HealthCare’s FAQ page or contact Cigna by calling the number on the back of their insurance card. A list of insurance providers accepted at UK HealthCare is available here . In the 2023-24 fiscal year, UK HealthCare hospitals managed more than 45,000 patient discharges, more than 38,000 surgeries, over 123,000 emergency department visits and more than 1.4 million hospital-based outpatient clinic visits. UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state’s only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns and the region’s only Level 1 trauma center.

    "article_text": "The Nigerian Government has been advised to integrate Artificial Intelligence-driven telemedicine healthcare in the nation’s hospitals. Prof. Chuks Ekwueme, the Chairman of Uniccon, gave this advice on Thursday while addressing reporters in Abuja, adding that such move would transform Nigeria’s healthcare landscape. He said a country of over 200 million citizens should work towards making the healthcare system easily accessible and affordable. According to him, Nigeria should aim at expanding access to quality healthcare in rural communities. Ekwueme said healthcare should be convenient, not complicated, adding that AI-driven telemedicine healthcare would ensure access to quality medical advice in minutes to anyone, regardless of location or financial status. Ekwueme said such AI system would offer users/patients a robust healthcare application, that would ease or bridge the gap in accessing healthcare service in Africa, especially when individuals understand how hectic the process could be, due to fewer nor underfunded medical facilities. He said this initiative would provide instant virtual consultations, smart symptom analysis, and accessible healthcare services across the country. “It will also reduce cost, gap in manpower supply, increase efficiency, increase reach and reduce stress on government facilities,” he said “It will be a very good initiative for Government owned hospitals to collaborate with telemedicine providers, by integrating that into it’s hospital management system. “With a doctor-to-patient ratio far below WHO recommendations…AI system will help to analyse symptoms and recommend next steps, significantly reducing consultation times and improving diagnosis accuracy. “Given the shortfall in healthcare workers, health centers and funding, Telemedicine remains the easiest, fastest and affordable means of offering a certain category of health services to the rural areas. He said that the telemedicine does not supplant physical consultation or examination, especially in the cases of emergency.

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: BJP's Maithili Thakur to lose Alinagar seat? Here's what pollsters said The Growing Challenge of Medical Inflation The relentless rise of medical inflation remains one of the most pressing issues in India’s healthcare landscape in 2025. According to several leading surveys, India’s medical inflation is expected to rise, with costs increasing by 13.2%—a scary 0.9% higher than the Asia-Pacific average of 12.3%. This trend is driven by several factors, including healthcare technology advancements, skyrocketing demand for sophisticated treatments, and historically high labor costs. The impact of this is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is straining household budgets; on the other, it is underscoring the importance of health insurance . Think about it, organ transplant surgeries can cost upwards of 20 lakhs, making it nearly impossible for a large section of the population to afford without insurance. At the same time, India’s large population and growing middle class create a strong demand for better healthcare services that drives supply constraints, and in turn, higher costs. This is further compounded by the limited talent pool of healthcare professionals, which limits the availability of affordable care. Another key driver of medical inflation is the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on healthcare spending associated with emergency healthcare supplies and services. For all the physical and financial ruin the pandemic left in its wake, it did reveal the vulnerability of the Indian healthcare system and brought to light the need for robust financial protection mechanisms like health insurance. Why Health Insurance is More Important than Ever As the healthcare sector continues to evolve, managing these costs requires strategic planning, including opting for comprehensive health insurance policies that cover a wide range of medical expenses. Unfortunately, the rising medical costs have a direct influence on health insurance premiums as insurers face higher claims due to increased treatment costs. With rising medical costs, health insurance premiums are also increasing. In 2025, premiums are expected to rise by 10% to 15% due to higher treatment costs, increased claims, and regulatory changes. This trend makes health insurance not just a precaution but a critical financial tool. Take Ramesh’s story, for example. Last year, Ramesh, a 42-year-old schoolteacher, suffered a heart attack. The hospital bill came to ₹8 lakhs—an amount that could have wiped out his family’s savings. Fortunately, Ramesh had a health insurance policy that covered most of the expenses. \"Without the insurance, I don’t know how we would have managed,\" he said. \"It allowed us to focus on my recovery rather than stressing about the money.\" This is but one of the many stories that perfectly illustrates how critical health insurance can be. Health insurance isn’t just about financial relief during a medical emergency. Comprehensive policies often cover preventive care like annual health check-ups and screenings, enabling early diagnosis and treatment. Catching health issues early reduces the risk of severe complications and helps manage chronic conditions more effectively. Government Initiatives and the Path Ahead According to the Impact and Policy Research Institute (IMPRI), despite a 10% increase in the health sector budget for 2025-26, India's healthcare spending remains low compared to other major economies, at 3.28% of GDP. This low spending is a concern, given the vast and diverse healthcare needs of the population. To address this issue, the government has increased allocations to health initiatives like Ayushman Bharat and medical infrastructure development. The latter includes efforts to enhance public healthcare infrastructure and reshore medical supplies manufacturing to mitigate the effects of medical inflation. The former, Ayushman Bharat, is one of the largest health insurance schemes worldwide. It aims to provide financial protection to over 100 million poor and vulnerable families with a scheme that offers a cover of up to Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. By expanding health insurance coverage under such schemes, the government aims to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare, which currently accounts for a significant portion of household spending. According to PRS Legislative Research, the Indian government’s health expenditure and initiatives in the 2025-26 budget are set to ensure equitable access to healthcare across the nation’s population. Despite these efforts, challenges persist. The financial strain of healthcare costs is evident in the fact that 62% of hospital costs in India are paid out of pocket, with 23% funded through borrowings. This financial burden often leads to catastrophic health expenditure, pushing families into poverty. With health insurance, this risk can be mitigated and families can rest easy knowing that their medical emergencies won’t lead them to financial crises. As medical inflation continues to rise, individuals must consider health insurance not just as a precautionary measure but as a necessary investment in their health and financial security. By understanding the causes of medical inflation and the benefits of health insurance, individuals can better navigate the challenges of the healthcare system. The government's initiatives to enhance healthcare infrastructure and expand insurance coverage are crucial steps toward ensuring that more citizens have access to affordable healthcare. However, individual responsibility in securing health insurance remains vital to managing the financial risks associated with rising healthcare costs. As India moves forward, it is essential to address the systemic challenges that contribute to medical inflation. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure, promoting domestic manufacturing of medical supplies, and ensuring that health insurance policies are comprehensive and accessible to all segments of society. By combining these efforts with individual actions to secure health insurance, India can better mitigate the impacts of rising medical costs and ensure a healthier, more financially secure future for its citizens.

    "article_text": "A sweeping bill that would expand reporting requirements related to sexual misconduct allegations against health care workers and impose fines for failure to report serious incidents gained initial approval from a House committee Wednesday. The bill follows a Tribune investigation last year that exposed how Illinois health care systems failed to protect patients from sexual abuse and how state government failed to hold them accountable. State Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, the bill’s sponsor, said during the hearing that the legislation will close a “critical gap” in communication and could “prevent dangerous behaviors from being hidden or left unaddressed within health care settings.” She referenced the Tribune investigation while presenting the initial version of the bill Wednesday. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Tribune series identified multiple well-known Illinois health systems that had fielded allegations of sexual abuse but allowed those physicians, nurses and other workers to continue caring for patients. The reporting also exposed gaps in state oversight of the health care industry that left patients vulnerable to harm. One story in the series revealed how Endeavor Health allowed obstetrician and gynecologist Fabio Ortega to continue seeing patients despite complaints about his conduct and after learning that he was under police investigation. Ortega later pleaded guilty to felony criminal sexual abuse of two patients. The doctor was accused of abuse by dozens of former patients, and Endeavor Health has settled more than 75 lawsuits related to those allegations. In November the health system disclosed it was spending $453 million on “costs, expenses and settlement of claims” related to a doctor it did not name accused of sexually abusing patients. Cassidy noted that while the legislature passed a bill last year that addressed one issue — a law that expanded which health care facilities must report patient abuse allegations to the Illinois Department of Public Health — “the problem goes well beyond that.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The new bill would require that health professionals who witness or hear about sexual misconduct by health care workers to report it to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which oversees health care workers’ licenses, within 24 hours. Health institutions would also be required to report allegations of misconduct to IDFPR within 24 hours of initiating an investigation into alleged misconduct, or when a worker is terminated or resigns following an allegation of misconduct. It would impose fines of $25,000 to $75,000 for failure to report and then place that money into a sexual assault survivors fund. The bill also expands reporting requirements for law enforcement, instructing law enforcement agencies to notify IDFPR within 30 days of opening an investigation into a licensed health care worker, arresting a health care worker or filing felony or serious misdemeanor charges against the person. In December, the Tribune revealed that despite a law mandating prompt action when licensed health care workers are charged with certain criminal offenses, it often took the state weeks or months to require that the health professional only provide care under the supervision of a medical chaperone or for the state to take other action. The bill is joint effort by IDFPR, IDPH and Gov. JB Pritzker’s office, along with Cassidy, she said. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association is currently in opposition to the bill, but the association’s senior vice president of government relations, David Gross, told committee members the group is working with the representative in coming to an agreement. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “What is not fleshed out yet is the role and responsibilities of the state and its agencies in ensuring prompt resolution to what could essentially be thousands of unfounded reports,” Gross said. State Rep. William Hauter, a Republican from Morton, said he was in support of the effort but raised concerns about the bill. Hauter, who is an emergency medicine doctor and anesthesiologist, said health care workers often deal with patients with altered mental states. “Our licenses, that’s a thing that we worked our whole life for, and to have that stain on there, even if it’s going to be investigated and removed, in some way I feel like it’s really putting a lot of health professionals at risk,” Hauter said. Cassidy responded that she understands the concerns of health care providers, but also wants to ensure that the facilities and health systems are addressing and not hiding these issues.

The Health Care Licenses Committee voted 9-5 Wednesday in favor of the initial bill, but Cassidy said she planned to bring the matter back to the committee with an amendment before the bill moves to the House floor. Tamara Holder, an attorney who represented many of the women who filed lawsuits against Ortega and Endeavor, said the bill would force more communication when it comes to allegations of sexual abuse against health care workers. “Regardless of what the recipient thinks or feels about the information, it creates a legal duty to do something, which is to report it,” Holder said. _____ About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "By Rachel Rabkin Peachman , Forbes Staff. Rachel Rabkin Peachman is a Forbes senior editor. Follow Author Mar 19, 2025, 04:04pm EDT Updated Mar 20, 2025, 01:20pm EDT Share Save The Top 100 F or the past 10 years, Forbes has ranked America’s Best Employers—tracking companies and organizations as they’ve navigated an era of lightning-speed technological innovation, economic and geopolitical instability, a global pandemic that prompted drastic changes in how and where we do business, and cultural and generational shifts that have amalgamated the composition of the country’s adult workforce . Throughout all the changes, however, research over the past decade has shown that employees have remained relatively steadfast when asked what they care about most in an employer : compensation , employee development and advancement opportunities, meaningful work, supportive colleagues, and workplace well-being and flexibility. Most recently, a global survey of business leaders conducted in 2024 by AESC —a membership association for the industry of executive search and leadership consulting—found that the top factors that attract and retain leaders in the United States workforce are, once again, compensation packages and work-life balance. Finding Work, Life Balance getty images To assess which employers met or exceeded workers’ expectations this year, Forbes partnered with market research firm Statista to produce our 10th anniversary editions of America’s Best Midsize Employers and America’s Best Large Employers. The annual rankings were based primarily on survey responses from more than 217,000 employees working at companies within the U.S. that employ more than 1,000 people. The organizations were stratified so that companies with 1,000 to 5,000 employees were deemed midsize, while companies with more than 5,000 employees were considered large employers. Survey respondents (who remained anonymous so they could answer freely) were asked if they would recommend their employer to others and to rate it based on a range of criteria, including salary, work environment, training programs and opportunities to advance. Participants were also asked if they would recommend their previous employers (within the past two years) and the employers they knew through their industry experience or through friends or family who worked there. The responses were tallied and analyzed along with additional survey data from the last three years, which allowed for a robust assessment of organizations that consistently ranked well versus those that may have had just one good year. The more recent data and the evaluations from current employees were weighted more heavily than others. Ultimately, each employer was given a score, and the 1,199 organizations with the highest scores landed on one of our two final lists—498 on America’s Best Midsize Employers 2025 and 701 on America’s Best Large Employers 2025 . For the Top 100 employers on Forbes’ list of America’s Best Large Employers 2025, see below. As with all Forbes lists, companies pay no fee to participate or be selected.

    "article_text": "The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) recently organised a workshop titled 'Your License, Your Responsibility' for medical doctors working in the private and semi-government sectors and contact officers from private and semi-government healthcare facilities. The workshop was held at Itqan Medical Simulation and Innovation Centre at Hamad Bin Khalifa Medical City. The workshop aimed to raise doctors' awareness of the importance of obtaining a professional license, clarify the steps and requirements necessary to acquire and renew the license, outline the requirements for obtaining surgical privileges, and explain the consequences of non-compliance with licensure requirements. It also covered the requirements for continuous professional development. The session addressed several important topics, including the procedures and requirements for services provided by the Department of Healthcare Professions of the Ministry of Public Health, such as requests for changing the workplace, how to comply with the requirements for obtaining continuous professional development to renew a license, and the mechanisms for achieving it. Director of Registration at the Department of Healthcare Professions of the Ministry of Public Health Jawaher Al Ali stated that the workshop is part of the ministry's ongoing efforts to raise awareness among healthcare practitioners, especially medical doctors, about the need to obtain and regularly renew their professional licenses to ensure the safety and quality of healthcare services provided in Qatar. She emphasised that the practitioner is responsible for licensure. The Accreditation Section of the Department of Healthcare Professions presented a detailed overview of the National Medical Education and Continuous Professional Development Program during the workshop, noting that the program represents a significant advancement in the healthcare sector. It aims to deliver outstanding, high-quality healthcare services to all patients in Qatar in line with the National Health Strategy and Qatar Vision 2030. It is also mandatory for all healthcare practitioners in Qatar to actively participate in medical education and continuous professional development programs as a condition for renewing their professional licenses in the country. The Department of Healthcare Professions of the Ministry of Public Health accredited the workshop as part of Category 1 continuing medical education and professional development activities for the approximately 800 participating healthcare practitioners over two days."

Generate Key Takeaways Gov. Kim Reynolds was joined by health care professionals at a news conference Feb. 18, 2025 about her proposals to improve rural health care access. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch) House and Senate appropriations subcommittees on Tuesday advanced the governor’s health care proposal to expand Iowa’s medical residencies and increase funding for the state’s health care student loan repayment program, largely with support from advocates for Iowa’s medical providers. House File 754 and Senate File 575 are companion versions of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ bill aimed at addressing Iowa’s health care workforce shortages, and the lack of care available in rural Iowa. The legislation would consolidate Iowa’s current five student loan repayment programs and increase funding from $4.2 million currently to $10 million. The loan repayment program would be open to any person who commits to practicing in high-demand areas of Iowa for five years, even if they were trained out-of-state. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The measure also would increase the medical training available in-state through an increase of a projected 115 new residency slots at Iowa teaching hospitals, with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services directed to attempt to draw down $150 million in federal funding for the expansion. The University of Iowa and Broadlawns Medical Center, two teaching hospitals in Iowa, would provide the state match for that federal funding, Reynolds’ legislative liaison Molly Severn told lawmakers Tuesday. “Fully implemented over four years, 460 new physicians will be trained right here in Iowa,” Severn said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX There are several other components to the legislation, including another directive for Iowa HHS to seek approval from the federal government for Medicaid rate flexibility “with the goal of incentivizing creative regional partnerships,” allowing rural health care systems to be modeled after the state’s existing Centers of Excellence Program. The bill would also unbundle Medicaid maternal rates and allocate $642,000 to increase rates for providers serving mothers and infants. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Overwhelmingly, advocates representing health care professionals spoke in favor of the legislation. Seth Brown with the Iowa Medical Society said the bill takes several of the suggestions members of his organization made on how to address health care shortages in Iowa. “The workforce shortage has been a top issue for our members for a while now,” Brown said. “We released a set of recommendations in (2024) about what would move the needle, and most notably, the physician residency slots was top, and then incentives for those training in Iowa was the second. So having these in there was very important for us, and we appreciate it.” A majority of concerns brought up in the bill were about changes to the loan repayment program — specifically, professions covered by current loan repayment programs that would be no longer necessarily be defined as a “eligible health care professional” in the new legislation. Advocates representing physical therapists, social workers and nurse anesthetists, said they were concerned workers in their organizations currently utilizing the state’s loan repayment program would no longer be able to access the program. The legislation defines an eligible health care profession as “health care occupational categories that are in high demand,” determined using a list created and maintained by Iowa HHS. The list may include, but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse educators and mental health professionals. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Iowa HHS Director Kelly Garcia said the department is planning to hire a health care economist that will work with other HHS workers, as well as the Division of Insurance, to conduct an analysis on where there are physician shortages and where there are shortages in other professional and clinical areas. Garcia said this approach will “deepen our work quite considerably,” as Iowa HHS currently primarily assesses shortages “through a Medicaid lens,” she said. She said the list of high-demand health care professions and areas is currently in development, and that more information on the methodology of the list will be released when it’s finalized. Medical educators: Money to hire faculty is vital to expansion of doctor training She said this information will help HHS and lawmakers find how best to allocate money through the loan repayment program to address health care shortages in Iowa — information that is currently not being collected or used. “Today, largely, many of those programs today are first-come, first-serve,” Garcia said. “And so there’s really not an analysis today on like, ‘where does (the funding) need to go?’ And so if we come back to you and the governor and say, ‘Look, we (were) able to make these lists,’ and, ‘look, this is what the shortage looks like, this is what the impact is,’ we’ll have a clearer lens into that.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Cedar Rapids, said she was still concerned on “transparency” regarding the funding of the measure. Garcia said the only state cost to the program is the increase to the loan repayment program, and that other components would be financed through federal dollars and private-public partnerships. Garcia previously said the state aims to launch the new medical residencies by July 1, though requests for federal funding and changes have not been finalized. Iowa HHS posted its public notice Tuesday seeking changes to reimbursement rates for acute care hospital graduate medical education (GME) payments under Medicaid, a change that would require approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Since the global AI hype triggered by DeepSeek's rise earlier this year leads to global investors reassessing Chinese assets, Sinohealth has delivered stunning performance in capital markets, though it has recently seen a notable pullback. The question remains: How should investors evaluate this Group's opportunities? Unlike many peers riding the AI bandwagon for valuation boosts, the Group stands out for its tangible edge in AI healthcare. While earlier moves like integrating DeepSeek into its platforms, ranking on the \"2024 AI Innovation Development List,\" and launching a \"pharmacy agent\" were appetizers, the Group's recent reveal at the 10th Health Products Trade Conference - the \"Medical and Healthcare Omini-Scenario Intelligent Agent\" - marks a game-changing breakthrough. This could well be the holy grail of efficiency revolution in China's healthcare industry. As a 20-year veteran in healthcare data, the Group aligns its strategy with the global AI healthcare investment boom while capitalizing on China's healthcare reform and policy dividends. Investors should examine this story under a microscope. I. Strategic Positioning: The \"iPhone Moment\" for AI Healthcare? NVIDIA's Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that the convergence of data science, AI, and automation will drive exponential improvements in biology, positioning it as the next golden frontier. The \"iPhone Moment\" for AI healthcare has undoubtedly arrived. In other words, the healthcare industry, with the support of AI, has reached a point of revolutionary disruption for the mobile phone industry, similar to the time when the iPhone emerged. Against this backdrop, Sinohealth is building the underlying operating system for AI healthcare with its \"Medical and Healthcare Omni-scenario Intelligent Agent\", ushering in a new era of healthcare intelligence. The Agent is powered by two engines: \"Tiangong-No.1\" and \"Woodpecker\" medical middleware, supported by the Woodpecker Medical Large Model. Combining high-quality data, domain knowledge, and advanced model distillation, these agents offer solutions across commercial, medical, pharmacy, health management, and R&D scenarios, enabling closed-loop operations with \"intelligent decision-making, agile execution, and predictable outcomes.\", assisting the healthcare industry in improving efficiency and service quality. Unlike fragmented solutions from AI healthcare competitors, Sinohealth's five agents cover the entire healthcare value chain - data - decision - execution - mirroring Tesla's vertically integrated approach. Just as Tesla is committed to building an artificial intelligence enterprise with full-stack self-developed and vertically integrated technology capabilities from cloud side to end side, chips to algorithms, and hardware to software, Sinohealth is replicating this \"end-to-end integration\" in healthcare: from data infrastructure to algorithm engines, scenario optimization to industry collaboration, forming an \"AI healthcare gigafactory.\" Undoubtedly, the Group has defined a new height in AI healthcare. Under its omni-scenario empowerment, five intelligent agents including medical agents, pharmacy agents, commercial agents, health management agents, and R&D agents work together to not only promote industry efficiency, but also deeply connect the needs of patients, enterprises, and medical institutions, forming a value network of \"technology - industry - user\" trinity. This innovative achievement with AI technology as its core marks the official entry of the healthcare industry into the era of omni-scenario intelligence, and also provides a new paradigm for the digital transformation of the life sciences field. The core highlight of the \"Medical and Healthcare Omni-scenario Intelligent Agent\" is the moat composed of the \"Tiangong-No.1 + Woodpecker\" dual engines. Tiangong-No.1, based on leading data processing technology and mature data insights, integrates internal and external data and decision-making models through a complete master data system, algorithm system, and data security management system to help enterprises achieve optimal business decision-making. Woodpecker smart health management, based on serious medical logic, combines the world's leading AI engineering capabilities with the Group's vertical large models with unique industry application scenarios. It integrates years of technical accumulation and industry practice, aggregates life science technology solutions, achieves multi-scenario service and health management for patients, and improves the efficiency of clinical research on drugs and medical devices. The former has accumulated massive data resources, while the latter has mastered the know-how of diagnosis and treatment scenarios. The data flywheel effect generated by the two makes it difficult for later players to replicate. This is like how Bloomberg terminals are used for financial data. Without decades of deep cultivation and accumulation, it is impossible to develop the necessary service capabilities and achieve such industry penetration rates. II. Business Model Evolution: Predictable Three Catalysts for Value Acceleration The launch of the \"Medical and Healthcare Omni-scenario Intelligent Agent\" is of great significance to the healthcare industry and also marks a new milestone for Sinohealth. At the beginning of this wave of AI healthcare boom, the market was more focused on the prospects of the Group as a healthcare data solution provider with AI empowerment. Now, the launch of the intelligent agents means that it has officially upgraded to an AI-driven decision-making service provider. In other words, the Group's construction of the operating system for the AI healthcare era will bring about a brand-new evolution of its business model. This will lead to a triple value leap for the Group. First, the transformation from traditional data services to AI-driven decision-making services will open up higher profit margins and even create a new value-sharing model around the intelligent agents. For example, by adopting new revenue models such as \"software service + revenue sharing\" with pharmaceutical companies, medical product suppliers, and pharmaceutical retail enterprises, etc., this not only diversifies its revenue sources but also enables the Group to generate \"recurring cash flow\". Second, the \"decision-making dependence\" created by the intelligent agents elevates customer stickiness from the tool level to the strategic level. By deeply integrating into the core business processes of customers, it builds irreversible switching barriers. This also means that its dynamic analysis capabilities may be regarded as a necessity for pharmaceutical companies, medical product suppliers, pharmaceutical retail enterprises, etc. Such deep-seated binding will further enhance the customer lifetime value. In addition, the Group features not its data storage capacity, but the ability to refine data into reusable intelligent agents and apply them to real-world scenarios, resulting in marginal delivery costs approaching zero and perfectly aligning with the expansion logic of the software economy. The \"Tiangong-No.1\" commercial data smart middleware, \"Woodpecker\" smart health management and medical middleware can provide customers with standardized SaaS products, customized professional services, and overall solutions for different application scenarios in medicine and healthcare. This industrialized, standardized, and modular output not only has high efficiency, but also has a significant cost reduction effect due to the increase in scale. The future profit margin can be described as enormous. From a longer-term perspective, when the number of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and pharmacies connected to intelligent agents exceeds a critical point, the Group will have access to the largest real-time decision flow data in China's medical industry. The combination of data freshness and scene thickness can bring more opportunities for it to explore and develop medical large models and build a solid industry moat. III. Valuation Reassessment: Pricing Logic for Benchmarking Global AI Healthcare Giants? Sinohealth's valuation deserves reevaluation on multiple fronts: Firstly, the Group promotes the transition of the medical industry from \"partial intelligence\" to \"systemic intelligence\" through the collaborative evolution of five intelligent agents. The valuation premium formed by this intergenerational gap can be compared to Tesla's valuation leap when it switched from an \"EV maker\" to an \"energy ecosystem\". It can be seen that currently, compared to the valuation of traditional car makers, Tesla's premium level of over tens of times is also due to its construction of a closed-loop ecosystem of \"data - algorithm - energy\". Sinohealth's current 3x PS resembles Tesla's early days as an EV maker. If recognized as a \"healthcare intelligence OS,\" its valuation could re-rate toward a composite AI medical ecosystem platform. Secondly, the ecological level restructuring of the Group will bring about a new evolution to the existing business model, catalyzing future growth expectations to reach new heights. Imagine that when the five major intelligent agents form a data resonance of \"diagnosis and treatment - research and development - circulation\", the collaborative value generated will far exceed functional superposition, and the multiplier effect released will also be enormous. Whether it is the exponential decline in cost or the grid based reproduction of standard outputs, it will enable it to devour the AI healthcare market with near zero marginal costs. Obviously, this lifetime value has not yet been valued by the current market value. Finally, global peers like American AI medical leader Veeva (VEEV, 13.8x PS) and AI pharmaceutical unicorn Recursion (RXRX, 42.2x PS) trade at significant premiums, while domestic counterparts like Yidu Tech (02158.HK, 8.4x PS), a Chinese medical big data leader, also command higher multiples. Sinohealth's valuation appears substantially discounted. In the long run, with the continuous increase in the proportion of AI agent business revenue in the future, the Group is expected to catalyze its valuation thanks to sticky client base, stable growth rate, and high profitability. IV. Conclusion: Sinohealth Holdings' current upsurge is expected to mirror the growth path of Palantir in the US stock market. In its early days, Palantir established decision-making barriers by accumulating intelligence data of the US military through the Gotham platform. It also built two core capabilities: cross-domain data integration and in-depth adaptation to vertical scenarios, achieving a transition in its business model from \"customized services\" to a \"platform-based ecosystem\". Now, its market capitalization has reached $1.42 trillion, and in recent years, it has even seen a ten-fold increase in its stock price under the wave of AI popularity. It's not hard to anticipate that in the future, the Group's \"Medical and Healthcare Omni-Scenario Intelligence Agent\" will also be deeply integrated into the strategic decision-making chains of pharmaceutical companies, medical product suppliers, and pharmaceutical retail enterprises. It will occupy a core position in the ecosystem and convert its technological advantages into the power to set industry standards, creating high-level competitive barriers that are difficult to replicate. As AI healthcare transitions from hype to practicality, companies that bridge \"data - scenario - commercialization\" will emerge as ecosystem gatekeepers of the new healthcare ecosystem. In Hong Kong's ongoing valuation recovery, AI healthcare platforms with hardcore technology like Sinohealth could experience a \"Davis Double Play\", and the Group's omni-scenario intelligent agent has pressed the fast-forward button on its value reconstruction. 18/03/2025 Dissemination of a Financial Press Release, transmitted by EQS News.

Generate Key Takeaways Warning that the state’s health care system is “falling apart,” the Senate’s point person on the topic said Thursday that she wants to rein in for-profit and private equity entities as well as give regulators more muscle to control rising costs. Policymakers and health care industry leaders gathered for an annual hearing about the so-called benchmark state government sets as a goal for reasonable health care spending growth, where they unpacked new data that showed health care expenses surged at a near-record rate in 2023. Kicking off the event, Sen. Cindy Friedman did not mince words. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “We hear about a system in crisis. We’re beyond that. It is now falling apart,” said Friedman, who has co-chaired the Legislature’s Health Care Financing Committee since 2019. “It is imperative for us to dig into which services and entities are siphoning the most health care dollars and returning the least value, as well as those that offer more value at a lower cost. It’s time for the state, including the administration and Legislature, to take bold steps to rein in costs and refocus the health care system on the patient and the delivery of quality care to those patients, rather than money and profit.” The Center for Health Information and Analysis reported Wednesday that health care spending in Massachusetts grew at an 8.6% rate from 2022 to 2023, more than twice the 3.6% benchmark and the second-highest annual increase since state watchdogs began tracking the data a decade ago. CHIA researchers dubbed the 2023 growth rate “unsustainable,” and said the major drivers were increased pharmacy spending and new MassHealth supplemental payments to hospitals. After hearing several hours of testimony about the data and calls for change from major industry stakeholders, Friedman said she expects the Senate to “take another pass” at some of the topics, like private equity, that featured in health care debates last term. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “We still have this huge issue of private equity and for-profit in health care, and it’s driving a lot of this, a lot of these costs,” she told the News Service. “We’re going to do that, and then we’re going to attack primary care again and the prior authorization pieces, which is really driving people out of the business because they can’t provide the care that they trained for.” “We’re going to go back a second time, a third time, and push those because we really believe that they will have a major impact on care and quality,” she added. The Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey late last year enacted a pair of new laws, one aimed at reining in prescription drug costs and the other designed to boost hospital financial oversight. (CHIA’s latest annual spending report only covers 2023, so the new laws have not yet affected the topline data.) Beacon Hill created the benchmark process in a 2012 cost containment law. The figure is a target for spending growth, not a cap, and regulators do not automatically impose penalties when costs surpass the benchmark. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Friedman, an Arlington Democrat, said the data produced each year since the process started have “gotten better and better.” “There’s information in this report that is invaluable,” she said of CHIA’s latest findings. “I think what we haven’t done is give the [Health Policy Commission] -- and, to some extent, the Division of Insurance -- the tools to start to bring those costs down. I think that’s really the next step that we have to look at very carefully: how can we empower them in the work that they do to help us bring those costs down?” Leaders of the HPC have long asked Beacon Hill to give the agency more teeth and muscle to enforce spending growth limits. Friedman’s counterpart in the House, Rep. John Lawn, similarly said Massachusetts is “at a pivotal moment in health care,” especially as fears swirl about the Trump administration cutting federal funding for Medicaid or other programs. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “The health care sector is facing immense uncertainty and frustration, locally and nationally. We are grappling with the Trump administration’s fiscal policy upheaval. We may reasonably expect that Massachusetts will see a reduction in funding for critical health care services, a blow to our residents and our economy,” Lawn, a Watertown Democrat, said at the hearing. “But this is not a momentary shake. The generational health crisis caused by COVID-19 exposed and exacerbated a multitude of long-standing challenges, challenges that continue to affect our health care system today, from rising inflation to shifting patterns in care, ongoing supply chain disruptions and workforce shortages.” CHIA found that the statewide average premium increased 6 percent in 2023 to $631 per member per month. Researchers said pharmaceutical spending, new MassHealth supplemental payments to hospitals, and care provided in hospital outpatient settings -- which are generally less expensive than inpatient admissions but pricier than physician offices -- were major drivers of the overall growth. Several hearing attendees urged lawmakers and the HPC to train their focus on the pharmaceutical industry. Alex Sheff, senior policy and government relations director at Health Care for All, said keeping spending growth close to the benchmark “has to start with reining in prescription drug costs.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Without cost constraints on providers in the pharmaceutical industry, health plans cannot make health care more affordable for your constituents,” added Lora Pellegrini, president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans group that represents insurers. No one from the pharmaceutical sector spoke at Thursday’s hearing, but Stami Williams, director for public affairs at industry group PhRMA, said in a statement that CHIA’s report “doesn’t paint a complete picture.” “There are multiple factors that can influence spending on medicines that this report overlooks, including the number of medicines prescribed to patients,” Williams said. “We will continue to offer solutions to lawmakers that lower costs at the pharmacy and protect access to the medicines patients need.” Friedman noted early in the proceedings that different figures across the health care landscape tend to point fingers at one another. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I have heard from providers and health systems that reimbursement rates are too low, from health plans saying that reimbursement rates and pharmacy spending are too high, from independent pharmacies telling me they are struggling with low reimbursement rates and clawbacks, from [pharmacy benefit managers] that say that independent pharmacies are stable and they do not claw back claims, from pharmaceutical manufacturers saying discounts to 340B-covered entities are too high, and from community health centers and safety net hospitals telling me they cannot operate without full 340B margins, and so on,” Friedman said. “Now there’s a lot of nuance to these statements, and they can all be true to an extent, but it begs the question of where our health care dollars are really going if everyone says they do not have a big enough slice of the pie,” she added. The sharp rise in health care spending came as Bay Staters struggled with rising pocketbook pressure on many other fronts. CHIA analysts crunched data from several sources, and found that the 9.7% growth in wages and salaries in Massachusetts from 2021 to 2023 lagged not only cost changes for health care premiums but also the growth in center-based child care prices (15.8%), New England housing expenses (19%) and New England food expenses (26.8%) in the same span. Eileen McAnneny, president of the Employer Coalition of Health, urged policymakers to weigh health care costs “in the broader context” of other factors affecting businesses, including energy prices and unemployment benefits. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I just ask: we can’t accept these double digit health care costs year over year and then wring our hands when health care costs go up,” McAnneny said. We have to actually do something, and I would suggest with urgency.” Download the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.

    "article_text": "From insurance-driven private health care to equity Premium The government must invest in preventive, community-based care that is accessible to all Published - March 17, 2025 12:08 am IST Pooja Sagar, Aruna Bhattacharya READ LATER SEE ALL Remove ‘A robust primary health care system reduces the burden on secondary and tertiary care, and ensures cost-effective health care’ | Photo Credit: Getty Images As the world’s largest democracy, India has long been committed to ‘Health for All’ under the World Health Organization’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) framework, which prioritises primary health care (PHC) and to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE). India’s evolving health policies have shaped Budget allocations and influenced health-care service and delivery. With the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) addressing OOPE, there is now greater scope to strengthen public health systems, especially primary health care. This insurance-based programme reduces OOPE by covering hospitalisation, surgeries, and procedures at the tertiary level, but sidelines the UHC principle of primary health care. Despite improving financial protection, it discourages primary health-care use, weakens public health infrastructure, and strengthens market-driven private health care. Neglect of primary health-care systems A robust PHC system reduces the burden on secondary and tertiary care, and ensures cost-effective health care. When health is recognised as a citizen’s right, the state must ensure accessible and affordable PHC, whether publicly provided or well-supported. However, AB-PMJAY’s hospitalisation-based reimbursement shifts the focus away from preventive and community-based health care, increases long-term costs and reliance on private hospitals, and fails to reduce OOPE. This contradicts the Bhore Committee’s vision of strong primary health care, with a pyramid-shaped health system tapering to secondary and tertiary care. Since its launch in 2018, the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission dashboard reports the issuance of over 36 crore Ayushman cards and the empanelment of more than 31,000 hospitals. Although health is a state subject, PM-JAY reroutes funds to private insurance players, limiting state control. The 2025 Budget allocates ₹9,406 crore to AB-PMJAY, which is ₹2,000 crore more than the previous year, boosting privatisation and insurance-based financing. It remains unclear how much it will help reduce health expenditures for marginalised groups or support primary health care to lower out-of-pocket expenses for Below Poverty Line cardholders. Budget, privatisation, insurance overhaul The health budget allocates ₹95,957.87 crore to the Department of Health and Family Welfare and ₹3,900.69 crore to the Department of Health Research. The Budget prioritises medical digital infrastructure and medical education expansion over PHC. The National Health Mission, vital for grass-root health care, receives a declining share, signalling the state’s gradual retreat from its universal health-care responsibility and shifting the burden onto private players. This affects citizens, as insurance schemes merely consolidate capital at the public’s expense. Additionally, significant changes in the insurance sector include raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in the insurance sector from 74% to 100%, following a previous increase from 49% to 74% in 2021. This aims to improve India’s low insurance penetration, especially in rural areas, attract more players into the insurance market, and achieve “Insurance for All” by 2047. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) expects this to bring capital and expand coverage. Policy changes raise concerns for India’s informal workforce and marginalised urban populations. With the informal sector comprising a significant portion of the workforce, the lack of universal health coverage leaves millions without health security. The government has yet to outline how it will protect these vulnerable populations. Insurance illiteracy further complicates access, forcing many migrant and non-literate working classes to rely on middlemen. Without strict private sector regulation, OOPE is likely to increase due to inflated medical costs and uncovered consumables. Coverage for Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers and grass-root health-care providers remains uncertain. Compounding these issues is outdated data —the last Census was in 2011, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey was in 2020-21 — hindering efficient allocation and utilisation of social protection schemes. Lessons from global models Global experiences warn against an over-reliance on private insurance. In the U.S., insurance-driven pricing has led to skyrocketing health-care costs, widening inequalities, and limiting access for uninsured individuals. Public outcry over claim denials highlights the risks of corporate control over health care. India can learn from countries such as Thailand (tax funded universal coverage scheme) and Costa Rica’s Mandatory insurance scheme (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social). Both rely on general tax revenue, strong public health investments, and regulated private insurance, prioritising primary care and community-based services. As India navigates urban and health-care transitions shaped by the Budget and policy, it must reassess priorities. Instead of disproportionately favouring tertiary private health care through insurance models, the government must invest in preventive, community-based care that is accessible to all. Policies must address the health-care needs of informal workers, the unemployed, migrants, and vulnerable populations, especially with rising climate-related health risks. Comprehensive public health benefit packages, cost-control mechanisms, and programmes to reduce OOPE are essential for achieving UHC. Safeguards must be in place to prevent private insurance from driving up health-care costs, ensuring India’s commitment to ‘Health for All’ remains more than just a slogan.

    "article_text": "Flexible payment plans, bundled care packages, digital tools can cut medical care costs, says Aster DM’s chief Azad Moopen Published - March 15, 2025 07:18 pm IST Lalatendu Mishra READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Azad Moopen, Founder & Chairman, Aster DM Healthcare | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement With digital interventions such as telemedicine platforms, AI-driven diagnostics and mobile health initiatives already ensuring access for patients to specialists and timely interventions, going forward, innovative financing solutions, including flexible payment plans, bundled care packages and digital tools that provide real-time cost estimates and insurance eligibility, would help patients make informed choices and access affordable healthcare, says Dr. Azad Moopen, Founder & Chairman, Aster DM Healthcare in an interview. Healthcare costs can be a challenge for many in India. What are the key factors driving these high costs, and how can they be addressed? India’s healthcare landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation, blending technological advancements, infrastructure expansion, and enhanced clinical capabilities to deliver world-class care. As we strengthen quality outcomes, ensuring affordability remains a shared objective for all stakeholders. A significant portion of healthcare costs is linked to the rising adoption of cutting-edge medical technologies, which enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment precision. Simultaneously, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer requires sustained, long-term care, adding to overall expenditure. However, this scenario presents India with the opportunity to pioneer innovative approaches to cost management. Encouraging domestic innovation in medical devices and pharmaceuticals, investing in preventive health, and strengthening early screening programmes will significantly lower the need for expensive interventions. Collaboration across sectors — involving healthcare providers, technology innovators, insurers, and policymakers — will be key to striking the right balance between cost and quality. How can we ensure that quality healthcare is accessible and affordable for a larger section of society? India’s strength lies in its ability to innovate and find scalable solutions that work for its vast and diverse population. Expanding access to quality healthcare calls for a strong focus on primary and preventive care, complemented by advancements in digital health solutions. Telemedicine platforms, AI-driven diagnostics, and mobile health initiatives have already demonstrated tremendous potential in reaching remote communities, ensuring access to specialists and timely interventions. Going forward, innovative financing solutions including flexible payment plans, bundled care packages, and digital tools that provide real-time cost estimates and insurance eligibility, will empower patients to make informed choices. Through technology-enabled efficiencies, operational excellence, and clinical innovation, healthcare providers can work together to make quality care financially accessible to a far larger section of society. Government schemes support the underprivileged, and the wealthy can manage healthcare expenses, but what about the 400 million middle-class Indians? How can we ease their financial burden when it comes to medical care? India’s vibrant and aspirational middle class is one of the backbones of the nation’s economic progress, and ensuring their health security is an equally important priority. The penetration of health insurance is steadily increasing, particularly post-Covid, but it is a long way to go. As per NITI Aayog, nearly 400 million Indians lack access to healthcare. While approximately 70% of the population is covered under public or voluntary health insurance, the remaining 30%—equivalent to around 40 crore people—remain uninsured. The Out of Pocket expenditure, though as per the data by National Health Accounts Estimates 2020-21 and 2021-22 released by the Health Ministry in September 2024 saw a decline from 64.2% in 2013-14 to 39.4% in 2021-22, it is till a long way to go. In addition, hospitals and healthcare providers need to provide greater transparency around treatment costs, along with curated health packages and structured payment plans that provide predictability and ease financial pressures. Digital platforms that enable real-time cost estimation, insurance eligibility checks, and seamless cashless transactions will further enhance affordability and confidence in the healthcare system. Countries like the U.S. and those in Europe have well-established healthcare models. What steps can India take to develop a system that ensures high-quality and affordable care for all? India has the advantage of being able to draw lessons from global healthcare models while creating a system that is uniquely suited to its own socio-economic and demographic context. The country’s ongoing focus on strengthening primary healthcare, expanding health insurance coverage, and embracing digital health is already laying a strong foundation for inclusive and affordable care. What sets India apart is its entrepreneurial spirit, which has driven innovations such as telemedicine platforms, affordable diagnostic technologies, and community-based health programmes. By nurturing these innovations, encouraging public-private collaborations, and promoting health literacy, India can create a robust healthcare ecosystem that ensures quality care is accessible to all, while remaining affordable and financially sustainable. We firmly believe in the power of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to accelerate progress. By integrating AI-driven predictive analytics, teleconsultations, and remote diagnostics into national health systems, while encouraging corporate players to participate in social health initiatives, India can create a resilient healthcare framework that ensures quality, affordability, and access for all. Improving the medical infrastructure is also a key aspect in building a robust healthcare ecosystem that ensures accessibility and affordability and rightly so was addressed in the last Union Budget. The commitment to adding 75,000 MBBS seats over the next five years, including 10,000 in the forthcoming fiscal year and the number of medical colleges growing from 387 to 702 in the last 10 years is a positive step forward in addressing the gap. More doctors mean improved accessibility to quality healthcare, reduced patient load in overcrowded hospitals, and better primary care services. Additionally, an increased number of trained professionals strengthens specialised care in fields like oncology, cardiology, and emergency medicine, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes. Apart from doctors, building more schools of nursing and paramedics is also crucial to addressing the growing healthcare demands of the country. While significant progress has been made in expanding medical education, the shortage of trained nurses, paramedics, and allied healthcare professionals remains a major challenge. These professionals form the backbone of the healthcare system, providing essential support in hospitals, clinics, and emergency care. With India’s rapidly growing population and increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, there is a pressing need for skilled healthcare workers to bridge the gap in patient care. Given the low penetration of health insurance in India and the challenges around claim approvals, how can we make cashless treatment a reality for more people? The insurance penetration in in India though has been seeing an overall upswing, the response to the sector in last 5 years has been confusing. While post-covid there was a rise in demand for health insurance, in 2023-24, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at just 3.7%, declining from 4.2% in 2021-22. With the government’s initiatives to boost insurance penetration, including the expected benefits of 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), India’s insurance sector is projected to grow at 7.1% annually over the next five years. The relaxation of FDI limits is expected to bring in more capital, leading to innovation, improved infrastructure, and broader access to insurance products. A major barrier to health insurance uptake in India is limited awareness. In FY 2023, India’s insurance density reached just $95, compared to the global average of $889. This disparity highlights the need for widespread education and awareness campaigns. Leveraging technology to create seamless connections between healthcare providers, insurers, and patients holds great potential for making cashless treatment widely available. Digital platforms that enable real-time verification of policy coverage, paperless claims processing, and direct communication between hospitals and insurers can accelerate cashless adoption. There is also scope for creating simpler, modular insurance products that cover day-to-day healthcare expenses alongside hospitalisation, making cashless healthcare relevant not just for serious illnesses, but for regular medical needs as well. As digital health infrastructure expands, cashless treatment should increasingly become the norm rather than exception. The financial strain of treating cancer and rare diseases has impacted many families. What kind of institutional support or policies can help reduce this burden? India has made notable progress in expanding access to cancer care and treatments for rare diseases through dedicated programmes and specialised centres of excellence. The next step is to build on these efforts through collaborative models that involve healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and social enterprises working together to ease the financial burden on families. The Government of India is playing an active role in this as well by announcing, in the recent Union Budget, that it will facilitate the establishment of 200 Daycare Cancer Centres in all district hospitals across the country over the next three years. The Centre has also announced that 36 life-saving drugs, including those for cancer and rare diseases, will be fully exempt from customs duty. This builds on previous reductions in duties on drugs like Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib, and Durvalumab. There is also a move of 5% concessional duty on six additional life-saving medicines. Furthermore, the Government has announced the addition of 37 more medicines under the Patient Assistance Programmes, which will also benefit from customs duty exemptions. This move is aimed at improving access to critical medications for patients, particularly those with severe chronic conditions. While the Government of India is putting in all efforts, the healthcare industry has to work on innovative financing options, such as crowdfunding platforms for healthcare, dedicated health savings plans, and outcome-based insurance coverage for high-cost treatments. By enhancing early screening programmes for cancers, expanding access to genetic counselling for rare diseases, and promoting patient support networks, we can create a more holistic ecosystem of care that combines financial protection with emotional and clinical support. Collaboration across sectors will be key to ensuring that life-saving treatments are both accessible and affordable. What is Aster DM’s role in making healthcare more accessible and affordable, and how does it plan to contribute to universal healthcare in India? Aster DM Healthcare has always prioritised accessibility, affordability, and quality across its network in India and the GCC region. In India, we are actively expanding our presence across tier-2 and tier-3 cities, ensuring that advanced healthcare services are not confined to metropolitan areas. Our pan-India network of 19 hospitals, 254 labs, and 203 pharmacies already provides multi-layered access across primary, secondary, and tertiary care, supported by digital health innovations and community outreach through Aster Volunteers. Through initiatives such as Aster Volunteers, we deliver free health camps, screenings, and health awareness programmes to underserved populations. Aster is also increasingly adopting technology to improve access — from teleconsultations to AI-driven diagnostics — reducing the need for physical visits and lowering the cost of care. Our collaborations with government programmes, such as Ayushman Bharat, enable us to provide quality care to economically vulnerable populations. Additionally, we are exploring innovative care models, including day surgery centres, home healthcare services, and preventive care packages, to make healthcare more affordable while maintaining high clinical standards. Our long-term vision aligns with the national goal of universal health coverage — ensuring no individual is denied care due to financial constraints.

    "article_text": "Share We recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Long-Term Investment . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) stands against other best healthcare stocks for long-term investment. Rising Healthcare Costs and the Impact of Tariffs on the US Industry In the US, healthcare expenditures and costs have been increasing. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, US healthcare spending increased 7.5% from 2022 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. In 2023, the healthcare industry made up around 17.6% of the US economy, up 17.4% from 2022. The expansion of Medicare and commercial health insurance are the two main forces behind this growth. The impact of tariffs on this continuing trend has become a major topic of contention in the healthcare sector, as more and more US corporations are turning to China for deals on the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer arena. Versant Ventures managing director Carlo Rizzuto spoke on the effects of tariffs on healthcare on CNBC’s “Fast Money” on February 7. Tariffs might affect the sector in two ways, according to Rizzuto. Products developed in China and introduced to the US or other markets would be the first. The sector would need to see how the tariffs are set up in the market to comprehend how they would impact such trade operations. Second, and more concretely, the US healthcare industry uses China as a huge hub for contract production and research. As a result, anything that raises that expense is probably going to make the market more difficult. An increase in costs will not improve the running of the healthcare sector, which is already facing pressure from investors. China’s Role in U.S. Healthcare and Long-Term Investment Opportunities Speaking about China’s enormous influence in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, Rizzuto stated that the vast majority of healthcare organizations use a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some capacity during the research and development phase. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the way biotech and pharmaceutical companies function in the nation. From the tiniest businesses to the biggest, this pattern is very common. Simply said, the United States lacks the infrastructure to handle the transfer, thus healthcare corporations cannot reshore all of their externalized R&D and production to the country. Therefore, it is quite hard to understand how such a large-scale reshoring might occur. With the quantity of tariffs applied, the costs to accomplish this achievement can be computed linearly. According to McKinsey, healthcare EBITDA is projected to rise from a baseline of $676 billion in 2023 to $987 billion in 2028 at a 7% CAGR. Recovery from post-pandemic lows is anticipated to support the improvement in several segments, while growth is anticipated to be faster in other areas (such as specialist pharmacy and HST). Software platforms are essential to the healthcare ecosystem because they make it possible for payers and providers to operate more effectively in a complicated setting. By automating processes, fostering data connectivity, and producing actionable insights, technological innovation (such as generative AI and machine learning) keeps opening doors for stakeholders across all segments. McKinsey went on to say that increased utilization and pipeline expansion (as in cancer) are projected to drive substantial growth in specialty pharmacy revenue. Specialty pharmacy profit pools are still growing as a result of the rise in the use of specialty medications. Our Methodology For our methodology, we used a Finviz screener and picked stocks with a market cap of over 2 billion, a 5-year annual return of over 10%, and a low PE ratio under 20. We then ranked these stocks based on their total number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). A doctor in scrubs shaking hands with a patient, representing the healthcare services provided to individuals and families. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is a managed care organization providing health insurance primarily for low-income individuals through Medicaid and Medicare. Instead of manufacturing products, it delivers healthcare coverage via government contracts, premiums, and value-based care. The company also generates revenue from pharmacy services and supplemental products like dental and vision coverage. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) reported strong Q4 2024 and full-year results, with total revenue reaching $40.65 billion, a 19% increase from 2023. Premium revenue grew to $38.6 billion, which was driven by contract wins, acquisitions, and service area expansions, though partially offset by Medicaid redeterminations. The company’s profitability remained solid, with GAAP net income per diluted share rising 9% to $20.42 and adjusted EPS increasing 8% to $22.65. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is considered one of the best healthcare stocks , with a consolidated Medical Care Ratio (MCR) standing at 89.1%, and Medicaid MCR slightly above expectations due to redetermination-related shifts. The Medicare MCR was 89.1%, while the Marketplace MCR performed well at 75.4%. Operating efficiency remained strong, with a well-managed General and Administrative (G&A) expense ratio of 6.7%. However, operating cash flow declined to $644 million from $1.66 billion in 2023 due to timing differences in government receivables and payables. The company repurchased 1.7 million shares for $500 million in Q4, reflecting confidence in its value. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) continues to expand its presence in Medicaid and Medicare Duals markets, leveraging new contract wins to strengthen its competitive position and achieve long-term financial targets. Overall, MOH ranks 4th on our list of best healthcare stocks for long-term investment. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

    "article_text": "THE Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) commends the government's decisive move to enforce the display of medicine prices in private clinics and hospitals under the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011 (Act 723). This initiative, spearheaded by the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry, marks an important step toward enhancing price transparency and accountability within the private healthcare sector. For too long, consumers have faced a lack of price transparency in private healthcare facilities, leaving them vulnerable to excessive medical charges without the ability to make informed decisions. By mandating price display for medicines and services, the government is ensuring that patients know their rights, can compare prices, and make informed choices, fostering healthy competition among healthcare providers. Additionally, if there are any cartel-like practices within the industry, this measure will help reduce their influence and curb excessive profiteering. Why regulation is crucial for private healthcare Fomca firmly believes that it is the government’s responsibility to regulate both public and private healthcare sectors to ensure security, affordability, and accessibility. This is especially crucial in the face of rising medical inflation, which, if left unchecked, could create a wider affordability gap, making healthcare inaccessible to low- and middle-income groups. The reality is that some businesses take advantage of regulatory loopholes to engage in price manipulation, overcharging vulnerable consumers. The enforcement of price display regulations acts as a safeguard against such exploitative practices and ensures fairer pricing in private healthcare. Strengthening consumer protection laws While the government’s latest initiative is a step in the right direction, it should not stop here. There is a pressing need to fast-track reforms to key consumer protection laws, specifically: 1. Consumer Protection Act 1999 (CPA 1999) – To include comprehensive provisions that regulate pricing and service standards in private healthcare. 2. Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998 (Akta 586) – To close existing loopholes and ensure fair medical pricing. Currently, without specific legal provisions, private healthcare businesses actively lobby against regulations that would hold them accountable. This must be addressed to ensure a well-regulated, transparent, and fair healthcare system. Moreover, Section 10 of Act 723 grants the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister the authority to require any party selling goods or offering services to display their prices. Since private healthcare facilities both sell medicines and provide services, this provision can and should be used to mandate price transparency and prevent price gouging. Ensuring a consumer-centric healthcare system Fomca fully supports the Madani government’s direction in regulating private healthcare and urges further action to ensure comprehensive, consumer-friendly healthcare policies. Healthcare is not just a business—it is a fundamental service that should prioritise patient welfare over profit maximisation. The government must remain firm in its commitment to consumer protection by enforcing fair pricing, transparency, and accessibility in private healthcare. Fomca remains committed to working with policymakers and advocating for stronger consumer rights to ensure that Malaysia’s healthcare system remains fair, transparent, and accessible to all.

    "article_text": "Thailand General Government aims to overhaul healthcare funding PUBLISHED : 14 Mar 2025 at 04:00 NEWSPAPER SECTION: News WRITER: Apinya Wipatayotin Small Medium Large 1 Listen to this article Play Pause The government is preparing to revamp its healthcare funding systems, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said yesterday. He said the government is aiming to enhance efficiency and address inequalities across the four existing healthcare service models: the universal healthcare scheme (gold card), the Social Security Fund (SSF), medical benefits for civil servants and the Department of Local Administration's (DLA) health services. Mr Pichai disclosed the outcomes of yesterday's first committee meeting on the country's healthcare welfare system. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra appointed the committee on Jan 27. Mr Pichai chairs it. The committee, comprising 22 members, convened for more than two hours to discuss the state of the country's healthcare system, particularly in light of rising medical costs, which have been increasing at a rate surpassing that of the country's GDP. The discussion focused on reviewing healthcare quality, addressing disparities in medical treatment and evaluating pharmaceutical imports. Mr Pichai emphasised that healthcare benefits would not be reduced. Instead, the government aims to optimise budget efficiency and reduce inequalities in medical services. Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, National Health Security Office (NHSO) secretary-general and committee member, said Thailand annually allocates 360 billion baht to provide healthcare to 64 million citizens. He said per capita expenditures vary for each service model: 3,800 baht for the gold card scheme, 18,000 baht for civil servants, 4,900 baht for SSF members and 12,000 baht for DLA beneficiaries. With Thailand's ageing population and increasing healthcare needs, annual medical expenses are rising by 11%, outpacing the country's GDP growth rate, which averages 3%, Dr Jadej said. Another critical issue is pharmaceutical imports, which total 200 billion baht annually. Over 50% of these imports are branded medications despite the availability of equivalent generic drugs. The committee proposed collective negotiations to reduce costs while ensuring equitable and high-quality healthcare access. Additionally, the committee introduced eight key measures to guide its work, supported by two subcommittees: an academic subcommittee and an implementation subcommittee. Dr Jadej said the government spent 340 billion baht last year to provide healthcare to citizens across the four service models, accounting for 10% of the total national budget. He further revealed that plans to standardise benefits across all healthcare systems have been discussed, adding that current benefits will remain the same.

In response, global IT research and advisory firm Info-Tech Research Group has published new insights, providing cybersecurity strategies to help healthcare organizations defend against evolving threats. In the resource, Info-Tech stresses the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices and offers key strategies to security leaders to mitigate ransomware risks, strengthen data protection, and enhance incident response capabilities. TORONTO , March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - The 2024 Change Healthcare/UHC data breach underscored the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity within the healthcare sector. Exposing sensitive patient records and disrupting hospital operations, the breach highlighted significant vulnerabilities, particularly around the growing reliance on third-party vendors and outdated IT disaster recovery plans. To help security leaders take proactive measures to strengthen their defenses and protect patient care in the aftermath of cyber incidents, Info-Tech Research Group has published its blueprint Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization . Continue Reading Info-Tech Research Group's newly published blueprint provides a structured five-step approach to help healthcare organizations mitigate third-party ransomware risks. (CNW Group/Info-Tech Research Group) \"In today's healthcare landscape, organizations face increasing cybersecurity challenges due to their reliance on third-party vendors and complex IT environments,\" says Sharon Auma-Ebanyat , research director at Info-Tech Research Group . \"The largest healthcare breach involving Change Healthcare/UHC highlighted significant vulnerabilities, disrupting hospital operations and billing and exposing patient records. This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address these risks.\" The firm reports that despite the escalating cyber threat landscape, many healthcare organizations have yet to fully implement multifactor authentication, especially for remote access services, leaving critical systems exposed to attackers who exploit stolen credentials. Info-Tech's insights also highlight the challenges posed by interconnected IT environments, making it difficult for organizations to detect and address security gaps. \"Many healthcare organizations encounter obstacles such as outdated IT disaster recovery plans that fail to address virtual and digital connections, limited budgets and resources, and complex, interconnected systems that make it difficult to identify and fix vulnerabilities,\" adds Auma-Ebanyat. \"Traditional disaster recovery approaches often overlook the evolving nature of third-party risks and virtual environments, increasing susceptibility to cyberattacks.\" Info-Tech advises the need for a more comprehensive and proactive cybersecurity approach to mitigate these risks. Five-Step Approach to Mitigate Third-Party Ransomware Risks In its recently published resource Lessons Learned and Life After a Breach in Your Healthcare Organization , Info-Tech provides a structured five-step approach to help healthcare organizations mitigate third-party ransomware risks. The five-step approach includes: Evaluate and Prioritize Vendor Security Risks Healthcare organizations must assess vendor security risks and prioritize high-risk partners, especially those handling sensitive patient data. A dual vendor strategy for SaaS applications reduces dependency on a single provider, improving resilience against disruptions. Assess and Document Data Flows and Architecture Mapping data flows helps identify vulnerabilities and potential ransomware entry points. Strengthening network segmentation and containment strategies minimizes damage and prevents the spread of attacks. Review and Strengthen the Incident Response Plan Regularly updating incident response plans ensures organizations can react quickly to ransomware threats. Tabletop exercises can help teams test their response strategies and improve coordination during real incidents. Develop Data Governance and Classification A strong data governance framework ensures sensitive data is classified and protected. Implementing access controls and encryption enhances security, reducing exposure to ransomware threats. Strengthen Disaster Recovery and Security Considerations Robust data backups and redundancy systems ensure critical operations can continue during an attack. Strengthening authentication, encryption, and access controls further minimize the impact of breaches. \"This research offers a roadmap to mitigate third-party ransomware and data breach risks, featuring insights on current healthcare cybersecurity threats, lessons from the Change Healthcare/UHC data breach, and strategies to prevent future incidents,\" explains Auma-Ebanyat By leveraging insights from Info-Tech's blueprint, healthcare organizations can take decisive steps to enhance their cybersecurity strategies and disaster recovery plans. The expert-driven recommendations outlined in the data-backed resource will help security leaders protect sensitive patient data, maintain operational resilience, and prepare for evolving cyber threats.

    "article_text": "Agencies AGS Health sale (Image for representation) Global buyout funds Blackstone , Hillhouse Investment , TPG Capital , and General Atlantic have submitted non-binding bids to acquire AGS Health , valuing the healthcare IT services firm at around $1 billion, said multiple people aware of the development. EQT Partners, the Swedish fund that owns AGS Health, has hired JP Morgan and Bank of America to manage the sale process which will be launched by early next year, ET first reported in September 2024. EQT acquired AGS Health in 2019 for $320 million. Spokespeople at EQT, Blackstone, and General Atlantic declined to comment. Hillhouse and TPG Capital did not respond to email queries. Bloomberg was the first to report last year about EQT's plans to sell AGS Health. AGS Health is expected to post $60 million in Ebitda this fiscal year, and annualised revenue of about $150 million. The company provides revenue cycle management (RCM) services to healthcare providers and vendors in the US, with 12,000 employees across multiple offices in India, Manila, and the US. AGS Health serves over 150 customers, including prominent US hospitals and health systems. Its clients include laboratory testing services company Aegis Sciences Corporation, American Addiction Centers, ApolloMD, Auburn Community Hospital, DocuCare LLC, OhioHealth, Richmond University Medical Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Live Events EQT has a wide portfolio of IT/ITES companies with a strong presence in India. Last year, it acquired GeBBS, a competitor of AGS Healthcare, from ChrysCapital for $860 million. With this acquisition, EQT currently owns four healthcare IT services companies in India - CitiusTech, AGS Health, Sagility and GeBBS. TPG Capital has been an aggressive investor in the healthcare IT space globally. Its current portfolio includes Nextech, Lyric, WellSky, and IQVIA. Blackstone has a presence in the healthcare IT space through its acquisition of HealthEdge. The sale process of AGS Health comes amid growing interest in healthcare BPOs from private equity firms. In a similar deal, half-a-dozen buyout funds including Hillhouse Investment, Blackstone and TPG were engaged in a race to acquire Texas-headquartered healthcare BPO Access Healthcare last year. Eventually, US-based investment firm New Mountain Capital, LLC, trumped its rivals to acquire a significant majority stake in Anurag Jain-owned Access Healthcare at a valuation of about $2 billion two months ago. Other deals include Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan's acquisition of a 45% stake in US-based healthcare BPO Omega Healthcare, valuing it at $1.8 billion, TA Associates' buyout of a significant majority stake in Bengaluru and US-based RCM services provider Vee Healthtek for $250 million. According to a BCC Research study, the global healthcare business process outsourcing market is estimated to grow to $259.5 billion by 2028 from $151.9 billion in 2022, at a compound annual growth rate of 9.7%. Continuous rise in healthcare costs has fuelled the urgency to find effective cost-reduction strategies. Organisations are increasingly turning to BPO to streamline processes, cut expenses, and navigate the complex landscape of healthcare expenditures, it said.

Cambodia Healthcare Market Analysis 2025-2035: Rising Medical Tourism Drives Cambodia's Healthcare Market, Healthcare Sector Sees Investment Surge Research and Markets March 12, 2025 5 min read Company Logo Cambodia’s healthcare market is projected for significant growth through 2035, fueled by economic development, urbanization, and rising healthcare investments. The Phnom Penh region dominates due to its advanced medical infrastructure, while rural areas struggle with accessibility issues. The country faces a growing burden of chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, alongside persistent infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and respiratory infections. Government policies, foreign direct investment, and public-private partnerships are shaping the future of Cambodia’s healthcare sector. Medical tourism and pharmaceutical advancements further drive market expansion, presenting opportunities for investors and healthcare providers. Dublin, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Cambodia Healthcare Market - Analysis, 2025-2035\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The healthcare market in Cambodia has seen significant growth over the past decade, driven by economic development, urbanization, and increasing demand for healthcare services. As one of Southeast Asia's emerging markets, Cambodia is experiencing a rise in healthcare spending, both from public and private sectors. The Cambodian government has been focusing on improving healthcare infrastructure, expanding access to medical services, and addressing challenges like healthcare workforce shortages and limited access in rural areas. Key drivers of growth include a growing middle class, rising health awareness, and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Cambodia also faces a rising burden of infectious diseases, which has prompted both government and international organizations to enhance public health campaigns and disease prevention programs. Additionally, Cambodia's medical tourism sector is expanding, attracting patients from neighboring countries for affordable treatments. The Cambodian healthcare market is characterized by a mix of public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system, which is predominantly funded by the government, offers basic services, but quality and availability remain limited outside urban areas. The private sector, however, offers higher-quality care with modern facilities, attracting patients who can afford to pay for better services. Pharmaceutical companies and medical device providers also play a growing role in meeting the needs of the expanding healthcare market. With continued investment in healthcare infrastructure, policy reforms, and international partnerships, Cambodia's healthcare market is poised for further growth, presenting opportunities for both local and foreign investors. In Cambodia, the healthcare market is expected to be led by the Phnom Penh region due to its concentration of healthcare infrastructure, urbanization, and higher-income population. As the capital city, Phnom Penh has the highest density of hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals, making it the hub for advanced healthcare services in the country. The region's growing middle class, rising health awareness, and demand for high-quality medical care contribute significantly to the market's growth. Other urban areas, like Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are also experiencing growth, but Phnom Penh remains the dominant force due to its proximity to government institutions, international organizations, and foreign investment. Additionally, the capital's infrastructure development, medical tourism industry, and presence of international healthcare providers give it a competitive edge. Rural regions face challenges such as limited healthcare access, which hinders their ability to lead in the healthcare sector compared to Phnom Penh. In the Cambodia healthcare market, segmentation by disease type can be broken down into non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases. Story Continues Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs): Within this segment, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is expected to lead the market. With the increasing urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, poor diets, and rising tobacco use, CVDs are becoming the leading cause of death in Cambodia. Additionally, diabetes and hypertension are also on the rise, spurring demand for chronic disease management and treatment services. Communicable Diseases: Respiratory infections is anticipated to be the leading segment, diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, due to ongoing public health challenges, particularly in rural areas. Respiratory infections continue to burden the healthcare system, fuelled by environmental factors, limited healthcare access, and poor sanitation. In both NCDs and communicable diseases, increased awareness and demand for healthcare services are driving investment in treatments, diagnostics, and prevention programs across Cambodia.

    "article_text": "Innovative Platform Delivers Real-Time Pricing Data and Streamlines Compliance with New Regulations VIENNA, Va. , March 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to President Donald J. Trump's newly signed executive order reinforcing healthcare price transparency regulations, careviso , a leader in healthcare technology solutions and prior authorizations (PA), is proud to announce how its seeQer platform is empowering patients and healthcare providers with real-time, accurate, and actionable pricing data for medical services and prescription drugs. Although the No Surprises Act was enacted over four years ago to prevent surprise medical bills, especially in emergencies or out-of-network care at in-network facilities, inconsistent enforcement still leaves many patients vulnerable to high costs. Despite regulatory efforts, many insurers and hospitals continue to obscure real pricing data or publish machine-readable files so large that meaningful price comparisons become nearly impossible for patients. This executive order, however, aims to close these gaps by directing the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to ensure that hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices—not estimates—giving patients a clearer path to making informed healthcare decisions. careviso's seeQer platform is at the forefront of this change, aligning seamlessly with these transparency regulations by giving patients and providers unprecedented clarity into healthcare costs. By delivering real-time, accurate pricing data and eliminating the hidden fees and price discrepancies that have long burdened American families, seeQer helps ensure that healthcare pricing transparency is no longer just a policy goal, but a practical reality. In addition to pricing transparency, the platform offers real-time benefits verification (RTBV), allowing patients to instantly access details on their coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and network eligibility. Additionally, seeQer's Advanced Explanation of Benefits (AEOB) feature provides a comprehensive breakdown of expected costs before a procedure or treatment occurs, helping patients avoid surprise bills and make the most cost-effective healthcare choices. While this executive order marks a significant step forward, it primarily focuses on hospitals and insurers, leaving a critical gap for other healthcare service providers. Many routine medical procedures—such as those performed in physician offices or ambulatory surgical centers—are not fully addressed in these new regulations, meaning patients may still face challenges in accessing transparent pricing for a significant portion of their healthcare needs. As the industry moves toward greater accountability, solutions like seeQer help bridge these gaps, ensuring that patients have access to the full scope of financial information they need, regardless of where they seek care. \"At careviso, we believe price transparency is the foundation for improving patient access to quality healthcare,\" said Andrew Mignatti , CEO of careviso . \"seeQer gives providers and patients the real-time information they need to make informed, cost-effective decisions. By simplifying the financial side of healthcare, we're making it more accessible for everyone, giving patients the transparency they deserve about their healthcare.\" As healthcare providers and insurers work to meet these new regulatory requirements, careviso stands ready to support the industry with cutting-edge technology that streamlines compliance and enhances transparency. For more information about seeQer and how careviso is modernizing healthcare price transparency, please visit www.careviso.com . About careviso Founded in 2018, careviso is dedicated to transforming the healthcare experience by streamlining prior authorizations and enhancing financial transparency. With a focus on innovation and efficiency, careviso's platform helps healthcare providers and patients navigate the complexities of healthcare access and costs. To date, careviso has successfully completed over 2 million prior authorizations and 1 million financial transparency transactions, underscoring its role as a trusted partner in healthcare.

    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new secretary of Health and Human Services , is the nation’s de facto healthcare czar. He will have influence over numerous highly visible agencies , including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration , among others. Given that healthcare is something that touches everyone’s life, his footprint of influence will be expansive. Our nation’s healthcare system is fragile, in a constant state of teetering on the edge between precarious functionality, financial insolvency and, for some clinics, operational collapse. As with many large systems in our country, finances rule the roost. “ No margin, no mission ” is the mantra of many healthcare organizations. This means that every patient interaction with a healthcare provider ultimately includes the omnipresent hand of health insurance policy rules, inconspicuously but persistently imposing its influence in how they authorize any recommended or prescribed treatments by healthcare providers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In some healthcare organizations, providers are required by their clinic to generate as much revenue as possible. Revenue is earned based on the classification of healthcare services and products, which are mapped into Current Procedural Terminology or CPT codes . These codes are in turn measured by relative value units — the more units billed, the more revenue accrued by clinicians and their employers. There were more than 11,000 CPT codes available in 2024 . The way clinicians code each service during patient interactions ultimately determines how much they can bill and how much patients’ health insurance will pay. Such a system implicitly provides a structure to value medical skills and services. It is impossible to evaluate a screening for prostate cancer ( code 84153 ), an X-ray exam of an infant’s arm ( code 73092 ) or a cardiac shunt imaging ( code 78428 ) on the same scale. Yet the Relative Value Unit system effectively creates such standardization, taking a basket of bananas, oranges and apples and assigning each a value as if they were all grapes. How is this achieved? An American Medical Association committee creates a single financial measure across the diverse swath of medical treatments, determined by factors including time, intensity and cost. The benefit of such standardization is that health insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can pay for services based on it. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Such a payment model unfortunately encourages some clinicians to find ways to bill certain procedures, even if they have limited healthcare value. Good medicine for patients should drive billing, not the other way around. Moreover, every type of physician has its own set of codes and values. For example, surgeons perform surgery , cardiologists perform cardiac catheterizations , and primary care physicians perform wellness visits . The value assigned to activities associated with each specialty may contribute to physician satisfaction, or dissatisfaction. It may also influence how medical students choose their specialties . The assigned values may even be a factor driving the looming shortage of all physicians and specialists . Healthcare is big business in our nation. Given that the per capita cost of healthcare in the United States is higher than any other country , yet our health outcomes are middling or poor, by several measures , one must ask whether all those healthcare dollars are delivering better population health. The data suggest that they are not. Unraveling financial motives from medical decision-making is a challenge. Indeed, CPT codes should be used to classify health services, their intended purpose. A focus on creating wellness rather than treating sickness would incentivize healthcare providers to grow their prevention practices and reduce the necessity for treatment. This can be captured in the value assigned for such efforts. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The current state of healthcare in our nation is unsustainable. Simply injecting more money into the system is bad for medicine and bad for the economy. Secretary Kennedy has an opportunity to make a difference. One place to look is the CPT codes and how the relative values are set, to determine if they are placing “ carrots ” for healthy living in the appropriate places within our healthcare system or paying for services and products that treat disease without encouraging wellness. Changing the compensation model for healthcare providers will not be easy. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rely on CPT codes. Many countries around the world also use them, with claims that they reduce costs . Yet per capita healthcare costs in the United States are at least 40 percent higher than in other wealthy countries . The U.S. also spends at least 2.5 times more on the cost of administration than such countries. Clearly, something is not working. The CPT codes may be innocent bystanders, given how they are being used and valued. Without new models for compensation, every person who receives healthcare services will be affected at some point in their life. If Secretary Kennedy can revamp procedures’ valuations in this way — perhaps even by taking ownership of committee that assigns them — the healthcare system may even heal.

    "article_text": "Healthcare management careers: How any graduate can aspire to manage doctors, large hospitals, pharma firms Premium Published - March 10, 2025 08:22 pm IST The Hindu Bureau READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Healthcare management professionals are earning competitive salaries, with significant opportunities for career growth. | Photo: iStock/ Getty Images You can be a Commerce graduate, Physics student, or a Chemical Engineer. You can still aspire to manage hospitals, doctors and healthcare operations at starting salaries of $20 lakh a year. Yes, healthcare management is a boom industry. Job portals are seeing a month-on-month increase in postings and the Indian government estimates the industry to be at $50 billion this year. New job opportunities include the careers abroad and the government sector where a specialised management cadre are likely to be raised by state governments. While doctors and nurses play a crucial role in providing medical care, healthcare managers are equally important in ensuring seamless operations, policy implementation, and administrative efficiency. The scope of careers in Healthcare Management, therefore, is expanding. The Hindu in a recent webinar discussed different courses students can take up to kick-start a career in Healthcare Management. The webinar also discussed global job opportunities, salaries and the impact of the push on analytics in job creation in the sector. In the future, opportunities are also to rise in the public health sector. The Hindu’s webinar was titled ‘Careers and Courses in Healthcare Management’ on March 8, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. featured distinguished experts, including Dr. P.R. Sodani, President of IIHMR University, Jaipur, and Dr. Gaurav Thukral, Co-Founder and COO of HCAH India. The discussion was moderated by M. Kalyanaraman, Head, Education Vertical, The Hindu. Rising demand for healthcare managers The demand for professionals in Healthcare Management has surged over the past two decades. With corporate and government hospitals expanding their operations, pharmaceutical companies diversifying, and public health programmes requiring better oversight, there is a growing need for competent healthcare managers. These professionals ensure that medical facilities run smoothly, patient care is optimised, and administrative challenges are efficiently addressed. Why professionals are choosing Healthcare Management The field is attracting individuals from diverse educational backgrounds. Many doctors and healthcare professionals pursue an MBA in Healthcare Management to transition into leadership roles, allowing them to influence healthcare policies, administration, and patient care on a broader scale. At the same time, non-medical professionals, including business graduates and entrepreneurs, are entering the sector to improve service delivery and healthcare business operations. While all graduates start on a level playing upon starting a course, their basic undergraduate degree can potentially influence their specialisation. For instance, Chemistry graduates can consider pharma management while biological sciences graduates can eye hospital management. Specialised courses and career prospects Leading institutions in India offer specialised courses tailored to Healthcare Management. Some of the most sought-after programs include: MBA in Hospital and Health Management: Prepares students for leadership roles in hospitals and healthcare institutions. Pharmaceutical Management: Focuses on managing pharmaceutical companies, drug development, and regulatory policies.

Hospital Administration: Equips students with skills to manage healthcare facilities efficiently. Graduates from these programmes find placements in corporate hospitals, government healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, insurance firms, and consultancy organizations. Additionally, the rise of digital health, AI-driven healthcare solutions, and telemedicine has created new opportunities in health tech startups and digital healthcare enterprises. Key takeaways from the webinar Dr. Thukral highlighted the fact that healthcare is a people-intensive industry that requires skilled managers to oversee operations, human resources, financial aspects, and patient care. The complexity of healthcare services demands professionals who can navigate both medical and administrative challenges. Dr. Sodani discussed the advancements in healthcare management education. The MBA programmes now focus on specialised courses in Hospital Planning, Patient Safety, Finance, Quality Accreditation, and Digital Health. Executive education programs are also gaining popularity, allowing working professionals to upgrade their skills while continuing their jobs. With initiatives such as the Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission, there is a significant push toward integrating technology into healthcare. As a result, institutions have introduced MBA in Healthcare Analytics, equipping professionals with expertise in AI-driven healthcare solutions, predictive analytics, and big data management. Diverse Career Paths in Healthcare Management Healthcare managers are now finding employment in a variety of sectors. Some of them are: Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities: Handling administration, patient care coordination, and hospital accreditation. Health Insurance Companies: Managing claims processing, fraud detection, and policy design. Public Health Programmes: Working with government agencies and global organizations like WHO and the World Bank. Health Tech Startups: Developing AI-driven solutions, telemedicine platforms, and digital healthcare initiatives. Consulting Firms: Providing strategic advisory services to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare policymakers. Eligibility and Admissions To enroll in an MBA in Healthcare Management, candidates generally require a Bachelor’s degree in any discipline with a minimum of 50% marks. A valid entrance exam score of CAT, MAT, or equivalent national-level aptitude test is also required. The candidate performance in group discussions and personal interviews is also evaluated during the selection process. For executive MBA programmes, a minimum of three years of work experience in the healthcare sector is usually required.

    "article_text": "In the past, many health insurance plans didn't cover mental or behavioral health treatments. This is because these services weren't viewed as healthcare in the same way that things like having surgery or getting an X-ray might be. The result was that many people couldn't access critical support from therapists, psychiatrists, or other mental health professionals. Paying out of pocket for mental healthcare can be costly, and many people simply can't afford out-of-network providers or treatments. However, thanks to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 , today there are more protections for mental healthcare benefits. Rula shares information to help you learn more about your rights under this legislation and how they can help you and your family use your health insurance to access the mental healthcare you deserve. Key Takeaways The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 requires health insurance plans to provide coverage for mental healthcare that's similar to the coverage they provide for physical healthcare. Most health plans are legally required to ensure that copays, visit limits, and prior authorization processes for mental healthcare are comparable to those for physical healthcare. If you're concerned that your health plan isn't meeting parity requirements or has incorrectly denied coverage, you can file an appeal through your insurance provider's appeals process. You can also ask for help from your healthcare provider or a patient advocate, or you can contact your state's insurance department or the U.S. Department of Labor for assistance. What Is the Mental Health Parity Act? The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act required insurance companies to change the way they cover mental healthcare . Some of the protections the legislation provides include: Your copays for mental health or substance use treatment must be similar in cost to copays for physical healthcare. Health insurance plans can't limit the number of times you receive outpatient mental healthcare within a benefit period (i.e., the number of times you go to therapy) if they don't have similar limits on the number of times you can access outpatient physical healthcare. If your health insurance plan requires prior authorization for mental health or substance use treatment, it must be comparable to those for physical health services. Which Plans Are Covered Under the Parity Law? The parity law requires most health plans to include mental health benefits, including : Employer-sponsored health plans for employers with over 51 employees The federal employee health benefits program Medicaid-managed care plans State children's health insurance programs Some state and local government health plans All health plans purchased through the health insurance marketplace (also referred to as ACA plans) Most individual and group health plans purchased outside the health insurance marketplaces Infographic detailing rights under the Mental Health Parity Act (Stacker/Stacker) Rula What mental health benefits does insurance have to cover? While there are some exceptions, under the Mental Health Parity Act , most health plans are required to cover: Outpatient mental and behavioral health treatment (i.e., therapy or counseling) Inpatient mental and behavioral health treatment (i.e., partial hospitalization programs) Substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs (also referred to as rehab or addiction treatment) Care for all pre-existing mental health conditions, with access starting on the day coverage begins (no waiting period for individual or small group plans under the Affordable Care Act) Before accessing mental healthcare, it's important to understand your coverage so you can anticipate what costs you might be responsible for. If you have questions about your benefits, reach out to your insurer and ask for an explanation of your coverage for mental health services. There's usually an 800 number on the back of your insurance card you can call. How to Tell if Your Insurance Plan Follows Parity Requirements If your health insurance company has denied coverage for mental healthcare, the following signs could indicate that it's not following the parity law , and you may have the legal right to demand payment or compensation. The cost of mental health services is much higher than physical health services under your plan. You're entitled to fewer covered mental healthcare appointments than physical health appointments. You've been denied coverage for mental healthcare because your plan deemed that it wasn't a \"medical necessity.\" However, the insurer isn't able to provide the criteria it used to make that determination. There are plenty of in-network providers for physical healthcare. But your plan has few, if any, in-network mental or behavioral healthcare providers. Your plan doesn't cover inpatient mental health, substance use treatment, or intensive outpatient care. But it does cover that level of care for other health conditions. If you suspect that your health plan isn't following the parity law, start by contacting your insurer to discuss your concerns. They might be willing to give you more details about why your claim was denied. If you still think your plan might be in violation of parity requirements, contact your insurer's customer relations department to initiate a formal appeal. Follow each step of your insurer's appeals process and be sure to save copies of all the documentation you submit. If you need additional support, you can also use this guide to help fight coverage denials for mental healthcare from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. You can also ask for help from your healthcare insurers' patient advocate or contact your state's insurance department or the U.S. Department of Labor for assistance.

Out of the lab and into the streets, researchers and doctors rally for science against Trump cuts The Associated Press ^ | March 7, 2025 | BY SETH BORENSTEIN Posted on 03/08/2025 11:05:50 AM PST by Oldeconomybuyer WASHINGTON (AP) — Giving a new meaning to the phrase mad scientists, angry researchers, doctors, their patients and supporters ventured out of labs, hospitals and offices Friday to fight against what they call a blitz on life-saving science by the Trump administration. In the nation’s capital, a couple thousand gathered at the Stand Up for Science rally. Organizers said similar rallies were planned in more than 30 U.S. cities. Politicians, scientists, musicians, doctors and their patients made the case that firings, budget and grant cuts in health, climate, science and other research government agencies in the Trump administration’s first 47 days in office are endangering not just the future but the present. “This is the most challenging moment I can recall,” University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann told the crowd full of signs belittling the intelligence of President Donald Trump, his cost-cutting aide Elon Musk and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “Science is under siege.” Astronomer Phil Plait told a booing crowd, “We’re looking at the most aggressively anti-science government the United States has ever had.” Rally co-organizer Colette Delawalla, a doctoral student in clinical psychology, said, “We’re not just going to stand here and take it.” Science communicator, entertainer and one-time engineer Bill Nye the Science Guy challenged the forces in government that want to cut and censor science. “What are you afraid of?” he said.

Photos courtesy of PCO MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos has expressed support for the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC)’s proposals to enhance access to health care and to expand health facilities, the group said yesterday. Health care policy reforms and strategic initiatives were discussed during PSAC’s meeting with the President last Thursday at Malacañang. In a statement, PSAC said it suggested updates to hospital licensing and physical facility standards to fast-track the establishment of new hospitals and other health care facilities. It also recommended a shift to outcome-based regulations that would streamline hospital renewal processes and promote network-based health care models for better resource distribution. According to PSAC, the reform is “crucial” as the country faces a hospital bed deficit in the face of increasing demand. The council also endorsed the expansion of community pharmacies, particularly in underserved regions, to boost access to essential medicines. A regulatory sandbox approach is being explored to allow licensed pharmacists to oversee multiple pharmacies remotely, leverage telepharmacy services and enhance the role of pharmacy assistants, PSAC said. The council said innovative solutions are needed to improve medicine availability, noting the shortage of 27,500 registered pharmacists as well as the geographical disparity in terms of distribution of existing pharmacies. The President highlighted the private sector’s vital role in driving health care reforms for the benefit of Filipinos, the council said. “With President Marcos’ endorsement, PSAC remains committed to public-private partnerships that drive lasting health care improvements, lower health care costs and stronger health system for the current and future generations,” it added. PSAC said it is also working closely with state-run Philippine Health Insurance Corp. to expand benefit packages, upgrade its information technology systems and enhance financial transparency. It also pushed for the fast-tracking of the approvals of 14 essential medicines for diseases like diabetes, hypertension and various cancers. “We are working towards a more equitable and sustainable health care system,” PSAC health care sector lead and AC Health CEO Paolo Borromeo said. “Collaboration between the government and private sector is key to ensuring that every Filipino, regardless of financial standing, has access to quality health care,” he added. PSAC is composed of business leaders and experts across six key areas, namely agriculture, infrastructure, digital infrastructure, education and jobs, health care and tourism. Marcos formed the council to strengthen the collaboration between the government and the private sector. PSAC BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

    "article_text": "Thailand General Fairer healthcare for workers on agenda PUBLISHED : 8 Mar 2025 at 04:00 NEWSPAPER SECTION: News WRITER: Post Reporters Small Medium Large Listen to this article Play Pause The Social Security Office (SSO) will next week discuss with relevant agencies a proposal to make access to healthcare benefits fairer for insured workers and those covered by the universal healthcare scheme, according to Labour Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn. He said the talk will be held next Wednesday and chaired by Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira. The SSO, the National Health Security Office (NHSO), which manages the universal healthcare scheme, and the Comptroller General's Department will also take part. Mr Phiphat said the discussion will focus on the potential merger of the healthcare benefits of the schemes and identify which benefits can be integrated to improve access and enhance services. Also he will not be present at the meeting. The planned meeting comes amid increasing scrutiny on unequal access to some healthcare benefits between insured workers under the social security system and those covered by the NHSO-run universal healthcare scheme. The social security system is run on a co-payment scheme in which employees, employers, and the state contribute to the fund. The universal healthcare scheme is state-sponsored. Critics say this scheme provides more comprehensive benefits. The House committee on public health on Thursday set up a sub-committee to study healthcare system improvements across the three major healthcare funds to reduce disparities. The other is the Civil Servants Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS). It also requested that the SSO and the NHSO submit meeting minutes -- within 15 days -- from the past 23 years regarding discussions on integrated benefits across these three schemes. Meanwhile, Mr Phiphat yesterday told a forum on the management of foreign workers that the ministry has proposed covering foreign workers in certain professions by the social security fund. Currently, some professions are exempt from Section 33, he said, adding that the Labour Ministry has already finalised the proposal pending cabinet consideration. When these foreign workers are covered, they will be eligible for healthcare benefits, and when they retire and return to their home countries, they will also receive retirees' pensions, he said. The labour minister said about 1.5 million foreign workers have subscribed to the social security system and receive healthcare benefits similar to those of Thai employees.

    "article_text": "Image: iStock/Ivan-balvan health How the hidden epidemic of violence against nurses affects health care Mar. 8 06:00 am JST Mar. 8 | 06:39 am JST 4 Comments By Jason Blomquist BOISE, Idaho “Violence is just part of the job. Every nurse and health care worker experiences it at some point.” Sentiments like this echo across American hospitals and health care facilities, capturing a disturbing and growing reality. Though Americans think of nursing as the most trusted profession, we often fail to see that it’s also one of the most dangerous. An alarming 8 in 10 nurses face violence at work. As a result, health care workers are more than four times as likely to be injured by workplace violence than workers in all other industries combined. Despite these staggering numbers, the full extent of this epidemic may not be fully understood because nurses and other health care workers chronically underreport violent encounters. The American Nurses Association estimates that only 20% to 60% of incidents are accounted for. Additionally, there is no agreed-upon definition for workplace violence or clear way of tracking it on a national level. As a practicing bedside nurse, I have experienced my fair share of workplace violence. As a professor of nursing, my research shows that violence has become a normalized but underreported part of working in health care and that it affects the care patients receive in pervasive ways. What really counts as workplace violence in health care? When people think about workplace violence, they often imagine dramatic physical assaults. Assaults do happen, but violence directed at workers can take many other forms, including verbal threats, intimidation, sexual aggression and bullying. What makes defining and measuring workplace violence especially difficult in health care settings is the range of people involved. Violence may stem from patients, their families, co-workers or even disgruntled members of the public. Nurses and health care staff work with people during incredibly stressful moments in their lives. Sometimes patients are experiencing medical conditions that may cause them to act out or be confused, such as dementia, delirium, psychosis or even postoperative reactions to anesthesia. Some health care organizations use vague definitions, such as “workplace violence is any violent act or threat of violence,” while nursing organizations advocate for tiered definitions delineating between perpetrator and intent. Although not all employees can recite their organization’s official definition of workplace violence, ask a nurse whether they have ever experienced a threatening situation at work and they will likely have stories at the ready. In my 14 years of nursing practice, nurses shared many different types of threatening encounters. They reported being screamed at by distraught visitors and having their hair and wrists grabbed by patients who are trying to bite or spit at them. I have personally experienced having objects thrown at me from across the room and being threatened with retribution by patients’ family members. Nurses also shared more extreme experiences in which they or their co-workers were injured in the course of trying to simply deliver care. Many described the emotional impact of watching a co-worker hurt badly enough to require medical attention. From my observations, it’s not just the major incidents but the countless small threats or insensitive behaviors that add up over a nurse’s career. These seemingly less-threatening events are much harder to document, and many nurses shrug them off, but the small infractions take a toll when they happen repeatedly. Breaking the culture of silence A culture of silence makes such incidents hard to track. The medical-surgical nursing unit at the hospital where I conducted my research has a healthy and supportive culture. Yet in my ongoing doctoral work, which will be published in May, of the 74% percent of staff that acknowledged experiencing workplace violence in the past year, only 30% reported the event. When nurses stay silent, whether from fear, futility or institutional pressure, violence becomes an accepted part of the job. Without accurate data, health care facilities don’t understand the true extent of the problem, can’t implement effective safety measures, and struggle to support their workers in meaningful ways. There are common themes as to why nurses underreport violence. Some nurses think reporting does not make a difference. Others find the lack of clarity in defining workplace violence or reporting policies demotivating and confusing. Nurses also report a lack of support from management, a fear of reprisal or a sense of shame when reporting. Commonly, many nurses simply find reporting tools to be too difficult and time-consuming to use. The hidden costs to health care For health care workers, the consequences extend far beyond physical injuries. Workplace violence in all its forms contributes to anxiety, depression or PTSD, as well as job dissatisfaction. Dangerous workplace violence trends are a contributing factor in 55% of health care workers feeling burned out and 18% of newly licensed registered nurses leaving the profession within the first year. That is a huge problem, considering that the United States is projected to have 193,100 nursing job openings per year until 2032, yet will produce only roughly 177,400 new nurses in that time frame. This also has vast repercussions for patient care. During my nursing career, I observed my peers developing complex strategies to protect themselves while trying to provide compassionate care. Like me, they tended to carefully position themselves near doorways, maintained constant awareness of their surroundings and silently assessed each new interaction for potential risks. These invisible precautions reflect the far-reaching effects of health care violence. When nurses are hypervigilant about their safety, they have less emotional energy for patient care. When they’re rushing between rooms due to short staffing caused by violence-related turnover, they have less time for each patient. When they are worried about what the next patient encounter may bring, they are increasing their anxiety, fear and stress rather than focusing on delivering quality care. Creating safer health care together Each health care visit is a chance for patients and their families to improve nursing care for everyone. When you visit a hospital or clinic, try to understand the stress that health care workers are under and express your needs and concerns calmly. You never know what your nurse is dealing with in their interactions with other patients. They try to compartmentalize and give you their full attention, but they might also be experiencing a difficult and traumatic situation right next door. It also helps to share information that might be relevant to caring for your family member, such as whether their medical condition is causing them to act differently than normal. And you should speak up if you witness any forms of aggressive behavior. These actions might seem small, but they support health care staff and help prevent violence in health care settings. Nurses are trained to keep information private, to be problem-solvers and to bear the burden of the job, so they don’t always seek support. If you have a nurse or health care worker in your family or circle of friends, let them know you care. Supporting their safety validates their work and leads to better care for everyone.

On Friday and Saturday nights they have police officers stationed at the hospital to deal with violence against staff as it is that common. Of course alcohol/drugs are involved in almost all cases. 0 ( +2 / -2 ) falseflagsteve Mar. 8 10:18 pm JST Mr Kipling Have sympathy with your family member those hospitals can be dangerous places at night. It will never get better, too much cheap drugs and booze available and mentally ill walking the streets. -5 ( +0 / -5 ) tom toto Mar. 9 04:01 am JST First, healthcare professionals are appreciated and much needed in a fast growing aging society including longer life expectancy. Healthcare workers must know the rewards and risks include physical&mental pains come with it as they deal with physical, mental, and or both sick/patients, so stressful conditions are guaranteed they experience one time or another... Hopefully proper training and safety measures are in place to protect both workers&patients. 0 ( +0 / -0 ) 1glenn Mar. 9 06:51 pm JST A few years back a man walked into a local hospital and started killing doctors and nurses with a pistol. He had decided that his mother had wrongly died in the hospital, and sought vengeance. Health care professionals can try to prolong life and reduce suffering, but they cannot save every sick person. On the other hand, the anguish of losing a loved one can sometimes induce a mental breakdown in anyone. I too have noticed that in recent years there are armed guards at hospital entrances. 0 ( +0 / -0 ) Login to leave a comment Facebook users Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

    "article_text": "Lebanon’s medical system faces immense strain as ongoing conflict with Israel has led to widespread damage to health care facilities and personnel. Israeli airstrikes across the country—particularly in southern Lebanon and Beirut—have severely impacted the health care sector, which continues to struggle to rebuild. Reports indicate that 63% of health transports and 26% of medical facilities have been affected. Previously regarded as one of the strongest health care systems in the Arab world, Lebanon’s medical infrastructure now faces severe limitations in providing adequate care. Impact on Medical Infrastructure and Personnel The conflict has resulted in repeated strikes on hospitals and medical centers across Lebanon. Between October 2023 and November 2024, 226 health workers and patients lost their lives, while another 199 suffered injuries. Although international humanitarian law protects medical facilities during armed conflicts, Lebanon’s health care workers have endured significant casualties and disruptions. The Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut, the city’s largest medical facility, sustained heavy damage from an airstrike. Reports indicate that 13 people were killed and more than 60 others injured, further diminishing Lebanon’s ability to provide critical medical care. Health Care System Under Economic Strain A weakened economy had already placed Lebanon’s health care system under significant pressure before the war escalated. As of May 2024, 44% of the population lived in poverty, with rates reaching 70% in Akkar, one of the country’s poorest regions. A prolonged liquidity crisis devalued the Lebanese pound, making it increasingly difficult for hospitals to purchase essential medicines, retain medical staff or maintain equipment. Many public hospitals struggle to function due to a lack of financial resources. International Aid Organizations Several international organizations continue to provide medical aid, transport and disease prevention programs, working to preserve access to health care across the country. International Organization for Migration (IOM). Since 2006, the IOM has focused on medical and psychological support for Palestinian and Iraqi refugee communities in Lebanon. During the conflict, IOM facilitated medical transport for more than 4,000 people, assisted in rebuilding health facilities and launched telehealth programs to ensure continued patient access to care. A cholera prevention campaign was implemented in response to concerns about potential outbreaks due to deteriorating sanitation infrastructure. International Medical Corps. Operating in Lebanon since 2006, the International Medical Corps supports a network of 50 health care clinics and dispensaries. The organization provides disease prevention programs, patient consultations and medical treatment for displaced and vulnerable populations. Health awareness initiatives have also been implemented to educate residents on preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières – MSF). The psychological toll of war remains a growing concern in Lebanon. Doctors Without Borders currently operates two mental health helplines , providing psychological support to those affected by the ongoing conflict. Reports suggest that two-thirds of Lebanese citizens are experiencing mental health disorders due to war-related trauma. The demand for psychiatric care and counseling services continues to rise, placing additional strain on an already fragile health care system. KSrelief. The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) has played a crucial role in providing health care services to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. At the Akkar-Bebnine Health Care Center, 2,689 patients received medical treatment in December 2024 alone. KSrelief’s contributions have been essential in addressing the medical needs of displaced communities who otherwise have limited access to health care services. Future Prospects At the beginning of 2023, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health introduced Vision 2030 , a long-term strategy aimed at revitalizing Lebanon’s medical system. However, the ongoing conflict has severely hindered its implementation, making immediate health care recovery efforts more urgent. International organizations and humanitarian groups continue to provide critical support, but Lebanon’s health care sector remains under immense strain. Rebuilding medical infrastructure, securing funding and addressing the long-term psychological and physical health consequences of the war remain significant challenges. Continued international aid, government intervention and economic recovery efforts could play a crucial role in determining the future of Lebanon’s medical system. – Charley Dennis Charley is based in London, UK and focuses on Global Health and Politics for The Borgen Project.

    "article_text": "Strategist explains why there's a 'good setup' for healthcare stocks Sara Belcher · Podcast Writer March 5, 2025 3 min read XLV ^GSPC Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Investors have been hesitant to invest in healthcare stocks ( XLV ) as the sector’s returns have lagged behind gains in the broader market. But the market may begin to favor healthcare again, according to one strategist. “I think there's a good setup of data to start adding healthcare to your portfolio,” Strategas Asset Management ETF strategist Todd Sohn said on an episode of the Stocks in Translation podcast (see video above or listen below) that aired on Feb. 11. He emphasized diversification in healthcare ETFs, “so you're going to get providers, you're going to get equipment and biotech.” Sohn acknowledged that “it’s been a rough go for healthcare” as of late. The healthcare sector placed in the bottom decile of S&P sector performance in the past five years, he noted. While that may make healthcare stocks seem like a less-than-lucrative investment option, Sohn argued they're due for better performance — especially considering the recent sell-offs in tech. “Usually when you get extremes like that, that's interesting, and there's been massive amounts of outflows from healthcare ETFs,” Sohn said. “So that tells me investors have left the [healthcare] space — they've deserted it. From a sentiment and a contrarian perspective, I like that idea. Especially if tech starts to falter here a little bit more too.” Should investors ease up on their investments in the tech space, according to Sohn, healthcare could be a potential hedge for investors. “There's a trade-off because healthcare does have those growth and value characteristics that you'll get from technology as well,” he said.

(Ezra Acayan/Getty Images) · Ezra Acayan via Getty Images “If you were to get software to take a hit, that leaves broader tech in trouble,” Sohn said. “So that's where healthcare comes into play because it's still a large weight. Or, say, something like Industrials and [Consumer] Discretionary — those will still at least hold up the benchmarks.” Though tech, AI, and crypto have been catalysts for stocks' recent highs, Sohn isn’t the first expert to caution that the trends may shift to favor other markets. “I think the main takeaway is the trend of the market is still up, but things are evolving,” he said. “Now the question [is] if the broader industry is going to make a new high, is participation still there? That's going to be the most important question heading into the rest of the first quarter and into the summer months because that's where durability is made or divergences are made too.” Story Continues Why inflation isn't cooling down any time soon How Chipotle & Lululemon are showing a shift in consumer spending Why betting on the AI bubble bursting could be a costly mistake On Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation , Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre and producer Sydnee Fried cut through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape.

    "article_text": "Leadership CIO Network HIMSS 2025 Recap For Healthcare CIOs By David Chou , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. David Chou is a nationally recognized healthcare technology executive Follow Author Mar 06, 2025, 06:34pm EST Mar 06, 2025, 06:38pm EST Share Save Aerial shot of Las Vegas, Nevada at night. Authorization was obtained from the FAA for this operation in restricted airspace. getty HIMSS 2025, the global healthcare conference, has brought together 28,000 attendees this week, with AI taking center stage as it did at the ViVE event two weeks ago. Healthcare CIOs are zeroing in on the following areas to fuel innovation and upgrade their existing solutions. Here’s what's drawing their focus from the event. Clinical Decision Making Microsoft booth had a large attendance following their announcement of the Dragon Copilot. The company finally combines its voice dictation product with the ambient listening solution. Many healthcare provider organizations have both products, and this is an opportunity to consolidate them by having the products operate on a single platform. The Dragon Copilot announcement is another stickiness to the Microsoft ecosystem of Microsoft Fabric, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry. In my discussion with Microsoft, they have approximately thirty healthcare partners and are growing in their Copilot Studio platform. One of the partners, Wolters Kluwer, announced the integration of its UpToDate solution with the healthcare agent service in Microsoft Copilot Studio. Greg Samios, President and CEO of Clinical Effectiveness for Wolters Kluwer Health said \"Seconds can make all the difference in clinical decision making, and through our collaborations, we're focused on speed to the right answer wherever you are in the clinical workflow\". Google Cloud announced new generative AI capabilities called Visual Q&A that will search tables, charts, and diagrams to process diverse patient data, medical images, and others to help provide a comprehensive view of the patient. Enterprise search within the EMR has improved dramatically with generative AI capabilities, and the EMR companies are partnering with their preferred cloud vendor to incorporate this feature. MEDITECH EMR has developed its AI-powered search within its Expanse product Oracle announced similar capabilities in Q4 last year with its clinical AI agent that can handle patient queries. MORE FOR YOU Overall, every healthcare technology vendor is developing a solution incorporating generative AI to improve and speed up clinical decision-making. Patient Engagement Ensuring patients are efficiently scheduled and seen by doctors is a top priority for healthcare providers. With high turnover in contact center staff, healthcare operations leaders are turning to automation to improve efficiency. As generative AI accelerates clinical decision-making, it also enhances contact centers by providing agents with instant patient information, leading to better interactions. Webex has integrated its Contact Center features with Epic’s Cheers module and Hyperdrive interface. With this integration, Webex agents can manage conversations directly within Epic, eliminating the need to switch between windows or systems. This streamlined workflow enhances efficiency and simplifies the contact center/patient interaction. Similarly, RevSpring announced its virtual healthcare agent to enhance the patient and customer service staff experience. RevSpring president Nicole Rogas said, “By combining AI, data-driven insights, and personalized engagement, we empower patients to better understand their financial obligations, simplify billing and payments, and easily access financial assistance.” The market is flooded with AI-powered virtual agents, all promising to transform patient interactions through phone, text, and online chat. These solutions tap into dynamic knowledge bases to answer questions, automate tasks, and enhance self-service options. While many will offer similar capabilities, the real differentiator lies in how effectively they reduce staff workload and refocus healthcare teams on patient care. Cybersecurity Scare Cybersecurity keeps every healthcare leader on high alert. During the Vegas event, a client I advised faced a potential security scare. I got a call warning of a possible compromise. Fortunately, it turned out to be a false alarm, with no signs of an actual intrusion. The organization had received a letter similar to the one Arctic Wolf posted. Carter Groome, Chief Executive Officer of First Health Advisory, a veteran in the information security space, said, \"We’ve seen a significant uptick in phishing, brute force, and social engineering attacks in the last couple of weeks.\" This trend will continue, and it will not stop. Healthcare CIOs continue strengthening their security posture while keeping up with the recent HIPAA updates. It will be interesting if the guidelines from the previous administration on HIPAA will stay. Carter Groome said, “I'm not sure if that will even be considered, but if healthcare entities need the government to guide them on how to protect their business, they have bigger issues.” HIMSS 2025 had great energy on the show floor, with new product announcements everywhere. Zafar Chaudry, Chief Digital Officer & Chief AI and Information Officer at Seattle Children's Hospital, summed it up and said, “At HIMSS 2025, AI and efficiency took center stage, fueling the next wave of healthcare transformation.” The question remains about how many of these products healthcare organizations will adopt and whether they will help them provide quality care at a lower cost.

NoRKA-Roots, the field agency of the Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NoRKA), has aided the migration of a record 1,090 health-care professionals, including doctors, chiefly to European countries and Canada so far this financial year. The destinations include England, Wales, Canada, and Germany, apart from Saudi Arabia. In previous years, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were the main destinations for health-care professionals from Kerala. Europe seems to have turned its focus on Kerala post-COVID-19, if the number of health-care professionals recruited from Kerala through NoRKA-Roots is any indication. Ajith Kolassery, Chief Executive Officer of NoRKA-Roots, said close to 9,500 nursing seats were available in Kerala annually, while another 10,000 seats were available for Keralites in neighbouring States. Kerala required only 10% of the total nursing students who passed out each year, while the remaining 90% eyed the overseas job markets, said Mr. Kolassery. High standards The deployment turnaround time is less for candidates from Kerala due to the high health-care standards of the State. Bridging the language divide is the only time-consuming exercise in migration. To address this, the Kerala government has started imparting training in in European languages with the help of recipient countries, making the process hassle-free. There is an acute shortage of health-care professionals in Europe, and Kerala is the first State in the country to tap the opportunity by holding a structured recruitment with government-to-government association with recipient countries. Further, Kerala has also been providing post-recruitment service, diaspora support, and reintegration support for the returnees as part of a holistic and comprehensive migration management policy. The State government has also been in consultation with the Danish, Austrian, and Netherland government agencies as part of providing health-care professionals to these countries, said government sources.

    "article_text": "A shift toward strategic partnerships is underway, with RCM outsourcing budgets expected to rise More than half of healthcare providers surveyed are actively exploring or testing gen AI use cases BOCA RATON, Fla. , March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- An overwhelming majority (85%) of senior healthcare executives surveyed believe AI will improve efficiencies in revenue cycle management (RCM) operations over the next five years, according to the results of a new Everest Group report, supported by Omega Healthcare, titled \" Realizing the Promise of Tech-Enabled, AI-Driven Revenue Cycle Management (RCM): Outsourcing in the New Era .\" The study highlights how healthcare providers are leveraging AI-enabled technology services (such as gen AI and agentic AI) and a shift to more strategic outsourcing partnerships to address challenges, enhance financial performance, and streamline revenue cycle processes. \"The hope and promise of AI, gen AI and agentic AI are no longer just hype,\" said Anurag Mehta , CEO and Co-Founder, Omega Healthcare . \"While the technology is important, it is only part of the equation. To fully harness the power of AI it will become increasingly critical for healthcare providers to work with the right partners.\" Shift to More Strategic RCM Outsourcing Partnerships As gen AI investments continue to accelerate, more than half (51%) of healthcare leaders polled expect an increase in RCM outsourcing budgets by 2030, emphasizing the significance gen AI will have on the sector. \"More than seven in 10 (71%) healthcare executives surveyed are planning to evolve from transactional relationships to strategic partnerships, and nearly half (49%) are interested in end-to-end RCM outsourcing to a single service provider,\" noted Mehta. \"Long-term success will be defined by selecting a partner who can serve as a trusted advisor capable of delivering not only the technology, but also a comprehensive fusion of ongoing digital innovation, healthcare expertise, services as solutions, and proven operational and cybersecurity excellence.\" Gen AI: Propelling RCM Transformation Interestingly, the survey found that more than half (51%) of healthcare providers are actively exploring gen AI in RCM, with 22% already testing proof-of-concept initiatives and 29% in the consideration stage, evaluating use cases and potential challenges. Although adoption varies by organization size, the overwhelming consensus is that gen AI will play a critical role in automating manual processes, improving billing accuracy, and reducing claim denials. \"As a benefit of the gen AI investments we have already made so our customers do not have to, our clients are already putting gen AI use cases into action and are seeing meaningful results across RCM functions,\" said Vijayashree Natarajan , SVP & Head of Technology, Omega Healthcare. \"The Omega Digital platform, powered by AI/gen AI/agentic AI solutions, is helping to enhance business outcomes for our customers, such as ~20-25% collections improvement; ~ 25-30% aged AR reduction; and ~ 30-35% improvement in charge lag.\" Top Five Gen AI Use Cases RCM leaders' top five gen AI use cases are: Real-time eligibility and benefits verification; Claims data analysis and pattern recognition to avoid future rejections; Gen AI chatbots to resolve patient queries (billing, payments, scheduling) and enhance experience; Documentation improvement through AI scribing; and Synthetic data generation and automated medical coding from clinical documents. Barriers to Adoption Major challenges to gen AI adoption in RCM include a lack of in-house expertise, with about 80% of executives citing it as a key hurdle, and barriers integrating with existing electronic health records systems. Additionally, 46% of survey respondents consider gen AI a high priority but are awaiting regulatory clarity before committing to large-scale investments. Future Investment Priorities Emerging RCM challenges, including the need for real-time claims tracking, the transition to value-based care models, and increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance, are also influencing investment decisions. Looking ahead, RCM leaders are prioritizing cybersecurity, payer collaboration, and AI-driven automation: Cybersecurity : 63% of respondents identified cybersecurity as the top priority investment in 2025, emphasizing the need for robust protections against data breaches and ransomware attacks. Payer collaboration : Improved provider-payer coordination is seen as a key strategy for reducing reimbursement delays and enhancing patient outcomes. AI and automation : By 2030, AI/ML investments are expected to be the top priority for RCM leaders, with 66% of respondents considering it a high priority area. About the survey To explore the impact and effectiveness of technology-driven RCM outsourcing, Everest Group, supported by Omega Healthcare, surveyed 41 C-Suite executives (CTOs, CIOs, CEOs), senior vice presidents, and directors of RCM Operations at US-based healthcare provider organizations. The study included organizations of all sizes and types, such as health networks, independent hospitals, independent physicians and physician groups, and ambulatory surgical centers, and DMEs.

    "article_text": "MARCH 5 — Imagine a world where one has to choose whether to pay for a doctor’s visit or to pay for dinner later that night. A saying as old as time; the access to healthcare is a basic human right, not a luxury. When we talk about UHC, it is not just about the healthcare systems and policies. It is about equality, dignity and most importantly, the fundamental right of every human being. Apart from that, good health and wellbeing is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The International Health Regulations (IHR), established in the year 2005, also supports this notion. The IHR regulates public health emergencies and ensures that healthcare is accessible for everyone in the face of a global health crisis. The right to health The goal of navigating inclusive healthcare systems of UHC is backed up by human right laws and is clearly outlined in the Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Additionally, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) asserts the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Failure of a country to do so results in massive scrutiny from international bodies like the United Nations. However, achieving UHC is no child’s play as many nations face significant impediments when they try to make quality health services a reality for everyone. These include treatments for illnesses, vaccinations, emergency services and mental health support. An undated file photograph shows healthcare workers at a hospital in Kuala Lumpur. — Bernama pic Even in the Global North, there is discrimination when it comes to accessing quality healthcare, where certain communities are left behind. UHC means every single person – from the energetic metropolises of Europe to the remote villages of Africa – should be able to get the basic healthcare they need. This calls for adequate leadership where minorities and underprivileged communities to be represented in the global perspective. For instance, Rocio Lazcano – an indigenous leader and the President of the Social Health Council in Northern Bolivia – is devoted to ensuring the health of the indigenous community by advocating and representing the needs of the community. Albeit being half of Bolivia’s population, the indigenous population lives in remote and rural areas. As reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) recently, unhygienic water supplies, inadequate waste management and hazardous health facilities are the factors influencing poor health in the indigenous population. Currently, the Ministry of Health and Sport of Bolivia is implementing changes to ensure the voices of minorities are part of national policies. Consequently, indigenous people can partake in decision-making regarding access to healthcare. If we were to look closely, this significantly connects to the SDG 10, reducing inequalities within and among countries. Financing the dream According to an article published in the Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health in March 2022, mismanagement of insurance schemes, poor funding for primary healthcare systems, mismatches of subsidies allocation, socioeconomic status and disproportionate copayments for laboratory tests and medicines are among the challenges in funding UHC. We can see many developing countries fall short in offering health services without proper investments. It is evident by now that there is a significant gap between high-income countries and low-income countries when it comes to healthcare resources, infrastructures or access to specialised treatments. This fact is cemented during global health crises, like the Covid-19 pandemic. Discriminations in healthcare should be disdained as people have a right to health, irrespective of income, status and nationality. Investing in healthcare infrastructures, providing adequate training to health professionals and ensuring that quality healthcare is provided to the nation’s people should be a priority. However, there is progress in certain nations. For instance, the National Health Services (NHS) – founded by the NHS Act of 1946 – covers the costs of most health services in the UK through a tax-funded system. Recently, the Malaysian government established the National Health Financing Act (2018) to fund health services in public hospitals and clinics, providing affordable healthcare to its people. Overcoming the barriers First of all, we need to demolish inequality. Why? It is because we cannot achieve SDG 3, the goal of “Good Health and Well-Being” for all people at all ages if we keep being indifferent to this issue. The government of a nation should ensure that quality healthcare must be available to everyone, especially those who are typically overlooked. No one can be excluded for UHC to be truly universal, this includes rural population, elderly and children as well as people with disabilities. On top of that, healthcare should be affordable. Governments should allocate sufficient resources so that financial barriers do not restrict access to quality healthcare. There are many cases where governments struggle to balance UHC goals with other national policies, which undermine compliance with human rights. Did you know that if a government fails to provide basic healthcare, it is a violation of human rights? Citizens can challenge the government in courts, forcing the government to provide compensation. The road ahead Though the path to achieving UHC in alignment with human rights is tough, we are gaining ground. In Thailand, a public health insurance program established by Thailand’s UHC Act (2002) guarantees that healthcare is affordable and accessible for all of its citizens. This was executed through expanding investments in public health and insurance coverage. Mexico’s UHC Law (2003) focuses on providing health insurance coverage to vulnerable groups, who were previously overlooked. Various NGOs in many countries strive to make UHC a reality by making specialised medicines and treatments affordable. If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that global healthcare systems are quite fragile, especially in low-income countries. Just because we live in a better situation does not mean someone else is too. We should come out of this nonchalant mindset as UHC matters to all of us. Healthy communities yield strong economies, as it is an enabler to achieving the SDGs for a sustainable future. Together, let us continue to forge ahead and make health for everyone, everywhere. • Shanthini Chandrasegaran and Dr Mohd Istajib Mokhtar are from the Department of Science and Technology Studies, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya, and may be reached at [email protected] ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail."

    "article_text": "Nurses in the United States face a high rate of burnout. Hirung via Getty Images Jason Blomquist , Boise State University Author Jason Blomquist Assistant Professor of Nursing, Boise State University Disclosure statement Jason Blomquist is affiliated with the American Nurses Association, Idaho chapter as a member of the board of directors. This affiliation has not influenced or overlapped with the work described in this article. Partners Boise State University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners DOI https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.pa3ggnpwd “Violence is just part of the job. Every nurse and health care worker experiences it at some point.” Sentiments like this echo across American hospitals and health care facilities, capturing a disturbing and growing reality. Though Americans think of nursing as the most trusted profession , we often fail to see that it’s also one of the most dangerous. An alarming 8 in 10 nurses face violence at work . As a result, health care workers are more than four times as likely to be injured by workplace violence than workers in all other industries combined. Despite these staggering numbers, the full extent of this epidemic may not be fully understood because nurses and other health care workers chronically underreport violent encounters. The American Nurses Association estimates that only 20% to 60% of incidents are accounted for. Additionally, there is no agreed-upon definition for workplace violence or clear way of tracking it on a national level. As a practicing bedside nurse, I have experienced my fair share of workplace violence. My work shows that violence has become a normalized but underreported part of working in health care and that it affects the care patients receive in pervasive ways. What really counts as workplace violence in health care? When people think about workplace violence, they often imagine dramatic physical assaults. Assaults do happen, but violence directed at workers can take many other forms, including verbal threats, intimidation, sexual aggression and bullying. What makes defining and measuring workplace violence especially difficult in health care settings is the range of people involved. Violence may stem from patients, their families, co-workers or even disgruntled members of the public. Nurses and health care staff work with people during incredibly stressful moments in their lives. Sometimes patients are experiencing medical conditions that may cause them to act out or be confused, such as dementia, delirium, psychosis or even postoperative reactions to anesthesia. Too often, nurses who are threatened or hurt at work do not report the event. Some health care organizations use vague definitions, such as “workplace violence is any violent act or threat of violence,” while nursing organizations advocate for tiered definitions delineating between perpetrator and intent . Although not all employees can recite their organization’s official definition of workplace violence, ask a nurse whether they have ever experienced a threatening situation at work and they will likely have stories at the ready. In my 14 years of nursing practice, nurses shared many different types of threatening encounters. They reported being screamed at by distraught visitors and having their hair and wrists grabbed by patients who are trying to bite or spit at them. I have personally experienced having objects thrown at me from across the room and being threatened with retribution by patients’ family members. Nurses also shared more extreme experiences in which they or their co-workers were injured in the course of trying to simply deliver care. Many described the emotional impact of watching a co-worker hurt badly enough to require medical attention. From my observations, it’s not just the major incidents but the countless small threats or insensitive behaviors that add up over a nurse’s career. These seemingly less-threatening events are much harder to document, and many nurses shrug them off, but the small infractions take a toll when they happen repeatedly. Breaking the culture of silence A culture of silence makes such incidents hard to track. The medical-surgical nursing unit at the hospital where I did my project has a healthy and supportive culture. Yet in my ongoing doctoral work, which will be published in May, of the 74% percent of staff that acknowledged experiencing workplace violence in the past year, only 30% reported the event. When nurses stay silent, whether from fear, futility or institutional pressure, violence becomes an accepted part of the job. Without accurate data, health care facilities don’t understand the true extent of the problem , can’t implement effective safety measures, and struggle to support their workers in meaningful ways. There are common themes as to why nurses underreport violence. Some nurses think reporting does not make a difference . Others find the lack of clarity in defining workplace violence or reporting policies demotivating and confusing. Nurses also report a lack of support from management, a fear of reprisal or a sense of shame when reporting. Commonly, many nurses simply find reporting tools to be too difficult and time-consuming to use. Nurses are the largest segment of the health care workforce in the U.S. Frazao Studio Latino via Getty Images The hidden costs to health care For health care workers, the consequences extend far beyond physical injuries. Workplace violence in all its forms contributes to anxiety, depression or PTSD , as well as job dissatisfaction . Dangerous workplace violence trends are a contributing factor in 55% of health care workers feeling burned out and 18% of newly licensed registered nurses leaving the profession within the first year . That is a huge problem, considering that the United States is projected to have 193,100 nursing job openings per year until 2032 , yet will produce only roughly 177,400 new nurses in that time frame. This also has vast repercussions for patient care. During my nursing career, I observed my peers developing complex strategies to protect themselves while trying to provide compassionate care. Like me, they tended to carefully position themselves near doorways, maintained constant awareness of their surroundings and silently assessed each new interaction for potential risks. These invisible precautions reflect the far-reaching effects of health care violence. When nurses are hypervigilant about their safety, they have less emotional energy for patient care. When they’re rushing between rooms due to short staffing caused by violence-related turnover , they have less time for each patient. When they are worried about what the next patient encounter may bring, they are increasing their anxiety, fear and stress rather than focusing on delivering quality care. Creating safer health care together Each health care visit is a chance for patients and their families to improve nursing care for everyone. When you visit a hospital or clinic, try to understand the stress that health care workers are under and express your needs and concerns calmly. You never know what your nurse is dealing with in their interactions with other patients. They try to compartmentalize and give you their full attention, but they might also be experiencing a difficult and traumatic situation right next door. It also helps to share information that might be relevant to caring for your family member, such as whether their medical condition is causing them to act differently than normal. And you should speak up if you witness any forms of aggressive behavior. These actions might seem small, but they support health care staff and help prevent violence in health care settings. Nurses are trained to keep information private, to be problem-solvers and to bear the burden of the job, so they don’t always seek support. If you have a nurse or health care worker in your family or circle of friends, let them know you care. Supporting their safety validates their work and leads to better care for everyone.

Danielle VanZandt, research manager for security at Frost & Sullivan, observed, \"Cynerio's multi-faceted platform aligns well with the triage-centric operational methodology that is fundamental to the healthcare industry, enabling security teams to efficiently determine the most prescient mitigation actions and better prioritize security objectives without overwhelming personnel.\" Cynerio's Healthcare Cybersecurity Platform enables healthcare security teams to gain the visibility they require, determine the current security posture of their connected assets, and enact mitigation measures for improvement while having real-time awareness of the threats targeting them. The NDR-H solution meets industry demands and combats the rising wave of cyberattacks, actively tackling customers' most pressing security challenges.

To enhance healthcare accessibility, we have launched the Home Healthcare Initiative , ensuring doorstep medical services. This program has already begun in Kolar and will soon expand across Karnataka.” – Dinesh Gundu Rao, Minister of Health & Family Welfare Boosting Medical Tourism With its ideal climate, safety, and advanced technology, Bengaluru is set to become a global destination for medical tourism. In the coming years, even patients from developed nations will seek treatment here.” – Dr. Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman, Manipal Hospitals Trust in Healthcare Matters Bengaluru has made a global mark in healthcare, and even government hospitals now offer quality services on par with international standards. The key to progress in healthcare is trust, and we must prioritise maintaining it.” – Ramesh Aravind, Actor Strengthening Medical Education & Infrastructure Karnataka boasts a robust medical education system, and we are planning to set up medical colleges in districts that currently lack one. Additionally, new units of Kidwai and NIMHANS will be established in different regions of the state.” – Dr. Sharan Prakash Patil, Minister of Medical Education & Skill Development ******************************************************************* Cutting-Edge Technology Enhancing Precision in Healthcare Medical advancements have revolutionised patient care, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. At the VK-BM Health Excellence and Conclave, leading experts discussed innovations such as robotic surgery, advanced IVF techniques, and government-backed healthcare initiatives, shaping the future of medical treatments. Speaking on robotic-assisted surgeries, Dr. Mohan Keshavamurthy, Urologist at Fortis Hospital, stated, “Robotic surgery has significantly improved precision, reducing post-operative hospital stays. The future holds exciting possibilities with telemetric surgeries, where doctors can perform procedures remotely across borders.” Highlighting the role of 3D printing in surgery , Dr. Pramod S. Chinder of Yellow Ribbon emphasised, “3D printing simplifies complex procedures, helping doctors better understand diseases and customize treatments. This not only saves time but also speeds up patient recovery.” Addressing advancements in IVF technology, Dr. Sneha Shetty, Head of Vriksha Fertility, noted, “Over the past decade, IVF success rates have improved remarkably, bringing hope to childless couples and increasing awareness about fertility treatments.” Government initiatives are also playing a crucial role in healthcare transformation. Dr. M.G. Triveni, Director of Health & Family Welfare Services, stated, “The government is integrating cutting-edge technology into healthcare. Real-time documentation during doctor-patient interactions ensures comprehensive patient data management. Additionally, schemes like Ayushman Bharat provide free treatment at government hospitals, making quality healthcare accessible to all.” With constant advancements and the integration of technology, the future of healthcare is brighter than ever, promising precision, efficiency, and accessibility for all.

However, the data also indicated significant mortality inequities among women and diverse groups. Most health care workers, particularly physicians, had a lower mortality rate compared with the general population, an analysis published in JAMA Internal Medicine revealed. This benefit was not present among women and diverse groups, however, with the results showing “the broader effect of structural racism and sexism in society at large,” the researchers wrote. Data derived from Patel V, et al. JAMA Intern Med . 2025;doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.8432. Past research has suggested that physicians possess longer life spans, but such analyses “largely predated the 21st century and had several limitations,” according to Vishal R. Patel, MD, MPH, from Harvard Medical School, and colleagues. Factors like record-high levels of stress and burnout and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic “may be associated with the health of physicians and other health care workers, warranting an updated, large-scale evaluation of their mortality, they added. In the cross-sectional study, the researchers assessed mortality rates among eight types of health care and non-health care occupations using death certificate data, taken from the National Vital Statistics System from 2020 to 2022. The study sample included adults aged 25 to 74 years (n = 3,606,791). Researchers evaluated overall and cause-specific mortality rates for each occupation and by sex, race and ethnicity. Most health care workers had a lower rate of mortality vs. non-health care workers. For example, the analysis showed age- and sex-adjusted annual mortality rates per 100,000 people of: 269.3 for physicians (of whom had the lowest mortality rate among all health care workers); 499.2 for high-income non-health care workers; and 730.6 for all non-health care workers. Physicians had substantially lower rates for all causes of death vs. non-health care workers except for suicide and Parkinson’s disease. The researchers pointed out that although women had a lower mortality rate vs. men among all non-health care occupations (female-to-male morality rate ratio [MRR] = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.55-0.55) and high-income non-health care occupations (MRR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.6-0.6), they did not observe this difference for some health care occupations, including physicians. Instead, female physicians experienced higher mortality related to neoplasms (MRR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.36-1.54) and chronic lower respiratory diseases (MRR = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.67-3.84) compared with male physicians, despite women in high-income non-health care occupations dying less frequently from these two causes vs. their male counterparts. Patel and colleagues also pointed out that the Black to white MRR (2.13; 95% CI, 1.99-2.29) and Hispanic to white MRR (1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.27) was higher for physicians than lawyers, scientists, engineers, high-income non-health care workers and non-health care workers overall. Heart disease, neoplasms and COVID-19 contributed to the largest differences in the Black to white MRR among physicians and were more pronounced in women (2.23; 95% CI, 2-2.5) vs. men (2.08; 95% CI, 1.9-2.27) physicians. The causes of the observed inequities “are likely multifaceted,” the researchers wrote. “One associated factor may be the disproportionate health effects of the medical profession on female practitioners,” they added. “Workplace stress and exposure have been implicated as reasons for higher cancer incidence, poor birth outcomes, and depression among female physicians.” Factors tied to systematic biases, demanding work hours and policies of exclusion may also contribute to the findings. Patel and colleagues concluded that the mortality inequities seen among physicians, “whose health care knowledge, financial resources, and access to medical care, on average, exceeds that of the general population,” necessitate further research.

    "article_text": "Audio By Carbonatix The Union of Professional Nurses and Midwives, Ghana (UPNMG), has called on President John Dramani Mahama to urgently address the ongoing challenges faced by nurses and midwives in the country, following the recent State of the Nation Address, which they say failed to acknowledge their struggles. While the Union acknowledged the government's focus on national development and economic recovery, they emphasised that the speech failed to address the critical issues facing nurses and midwives—key players in Ghana's healthcare system. In a statement, the UPNMG drew attention to the hardships endured by nurses and midwives, who continue to work in challenging environments with limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. Despite their unwavering commitment, many face delayed postings, poor salaries, and a lack of essential support. As a result, a growing number of healthcare professionals are leaving the country in search of better opportunities abroad. \"Nurses and midwives are the backbone of Ghana's healthcare system, yet their struggles remain largely unacknowledged,\" the statement noted. The Union warned that the increasing migration of healthcare professionals is rapidly becoming a crisis that, if not addressed, will have severe consequences for the country’s healthcare system. \"The mass exodus of trained professionals threatens the very foundation of our healthcare services,\" they said. A major concern raised by the UPNMG was the lack of clear measures outlined in the State of the Nation Address to resolve these pressing issues. \"The address did not offer concrete solutions to the challenges that healthcare workers face, despite the vital role they play in national healthcare delivery,\" the statement continued. In light of these concerns, the UPNMG has called on the government to take immediate action on several fronts: Accelerating the recruitment and posting of trained nurses and midwives to strengthen the healthcare workforce. Improving working conditions by ensuring that healthcare professionals have the necessary resources to carry out their duties effectively. Introducing competitive salary structures to help retain skilled nurses and midwives and curb the growing trend of healthcare professional migration. Providing adequate housing for nurses and midwives, particularly in rural and underserved areas, to improve their living conditions and boost morale. Reinstating the vehicle import duty waiver to help nurses and midwives acquire reliable transport for their work, in line with provisions for other professionals. Ensuring the swift implementation of rural incentive packages to encourage healthcare workers to accept postings in remote and hard-to-reach areas. Engaging in dialogue with key stakeholders, such as UPNMG and other unions, to find sustainable solutions for improving the welfare of healthcare workers. The UPNMG stressed the importance of a well-supported healthcare workforce for the nation’s progress. \"Investing in the well-being of healthcare professionals leads to higher job satisfaction, improved retention rates, and better healthcare outcomes. This has been proven worldwide,\" they pointed out.

(AA Photo) by Anadolu Agency Feb 28, 2025 2:31 pm Ongoing attacks by the PKK/YPG terrorist group on civilians and the destruction of health care facilities have severely disrupted medical services in Syria's Manbij district, located in Aleppo province. On Dec. 9, 2024, Manbij was liberated from PKK/YPG occupation during Operation Dawn of Freedom, leaving behind a health care system in ruins due to the group's actions. Tunnels dug by PKK/YPG beneath hospitals continue to endanger both medical facilities and residents. The risk of sudden collapses further hampers the already struggling health care services. Despite the group's removal from Manbij, it continues targeting civilians and residential areas with bomb attacks, worsening the already fragile health care infrastructure. Meanwhile, health care workers are struggling to provide basic medical services with limited resources as they attempt to rebuild the district's health system. Emin Abdo, a dialysis patient at Manbij National Hospital, spoke to Anadolu Agency (AA) about the dire health care conditions in the district. He highlighted frequent power outages and fuel shortages for generators, forcing patients to travel to other cities for treatment. Abdo also noted that nearly 80% of essential medicines are unavailable. Due to high costs and medication shortages, Abdo said he is only able to receive his Epoetin injection once a week instead of three times, urging authorities to ensure the availability of necessary medicines. He added that local institutions and aid organizations are unable to provide assistance due to ongoing PKK/YPG attacks, stating: \"There are attacks by car bombs every day, in addition to the shelling and missiles hitting the city of Manbij. These are the main reasons preventing aid from reaching us.\" Emin Nur Elmeshed, Manbij's health officer, said health care services deteriorated significantly under PKK/YPG occupation, adding: \"PKK/YPG terrorists have turned the health care sector into ruins.\" Elmeshed highlighted the extensive tunnels dug beneath hospitals, saying: \"Hospitals have been converted into military bases, as proven by the presence of tunnels and operation centers beneath them — like under the National Hospital.\" He also pointed out that storage areas in health facilities were left filled with expired medicines and medical equipment. Elmeshed said they remain in constant contact with the Health Ministry and Aleppo Health Directorate to improve health care services in the district, stressing the urgent need for support to address the medication shortage. Hanadi Musa, head nurse of the intensive care unit at Manbij National Hospital, said explosions caused by PKK/YPG attacks are severely affecting patients, particularly the elderly, as the blasts create widespread fear and panic, further worsening their health conditions. She noted that the hospital has received a large number of patients injured in explosions, straining the intensive care unit's capacity. Musa emphasized that health care workers continue to perform their duties under constant fear and anxiety, urging authorities to ensure a safer working environment. \"We want these explosions and bombings to stop,\" she urged. shortlink copied KEYWORDS pkk terrorism manbij syria pkk/ypg terrorists aleppo The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

The sanction involved the revocation of the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification of the company. It has further directed Samos Pharma, a Ghanaian importer, to terminate all transactions with Aveo Pharmaceuticals and Westfin International. The FDA has also suspended the registration process for six products from Masters Pharmaceutical Limited, which planned to use Aveo Pharmaceuticals as a contract manufacturer. The BBC Africa Eye investigation claimed that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, through Westfin International, exported unapproved drugs containing tapentadol and carisoprodol—powerful and highly addictive opioids—to Ghana, Nigeria, and Côte d’Ivoire. The FDA assured the Ghanaian public that it will continue to intensify enforcement actions, including seizures, fines, and prosecutions of illegal drug distributors.

    "article_text": "Hospitals are meant to be sanctuaries of healing, yet immigration enforcement policies are turning them into sites of surveillance, fear and exclusion. Health care workers today face a stark mandate: comply with federal policies that permit Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to operate within medical settings, or resist participation in a system that undermines patient trust and public health. This dilemma is not merely an ethical concern; it is a profound threat to health care access, professional integrity and the moral foundation of medicine itself. The Trump administration’s rollback of protections barring ICE from hospitals and clinics has opened the door for enforcement actions that deter individuals living in the country illegally from seeking care. Reports from across the country show that fear of deportation has led pregnant women to avoid prenatal visits , individuals with chronic illnesses to skip necessary treatments and families to forgo emergency care . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement These effects ripple beyond the undocumented population, increasing the spread of infectious diseases, exacerbating health disparities and weakening trust in health care institutions. The erosion of trust in medical spaces due to immigration enforcement disproportionately harms already marginalized communities, further straining an overburdened health care system. Yet, health care workers are not powerless in this moment. The law provides crucial safeguards that, when understood and enforced, can mitigate the damage of immigration enforcement in hospitals. The Fourth Amendment protects patients from unwarranted searches and seizures, meaning ICE agents cannot enter private hospital spaces without a judicial warrant. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of patient information, making any health care worker who voluntarily hands over records to immigration authorities complicit in a breach of federal law. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act further guarantees that emergency medical care must be provided regardless of immigration status, making the presence of ICE in hospitals anathema to both medical ethics and legal obligations. Despite these legal protections, ICE continues to employ intimidation tactics, exploiting health care workers’ uncertainty about their rights . Agents may present administrative warrants — documents signed by ICE officials, not judges — to gain access to restricted areas or demand information about patients. However, these warrants carry no legal authority in medical settings. Health care institutions must equip their staff with the knowledge to recognize and challenge such deceptive practices. Hospitals should establish clear protocols: If ICE appears without a judicial warrant, staff should refuse entry, document the encounter and notify legal representatives immediately. Beyond legal recourse, history offers a moral precedent for health care workers facing unjust mandates. The biblical midwives Shiphrah and Puah defied Pharaoh’s orders to kill newborn Hebrew boys, instead finding ways to protect life under the guise of compliance. Their resistance was not overt rebellion; it was a strategic assertion of moral duty in the face of state-sanctioned harm. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Today’s health care workers are called to a similar form of ethical defiance — not only by refusing to comply with unjust policies but by actively creating spaces of safety and advocacy within their institutions. Some hospitals have already taken a stand, enacting sanctuary policies that prohibit cooperation with immigration enforcement and reaffirming their commitment to patient confidentiality. Health care institutions nationwide should follow suit by implementing training programs that educate staff on their legal rights, forming partnerships with immigrant advocacy groups and offering legal support to patients at risk of deportation. In addition, hospitals must develop emergency response teams trained to manage ICE encounters, ensuring that staff can respond quickly and legally when enforcement officers arrive at their facilities. Moreover, health care workers should engage in broader advocacy efforts, lobbying for policies that protect patients who are not documented and calling for legislative action that explicitly prohibits ICE presence in medical settings. Physicians and hospital administrators must leverage their positions to speak out against these enforcement tactics, using their collective voice to push back against policies that compromise public health. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The medical community has historically played a vital role in social justice movements, from advocating for civil rights to championing the fight against HIV/AIDS stigma. The current moment demands similar action. Critics argue that defying federal enforcement policies places health care workers at legal risk. However, history vindicates those who resist unjust laws. From the Civil Rights Movement to medical professionals who opposed apartheid-era racial segregation in hospitals, defiance has often been a necessary precursor to justice. The presence of ICE in hospitals is not merely a policy issue; it is a moral test for the medical profession. Will we allow the principles of compassionate care to be eroded by the politics of exclusion, or will we take a stand for the sanctity of health care as a universal human right? The time for passive concern has passed. Health care workers must act now to protect the vulnerable, uphold their ethical commitments and ensure that hospitals remain spaces of healing, not fear. This requires a collective effort, from individual clinicians to hospital administrators to policymakers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Failure to act will not only harm patients who are in the country illegally but will also erode the foundational trust that underpins the entire health care system. The cost of inaction will not be measured in policy debates or court rulings but in human lives. The mandate is clear: Resist, protect and reaffirm the duty to heal. Y.

    "article_text": "Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu In the face of an unstable and uncertain market, now may be the health-care sector's time to shine, according to BTIG. Health-care stocks were the second-worst group last year in the S & P 500 , rising less than 1% compared to a 39% gain in communication services stocks. But spurred partly by looming tariffs, investors have increasingly flocked to health-care stocks in a volatile market and macroeconomy. Health-care stocks have climbed more than 7% so far in 2025, second-best in the S & P 500, behind only consumer staples, another defensive category. That has been due to a host of individual stock performances. CVS has surged 40% in 2025, partly due to a strong fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat . Biopharma stock Gilead Sciences has popped 20% year to date, also on the back of strong fourth-quarter results. IYH YTD mountain iShares health care ETF in 2025. Going forward, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky expects this outperformance to continue. \"While it's far too soon to tell whether HC will be 2025's best sector, for now it fits the bill as a somewhat defensive group that is likely underowned given its multi-year downtrend vs. the S & P 500,\" Krinsky wrote in a report Monday. \"More recently, however, it's very close to making a multi-month relative high which suggests it should be given the benefit of the doubt.\" Krinsky said health care has not led the S & P 500 in a calendar year since 2018, when it rose 5% while the S & P 500 lost 6%. \"Interestingly that was another year that saw heightened volatility amidst geo-political uncertainty,\" Krinsky added. Krinsky highlighted some health-care stocks that could lead the sector higher this year, including GE Healthcare , a \"pre-breakout candidate that has been consolidating for a year in a wide trading range.\" He also sees more room for Gilead Sciences to move higher. The BTIG chart analyst is not alone on Wall Street in recommending health care lately. In a January note, Barclays analyst Andrew Mok called the sector one of the biggest beneficiaries following the DeepSeek-instigated Nvidia sell-off, owing to the fact investors are so underweight health care in a typical portfolio. \"The NVDA sell-off [in late January] prompted a big sector rotation within the S & P 500 that primarily benefited defensive-oriented sectors such as Health Care and consumer staples,\" he wrote. \"Any sustained underperformance in Big Tech is likely to benefit Health Care broadly and help to renew interest in facilities and managed care.\" The information technology sector has shed about 3% in 2025, second only to consumer discretionary stocks. Similarly, earlier this month, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood singled out health care as one of her biggest investment ideas of 2025. \"We've got 37 trillion cells in our body, and they're going to be sequenced as we're looking for cures,\" Wood said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" \"The most underappreciated application of AI is health care. I think health care is responsible for an incredible amount of storage out there right now. Data is the name of the game,\" Wood added.

    "article_text": "The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being regardless of race, religion, sex, political belief, economic or social condition. This is how World Health Organization’s director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, best iterates why access to health care is a fundamental human right. Last week I highlighted a workshop the Competition Commission hosted with different firms and associations active in the gas value chain. In this workshop the commission's advocacy division explained the block exemptions for stakeholders in the gas sector industry. The readers might have seen media reports that the department of trade, industry and competition (DTIC) issued a draft Interim Block Exemption for Tariffs Determination in the Healthcare Sector, 2025. What does this draft block exemption mean, and what role can you play to help shape this legislation? First, a block exemption is a legislative tool aimed at facilitating and enabling co-ordination and co-operation in an industry or sector to prevent contraventions of the Competition Act. Block exemptions are usually developed to address a concern of public interest. Before a block exemption is finalised, the draft is opened for comment, allowing industry experts, the public, associations, firms active in the industry, and other competition practitioners to be able to review the exemption and submit recommendations or opinions to the DTIC or the commission. At present the negotiation of health-care tariffs occurs on a bilateral basis between health care funders and health care providers, and there is no framework for collective determination of health care tariffs in SA. This has led to inefficiencies, high cost of health care services, pricing differences, and a lack of pricing transparency. The draft block exemption therefore seeks to contribute to making quality health care more affordable, reduce costs, and prevent the overutilisation of health care services. Establishing an equitable and transparent framework for tariff determination further contributes to the long-term goal of reducing costs and promoting universal access to health care. How exactly does this draft exemption propose tariff determination should work? The draft block exemption creates two structures for tariffs determination: The Tariffs Governing Body (“TGB”), consists mainly of experts responsible for providing oversight in the tariff determination process. The Multilateral Negotiating Forum consists of multiple stakeholders, which shall serve as the primary forum for collectively determining the maximum tariffs for prescribed and non-prescribed minimum benefits for health care services. The commission is of the view that an industry-level collective tariff determination will offer a more effective means of cost reduction across the industry, thereby fostering greater efficiency and transparency. This approach will also enhance the participation of small, medium and micro enterprises and historically disadvantaged individuals. Stakeholders and interested persons are invited to submit written comments to the DTIC on the proposed draft block exemption within a period of 30 business days from the date of publication of the draft block exemption, March 31 2025. email Galodikwe@thedtic.gov.za The draft is available on the commission's website .

Taiwan scored 86.5 on a scale of zero to 100 on the regular index and 159.2 on the exponential index, which places greater emphasis on positive responses to its surveys. However, do the rankings reflect what truly happens in Taiwan’s medical system? What I see on the front lines working at a medical center is a much starker reality. For many years, Taiwan’s medical industry has been rooted in the National Health Insurance (NHI) system, which provides high-quality services at low cost by exploiting healthcare workers, who work themselves into the ground. While they are proud of the No. 1 rankings, the government and the media turn a blind eye to the predicament faced by healthcare workers. They even use it as an excuse to rationalize not increasing NHI premiums and refusing to improve the work environment, which could lead to the collapse of the healthcare industry. The Numbeo rankings are based on how respondents feel about healthcare workers’ attitudes, convenience of access to medical services and cost. It is not a professional evaluation of the quality of medical services. Taiwan’s high satisfaction rate comes on the back of medical professionals working overtime, and dealing with low incomes and fatigue. Healthcare workers are enslaved to fill a resource gap, sacrificing their mental and physical health while earning less than they should. NHI premiums have not gone up for years. To survive, hospitals and clinics have to lower their costs and it is healthcare workers who face the consequences. Long working hours, high-risk work and low income are factors contributing to the trend of young physicians being unwilling to specialize in areas such as emergency medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology to avoid high-pressure work environments. Even fields that are said to be relatively less stressful, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, are not appealing enough to retain talent. The shortage of personnel worsens every day. Primary care providers are under pressure to deal with an increasing patient load, while the NHI system requires healthcare workers to do administrative work that is unrelated to medical care itself with no increase in resources. The government should address and recognize the predicament and stop taking credit for rankings from opinion-based surveys. It must stop finding excuses to shrug off its responsibilities to implement healthcare reform. Improving healthcare services should not require endless sacrifices by healthcare workers. For the sake of public health, problems in the industry should be addressed so that the Numbeo ranking is not merely superficial glory, but truly represents the well-being of healthcare workers and patients.

The purpose of the centers — which are open from 8am to midnight on Sundays and national holidays — is to reduce congestion in hospital emergency rooms, especially during the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday next year. It remains to be seen how effective these centers would be. For one, it is difficult for people to judge for themselves whether their condition warrants visiting a major hospital or a UCC — long-term public education and health promotions are necessary.

Although it appears to have been made in passing, the comment nevertheless reveals something about Trump’s views and his understanding of Taiwan’s situation. In line with the Taiwan Relations Act, the US and Taiwan enjoy unofficial, but close economic, cultural and national defense ties. They lack official diplomatic relations, but maintain a partnership based on shared democratic values and strategic alignment.

Although there are more current health care concerns on our minds, the murder of the United Health Care CEO should and will continue to be reviewed and examined. The U.S. health care system is broken, and the right individuals need to learn how to fix it early in their education, or we will continue with a broken, expensive health care system that serves executives and not the people for whom it is intended. The evolution of health care in the United States began with a holistic approach in the 1700s, progressed to an apprenticeship model in the 1800s, became structured in the 1900s due to the Flexner Report, and little has changed since then. Most medical schools continue to teach the two pillars of medical education: basic sciences and clinical sciences, with little regard to the third pillar of medical education: health systems science (HSS). Medical HSS experts understand the importance of teaching a systems approach to health care, but there is a struggle as to where to place the content and how much information undergraduate medical students need. They need it now, and they need it early so they can frame and understand health care as a system, not just caring for one patient at a time. HSS consists of looking at health care as a system that includes “improving quality, outcomes, and costs of health care delivery for patients and populations within systems of medical care.” This includes looking at collaboration among health care professionals, the ethics of care, patient safety, social determinants of health, population health, public health, value-based care, quality and performance improvement, technology, artificial intelligence, and other concepts. These concepts and approaches to medicine are often siloed to fit into undergraduate medical education haphazardly, not because they are not valued, but because in four years of undergraduate medical education, there is a limited amount of time. Now is the time to rethink what is important to care for the U.S. population and health care system. Is biochemistry and basic sciences more, less, or equally important as preparing our medical students to work within our broken care system? Evidence: A landmark article, “Health Systems Science: The ‘Broccoli’ of Undergraduate Medical Education,” highlighted the importance of undergraduate students getting HSS curriculum early in their medical education. The reasoning is that students do not know it is good for them but need to understand HSS to be the changemakers of the future. Do we really need to “hide the broccoli,” or should we be embracing the broccoli, loving the broccoli, and explicitly connecting the students to the importance of having this broccoli to guard health care professionals against “burnout,” which is really “moral injury”? Change is hard. As a passionate HSS medical educator, I understand the difficulty of creating and implementing HSS into undergraduate medical education. Each medical school needs to work within the boundaries of its academic calendar, limited hours, excessive testing, and preparing students for the “boards” that have a limited amount of HSS content tested. If we do not acknowledge the importance of HSS, we will not be able to have physician leaders in the future who can work on our broken system. This means that we need deep and consistent change across all schools. We cannot reform and improve the U.S. health care system without reforming the way undergraduate medical education is taught. Highlighting board scores and traditional basic sciences is short-sighted. Now is the time for medical educators to act and insist on reform and perhaps an overhaul of medical education, as it occurred over 100 years ago in the Flexner Report. We need the Broccoli Report with new recipes to include HSS, whether hidden in a brownie recipe or more appropriately highlighted as part of a stir-fry to be served and consumed by the future leaders of the U.S. health care system. These leaders should include physicians and health care advocates, not just bean counters. Killing a health care CEO is not the answer, but maybe education and advocacy is.

The Department of Government Efficiency has a crucial role to play in addressing this challenge. As a physician, I often strive to practice cost-conscious care whenever possible. Three common-sense broad reforms—repealing Certificate of Need (CON) laws, implementing universal physician licensing, and advocating for site-neutral payment reform—offer significant opportunities to reduce health care spending while improving patient care. Repealing Certificate of Need (CON) laws Certificate of Need (CON) laws are state regulatory mechanisms that require health care providers to obtain state approval before making significant capital expenditures or expanding services. These laws were originally designed to control health care costs by preventing the duplication of services and ensuring that new facilities were necessary for the community. However, CON laws often have the opposite effect. By restricting the entry of new providers and limiting competition, they enable existing facilities to maintain high prices and limit patient choice. Studies have shown that repealing these laws can lead to increased competition, lower prices, and improved access to care. For instance, in states that have repealed CON laws, there has been a notable increase in the number of health care facilities, which has enhanced access to care, especially in rural areas. Estimates suggest that repealing CON laws nationwide could save the health care system approximately $500 million annually. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, temporary suspensions of CON laws allowed for a rapid increase in hospital bed capacity, demonstrating the potential benefits of permanent repeal. Implementing universal physician licensing The current system of state-by-state physician licensing creates unnecessary barriers to health care delivery. These burdensome requirements hinder the mobility of health care providers, exacerbating shortages in underserved areas. Maintaining multiple licenses also imposes significant administrative costs on physicians, estimated at over $1 billion annually by the Niskanen Center. Universal physician licensing (similar to that of driver’s licenses) would not only reduce these costs but also facilitate the delivery of telemedicine services, improving access to care, particularly in rural areas. For example, states that have adopted universal licensing recognition have seen an increase in health care utilization and a reduction in the number of patients who forgo care due to cost. This reform would also support military families and other mobile populations by allowing health care providers to practice across state lines without the need for multiple licenses. Universal physician licensing would function similarly to state driver’s licenses. Just as a driver’s license issued in one state is recognized across all states, a universal physician license would allow doctors to practice in any state without needing to obtain separate licenses. This system would streamline the licensing process, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance the mobility of health care providers. Advocating for site-neutral payment reform Another significant source of waste stems from the current payment system, which favors hospital settings over outpatient facilities for the same services. This discrepancy incentivizes hospitals to acquire outpatient practices and charge inflated rates, driving up costs for patients and insurers. Site-neutral payment reform, which would equalize reimbursement rates regardless of location, would address this inefficiency and encourage the most cost-effective delivery of care. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has estimated that site-neutral payment policies could save Medicare $30 billion over a decade. Extrapolating these savings to the broader health care system suggests potential cost reductions exceeding $100 billion. Moreover, such reforms could reduce the financial incentives for hospital consolidation, promoting a more competitive and efficient health care market. Conclusion The Department of Government Efficiency has a unique opportunity to champion three common-sense reforms that will reduce health care waste by hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These reforms not only address critical cost-containment issues but also promise to improve access to care, particularly for underserved populations. Aamir Hussain is a dermatologist.

(NASDAQ: ACHC ) stands against other most oversold healthcare stocks to buy now. Are Healthcare Costs Rising in the US? Healthcare costs and spending have been rising in the US. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported that healthcare spending in the US reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, up 7.5% from 2022. The healthcare sector accounted for around 17.6% of the US economy in 2023, reflecting a 17.4% rise from 2022. The two primary drivers of this growth are the rise in private health insurance and Medicare.

What Could Trump’s Tariffs Mean for the Healthcare Industry Since more and more companies in the US are looking towards China for deals regarding the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer space, the impact of tariffs on this ongoing trend has become a subject of significant discussion in the healthcare industry. On February 7, Carlo Rizzuto, Versant Ventures managing director, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ to discuss the impact of tariffs on healthcare. Rizzuto believed that there are two ways in which tariffs could impact the industry. The first would be products innovated in China and brought over to the US or other markets. To understand how the tariffs would affect such trade processes, the industry would have to see how the tariffs are actually structured in the market. Secondly and more tangibly, China is a massive center for contract research and manufacturing for the US healthcare industry. Therefore, anything that increases that cost is likely to make the market conditions more challenging. The healthcare industry is already under pressure in terms of investor sentiment, and an increase in cost is not going to help its functioning. China and the US Healthcare Sector: What’s the Connection? Talking about the immense role played by China in the pharma and healthcare space, Rizzuto said that a significant majority of healthcare companies are using a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some way in the R&D process. It is thus a very significant part of how biotech or pharma companies operate in the country. This trend is widely prevalent, going from the smallest companies to the largest. Simply speaking, it is not possible for healthcare companies to reshore all of the externalized R&D and manufacturing to the US, as the country does not have enough capacity to accommodate the transfer. It is thus very difficult to imagine how a reshoring of such magnitude could take place. The costs to undertake this feat can be calculated linearly with the amount of tariffs applied. Delving deeper into the industry dynamics, Rizzuto termed the obesity space and, more broadly, the cardiometabolic domain as the single largest value-creation opportunity in the industry’s history. In a recently published article on 10 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now , we discussed whether China is the next big thing in the pharmaceutical industry. Here is an excerpt from the article: “Large American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI. Various reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China. Despite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector”.

The company ranks 11th on our list of the 12 most oversold healthcare stocks to buy now. Aristotle Small Cap Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) in its Q4 2024 investor letter : “Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC), a behavioral healthcare and substance abuse treatment services company, continues to be impacted by the negative sentiment surrounding the news headlines related to patient care and questions about billing practices. While we take these developments seriously, we believe investors’ reaction to the news has been more severe than warranted. Industry peers have faced similar levels of scrutiny in the past with limited fundamental impact, and unless additional information is uncovered, we believe the current scrutiny will be resolved without much of an impact on their business. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to be an important part of the solution to an unfortunately growing need for behavioral health services.” Overall, ACHC ranks 11th on our list of the most oversold healthcare stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of ACHC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

    "article_text": "Innovation AI AI Can Save Us: 6 New Elements Of Self-Care By John Werner , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am an MIT Senior Fellow & Lecturer, 5x-founder & VC investing in AI Follow Author Feb 20, 2025, 08:41am EST Feb 20, 2025, 10:59am EST Share Save Comment From Now to Next Daniel KRaft We are on the cusp of reimagining healthcare, with AI, wearables, multimodal data, AR/VR, and other innovations rapidly accelerating the field. Over the last few years, the medical community has witnessed AI’s growing impact on clinical care, yet we are still uncovering new ways it can save lives, improve health outcomes, and empower patients. Dr. Daniel Kraft , a leading voice in healthcare innovation and the founder of NextMed Health (coming up this March 30-April 2) , is at the forefront of this transformation. He highlights several key breakthroughs that will shape the future of medicine in the decade ahead. Vitals Monitoring 24/7 One of the most significant advances in healthcare is the ability to continuously monitor vital signs with low-cost smart wearables. Traditionally, real-time monitoring was only available in intensive care units, where clinicians could track heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital metrics. But what if these tools were available to everyone, every day? The ability to monitor key health indicators in real time could allow for early-stage detection of medical conditions, proactive interventions, and more effective, less invasive treatments. AI-driven systems will enable this shift, redefining healthcare from reactive care to continuous, personalized health optimization. Extra Vital Signs: Notes From the Personal Multiome Beyond traditional vital signs, AI is also unlocking insights from new types of multimodal health data. Kraft emphasizes the potential of integrating genomics, microbiome analysis, metabolomics, and social determinants of health into comprehensive health profiles. These data streams can create intelligent health agents that tailor recommendations based on a person’s age, culture, personality, and health goals. “I like to think of it more (as) ‘generative health’, that the new multimodal forms of data from our genome, metabolome, microbiome, sociome, digitome, etc, can come together and be made sense of,” Kraft suggested in a recent talk , “where our health agents will interact with us based on our age, culture, language, personality type, education level, healthcare goals, etc” MORE FOR YOU With AI making sense of these complex systems, we can better understand what is happening inside our bodies daily, enabling more proactive and personalized healthcare approaches. This shift will not only extend our years of optimal health but also minimize the time spent dealing with disease. A ‘Check Engine Light’ for the Body Early diagnosis remains one of the most powerful ways to improve health outcomes. AI-powered diagnostic tools are proving capable of detecting diseases such as cancer, heart conditions, and neurological disorders earlier and with greater accuracy than ever before. Machine learning models trained on medical imaging are already assisting radiologists in identifying abnormalities with remarkable precision. With AI-driven diagnostics becoming more integrated into clinical workflows, early detection and timely intervention could become the norm, significantly reducing the need for invasive treatments and improving survival rates. Democratizing Access Widespread health monitoring leads to better outcomes, but AI’s true game-changing potential lies in making healthcare more affordable and accessible to all. The high cost of medical care is driven by expensive personnel and specialized equipment, creating barriers for many patients. However, AI has the power to reduce costs and improve efficiency, shifting healthcare delivery away from its dependence on human labor and costly infrastructure. Recent U.S. HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm recently addressed AI’s potential in transforming healthcare accessibility, stating: “At HHS, we are optimistic about the transformational potential of AI … these technologies hold unparalleled ability to drive innovation through accelerating scientific breakthroughs, improving medical product safety and effectiveness, improving health outcomes through care delivery, increasing access to human services, and optimizing public health. However, our optimism is tempered with a deep sense of responsibility. We need to ensure that Americans are safeguarded from risks. Deployment and adoption of AI should benefit the American people, and we must hold stakeholders across the ecosystem accountable to achieve this goal.” By integrating AI into healthcare workflows, automation, remote diagnostics, and virtual health assistants will help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve care quality. This shift has the potential to bridge healthcare disparities, making high-quality medical services more accessible—not just for the privileged few, but for everyone. If implemented thoughtfully, AI won’t just improve healthcare—it will help democratize it. Knock-off Effects on Traditional Practices The integration of AI into healthcare will also reshape medical practice. The first-year medical students of today won’t complete their training until 2032, and by then, AI will be deeply embedded in clinical workflows. AI-powered decision support systems will assist doctors in diagnostics, treatment planning, and surgery, reducing cognitive overload and improving patient outcomes. AI-driven automation will also help alleviate burnout by streamlining administrative tasks, allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care. Medicine has traditionally been slow to adopt new technologies, but AI is providing an opportunity to rethink traditional practices and build a more efficient and patient-centered healthcare system. The Digital Twin Another transformative aspect of AI in healthcare is the emergence of digital twins—a concept that involves creating virtual replicas of complex systems. In medicine, a digital twin of a patient could serve as a real-time model of their health, allowing for highly personalized diagnostics, predictive insights, and tailored interventions. Augmented reality (AR),virtual reality (VR) and spatial computing are also becoming valuable tools in medical training and patient care, providing interactive environments for education and real-time guidance for complex procedures. AI-enhanced overlays in AR can provide critical information to surgeons or help physicians visualize patient data in new ways, enhancing precision and decision-making. Transforming Health Just as a last point: Kraft also talks about agentic AI and the use of digital agents to help us keep tabs on our health – to foster conversations, to give warnings, to make recommendations or suggestions, and to help us feel more empowered to take control of our health day to day. These AI-powered assistants will act as personal health companions, tracking vitals, lifestyle habits, and medical history to provide real-time feedback and proactive health recommendations. These digital agents will foster conversations around health, issue early warnings, and help people take greater control of their well-being. As AI continues to evolve, it will shift healthcare from a reactive system focused on treating illness to a proactive model centered on prevention and optimization. The convergence of AI, wearables, digital health platforms, and personalized medicine is poised to revolutionize healthcare. In the coming years, these technologies will make preventive, predictive, and personalized healthcare the standard, improving patient outcomes, extending longevity, and reducing disparities. The question is not whether AI will transform healthcare—it already is. The real challenge lies in ensuring we harness its potential responsibly and equitably, making the future of healthcare more intelligent, accessible, and human-centered.

Hospitals and clinics are dealing with new technology, financial pressures, and changing patient needs. Many are looking for ways to improve efficiency while controlling costs. Outsourcing has become a practical way to handle essential but time-consuming tasks like medical billing, customer support, and clinical research management. BruntWork has built a strong reputation by offering tailored outsourcing solutions for healthcare providers. Healthcare outsourcing with focus on smart solutions and savings A look at BruntWork Why Healthcare Outsourcing Is Growing Healthcare providers increasingly rely on outsourcing to manage administrative and operational work. Costs keep climbing, and staff shortages continue to strain resources. Healthcare outsourcing allows hospitals and clinics to focus more on patient care while keeping day-to-day operations on track. The healthcare business process outsourcing (BPO) industry was valued at $25.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $44.5 billion by 2027. One of the main factors driving this expansion is the increased use of telehealth and remote care, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Outsourcing companies provide the technical support needed to keep virtual healthcare services running smoothly. Automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are also changing how healthcare functions. Administrative tasks like medical coding and claims processing are now handled by software, reducing errors and speeding up work. Another area receiving attention is revenue cycle management (RCM), which helps healthcare facilities handle billing and payment processing. Analysts expect more healthcare organizations to outsource RCM services by 2025, leading to better financial stability for hospitals and clinics. BruntWork has gained recognition in customer service outsourcing, helping healthcare organizations reduce administrative workload while making sure patients receive timely assistance. BruntWork’s Perspective on Healthcare Outsourcing BruntWork CEO Winston Ong believes outsourcing improves efficiency and patient care. \"Outsourcing allows providers to focus on what they do best—caring for patients,\" he says. Along with keeping daily operations efficient, outsourcing helps healthcare providers reduce expenses. Organizations can save 30-40% by outsourcing tasks like billing and administrative support. Many clinics and hospitals hire a virtual assistant to handle documentation, insurance claims, and data entry, leading to even greater cost savings. These savings can then go toward expanding medical services, upgrading technology, and hiring more healthcare professionals. The Risks and Considerations in Healthcare Outsourcing While outsourcing provides benefits, it also presents risks, especially in cybersecurity and legal compliance. Sharing patient data with external providers raises concerns about privacy and security breaches. Cyberattacks targeting healthcare organizations have become more frequent, making strong security measures necessary. Encryption, secure cloud storage, and strict access controls help protect sensitive patient data. Hiring a virtual assistant for data entry can help healthcare providers manage large volumes of patient records, insurance claims, and administrative documentation more efficiently. However, it is critical to ensure that these assistants follow strict data protection protocols. Any mishandling of sensitive information could lead to compliance violations and security threats. Regulations add another layer of complexity. Medical providers must confirm that outsourcing companies follow laws like HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR in Europe. Failing to meet these requirements can result in serious legal and financial consequences. Healthcare organizations need to carefully review outsourcing providers and establish clear agreements on data protection. What Lies Ahead for Healthcare Outsourcing Outsourcing in healthcare is expected to expand in the coming years. The hospital outsourcing industry alone is projected to grow at an annual rate of 10.34% between 2025 and 2034. As AI and automation continue to develop, outsourcing will likely become even more common. Ong believes AI will change how outsourcing functions. \"AI and automation are making healthcare outsourcing more efficient, reducing costs, and improving patient care,\" he says. Using advanced technology can simplify processes and allow more time for personalized care. Outsourcing continues to help healthcare organizations manage costs, streamline operations, and reduce administrative burdens. As telehealth, AI, and automation advance, companies like BruntWork are playing a strong role in helping medical providers adjust. However, cybersecurity and compliance remain serious concerns, making it essential for healthcare organizations to choose outsourcing partners that prioritize data security and legal requirements. Those who successfully integrate outsourcing into their operations will be better prepared to handle increasing demands while maintaining high-quality patient care.

Article Insights Taft Stettinius & Hollister are most popular: within Strategy and Insurance topic(s) with readers working within the Environment & Waste Management, Utilities and Construction & Engineering industries On Feb. 13, the Indiana House of Representatives passed Indiana House Bill 1666 (HB 1666), which, if signed into law, would expand the existing notification requirement for health care transactions to all health care entities and would require certain health care entities to annually report ownership information to the state. HB 1666 now moves to the Indiana Senate. Current Indiana Law Under current Indiana law, following the passage of Senate Bill 9 , which went into effect July 1, 2024, Indiana health care entities seeking to enter into a merger or acquisition transaction with another health care entity must notify the Indiana Attorney General (AG) at least ninety days before the date of the merger or acquisition. Under current law, this requirement only applies where the transaction involves a health care entity with at least $10 million in assets. Changes under Indiana HB 1666 Transaction Reporting Requirements: HB 1666 would expand the health care transaction reporting requirement to cover any merger or acquisition between an Indiana health care entity and another health care entity, removing the $10 million asset threshold. In addition, HB 1666 would require notice to be sent to the office of the Indiana AG and a \"merger approval board,\" which would approve or deny the proposed mergers and acquisitions. The board would consist of the Indiana AG, the Secretary of Health and Family, the Secretary of Business Affairs, and two members appointed by the Governor. The board would have ninety days after receiving notice to approve or deny the transaction, though they could extend their decision by ninety days for \"good cause.\" The following criteria must be met for a proposed transaction to be approved: The transaction would not significantly reduce the availability or accessibility of health care services for the affected community. The transaction is in the public interest. The health care entity involved in the transaction exercised due diligence in: (1) deciding to go forward with the transaction, (2) identifying each person to engage in the transaction, and (3) negotiating the terms of the transaction. The health care entity used adequate procedures in agreeing to the transaction, including using appropriate expert assistance. Any conflict of interest that could impact competition in the relevant market was disclosed to each health care entity involved in the transaction, including any conflict of interest related to each entity's directors, executives, experts, partnerships, and joint ventures. Any management contract proposed under the transaction is for reasonably fair value. In transactions between health care entities, the health care entity being acquired will receive full and fair market value. The proposed transaction complies with applicable state or federal law. HB 1666 would also allow the Indiana AG to bring a civil action for equitable relief to enforce the requirements and/or to impose a civil penalty of up to $15 million for violations. Ownership Information Reporting Requirements: HB 1666 would require certain health care entities to file annual reports to Indiana state agencies disclosing ownership information. Specifically, the bill would require: Hospitals to report ownership information in their annual fiscal report to the Indiana Department of Health. Physician groups with at least one physical location in Indiana and two or more licensed physicians to report ownership information to the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency. Insurers, third party administrators, and pharmacy benefit managers doing business in Indiana to report ownership information to the Indiana Department of Insurance. Other health care entities, defined as any businesses providing diagnostic, medical, surgical, dental treatment, or rehabilitative care, to report ownership information to the Indiana Department of Health. The required ownership information would include the name, business address, and identification number of each person or entity that has: (1) at least a 5% ownership interest in the entity, (2) a controlling interest in the entity, or (3) an interest in the entity as a private equity partner. If the information is not reported on time, the proposed bill would allow for a civil penalty of $500 per day for physician group practices with less than five physicians and $1,000 per day for health care entities, physician group practices with five or more physicians, and insurers, third party administrators, and pharmacy benefit managers. Indiana law already allows for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per day for hospitals that do not file their annual fiscal report on time, and the proposed bill would include ownership information in this report.

The visit was part of ongoing efforts to enhance bilateral cooperation in healthcare infrastructure, medical training, and health management at the district and sub-district levels. Ambassador Park Kyongsig reaffirmed Korea’s long-standing commitment to supporting Ghana’s healthcare development, particularly in areas such as maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and capacity building for healthcare workers. “Korea is dedicated to strengthening Ghana’s health systems to ensure accessible and efficient medical services for all citizens,” Ambassador Park stated during the meeting. Accompanying the Ambassador were representatives from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH).

United States Employment and HR Hall Benefits Law Your Author LinkedIn Connections To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Just before the presidential inauguration, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced the termination of its COVID-19 healthcare rulemaking . OSHA originally issued an Emergency Temporary Standard on June 21, 2021. The purpose of the standard was to protect workers in healthcare settings from COVID-19. The agency published the Emergency Temporary Standard as a proposed rule, soliciting comments from stakeholders and other members of the public. OSHA also held public hearings on the issue from June 2021 to May 2022. OSHA submitted a draft final COVID-19 rule to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on December 7, 2022. However, on April 10, 2023, President Biden signed House Joint Resolution 7 into law, which terminated the federal government's national emergency declaration in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its statement, OSHA reasoned that it chose to terminate the COVID-19 healthcare rulemaking in favor of pursuing generalized Infectious Diseases rulemaking for healthcare. The agency explained that focusing on mitigating workers' exposure to occupational exposure to all infectious diseases in the healthcare setting was a better use of its resources than solely gearing the rule toward COVID-19. With today's announcement, OSHA is now terminating the rulemaking because the most effective and efficient use of agency resources to protect healthcare workers from occupational exposure to COVID-19, as well as a host of other infectious diseases, is to focus its resources on the completion of an Infectious Diseases rulemaking for healthcare.

    "article_text": "Share We recently published a list of the 10 Best Performing Healthcare Stocks So Far in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Doximity, Inc. (NYSE: DOCS ) stands against other best performing healthcare stocks so far in 2025. The Healthcare Sector and its Dynamics in the Stock Market Despite the ongoing craze surrounding the GLP-1 obesity drugs, the healthcare sector was a lagger last year. On January 3, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America’s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to talk about the healthcare sector’s outlook in 2025. While he anticipates another year of underperformance for the sector, he also believes that healthcare has “been so bad, maybe it’s gonna be good” in 2025. Holz further said that the healthcare sector presents a calamity since there aren’t a lot of easy spaces in the domain. Other industry verticals, such as technology and financials, are well set up. Healthcare, in contrast, appears to have several variables in place, and most of them are not positive. However, he believed that the MedTech sector provides a sort of safety net in such a tumultuous sector. We talked about the medical device sector and the future of the healthcare industry in the US in a recently published article on 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . Here is an excerpt from the article: “According to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth. In addition, pharmacy services, especially those focused on specialty pharmacy, are expected to see continued growth. The launch of new therapies and increased utilization are expected to be the primary drivers of this growth. McKinsey estimates specialty pharmacy revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, growing EBITDA for managed service providers and specialty pharmacies. Therefore, optimistic trends are materializing for the healthcare industry as a whole, including the medical device sector”. AI and its Use in Healthcare: Is It All a Hoax? Talking about the recent trends involving the increasing use of AI in the healthcare sector, Holz said that the scenario is possibly helping the software and technology companies more than healthcare ones. AI and its impact on drug development in clinical trials is another significant subject of discussion in the healthcare sector. However, Holz said that the industry is not really seeing the positive impact of the adoption of AI in the sector. Several clinical trials employing AI have failed in the recent past. So, even though it seems that the science and technology behind the scenes is getting better, it hasn’t necessarily translated to better drug development and higher approval rates. Although he expects that the use of AI may lead to better results in the future, Holz believes that it is too early to make generalizations that the AI craze will lead to better results for biotech or pharma, at least in the near term. Our Methodology We used Finviz to screen healthcare stocks and looked at their year-to-date (YTD) performance, as of February 17, 2025, to select the best performing stocks. We also included the number of hedge fund holders for each stock as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of year-to-date performance. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ) . A pathologist and a laboratory assistant in a laboratory researching medical news and data. Doximity, Inc. (NYSE: DOCS ) YTD Performance: 45.96% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19 Doximity, Inc. (NYSE:DOCS) develops and operates an online platform for medical professionals. Its cloud-based software allows physicians and healthcare professionals to collaborate with their colleagues, conduct virtual patient visits, coordinate patient care, manage their careers, and stay on top of the latest medical news. It offers Hiring, Marketing, and Productivity Solutions to health systems, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical recruiting firms, and other healthcare companies. Its Productivity Solutions segment comprises on-call scheduling, telehealth, and AI-assisted medical correspondence tools that help clinicians streamline their workflow. The company reported impressive fiscal Q3 2025 results, resulting in soaring bullish sentiments for the company. Its net income for fiscal Q3 2024 grew 57% year-over-year to $75.2 million, while net profit for the first nine months rose by 50.2% year-over-year to $160.7 million. Revenue for fiscal Q3 2025 also grew by 24.6% year-over-year, reaching $168.6 million. Doximity, Inc. (NYSE:DOCS) expects this momentum to continue and anticipates revenue for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, to settle between $564.6 million and $565.6 million. Doximity, Inc. (NYSE:DOCS) anticipates the pharma healthcare professionals (HCP) digital market to grow approximately 5% to 7%, and plans to grow ahead of the overall market. Its record engagement and strong competitive standing position it to attain this objective. Overall, DOCS ranks 10th on our list of the best performing healthcare stocks so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of DOCS, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

These health systems are in crisis, as evidenced by reduced access to patient centred healthcare, longer waiting times, delayed diagnoses, and poorer health outcomes. 5 6 7 Over the past 20 years, European health systems have become increasingly reliant on international medical graduates from low to middle income countries, 8 which also face healthcare shortages. 9 The World Health Organization (WHO) has forecast worsening health professional shortages globally, up to 12.9 million by 2035. 10 Training refugee and asylum seeking healthcare professionals to work in host health systems could provide a rapid, cost effective, ethical alternative to recruiting international medical graduates, which we are involved in, while also allowing individuals to retain their professional identity.

    "article_text": "Salute to Marina staff! But let's fix healthcare system Tuesday, February 18, 2025 | 440 Views | The Monitor Editor Share Tweet Share Email sms Listen The recent incident at Princess Marina Hospital has once again highlighted the nation's healthcare professionals' tireless dedication and unwavering commitment. Under extremely challenging circumstances and with dilapidated equipment, the team at the referral hospital, consisting of doctors, nurses, engineers, and healthcare assistants, managed to save a patient's life during an emergency operation despite a sudden power failure caused by a faulty generator. Their ability to remain calm and focused, immediately switching to 'lifesaving mode' ensured that the patient emerged from the ordeal unscathed and is now recovering well, per a press release from the ministry. Moments like these remind us of the true heroes within our healthcare system. The Marina team and countless other healthcare workers across the country continue to perform miracles every day, often with limited resources and in less-than-ideal conditions. Their dedication to duty is commendable, and they deserve our heartfelt gratitude and recognition. However, whilst we celebrate these gallant efforts, we must also address the systemic issues plaguing healthcare facilities. The Ministry of Health's decision to publicly appreciate the Marina team is undoubtedly well-deserved, but it shouldn't distract us from the underlying problems that necessitate such heroic measures. Our healthcare system is in dire need of comprehensive reform. Many of our hospitals are in a state of disrepair, with outdated and malfunctioning equipment, inadequate staffing, and insufficient resources. Incidents like the one at Princess Marina Hospital should serve as a wake-up call for the ministry to take immediate and decisive action to address these issues. It isn't enough to simply praise our healthcare workers for their resilience and resourcefulness. We must ensure that they are provided with the necessary tools, equipment, and support to perform their duties effectively and safely. The ministry must prioritise the resourcing of hospitals and the maintenance of equipment to prevent such incidents from recurring. Celebrating the heroism of our healthcare professionals should go hand-in-hand with efforts to improve the conditions under which they work. Whilst we join the Ministry of Health in applauding the incredible efforts of the Marina team and other dedicated healthcare workers across the country, we must also hold the ministry accountable for the state of our healthcare facilities. Let's channel our admiration into action and advocate for a healthcare system that isn't only capable of saving lives in emergencies but also equipped to provide consistent, high-quality care to all citizens."

A unified monitoring system, aligned with clinical workflows such as alarm assessments, will be established. The infrastructure will be co-designed to achieve interoperability, ensure cloud and cybersecurity alignment, and support clinical workflow assessments. Additionally, AI-powered models and algorithms will be jointly developed to monitor developments in patients’ conditions, optimize alarm management, and deliver clinical parameter dashboards and avatars. Partnerships key to future-proofing healthcare delivery with innovation One of the key challenges in the complexities of the healthcare system is the ability to access and integrate different data sources to form a cohesive patient story. Accurate and timely access to data at critical points in a patient’s journey is key in the digital transformation of the healthcare system. According to the Singapore FHI 2024 report findings , more than one-third (37%) of healthcare leaders surveyed are looking to external partnerships to use data analytics for more informed decision-making. Please refer to Annex for more info on Singapore findings of the Philips Future Health Index (FHI) 2024 report. Philips has previously partnered SingHealth in the implementation of an iECG initiative to transform the delivery of cardiovascular care in Singapore . Philips also partnered Singapore General Hospital to advance its medical imaging capabilities . “We believe in harnessing the power of strategic partnerships to address the unique healthcare needs of the Asia Pacific . By conducting thorough reviews of current capacities, processes and workflows, and thoughtfully integrating advanced technologies in a way that best supports staff, we are dedicated to improving healthcare outcomes and efficiency across this diverse and dynamic region,” said Jasper Westerink , Acting Managing Director, Philips APAC . “I’m excited about how our upcoming projects will positively impact patient care and digital healthcare innovation in the region, especially since SingHealth is Singapore’s largest healthcare group and has a track record of setting standards of excellence in patient-centred clinical care, and since Singapore is a key medical hub.” Mr Lawrence Loke , Group Chief Information Officer, SingHealth , said, “This collaboration between SingHealth and Philips is a big stride forward in accelerating healthcare innovation in Singapore . By combining our deep and broad range of clinical expertise with Philips’ cutting-edge technology, we are prioritizing the needs of our patients in reimagining healthcare delivery. From ‘Smart ICUs’ to AI-driven diagnostics, our singular goal is to enhance patient outcomes and experiences. In our efforts to pilot transformative care models, we hope that our patients will receive personalized, timely and accessible care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes possible for them.” As a key medical hub in the Asia Pacific , partnerships like these position Singapore well in leading the charge to pioneer and deploy next-generation healthcare technologies, driving efficiency, better care, and more accessible health services for more people across the region. [1] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/singapore-healthcare-hospital-telehealth-diabetes-remote-3802171 About Royal Philips Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA) is a leading health technology company focused on improving people’s health and well-being through meaningful innovation.

News about Philips can be found at www.philips.com/newscenter . Annex Addressing healthcare system challenges: Workforce, data and workflow optimization With Singapore’s population set to become “super-aged” by 2026, and 21% of its population over the age of 65, the healthcare system faces mounting pressures.[1] According to the Singapore findings of the Philips Future Health Index (FHI) 2024 report , nearly two-thirds (65%) of healthcare leaders report that workforce shortages are leading to staff having less time with patients, higher patient-to-staff ratios and/or an increase in clinical errors. These challenges highlight the urgent need to augment clinical manpower and address growing patient workloads and demands on Singapore’s health services. In addition to workforce shortages, healthcare leaders identified workflow prioritization as a key area for automation, which can help healthcare professionals better manage high patient volumes without compromising on care quality. For instance, automated initial screening of medical images can help prioritize cases and direct them to the right sub-specialty radiologist. Similarly, automated triaging systems can assist emergency department staff, improving efficiency and reducing strain on personnel. Philips FHI 2024 report also revealed that 84% of Singapore’s healthcare leaders face data integration challenges, which hamper their ability to deliver timely, high-quality care. The inability to fully utilize data has wide-ranging effects, from financial and operational concerns to limiting coordination between clinicians and reducing their time spent with patients. Overcoming barriers to integrate data accessibly across clinical operations, human resources, and financials for reporting is therefore critical for continuous improvement, better decision-making and better patient empowerment."

Annex Addressing healthcare system challenges: Workforce, data and workflow optimization With Singapore's population set to become \"super-aged\" by 2026, and 21% of its population over the age of 65, the healthcare system faces mounting pressures.[1] According to the Singapore findings of the Philips Future Health Index (FHI) 2024 report , nearly two-thirds (65%) of healthcare leaders report that workforce shortages are leading to staff having less time with patients, higher patient-to-staff ratios and/or an increase in clinical errors. These challenges highlight the urgent need to augment clinical manpower and address growing patient workloads and demands on Singapore's health services. In addition to workforce shortages, healthcare leaders identified workflow prioritization as a key area for automation, which can help healthcare professionals better manage high patient volumes without compromising on care quality. For instance, automated initial screening of medical images can help prioritize cases and direct them to the right sub-specialty radiologist. Similarly, automated triaging systems can assist emergency department staff, improving efficiency and reducing strain on personnel. Philips FHI 2024 report also revealed that 84% of Singapore's healthcare leaders face data integration challenges, which hamper their ability to deliver timely, high-quality care. The inability to fully utilize data has wide-ranging effects, from financial and operational concerns to limiting coordination between clinicians and reducing their time spent with patients. Overcoming barriers to integrate data accessibly across clinical operations, human resources, and financials for reporting is therefore critical for continuous improvement, better decision-making and better patient empowerment.

    "article_text": "While health insurance can prevent emergencies and catastrophic conditions from decimating your financial plans, the premiums and out-of-pocket expenses can also take a toll on your wallet. In 2024, the average annual premium for a single individual was nearly $9,000—and an estimated $25,500 for a family of four. While many workplaces subsidize these premiums, and the Affordable Care Act opened access to health care for Americans not covered by employer plans, health insurance is still often a costly budget item that some individuals may forgo. In these cases, Americans may be making tradeoffs between their health and their financial well-being. With this in mind, SmartAsset ranked 810 U.S. counties based on the rate of people under age 65 who were insured in 2024. Annual changes in coverage, coverage of children, and the relative presence of primary care physicians in each county are also examined. Key Findings These Texas counties have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage nationwide. More than any other county, 32% of residents in Hidalgo County don't have health insurance. Cameron County (30.1% uninsured), Webb County (29.7%), Starr County (29%), Ector County (25.3%), Potter County (24.4%), Dallas County (24.2%), Harris County (23.8%), and El Paso County (23.5%) are also among the top 10 uninsured counties nationwide. More than 96% of the population has health insurance in this state. Massachusetts dominates the rankings for high rates of health insurance coverage. Norfolk County has the highest rate of insurance at 97.6%. Statewide, more than 98.5% of children under age 19 have health insurance. These counties have the highest and lowest rates of primary care physicians. Orange County, TX, ranking 84th overall for lowest rate of health insurance among the population, has 6,053 residents per primary care physician – more than any other county studywide. On the other hand, 18th place Smith County, TX has the smallest number of residents per primary care physician studywide at 1,014. The biggest swings in coverage year over year happened in these counties. Relative to the population, Tom Green County, TX (25th highest rank of uninsured residents) saw the biggest drop in insurance coverage, going from 17.5% uninsured in 2023 to 20.2% uninsured in 2024. Meanwhile, Elkhart County, IN saw the biggest relative improvement in insurance coverage, going from 16.6% uninsured in 2023 to 13.3% uninsured in 2024.

The world is looking to India's healthcare systems to provide affordable and dignified services for transgender peoples A special health camp organised for transgender people in Pune. (Express file photo by Arul Horizon) Aqsa Shaikh February 24, 2025 11:23 AM IST First published on: Feb 18, 2025 at 07:08 PM IST Share Comments Print A primary agenda of the Trump administration is the erosion of transgender rights . Soon after taking office, the US president issued an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognise only two sexes — male and female — as unchangeable, impacting federal IDs like passports. Another executive order banned federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender individuals under 19 years of age, depriving them of vital life-saving services such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement treatments. Trump also reinstated a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military and on transgender women and girls from participating in women’s sports in federally-funded schools. He even mandated that transgender individuals be housed in detention according to their sex assigned at birth, posing significant risks of physical and sexual violence. As if this didn’t cause enough damage, USAID operations, a strong supporter of many transgender healthcare initiatives, including in India, have been shut down pending review, leaving many transgender employees jobless and beneficiaries of these services helpless without an alternative. This change has had global repercussions. In India, the Mitr Clinic, supported by USAID and serving hundreds of transgender clients with essential services like mental healthcare and transition-related medical services, has been shut down. The US, once a global leader in transgender rights and healthcare, has suddenly become a dangerous place for transgender people to live in and access healthcare. Advertisement This development is undoubtedly disastrous. Within this tragedy, however, lies an opportunity for India. Transgender rights in India are legally protected, thanks to the 2014 NALSA vs Union of India judgment and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019. India is one of the few countries that legally recognises more than two genders. The law mandates anti-discrimination measures in education, employment, housing, and access to public spaces and offices for transgender persons. It also supports transgender individuals seeking sex reassignment surgery, promising at least one government hospital providing these services per state. A couple of years ago, Ayushman Bharat announced the Ayushman Bharat TG Plus card, offering a package of Rs 5,00,000 per person for transgender individuals to access any inpatient medical care, including gender-affirming services. It, however, is yet to be implemented. While Indian doctors are considered among the best in the world, the provision of transgender-friendly services in India remains sub-optimal. Much of this stems from the lack of transgender care competencies in medical and healthcare professional courses. On the insistence of the Madras High Court, the National Medical Commission removed homophobic and transphobic content from medical curricula and included some LGBTQIA+ competencies. A Centre of Excellence for Transgender Healthcare has been initiated at AIIMS, New Delhi . Still, the number of gender affirmation surgeries happening in our public healthcare system is just a handful, while the private sector is inundated with demand for the same by a growing pool of clientele who need these life-saving services and are willing to pay for them. Contrast this with Thailand, which performs one of the highest numbers of transgender surgeries in the world. There is no reason why India cannot become a hub for such procedures. Also in Opinion | In one stroke, Trump has effectively deleted transgender people from his America India boasts of a cultural and societal acceptance of sexual and gender minorities, a constitutional and legal framework for providing transgender healthcare services, a strong network of community-based organizations advocating for transgender health and rights, capable doctors who can be trained in providing highly skilled services, a burgeoning private healthcare sector, and a friendly medical tourism policy. Advertisement As the US and some European countries impose restrictions on gender-affirming services, the world is looking to India for its healthcare systems to rise and shine in providing quality, affordable, and dignified healthcare services for transgender individuals. In this challenging time, with anti-trans legislation being enacted in many countries, India can be a beacon of hope for transgender individuals seeking affordable and quality healthcare. most read 1 Red Fort blast: After 14 years of calm in Delhi, one night of fear rekindles security concerns 2 C Raja Mohan writes: India-Bhutan ties show how to get it right in a challenging neighbourhood 3 For a country that believes in non-violence, SC order on stray dogs should be unacceptable 4 Yogendra Yadav writes: We need to move from a caste census with a capital C to one with a small c 5 On stray dogs issue, SC undermines its own balanced approach To make this possible, we need strict implementation of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights Act) 2019 and Rules 2020, inclusion of transgender healthcare services in medical curricula, training of in-service doctors in highly specialised transgender surgeries, professional guidelines for providing these services, a conducive medical tourism policy catering to transgender clientele, strengthening of services in the public healthcare system including the Ayushman Bharat TG Plus scheme, and improved passport, visa, and document-change policies. The budget for transgender issues in India has been dismally low and needs a significant increase, with an enhanced role for the health ministry to cater to the healthcare needs of transgender people. The time has come for India to put its policies into action and create an ecosystem that cares for transgender persons who need life-saving gender affirmation services. With proper policy and action, India can truly become a vishwaguru for transgender healthcare.

By CASSIDY MORRISON, US SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER Published: 17:00 EST, 17 February 2025 | Updated: 18:59 EST, 17 February 2025 e-mail 29 shares 21 View comments Some Americans are paying 10 times more in out-of-pocket healthcare fees simply because of where they live. Experts say a confluence of factors - fewer doctors to treat people in rural areas, more uninsured people in Southern states, and high reliance on private insurance in the Northeast and Upper Midwest - contributes to major insurance price disparities county-by-county. A sweeping new analysis found that, while health insurance covers most healthcare costs, Americans spent nearly half a trillion dollars in out-of-pocket costs on healthcare services in 2019 — a new record. Counties in Alaska , Wyoming , Montana , and the Dakotas, as well as parts of New England, had the highest rates of out-of-pocket spending in 2019, ranging from $720 to $2,335 per person. The analysis by University of Washington Researchers showed these states and New England rely heavily on private health insurance companies to cover bills. When people seek care their insurance covers, they still face out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance. Meanwhile, many counties in Southern states , where people are more likely to be underinsured, tended to have lower out-of-pocket spending, suggesting without health coverage, people may avoid medical care altogether. And in coastal areas, high out-of-pocket spending corresponded with locations of metropolitan areas, including Boston, Washington, DC , Miami, Los Angeles , and Seattle, where healthcare tends to be more expensive. In 2019, rural states like Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas had the highest out-of-pocket spending, ranging from $720 to $2,335 per person. In contrast, counties in Southern states with higher underinsurance rates had lower spending, indicating that lack of coverage may lead people to avoid care Researchers at the University of Washington's School of Medicine analyzed over 40billion insurance claims, nearly one billion facility records, and survey data to show how healthcare spending on 148 health conditions varies across 3,110 counties. For people under 65, about 12 percent of healthcare spending was by the patient out of pocket, which amounts to approximately $288 billion. Read More New data reveals which health insurers deny the most claims from poor people Over half of healthcare services were paid for by private insurance, about 25 percent by Medicaid, and seven percent by Medicare. After age 65, when a person is automatically enrolled in Medicare (the federally-funded healthcare program for seniors), 11.5 percent of services were paid for by the patient out of pocket, which amounts to about $276billion Over 60 percent of services are paid for by Medicare. More than 18 percent of services were paid for by private insurance, and seven percent by Medicaid. The biggest differences in healthcare spending across counties were seen in the amount people paid out of pocket, adjusted for age. The out-of-pocket costs that Americans pay have risen over time. The latest study did not estimate per-person out of pocket spending in 2019, but the Kaiser Family Foundation put the total at $1,375 per person , up from $900 per person 30 years ago. In addition to patient out-of-pocket spending, researchers looked at how much private insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid (the healthcare program for low-income Americans) spent on healthcare services from check-ups to hospital stays. The latest study covered more than 76 percent of all personal healthcare spending from 2010 to 2019. The main driver of differences in healthcare spending by county was the utilization rate, or how much people use healthcare services. More doctor visits, preventive screenings, and diagnostic tests mean more spending by insurers or patients The main driver of differences in healthcare spending by county was the utilization rate, or how much people use healthcare services. More doctor visits, preventive screenings, and diagnostic tests mean more spending by insurers or patients. Without insurance, the costs of essential services can be prohibitively high. As a result, almost half of uninsured people forgo medical care due to cost. Dr Joseph Dieleman, the study’s lead author, said: ‘If people had better insurance coverage, they would be more likely to pursue regular health checkups, potentially reducing the need for emergency care. ‘This change would also lead to better health outcomes and allow emergency providers to focus on patients with urgent medical needs.’ The Southeast and Southwest tend to have higher shares of uninsured populations, with people in the Southeast mainly relying on their states’ Medicaid programs. When the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare - was signed into law, states were allowed to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more people across a wider income range and receive more money from the federal government to do so. Ten states — Wyoming, Texas, Kansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, and Wisconsin — have yet to expand Medicaid. Southern states account for about 92 percent of the 2.5million people in the Medicaid coverage gap. The counties with the highest age-standardized spending per capita in 2019 were Nassau County, New York ($13,332), Suffolk County, New York ($12,689), and the District of Columbia ($12,534). On the other hand, the counties with the lowest age-standardized spending per capita were Clark County, Idaho ($3,410), Loving County, Texas ($3,923), and Kennedy County, Texas ($4,027) Your browser does not support iframes. If their state expanded Medicaid, these people would qualify for it. Still, they earn too little to qualify for subsidies on the health insurance exchange, leaving them financially responsible for medical care. With lackluster coverage, people are less likely to see doctors, which would explain relatively low out-of-pocket spending per person. In the upper Midwest and Northeast, meanwhile, most people rely on private health insurance to cover most of their health insurance costs. According to University of Washington researchers, these areas had some of the highest rates of per capita healthcare spending. Out-of-pocket spending in those areas was also high, possibly due to high deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance rates. Access to care is typically better in metropolitan or suburban centers, raising spending in those areas. Remote Alaska and sparsely populated areas in the Midwest may have fewer healthcare providers and few health insurance options, which can lead to high out-of-pocket spending . The largest share of healthcare spending by insurers, the government, and individuals was on diabetes, at $143.9 billion. Medicaid spent the least amount of money on healthcare services in Southeastern states that have not passed laws the expand access to benefits to a wider population of low-income residents This was followed by musculoskeletal disorders like joint pain and osteoporosis ($108.6 billion), oral disorders ($93 billion), and ischemic heart disease ($80.7 billion). Of the total spending, 42 percent went to outpatient care, 24 percent to hospital inpatient care, and 14 percent to prescription drugs. Spending by county varied significantly, ranging from $3,410 per person in Clark County, Idaho, to $13,332 per person in Nassau County, New York. The study's findings appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association . The most significant differences across counties were in the amount people paid out-of-pocket and in private insurance spending. The main factor in these differences was how often people used health care, though cost and care intensity also played a role, except for those covered by Medicare.

(Tarun Kumar Sahu/Mint) Summary For tech companies, the healthcare vertical is now the fastest growing business. The US, which spends about $5 trillion on healthcare, is the biggest market and ground zero for an ongoing court battle. We take you behind the Cognizant-Infosys slugfest to show you what is actually going on. Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now New Delhi: At one time, Texas was part of America’s wild west, where a bullet separated the quick and the dead. These days, however, disputes in the largest state in the continental US are settled in court. Aside from that, however, the duels are just as vicious as they were in the 1800s. A recent case epitomizes just how bitter things can get, with the two sides trading various charges, including theft, breach of contract, poaching, and moral turpitude, among other things. These claims and counterclaims may seem like the fevered imaginings of a screenwriter scripting a Hollywood potboiler, but they are very real, and among the accusations IT services companies Cognizant and Infosys have flung against each other in a Texas court. While Infosys is an Indian company, the vast majority of US-based Cognizant’s workforce is in India. It all began last August, when Cognizant subsidiary TriZetto filed a lawsuit against Infosys in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, a federal court, accusing the Bengaluru-headquartered company of theft of trade secrets related to its healthcare insurance software. Cognizant had acquired the company about a decade earlier for $2.7 billion in its largest buyout ever. At the time Infosys was also reportedly eyeing TriZetto. Infosys denied the allegations. Instead, on 9 January, it filed a counterclaim against the Nasdaq-listed Cognizant in the same court. In a rare instance of a company turning against a former executive, it accused Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar , who was the president of Infosys in his previous role, of misusing sensitive information and indulging in anti-competitive practices. Infosys alleged that Kumar had deliberately delayed the rollout of Helix, its product rivalling Cognizant’s healthcare solution, as he was in talks to join the Teaneck, New Jersey-headquartered company. Infosys alleged that Kumar had deliberately delayed the rollout of Helix, its product rivalling Cognizant’s healthcare solution, as he was in talks to join the Teaneck, New Jersey-headquartered company. Aside from Kumar, the Indian company alleged that Cognizant’s anti-competitive scheme also included the targeted recruitment of other key senior executives responsible for Helix, including Shveta Arora and Ravi Kiran Kuchibhotla, incentivizing them to delay the development of the product. Arora, Infosys’ former global consulting head, is now in a similar role at Cognizant. View Full Image Ravi Kumar, CEO of Cognizant. In its submission, Infosys said: “Kumar had championed Infosys Helix from his senior position at Infosys. But Kumar’s optimism and excitement for the Infosys Helix product suddenly changed in Spring 2022. He began to pull back support of Infosys Helix, declining requests for needed resources, which delayed the completion of Infosys Helix by at least 18 months.\" Kumar quit Infosys in October 2022 and took over as its rival’s CEO in January 2023. While the slugfest may appear to be a case of two companies fighting over very specific issues, at its heart is something much bigger: the healthcare sector and all the business that comes with it. “Healthcare has been the fastest growing vertical since the pandemic. It is one of the top priority verticals for most large service providers as they have seen slower growth in their BFSI segment,\" said Chunky Satija, vice president, Everest Group. In particular, the US has become a key battleground for IT services companies jostling for space in the sector—the country spends about 17% of its GDP, or $5 trillion, on healthcare. And the contenders are all vying with each other to land large, transformational deals. Healthcare has been the fastest growing vertical since the pandemic. — Chunky Satija The healthcare sector thus holds a massive opportunity that promises to give the balance sheets of Indian IT companies, long dependent on the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector for business, a shot in the arm. The Cognizant-Infosys court duel should be viewed in this backdrop. Its outcome has the potential to shape the contours of the overall IT services business in the years to come. Why healthcare matters With $29 billion in revenue, Tata Consulting Services (TCS) sits atop the pecking order of the $260 billion IT services sector. Infosys is a distant No. 2, at $18.5 billion. Include the $19.7 billion New Jersey-headquartered Cognizant, and Infosys slips to No. 3. Over the last decade it has managed to narrow the gap with Cognizant, but the two are still separated by a billion dollars or so. Most companies report the healthcare business under the ‘healthcare and life sciences’ vertical. The former refers to hospital management, delivery of health services and insurance, while life sciences includes pharmaceuticals (drugs), as well as biotech and medical devices. For simplicity, in this article, healthcare refers to the entire business vertical. According to research firm Everest Group, the market size for technology services in the healthcare sector was $145-150 billion in FY24, with 54% coming from healthcare and 46% from life sciences. Cognizant is the runaway leader in the healthcare segment, which accounts for a third of its revenue. To put that in context, Cognizant’s healthcare business in 2023-24, was bigger than that of Infosys, TCS, and Wipro combined. In its quarterly numbers shared on 6 February, healthcare emerged as Cognizant’s biggest business for the fifth straight quarter. In fact, much of its growth in 2024 came from the vertical. In contrast, healthcare contributes just around 7% of Infosys’ overall business. For TCS, it accounts for a little over 10% of its $29 billion revenue. For HCL Tech, another top-tier company, healthcare is the third largest business and accounts for around 16% ($2 billion) of its revenue. The company offers solutions to insurance firms, hospitals, pharma companies and medical device companies. “We are also developing GenAI-driven IT support to enhance service quality and customer experience,\" said Shrikanth Shetty, chief growth officer, Americas, Life Sciences and Healthcare industries, HCLTech. Queries sent to Cognizant and Infosys remain unanswered. All the Indian companies are now looking to increase the size of the healthcare slice in their overall pie. Mid-tier and smaller IT firms are also looking to get in on the action. Persistent Systems doubled its revenue from around $500 million to over $1.1 billion on the back of health services. “We work with major scientific instruments and diagnostics companies to help scientists research diseases and develop new therapies faster,\" said Ganesh Nathella, senior vice president and general manager, Healthcare and Life Sciences Business, Persistent Systems. However, he declined to share client names. Even Coforge, formerly NIIT Technologies, is eyeing future growth from this service line. Early mover But the Indian companies will struggle to catch up with Cognizant, which had made the most of a headstart it got in the business. Cognizant had been set up in 1994 as the in-house technology unit of business intelligence firm Dun & Bradstreet. In 1996 it was spun off as a separate entity along with IMS International, a large provider of healthcare information services in the US. While Indian IT services players focused more on BFSI, Cognizant built on its early start and later bought out TriZetto in 2015 to strengthen its healthcare portfolio. Since that buyout a decade ago, Cognizant has doubled its healthcare business from $3 billion to $6 billion. In between, it bought out at least half a dozen healthcare companies, including Bolder Healthcare Solutions, a provider of revenue cycle management solutions to hospitals, in 2019, and TMG Health, a business process solutions provider, in 2017. Interestingly, Wipro bought a health plan and payer management company, Infocrossing, for $600 million in 2007, but it could not scale up its healthcare practice significantly. Infosys, meanwhile, has been building its Helix platform to make deeper inroads into the segment. The world’s biggest market Most of the healthcare business for IT services companies comes from the US market. “The US is by far the largest market for healthcare. Unlike Europe and even Japan, where healthcare is publicly funded, in the US, it is provided by the private sector,\" explained Satija. “Privatization creates more competition and leads to more IT spending to create competitive differentiation.\" The Affordable Care Act (ACA), informally called Obamacare, which came into force in 2014, is also leading to higher spending on digital services. The law calls for healthcare delivery systems reforms that will reduce administrative costs and improve quality by using more technology. US President Donald Trump, who tried to kill the law in his previous term, has called for an overhaul of the ACA but is yet to spell out details.

(Bloomberg) “IT services companies have built critical scale to build upon the healthcare vertical. And it’s fairly attractive now for three reasons: the business is recession-proof—irrespective of what happens, people fall sick. Second, the US, which is the largest market, spends 17% of its GDP on healthcare. And third, it’s a highly inefficient sector,\" said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner, Catalincs and former CMD of Cognizant India. For every $1 spent on healthcare, up to 40 cents are spent managing care or administrative costs. Hospital chains, pharma companies, medical devices manufacturers and insurance firms are looking at technology to reduce this overhead. Globally, IT services companies have become critical partners in the sector today as more technology is being used across the value chain. Moreover, digital wearables, implantables, telemedicine, and remote monitoring systems are technology enabled, increasing the role of software engineers in improving patient care. According to Ramamoorthy, the top 25 health insurance providers (in the US and beyond), pharma companies, biotech and medical devices companies all work with third-party IT services companies in India. These include AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Roche, Johnson & Johnson, GSK, Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, Anthem, Amgen, Siemens, Medtronic and Thermo Fisher. Many of them have their own captive centres. In September 2024, Pfizer set up a captive unit in Mumbai for healthcare-related analytics tasks. According to a recent Nasscom-Zinnov report, 38 pharmaceutical Global Capability Centres (GCCs) have been set up in India and employ around 80,000 people. These include centres set up by Bayer, AstraZeneca and United Healthcare. Shortening time-to-market Even drug development and new vaccine development depend on technology to improve outcomes and reduce time-to-market as was seen during the pandemic, when healthcare and technology collaborated closely. The turning point came with the demand for faster covid vaccine rollouts, customized treatment options, and a scramble for immunity-boosting and other healthcare products. For example, American biotech company Moderna’s covid vaccine , developed using the mRNA approach, was largely a technology-driven effort. Every phase, from R&D, drug discovery, clinical trials, manufacturing and even commercial operations used technology. View Full Image Moderna’s covid vaccine, developed using the mRNA approach, was largely a technology-driven effort. “From vaccine discovery to sales and marketing, it all happened in 12-24 months. At every stage of the value chain they deployed nextgen tech,\" said Ramamoorthy. “This was an important turning point as traditionally, it used to take 10 years to develop a drug and five years to commercialize it. Now, using technology, pharma companies are reimagining the entire process.\" While the sector has witnessed a lot of structural shifts, there may be a limit on how much business Indian companies can attract immediately, particularly because of long-standing relationships between healthcare and technology companies. For example, the IBM-Pfizer relationship is over three decades old. Pfizer has also been working with Oracle for many years. Similarly, AstraZeneca has had sourcing pacts with IBM and Oracle for decades. For Cognizant, healthcare has become bigger than BFSI. But for the others, while healthcare will become bigger, it is unlikely to eclipse BFSI. “Largely, what Indian IT services firms are winning is basically healthcare and life sciences outsourcing deals from tier two companies,\" said Gaurav Vasu, CEO of UnearthInsight, a Bengaluru-based market intelligence firm. While the business is recession-proof and offers growth opportunities, it is also very sticky. “Historically, Indian IT services firms have had limited success in healthcare as deal cycles and partnerships do not change very often. The other challenge is that Indian companies lack strong platforms or products in this space. But there is a window of opportunity with AI-led disruptions in healthcare, as well,\" Vasu added. For Cognizant, healthcare has become bigger than BFSI. But for the others, while healthcare will become bigger, it is unlikely to eclipse BFSI. “Technology spending in BFSI is more than twice that of healthcare. BFSI maturity is also much higher among Indian providers than in any other vertical,\" said Ramamoorthy. “In the long run, however, healthcare could potentially become the second-largest vertical or even get neck-to-neck with BFSI.\" Gift this article Catch all the Industry News , Banking News and Updates on Live Mint.

    "article_text": "T-Magazine Next Story Healing on life support With too few doctors, crumbling hospitals & soaring costs, healthcare remains a privilege for millions of Pakistanis By Nabil Tahir | Design by: Ibrahim yahya facebook twitter whatsup linkded email PUBLISHED February 16, 2025 KARACHI: In a small village in rural Pakistan, a young mother named Shahida* lies on a charpoy, her body wracked with pain as she clutches her swollen abdomen. She has been suffering from severe stomach cramps for days, but with no healthcare facilities nearby, she has been forced to rely on the advice of unqualified traditional healers. Her husband, a daily wage laborer, has taken a day off from work to take her to the nearest hospital, but they know it will be a long and arduous journey, with no guarantee of quality care at the end of it. Shahida’s story is not unique. Millions of Pakistanis, particularly women and children, suffer from preventable illnesses and injuries due to lack of access to quality healthcare. In urban areas, the situation is not much better. In Karachi's Lyari neighborhood, for example, residents are forced to navigate narrow alleys and crowded streets to reach the nearest hospital, which is often understaffed and underfunded. The air is thick with pollution, and the smell of garbage and sewage hangs heavy over the streets. It is a bleak and unforgiving environment, where the struggle to survive is a daily reality. Pakistan, a country of over 220 million people, is facing a healthcare crisis of epic proportions. Despite being the fifth most populous country in the world, Pakistan's healthcare system is woefully inadequate, with millions of people struggling to access even the most basic medical care. The statistics are staggering, Pakistan has one of the lowest healthcare expenditures in the world, with only 2.9 per cent of its GDP allocated to healthcare. This translates to a per capita health spending mare Rs8,526, which is equivalent to $48.05, compared to the global average of $1,064. This is also lower than the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recommended level of $86 per capita. The result is a healthcare system that is underfunded, understaffed, and ill-equipped to meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. The consequences of this crisis are far-reaching and devastating. Every year, thousands of Pakistanis die from preventable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhea. Maternal and child mortality rates are among the highest in the world, with over 170 mothers dying for every 100,000 live births, and over 69 children dying before their fifth birthday. The lack of access to healthcare is exacerbated by poverty, inequality, and social injustice, with the poor and marginalised bearing the brunt of the crisis. In rural areas, where healthcare facilities are scarce and often non-existent, people are forced to rely on unqualified traditional healers or travel long distances to access medical care. Despite these challenges, there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. The government of Pakistan has launched several initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access, including the Universal Health Coverage Act 2024, which promises to provide health insurance to all citizens. Meanwhile, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are working tirelessly to provide quality healthcare services to those who need them most. Here is a different Pakistan, one where healthcare is not a privilege reserved for the wealthy, but a fundamental human right available to all. Struggling to keep pace Pakistan's healthcare system is in a state of crisis. With a population of over 220 million people, the country's healthcare infrastructure is woefully inadequate, leaving millions of people struggling to access even the most basic medical care. According to National Health Accounts Pakistan 2021-22, total health expenditure was Rs. 1,962 billion, marking a 34 per cent increase from 2019-20. Per capita health spending was PKR8,526 (US$ 48.05). Expenditure allocation was 47 per cent by the general government, including federal, provincial, and district entities, whereas 52.6 per cent through the private sector, with 89 per cent out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures, while 0.4 per cent contributions from development partners and donors. In terms of infrastructure, the country has a total of 1,233 hospitals, including 721 public and 512 private hospitals making only 1.2 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared to the global average of 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 people. According to World Health Organisation, the country also has a severe shortage of healthcare professionals, with only 0.8 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the global average of 1.5 doctors per 1,000 people, and 0.4 nurse per 1,000 people. The statistics only tell part of the story. Behind every number, there is a person, a family, a community struggling to access quality healthcare. Take the story of Farhat*, a 45-year-old woman who works at a garment factory in Karachi. Farhat's husband, a former electrician, has been suffering from a debilitating lung disease that has left him unable to work. Despite her best efforts, Farhat has been unable to get her husband the treatment he needs. \"I was a whole housewife back then, and my husband fainted at his work,\" Farhat recalls. \"I received a call that my husband fainted, and they're taking him to the public hospital in Karachi. I urgently went there and saw my husband lying on the stretcher without being treated. They wanted someone to take responsibility first and then start the treatment.\" Farhat took responsibility for her husband's treatment and began the paperwork. However, even at the public hospital, she had to purchase some medication from outside. \"Despite being a public hospital, I had to get some things from the pharmacy outside the hospital,\" she says. \"I didn't have much money, so I had to borrow from my relatives.\" After four hours of waiting, the doctors finally diagnosed Farhat's husband with a lung disease. However, the treatment was not straightforward. \"They told me that the lungs of my husband are no more functioning, and they had to be treated,\" Farhat explains. \"They said they have to put him on a ventilator and then give him medications to get his lungs functioning a little.\" Farhat's husband was admitted to the hospital for a four before being discharged due to the unavailability of the beds and that there were more severe patients than her husband. However, the treatment was not complete, and Farhat was left to care for her husband on her own. \"They gave me some instruments and medications, but they were not enough,\" she says. \"They were only for three days, after that, I had to buy them from the pharmacy, which cost me around PKR 10,000 per month. It was not possible for me to bear.\" With no other option, Farhat was forced to find work to support her family. She took a job at a garment factory, working 12 hours a day to earn a meager salary. \"I worked there for 12 hours, and when I came back home, I didn't have much energy left to look after my husband,\" she says. \"But I had to, as the hospitals were full, and they didn't have space to treat my husband.\" Farhat's children, a 21-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old son, also work at the factory to support the family. \"I realised that I was earning only PKR 20,000 per month, which was not enough to run my family,\" Farhat explains. \"So, I had to put my daughter and son in the same factory so we can earn enough to take care of my husband and run things at my home.\" Farhat's story is a voice of millions of Pakistanis who are unable to access quality healthcare. Despite her best efforts, she has been unable to get her husband the treatment he needs, and her family has been forced to sacrifice their well-being to make ends meet. \"I feel like I'm losing him,\" she says, her voice cracking with emotion. \"I just want him to get better, but I don't know how to make that happen.\" \"If the government facilities were good enough, and they had treated him fully before discharging him, I wouldn't have to face this much struggle in my life,\" says Farhat. The human cost of Pakistan's healthcare crisis is devastating. Families are torn apart by illness and death, communities are ravaged by disease, and individuals are left to suffer in silence. It is a cost that is being borne by millions of Pakistanis every day, and one that can no longer be ignored. Government initiatives The government of Pakistan has taken steps to address the country's healthcare challenges. One notable initiative is the Universal Health Coverage Act 2024, which aims to provide health insurance to all citizens. Although details of the act are scarce, it is expected to increase access to healthcare, particularly for low-income families. The government's vision for universal health coverage is ambitious, and if successful, it could significantly improve healthcare outcomes for millions of Pakistanis. To achieve this goal, the government has launched several healthcare programs. Mobile health clinics, for example, provide basic healthcare services to rural and underserved areas. Staffed by trained healthcare professionals, these clinics offer services such as vaccinations, check-ups, and referrals to specialised care. Immunisation initiatives are another key area of focus, with the government launching several programs to combat vaccine-preventable diseases. The Lady Health Worker Programme is another notable initiative, employing over 90,000 community health workers who provide basic health services to marginalised communities. Another notable initiative of the Government of Pakistan is the Prime Minister's National Health Program, which provides health insurance to low-income families, aiming to increase access to healthcare for the most vulnerable populations. Another crucial program is the Sehat Sahulat Program (SSP), launched in 2015 by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government and later expanded to other provinces by the federal government in 2019. The SSP provides free healthcare services to poor families, with the goal of protecting citizens from financial hardship due to unexpected medical expenses. The program offers health insurance cards to eligible families, allowing them to receive healthcare services at partnered hospitals and clinics, with coverage of up to one million rupees annually. The SSP has made significant progress, covering over 44.6 million households across 36 districts in Punjab, 35 districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other provinces. The program has also helped reduce financial hardship for marginalised populations, including disabled individuals and transgender individuals registered with the National Database Regulatory Authority (NADRA). These programs demonstrate the government's commitment to strengthening primary healthcare and health financing reforms. By prioritising universal health coverage, primary healthcare strengthening, and health financing reforms, the government aims to create a more equitable and effective healthcare system. The success of these programs will depend on sustained funding, effective implementation, and a commitment to addressing the systemic challenges that have long plagued Pakistan's healthcare system. Plugging the gaps pro bono Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) play a vital role in Pakistan's healthcare system, filling gaps in services and providing critical support to marginalised communities. While some NGOs operate on a large scale, others work at the local level, making a significant impact in their respective areas. Some notable NGOs in Pakistan's healthcare system include, Edhi Foundation, which was Founded by Abdul Sattar Edhi, provides a range of services including emergency medical care, orphanages, and food banks. The foundation has, rescued over 20,000 abandoned children, provided shelter to over 50,000 orphans, offered free medical care to over 1 million patients. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital founded by Imran Khan, is another state-of-the-art cancer hospital that provides free treatment to thousands of patients every year. The hospital has, treated over 200,000 cancer patients, provided free treatment to over 75 per cent of its patients, achieved a survival rate of over 80 per cent for certain types of cancer. Other notable NGOs include; LRBT (Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust), providing free eye care services to the poor, treated over 50 million patients, Indus Hospital, a free hospital in Karachi that provides quality medical care to the poor, and has treated over 1 million patients, then there is SIUT (Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation), a renowned NGO that provides free medical care to patients with urological and nephrological disorders. Founded by Dr. Adibul Hasan Rizvi in 1975, SIUT has treated over 1.5 million patients, established a state-of-the-art hospital with modern facilities and equipment, and trained thousands of healthcare professionals in urology and nephrology. While these large NGOs are making a significant impact, other NGOs like the Latif Kapadia Memorial Welfare Trust (LKMWT) are also working tirelessly to provide better healthcare to local communities. Founded in 2007, LKMWT is a non-profit organisation that aims to provide quality healthcare services to the underprivileged. The trust operates a hospital in Karachi, which provides a range of services including emergency care, surgery, and diagnostic testing. Over the years, LKMWT has treated over 1.5 million patients, with a monthly average of over 2,500 patients. In 2022, LKMWT expanded its operations to Surjani Town, increasing its reach and impact in Karachi. More recently, in 2024, LKMWT launched its \"Wellness for All\" campaign, offering free medical check-ups and promoting health awareness among marginalised communities. In addition to its clinical services, LKMWT has also organised several health awareness campaigns, focusing on critical areas such as maternal health, vaccination, and diabetes. The trust has conducted workshops and seminars to educate women about prenatal care, childbirth, and postnatal health. It has also collaborated with government agencies and international organisations to promote vaccination drives and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, LKMWT has launched awareness campaigns to educate people about diabetes prevention, management, and treatment options. These initiatives have been supported by key participants and notable guests, including healthcare professionals, government officials, and community leaders. For Ahmed Kapadia, Founder and Chairman of LKMWT, the trust's work is a labor of love. \"I am proud to have bought my father's dream to life,\" he says. \"Latif Kapadia was a man who cared deeply about the welfare of others, and I am honored to be carrying on his legacy through LKMWT. Our mission is to provide quality healthcare services to those who need it most, and we will continue to work tirelessly to achieve this goal.\" The journey to improve Pakistan's healthcare system is ongoing, with both the government and NGOs working tirelessly to address the challenges. While significant progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. To further healthcare in Pakistan, it is essential to prioritise sustainable funding, strengthen primary healthcare, and promote health-financing reforms. By doing so, Pakistan can create a more equitable and effective healthcare system, where quality medical care is accessible to all, regardless of income or social status. Ultimately, the future of healthcare in Pakistan depends on the collective efforts of the government, NGOs, and individuals to ensure that every citizen has access to quality healthcare, dignity, and a chance to thrive. *The names in this story have been changed at the request of the individuals featured"

    "article_text": "Guest opinion: The high costs of single-payer health care By Ryan Smith - | Feb 15, 2025 Recently, Wendell Potter, a former health insurance executive who left the industry in 2008 and now advocates for a government-run health care system, made waves in Utah media . Since departing from the industry, Mr. Potter has been a “Johnny One-Note,” insisting that the government should take over and that consumers should be deprived of the benefits of competition and choice in their health care decisions. Potter is not alone. Dr. Joe Jarvis has also been a vocal proponent of universal health care in Utah. He is leading efforts to introduce a ballot initiative aimed at establishing a single-payer health care system within the state. Common Sense Health Care for Utah also advocates for a comprehensive single-payer health care plan. Their mission is to extend coverage to every Utahn, ensuring equitable access to medical services and reducing the financial burdens associated with health care costs. While their talking points may sound good on paper, their recommendation of socializing health care will only worsen the health care affordability crisis that Utahans currently face. Utah’s health care affordability crisis is indeed a pressing concern. A 2024 report highlighted that health care spending has increased by nearly 20% in the state, posing significant financial challenges for both employees and small business owners who struggle to keep up with escalating premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The question is not whether Utahns are facing difficulties affording care but rather how best to address these challenges without resorting to a costly, inefficient government takeover of the health care system. Every country, including the United States, has problems with its health care system. While our system can be expensive, we don’t suffer from the maladies common in the rest of the world — waitlists, poor care, limited technological advancement and high prices. Mr. Potter’s critique of private insurers misses a fundamental reality — competition and market dynamics drive innovation and efficiency. While the U.S. health care system is far from perfect, private insurers — when adequately regulated — create incentives for cost control and improved services. In contrast, single-payer systems often operate as monopolies, stifling innovation and leading to care rationing. For example, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom suffers from delays for routine critical procedures. According to a 2023 report by the British Medical Association, over 7.5 million people were on NHS waiting lists, with many waiting months or even years for treatment. Potter’s proposals would import this kind of inefficiency into the United States. Government-run systems are not immune to rising costs, either. Socialized medicine advocates like Mr. Potter often point to administrative expenses in the private sector as a driver of health care costs, yet they fail to account for the significant bureaucratic overhead in public systems. A recent study found that the government-run Canadian system was the most expensive among 30 universal health care countries. Canada had some of the fewest physicians (ranked 28th of 30 countries), hospital beds (ranked 23rd of 29) and diagnostic technology such as MRIs (ranking 25th of 29 countries) and CT scanners (ranking 26th out of 30 countries) compared to other high-income countries with universal health care. Canada also recorded the longest-ever delay for nonemergency care at 27.7 weeks, a 198% increase from the 9.3-week wait experienced in 1993 (the first year national estimates were published). This is hardly a model worth emulating. According to a study by the Mercatus Center, implementing a Medicare-for-All program in the U.S. would cost an estimated $32 trillion over 10 years. This would necessitate substantial tax increases, including on middle-class families. Meanwhile, a single-payer system would eliminate consumers’ ability to choose their insurers and potentially their providers, forcing everyone into a one-size-fits-all plan. Finally, Mr. Potter’s portrayal of single-payer systems as universally equitable ignores the reality of rationed care and inequities within those systems. Wealthier people in countries like Canada and the U.K. often bypass public queues by seeking private care domestically or abroad. This creates a two-tiered system that undermines the egalitarian ideals proponents of single-payer health care claim to uphold. Mr. Potter’s call for a government-run health care system is not the panacea he portrays it to be. While private insurers are not without flaws, their competitive pressures drive innovation, efficiency and quality in ways government-run systems cannot replicate. The path to a better health care system is embracing market-driven reforms that empower consumers, promote innovation and ensure access to high-quality care. Sacrificing choice and competition for the false promises of a single-payer system would be a step backward, not forward. Ryan Smith is the former chairman for the Utah College Republicans.

Article Insights Mintz are most popular: within Law Practice Management and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) Health Care Cases Spur Largest FCA Recoveries Mintz's annual report on False Claims Act case activity analyzes data from DOJ and the firm's Health Care Qui Tam Database, and explores the 2024 record high in FCA case activity, the moderate increase in health care–related activity, and continuing strong recoveries in health care cases. A Letter from the chair In this edition of EnforceMintz, we analyze trends in False Claims Act (FCA) investigations and lawsuits using data recently made available by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in its annual report of FCA statistics and DOJ's discussion of FCA enforcement trends and recoveries that accompanied its annual report. The number of new FCA cases filed in FY 2024 remained high, in large part due to COVID-19 pandemic relief fraud pay-and-chase efforts. While those cases may have been numerous, health care FCA cases largely drove financial recoveries. DOJ recovered over $2.9billion in FY 2024, and health care cases represented about 57% of that amount. Given the upheaval that the federal workforce is currently experiencing, consistent devotion of resources to government investigations is in question, so these could differ for FY 2025. For additional health care enforcement analysis, view our recently released Health Care Enforcement Trends & 2024 Outlook, which reports on qui tam FCA cases, other government enforcement actions, and significant regulatory developments from the past year. Karen Lovitch, Chair, Health Care Enforcement Defense Practice As 2024 Overall New Cases and Investigations Surge to Record Highs, Health Care Cases Continue to Drive Largest False Claims Act Recoveries The post-pandemic increase in False Claims Act (FCA) case activity roared on with a vengeance during the federal fiscal year (FY) ended September 30, 2024. As reported in the annual statistical report published by the Department of Justice (DOJ)FY 2024 saw the highest number of qui tam cases ever filed under the FCA's whistleblower provisions, leading to unprecedented overall FCA activity. While health care case volume grew moderately, the overall increase in reported volume appears again to have resulted primarily from cases alleging fraud and abuse arising from the pandemic-relief Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). These results extend an anomalous recent trend where health care cases no longer constitute a majority of new FCA cases and investigations. However, for settlements and judgments in FY 2024, health care cases continue to account for the vast majority of FCA recoveries, which underscores the higher stakes at play in health care fraud and abuse litigation. Record qui tam case volume led to overall record volume in FY 2024. For the second year in a row, DOJ reported a large spike in total new FCA cases. Even as the number of government cases and investigations slightly declined, 979 new qui tam cases were filed during FY 2024, an annual total that, standing alone, exceeds the total of all new cases and investigations in each year prior to 2023. When added to the still large volume of government-initiated cases and investigations, the net result for FY 2024 was 1,402 new cases, a 15% increase from FY 2023's record 1,218 new cases. As shown here, DOJ-initiated case activity declined about 16% in FY 2024, ending a five-year trend of increased enforcement activity. Even with that decrease, the number of new government cases in FY 2024 remained near historic highs, at a level not seen since the late 1980s. But, as DOJ highlights in its press release on its FY 2024 statistics, the real story is the record number of qui tam filings. Non–health care cases are driving new case volume. That overall case volume continues to be driven by qui tam cases is not a new phenomenon. As we observed nine years ago in our analysis of DOJ's FY 2015 statistics, the immense growth in FCA litigation over the preceding 20 years was almost entirely the result of sky rocketing qui tam case volume. Our analysis found that health care–related cases primarily lead to this growth, which reflects the growing share of the federal budget devoted to health care spending. The historical dominance of health care cases as a function of overall FCA case volume can be seen clearly in the following chart. However, looking closely at the overall trend, it is apparent that health care cases recently ceased to constitute a majority of new FCA cases. The change can be seen most clearly by looking at just the past 10 years of new case activity. As the next chart shows, starting in 2022, non-health care cases supplanted health care–related cases as the largest component of overall FCA enforcement activity. This trend appears to have been driven by aggressive enforcement directed toward fraudulent claims for COVID-19 pandemic relief. According to DOJ's press release, DOJ enforcement efforts in FY 2024 included the pursuit of cases involving improper payments under the COVID-era Paycheck Protection Program. DOJ stated that pandemic-related cases resulted in 250 settlements and judgments, yielding recoveries in excess of $250 million. That large volume of case resolutions tracks the commensurately large volume of new non–health care and defense cases shown in this table. The continuing focus on enforcement efforts directed toward pandemic relief fraud makes it likely that the volume of non-defense and health care case activity could continue to remain high over the next several years before returning to historic levels as the pandemic fully recedes into the past. Health care cases still take precedence, even as they constitute a declining share of overall case volume. Health care's declining share of overall FCA case activity paints a deceptive picture. The stakes are much higher in health care cases, as reflected in the statistics for FCA recoveries. In FY 2024, recoveries in health care cases totaled almost $1.7 billion, compared to defense case recoveries of $93 million and total recoveries in other cases of just under $1.2 billion. This resulted in health care cases accounting for 57% of all recoveries, continuing the trend that has played out over the past 10 years. Even as the number of health care cases and investigations makes up a smaller portion of overall case volume, in each of the past 10 years, health care settlements and judgments have far outstripped recoveries for other types of cases. The preponderance of health care recoveries illustrated in the preceding chart can be further illustrated by looking at total FCA recoveries over the past 10 years. During that time, recoveries for all cases totaled about $33.5 billion. Of that amount, health care cases yielded recoveries of $23.5 billion, which represents 73% of the total. By comparison, over that same period, roughly 54% of new case filings were health care cases. On a per-case basis, the stakes in health care cases are significantly higher than in other cases. This phenomenon again reflects the continuing growth in health care expenditures as a component of total federal spending that we first noted nine years ago. Here, as in many domains, it is dollars, and not raw numbers, that provide the true measure of what is important. By that measure, health care cases continue to be the most important area for FCA enforcement and litigation activity. And, lest there be any doubt about how DOJ views the significance of health care FCA case activity, the first and longest discussion of enforcement activity in the DOJ press release concerns health care fraud. For the foreseeable future, as has been true for the past 30 years, health care cases will continue to be the paramount focus of government and qui tam case activity.

Explore Firm Details Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into health care operations, from administrative functions such as scheduling and billing to clinical decision-making, including diagnosis United States Technology Charles Gass and Hailey Adler Your Author LinkedIn Connections To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Article Insights Foley & Lardner are most popular: within Government, Public Sector, Insurance and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into health care operations, from administrative functions such as scheduling and billing to clinical decision-making, including diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Although AI offers significant benefits, concerns regarding bias, transparency, and accountability have prompted regulatory responses. Colorado's Artificial Intelligence Act (the Act), set to take effect on February 1, 2026, imposes governance and disclosure requirements on entities deploying high-risk AI systems, particularly those involved in consequential decisions affecting health care services and other critical areas. Given the Act's broad applicability, including its potential extraterritorial reach for entities conducting business in Colorado, health care providers must proactively assess their AI utilization and prepare for compliance with forthcoming regulations. Below, we discuss the intent of the Act, what types of AI it applies to, future regulation, potential impact on providers, statutory compliance requirements, and enforcement mechanisms. 1. What Is the Act Trying to Protect Against? The Act primarily seeks to mitigate algorithmic discrimination, defined as AI-driven decision-making that results in unlawful differential treatment or disparate impact on individuals based on certain characteristics, such as race, disability, age, or language proficiency. The Act seeks to prevent AI from reinforcing existing biases or making decisions that unfairly disadvantage particular groups. Examples of Algorithmic Discrimination in Health Care Access to Care Issues: AI-powered phone scheduling systems may fail to recognize certain accents or accurately process non-English speakers, making it more difficult for non-native English speakers to schedule medical appointments. Biased Diagnostic Tools and Treatment Recommendations: Some AI diagnostic tools may recommend different treatments for patients of different ethnicities, not because of medical evidence but due to biases in the training data. For instance, an AI model trained primarily on data from white patients might miss early signs of disease that present differently in Black or Hispanic patients, resulting in inaccurate or less effective treatment recommendations for historically marginalized populations. By targeting these and other AI-driven inequities, the Act aims to ensure automated systems do not reinforce or exacerbate existing disparities in health care access and outcomes. 2. What Types of AI Are Addressed by the Act? The Act applies broadly to businesses using AI to interact with or make decisions about Colorado residents. Although certain high-risk AI systems — those that play a substantial factor in making consequential decisions — are subject to more stringent requirements, the Act imposes obligations on most AI systems used in health care. Key Definitions in the Act \"Artificial Intelligence System \" means any machine-based system that generates outputs — such as decisions, predictions, or recommendations — that can influence real-world environments. \"Consequential Decision\" means a decision that materially affects a consumer's access to or cost of health care, insurance, or other essential services. \"High-Risk AI System\" means any AI tool that makes or substantially influences a consequential decision. \"Substantial Factor\" means a factor that assists in making a consequential decision or is capable of altering the outcome of a consequential decision and is generated by an AI system. \" Developers \" means creators of AI systems. \" Deployers \" means users of high-risk AI systems. 3. How Can Health Care Providers Ensure Compliance? Although the Act sets out broad obligations, specific regulations are still forthcoming. The Colorado Attorney General has been tasked with developing rules to clarify compliance requirements. These regulations may address: Risk management and compliance frameworks for AI systems. Disclosure requirements for AI usage in consumer-facing applications. Guidance on evaluating and mitigating algorithmic discrimination. Health care providers should monitor developments as the regulatory framework evolves to ensure their AI-related practices align with state law. 4. How Could the Act Impact Health Care Operations? The Act will require health care providers to specifically evaluate how they use AI across various operational areas, as the Act applies broadly to any AI system that influences decision-making. Given AI's growing role in patient care, administrative functions, and financial operations, health care organizations should anticipate compliance obligations in multiple domains. Billing and Collections AI-driven billing and claims processing systems should be reviewed for potential biases that could disproportionately target specific patient demographics for debt collection efforts. Deployers should ensure that their AI systems do not inadvertently create financial barriers for specific patient groups. Scheduling and Patient Access AI-powered scheduling assistants must be designed to accommodate patients with disabilities and limited English proficiency to prevent inadvertent discrimination and delayed access to care. Providers must evaluate whether their AI tools prioritize certain patients over others in a way that could be deemed discriminatory. Clinical Decision-Making and Diagnosis AI diagnostic tools must be validated to ensure they do not produce biased outcomes for different demographic groups. Health care organizations using AI-assisted triage tools should establish protocols for reviewing AI-generated recommendations to ensure fairness and accuracy. 5. If You Use AI, With What Do You Need to Comply? The Act establishes different obligations for Developers and Deployers. Health care providers will in most cases be \"Deployers\" of AI systems as opposed to Developers. Health care providers will want to scrutinize contractual relationships with Developers for appropriate risk allocation and information sharing as providers implement AI tools into their operations. Obligations of Developers (AI Vendors) Disclosures to Deployers: Developers must provide transparency about the AI system's training data, known biases, and intended use cases. Risk Mitigation: Developers must document efforts to minimize algorithmic discrimination. Impact Assessments: Developers must evaluate whether the AI system poses risks of discrimination before deploying it. Obligations of Deployers ( e.g. , Health Care Providers) Duty to Avoid Algorithmic Discrimination Deployers of high-risk AI systems must use reasonable care to protect consumers from known or foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination. Risk Management Policy & Program Deployers must implement a risk management policy and program that identifies, documents, and mitigates risks of algorithmic discrimination. The program must be iterative, regularly updated, and aligned with recognized AI risk management frameworks. Requirements vary based on the deployer's size, complexity, AI system scope, and data sensitivity. Impact Assessments (Regular & Event-Triggered Reviews) Timing Requirements: Deployers must conduct impact assessments: Before deploying any high-risk AI system. At least annually for each deployed high-risk AI system. Within 90 days after any intentional and substantial modification to the AI system. Required Content : Each impact assessment must include the AI system's purpose, intended use, and benefits, an analysis of risks of algorithmic discrimination and mitigation measures, a description of data processed (inputs, outputs, and any customization data), performance metrics and system limitations, transparency measures (including consumer disclosures), and details on post-deployment monitoring and safeguards. Special Requirements for Modifications : If an impact assessment is conducted due to a substantial modification, it must also include an explanation of how the AI system's actual use aligned with or deviated from its originally intended purpose. Notifications & Transparency Public Notice : Deployers must publish a statement on their website describing the high-risk AI systems they use and how they manage discrimination risks. Notices to Patients/Employees: Before an AI system makes a consequential decision, individuals must be notified of its use. Post-Decision Explanation: If AI contributes to an adverse decision, deployers must explain its role and allow the individual to appeal or correct inaccurate data. Attorney General Notifications: If AI is found to have caused algorithmic discrimination, deployers must notify the Attorney General within 90 days. Small deployers (those with fewer than 50 employees) who do not train AI models with their own data are exempt from many of these compliance obligations. 6. How is the Act Enforced? Only the Colorado Attorney General has enforcement authority. A rebuttable presumption of compliance exists if Deployers follow recognized AI risk management frameworks. There is no private right of action, meaning consumers cannot sue directly under the Act. Health care providers should take early action to assess their AI usage and implement compliance measures. Final Thoughts: What Health Care Providers Should Do Now The Act represents a significant shift in AI regulation, particularly for health care providers who increasingly rely on AI-driven tools for patient care, administrative functions, and financial operations. Although the Act aims to enhance transparency and mitigate algorithmic discrimination, it also imposes substantial compliance obligations. Health care organizations will have to assess their AI usage, implement risk management protocols, and maintain detailed documentation. Given the evolving regulatory landscape, health care providers should take a proactive approach by auditing existing AI systems, training staff on compliance requirements, and establishing governance frameworks that align with best practices. As rulemaking by the Colorado Attorney General progresses, staying informed about additional regulatory requirements will be critical to ensuring compliance and avoiding enforcement risks. Ultimately, the Act reflects a broader trend toward AI regulation that is likely to extend beyond state borders. Health care organizations that invest in AI governance now will not only mitigate legal risks but also maintain patient trust in an increasingly AI-driven industry. If health care providers plan to integrate AI systems into their operations, conducting a thorough legal analysis is essential to determine whether the Act applies to their specific use cases. This should also include careful review and negotiation of service agreements with AI Developers to ensure that the provider has sufficient information and cooperation from the Developer to comply with the Act and to properly allocate risk between the parties. Compliance is not a one-size-fits-all process. It requires careful evaluation of AI tools, their functions, and their potential to influence consequential decisions. Organizations should work closely with legal counsel to navigate the Act's complexities, implement risk management frameworks, and establish protocols for ongoing compliance. As AI regulations evolve, proactive legal assessment will be crucial to ensuring that health care providers not only meet regulatory requirements but also uphold ethical and equitable AI practices that align with broader industry standards. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Feb 13, 2025, 09:45am EST Share Save Mika Newton is CEO of xCures , using state-of-the-art AI to process all types of medical records, turning data chaos into clinical clarity. getty The U.S. healthcare system faces an unprecedented challenge—and an equally profound opportunity. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \" by 2034, older adults will outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history ,\" placing immense strain on a system already grappling with rising chronic disease rates and a shortage of healthcare providers. As the demand for healthcare services intensifies, so does the urgent need to make healthcare more efficient, effective and sustainable. Healthcare data lies at the heart of this transformation, holding the potential to bridge systemic gaps and drive a smarter, more responsive system. Data Fragmentation: A Barrier To Efficient Care Consider a patient with a complex illness like cancer who sees a new specialist only to spend precious time recounting their medical history from memory. Too often, providers are forced to navigate an outdated landscape of faxes and phone calls just to obtain records. This disjointed, fragmented data environment delays care, increases costs and often results in suboptimal patient outcomes. The widespread issue of data fragmentation—where patient records are scattered across different healthcare systems—impedes the flow of information needed for informed decision making. Many patients have records in multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems that don’t communicate effectively, forcing providers to waste time gathering data rather than focusing on what they do best: caring for patients. According to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), improved interoperability between EHR systems can help clinicians deliver patient-centered care. Comprehensive Data Sharing: A Pathway To Better Care And Lower Costs An integrated data network is no longer a “nice-to-have”—it’s a critical component of modern healthcare. Comprehensive data sharing allows healthcare professionals to access complete, real-time patient information, leading to faster, more accurate decision making. When data is shared across systems, providers have immediate access to essential information, such as physician notes, lab test results and imaging data, which collectively enable a fuller understanding of the patient's needs. The national effort to create a health information exchange through the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) is a pivotal step forward. TEFCA’s vision for seamless information access provides a model for connecting disparate sources of patient data, allowing providers to see the full picture of a patient’s health. This reduces redundancy and waste while paving the way for more personalized and timely treatment. Data-sharing standards, such as the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) , ensure that information is not only accessible but contextually relevant and machine-processable. The aim isn't simply to collect more data but to deliver the right data at the right time for the right purpose. With the healthcare landscape better organized, providers can focus on delivering the best possible care rather than managing administrative tasks. Building A Sustainable Future Through Data Integration Healthcare sustainability hinges on the system’s ability to improve efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining high-quality care. Breaking down barriers to data exchange is a foundational step toward addressing one of the root causes of inefficiency. Enhanced data sharing doesn’t just boost care quality—it also reduces unnecessary tests, treatments and administrative expenses, driving down costs across the board. With the demographic shift, healthcare delivery must adapt. By 2030, one in every five U.S. residents will be of retirement age, placing more pressure on a limited number of healthcare providers. Alternative care models, like telehealth and home-based care, will be essential in meeting this demand. However, these models will only thrive if data flows seamlessly across settings and is readily available whenever and wherever care is needed. Data integration can also significantly impact chronic disease management, which is both a health and economic imperative. According to the CDC , six in 10 U.S. adults have a chronic disease or a mental health condition, a leading driver of the country’s $4.5 trillion in yearly healthcare expenditures. Without intervention, these costs will continue to grow, outpacing inflation and posing a risk to the system's sustainability. A study from Harvard and the London School of Economics emphasizes that our current healthcare spending should be curtailed. A unified data infrastructure could help curb these costs, promoting more proactive and efficient care management. A Call To Action: Advocate For Seamless Data Interoperability The path to a more efficient and sustainable healthcare system requires both advocacy and action. Healthcare professionals must demand seamless interoperability from their EHR systems and push for comprehensive data-sharing capabilities across platforms. If you’re a healthcare provider, now's the time to champion improved data access and sharing within your practice. Ask your EHR vendor about their interoperability features, join forces with other providers to integrate advanced data aggregation tools and support initiatives promoting data standards like FHIR and TEFCA. By working together, healthcare providers, policymakers and technology vendors can create a more connected healthcare system that benefits everyone involved.

Additionally, a mechanism has been put in place to increase Waverly’s shareholding in AHH Singapore over time. The restructuring is categorised as an acquisition of shares and voting rights under Sections 5(a) and 5(b) of the Competition Act, 2002. The involved entities operate in key healthcare segments, including maternal and child healthcare, nephrology, urology, dialysis, and kidney transplants. AHH Singapore, which is jointly managed by TPG and GIC, holds long-term investments in multiple healthcare services across various states and union territories in India. TPG Growth III and V function as investment funds managed by TPG Inc., a NASDAQ-listed private equity firm that specialises in technology, healthcare, consumer, and financial services. Waverly is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GIC Ventures, part of the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund managed by GIC Special Investments Private Limited. Their joint involvement in AHH Singapore strengthens their position in India’s healthcare sector, ensuring long-term strategic investment in specialised hospitals.

    "article_text": "Home Columnists Analysis Ethics-driven AI in predictive healthcare: Building a foundation of trust and accountability Thursday, 13 February 2025 | Gerald Jaideep Share T T T T 0 Ethics-driven AI in predictive healthcare: Building a foundation of trust and accountability Thursday, 13 February 2025 | Gerald Jaideep Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionising predictive healthcare, offering early disease detection, personalised treatment plans and improved patient outcomes In todayâ€™s rapidly advancing healthcare landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a transformative role, particularly in predictive healthcare. AIâ€™s ability to analyse vast datasets enables early disease detection, personalised treatment plans and improved patient outcomes. The global AI in healthcare market, valued at approximately $15.4 billion in 2022, is projected to surge to $187.95 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37 per cent. Yet, with this potential comes a responsibility to ensure that AI is used responsibly, ethically, and equitably. Establishing a framework prioritises privacy, fairness, transparency and accountability is essential to protect patient rights and maintain public trust. The Power of AI in Predictive Healthcare AIâ€™s role in predictive healthcare is primarily driven by machine learning and data analytics, empowering it to forecast diseases, assess risk factors, and recommend preventive measures. By examining patterns in comprehensive datasets, such as medical histories, genetic profiles, lifestyle information and real-time health data, AI can predict the likelihood of conditions ranging from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases to complex ailments like cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s. This shift from reactive to preventive care can ease the burden on healthcare systems and improve patient quality of life. For example, AI-based diagnostics for diabetic retinopathy have shown an accuracy rate of over 87 per cent, enabling early detection and timely intervention. Similarly, IBM Watsonâ€™s Oncology AI has achieved 90 per cent accuracy in cancer treatment recommendations that align with those of human oncologists. However, to harness AIâ€™s potential responsibly, itâ€™s crucial to address the ethical challenges it introduces. Safeguarding Data Privacy and Security The ethical use of AI in healthcare hinges on the responsible management of patient data. Predictive healthcare AI relies heavily on sensitive information, including medical, genetic, and behavioural data. Yet, the need for privacy is ever more pressingâ€”72 per cent of Americans express significant concerns about data privacy in AI applications, particularly in healthcare. In 2022, nearly 50 million healthcare records were exposed to data breaches in the United States, underscoring the need for strong data security protocols. To protect this information, AI systems must prioritise rigorous security measures such as encryption, anonymisation and regular audits. Patients should also provide informed consent, clearly explaining how their data will be used and stored. By centring data protection in AI development, healthcare can ensure patient confidentiality and foster the trust necessary for AIâ€™s continued adoption. Addressing Bias for Fair and Equitable Predictions AIâ€™s reliance on historical data introduces the risk of bias, which can lead to predictions that disproportionately impact certain demographic groups. Research has shown that AI models trained on biased data result in 35 per cent more misdiagnoses for Black and Hispanic patients compared to white patients. In healthcare, such biases could exacerbate disparities for marginalised populations. Ensuring fairness requires AI systems trained on diverse, representative datasets, as well as continuous monitoring and adjustments to detect and correct biases. A study published in Nature Medicine found that AI systems trained on inclusive datasets significantly reduce diagnostic discrepancies, underscoring the importance of inclusivity in training data. Collaboration with healthcare professionals and ethicists is also vital to developing AI solutions that are equitable and serve all patients effectively. Promoting Transparency and Explainability in AI Models The complexity of AI algorithms often results in â€œblack boxâ€ decision-making, where the reasoning behind predictions is not fully understood by users or developers. In predictive healthcare, this lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption among patients and healthcare providers alike. In a survey by the American Medical Association, 67 per cent of healthcare providers expressed reservations about using â€œblack-boxâ€ AI systems, highlighting the need for explainable AI.Currently, only 23 per cent of AI-based diagnostic tools meet explainability standards to ensure transparency. By developing interpretable models, researchers can make AIâ€™s decision-making processes accessible to healthcare providers, enabling them to communicate AI-driven recommendations clearly and fostering patient involvement in care decisions. As AI continues to advance, a strong ethical framework will be essential to uphold public trust and ensure that AI-driven healthcare remains a force for good.

    "article_text": "PORTSMOUTH, N.H. , Feb. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MedWatch, an industry leader for white-glove concierge member advocacy and support services, was recently selected to support a next-generation negotiated rate calculation and pricing solution, providing healthcare stakeholders evidence-based, commercially valid, equitable market rates to providers and patients. MedWatch is supporting TALON, a pioneer in ethical healthcare price transparency, to empower the healthcare market with a fair, transparent price, for the first self-funded employer group deployment. Continue Reading TALON's Universally Acceptable Payment Amount™ (UAPA) Developed internally at TALON, the Universally Acceptable Payment Amount™, or UAPA™, leverages advanced machine learning to ingest and transform massive amounts of healthcare pricing data, curating a single, evidence-based rate that patients and providers can trust. Unlike other contracted rates within healthcare, UAPA eliminates the \"network discount\" concept, and instead reflects actual commercial acceptance. Derived from real, commercial prices spanning over 400+ payers, UAPA lands at an equitable midpoint—not artificially low or high. Providers see a realistic rate they already accept, employers achieve predictable spend, and patients receive fair, ethical, transparent pricing. \"I'm very excited for the future of the healthcare industry as a result of our development and first deployment of UAPA\" commented Mark Galvin , CEO of TALON, \"UAPA will spark a massive transition in the healthcare industry, fostering a more efficient, free market driven financial environment for healthcare patients and providers. Selecting MedWatch to support the first real-world deployment was an easy decision, given their reputation in the industry and their gold standard support and advocacy on behalf of healthcare consumers.\" \"MedWatch delivers lasting value built on compassion, transparency, and a deep understanding of what it truly means to care. TALON's UAPA is perfectly aligned with our organizational values and commitment to patients\" said Sally-Ann Polson , President and CEO at MedWatch. \"When paired with our Pathways Concierge solution, patients leveraging UAPA will benefit from outstanding clinical outcomes, increased trust and loyalty between patient and provider, and meaningful reduction in healthcare spend.\" About MedWatch: MedWatch, a leader in population health and medical management solutions, offers clients the unique ability to deliver a truly thorough approach to concierge member advocacy and medical cost containment solutions.

(Hotel Indonesia Natour/-) T he government has established two special economic zones (SEZs) for tourism and healthcare, namely the Sanur SEZ in Bali and the Batam SEZ in Riau Islands province. Both regions are considered to have potential and advantages in the healthcare and tourism sectors so that they can attract high-value investments and create jobs to accelerate regional and thus national economic development. In addition, both regions are also assessed to be ready to develop the healthcare and tourism sectors to international service standards, making them a reference for both domestic and international communities in accessing healthcare services. Specifically, this is expected to reduce the country's foreign exchange losses caused by the large number of people who have been choosing to seek treatment abroad. As an illustration, Indonesia loses some US$11.5 billion annually as over 1 million citizens seek treatment overseas. Will the development of the Sanur and Batam SEZs for tourism and healthcare be able to change the public’s preference? What challenges and obstacles will be faced in the development of the tourism and healthcare SEZ? What factors will determine the success of the zone? In our opinion, the success of the tourism and healthcare SEZ in changing public preferences to seek medical treatment domestically will greatly depend on the public's perception of the quality of healthcare services within the country. According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, there are several factors that encourage people to seek medical treatment abroad. The public perceives that healthcare facilities abroad offer comprehensive facilities (93.5 percent), services that meet expectations (91.7 percent), fast/accurate/precise services (89.3 percent), comfortable rooms (86.8 percent), communicative staff (84.8 percent), easy and accessible locations (47.9 percent) and affordable prices (35.7 percent). Meanwhile, in the Indonesian Private Hospital Association’s (ARSSI) patient perception survey on hospitals in Indonesia, 70.5 percent of respondents considered the communication of staff, including doctors, at Indonesian hospitals to be poor (lacking empathy). Additionally, 61.4 percent of patients believed the consultation time provided by doctors in Indonesian hospitals was shorter than at hospitals abroad. Furthermore, 49.0 percent of patients assessed the medical equipment in Indonesian hospitals as less advanced, and 30.3 percent of patients considered the diagnoses at these hospitals to be less accurate. We understand that changing public perceptions is not an easy task. In this regard, the tourism and healthcare SEZ must provide a new experience and be able to convince the public that the quality of healthcare facilities offered is on par with those abroad.

    "article_text": "Leadership Leadership Strategies The Healthcare Leadership Revolution: Why Teamship Saves Lives By Keith Ferrazzi , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover the future of work, team effectiveness, and growth strategies. Follow Author Feb 12, 2025, 03:15am EST Share Save Comment The shift from hierarchical leadership to peer-to-peer teams in healthcare can be profound—the difference can be saving a patient's life. getty In an operating room, a surgical technician notices something concerning during a procedure. In traditional hospital hierarchies, they might hesitate to speak up. But a transformation in healthcare leadership is under way that would make that moment of hesitation unthinkable. The old deference to hierarchical leadership is giving way to a new mode of behavior where peers put status, role and ego aside to work together like a team of leaders to elevate each other’s performance and get critical jobs done. And the difference made by this shift from hierarchical leadership to peer-to-peer teams can be profound, as Dr. Laura Dannels, Chief Talent Officer of Wellstar Health System, which runs hospitals, cancer centers, hospices, and hundreds of medical offices across Georgia, explains. \"Research shows that psychological safety and trust are critical. The difference in candor versus conflict avoidance is saving a patient's life.\" The transformation Dannels describes is what I call \"teamship,\" a concept I explore in my new book Never Lead Alone . Teamship is the ultimate competitive advantage, driven by two forces: co-elevation behaviors and modern collaboration practices. Co-elevation is a commitment among teammates to lift each other up while achieving the mission—moving beyond traditional silos to create value through interdependencies and never letting each other fail. When combined with new collaborative processes and tools, this enables bolder innovation and faster decision-making. Our research shows the impact is dramatic. Teams that adopt teamship see a 79% increase in candor, a 46% increase in collaboration, and a 44% increase in accountability. Yet only 15% of teams achieve this standard today. The difference between average and extraordinary teams is not more leadership; it is the adoption of teamship. Making Culture Change a Daily Assignment The shift to teamship is not theoretical; it is achieved through specific high-return practices that turn abstract cultural goals into concrete daily assignments. These practices range from \"Stress Testing\" exercises, where teams collaborate to uncover unseen risks, to \"Sprint Reviews\" which create peer-to-peer accountability. Common factors in all the practices are courageous candor and inclusivity: encouraging all voices to be heard to mitigate risk, fuel innovation and accelerate decision-making. The Healthcare Imperative Healthcare faces unique challenges that make the shift to teamship particularly critical. The stakes are especially high in an industry where, as Dannels notes, \"The staff/leadership ratios on the frontlines of healthcare are enormous.\" MORE FOR YOU The transformation requires what Dannels describes as \"shared leadership:” a model where \"healthcare professionals at all levels are empowered to make decisions within their scope of practice and expertise.\" This approach fosters what she calls \"mutual accountability,\" where \"all team members share responsibility for the outcomes of their decisions and actions.\" Building Resilient Healthcare Teams Most crucially, teamship addresses one of healthcare's most pressing challenges: burnout. \"Healthcare leaders and providers have some of the highest burnout rates,\" says Dannels. The solution lies in what she calls \"community,\" explaining that \"our 'Energy' is impacted by those who are on our 'teams,’ so community is incredibly important in my opinion for any resilience work.\" Breaking Down Silos for Better Care Healthcare organizations that embrace teamship are seeing another crucial benefit: better integrated care. As Dannels explains, \"To provide better healthcare, any given doctor needs broader information in order to make a well-informed diagnosis and provide a solution.\" This integration of perspectives and information is essential for modern healthcare delivery. The Path Forward The transformation to teamship in healthcare requires more than just structural changes, it demands new behaviors, practices, and mindsets. But these changes do not have to be overwhelming. Through simple, targeted practices that any team can adopt, organizations can begin making the shift immediately. As healthcare continues to face unprecedented challenges, the choice becomes clear: continue with traditional hierarchical models that may no longer serve our needs or embrace teamship as the path to better healthcare delivery. The future of healthcare belongs to organizations that never lead alone. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

    "article_text": "(COLORADO SPRINGS) — The VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System celebrated the 100th birthday of retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant Edwin Beck on Friday, Feb. 7. Beck is a World War II and Korean War veteran who lives in Colorado Springs. He served in the Army for 27 years. The VA said during this time he fought during the Battle of the Bulge where he was captured and held for six months. After the end of his military career, Beck continued to serve the veteran community, sharing his time as a prisoner of war and the harsh treatment he endured.

It truly cannot be overstated just how much Master Sergeant Beck means to the veteran community here in the Springs, and we wish him a happy birthday and many more for all he has done for us.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Δ But as providers move away from traditional fee-for-service models toward value-based care, representing a fundamental shift in how care is delivered and reimbursed, this transformation is not about clinical outcomes alone. The back-end systems that power healthcare organizations, from payments to procurement, are quietly undergoing their own revolution as operational and financial workflows evolve in tandem with care models. It’s about time. The latest PYMNTS Intelligence reveals that the healthcare industry’s payment technology is outdated compared to other fields. As of 2024, just over 1 in 2 healthcare executives (54%) believe their organizations’ technology is sufficient. As care models change, these legacy technology stacks are unlikely to be able to adapt as nimbly as digital solutions can to the evolving expectations and operational realities of healthcare stakeholders. After all, the modernization of B2B healthcare transactions is being driven by digital payments, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered procurement systems and automation that reduces administrative complexity. These innovations are streamlining financial operations, helping in optimizing supply chains and allowing providers to focus on patient care rather than paperwork. Read more : Software, Not Spreadsheets, Solves Healthcare’s Cash Flow Bottlenecks The Shift Away From Fee-for-Service Healthcare Models For decades, the fee-for-service (FFS) model dominated U.S. healthcare, with providers being paid for each individual service rendered. While this system ensured steady revenue streams, it also incentivized volume over value, contributing to sector-wide inefficiencies, rising costs and disparities in patient outcomes. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue As the landscape evolves, healthcare organizations are increasingly embracing value-based care (VBC), where payments are tied to quality and efficiency rather than sheer volume. This shift demands new operational models — ones that prioritize interoperability, real-time payments and procurement strategies aligned with outcome-driven care. With care delivery transforming, so too must the mechanisms supporting it. These changes are rippling through the financial and administrative side of healthcare, prompting a reevaluation of how organizations transact with one another. As PYMNTS Intelligence found in a report done jointly with Citi, “ The Impact of Misunderstood Treasurers in Healthcare ,” 44% of healthcare treasurers say their cash flows are predictable. That leaves a majority, at 56%, of treasurers who say that their cash flows are unpredictable. Already, the marketplace is responding. Last week (Feb. 4), healthcare financing firm PayMedix announced it had teamed up with care/benefits platform XO Health to give XO Health’s network of self-insured employers, third-party administrators and value-based providers access to PayMedix’s healthcare financing solution. Traditionally, healthcare payments have been mired in manual processes, paper invoices, and slow reimbursements. However, the rise of digital and automated payment solutions is reducing administrative burdens and improving cash flow management. In an interview with PYMNTS last year, Big Data Healthcare (a wholly owned subsidiary of Fifth Third Bank) President and Co-Founder Dean Puzon said, “Automation can significantly transform the payment reconciliation process in healthcare,” adding that the future of healthcare payments is defined by the benefits of automation, artificial intelligence and data-driven innovations. Read more : Digital Innovation Continues to Shift B2B Healthcare Market Optimizing Healthcare Supply Chains Beyond payments, procurement processes in healthcare are also experiencing a technological overhaul. After all, while hospitals and healthcare providers need a steady supply of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and consumables to operate efficiently, historically, procurement has been fragmented, relying on siloed databases, manual purchase orders and long procurement cycles. AI and data analytics are promising to change that by introducing tools designed to support predictive demand planning and automated procurement workflows. The rise of digital procurement marketplaces is also driving efficiency. Instead of relying on legacy distributor relationships, healthcare organizations can now access cloud-based B2B marketplaces where they can compare prices, review supplier ratings and negotiate contracts more effectively. “When you think about how you can best serve the market, one major thing is honestly just getting the best deals and having the lowest prices,” Jonathan Chen , founder and CEO of Nitra , told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster last year. “Every single day doctors are buying from the major brands like McKesson, Henry Shine, AbbVie, all these folks, and oftentimes they’re doing it manually through a salesperson who comes to their office and sends them an invoice … it gets very jumbled up and the process is obscure, as is the pricing transparency.” Ultimately, the future of healthcare B2B transactions will likely be fueled by technological advancements that can build more resilient, efficient and patient-centric financial ecosystems.

    "article_text": "Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Jessica Dobrinsky, chief of staff at the Cardinal Institute for West Virginia Policy, is sworn in Tuesday for her briefing on the proposed repeal of certificates of need requirements for health care facilities. West Virginia Legislative Photography Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Lawmakers received a preview Tuesday of the fight coming to the 2025 legislative session, which begins Wednesday, over whether to keep, reform or repeal West Virginia’s certificate of need program for health care facilities. The Joint Standing Committee on Health heard from supporters of ending the state’s certificate of need program regulated by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, as well as from representatives of the West Virginia Hospital Association who believe that repeal would hurt rural hospitals and health care providers. States began implementing certificate of need, or CON, programs to help control health care costs and prohibit duplicative or unneeded medical services in communities. The Mountain State’s CON law was put in place by lawmakers in 1977, making West Virginia one of 35 states with such laws. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, only 12 states have fully repealed their CON programs. Justin Cox, executive director of the West Virginia Health Care Authority, told committee members that his agency reviewed 35 applications for CONs in 2024 which were approved, along with 239 exemption requests. Supporters of repealing CON believe ending the program will give residents more options for health care, increase the number of rural hospitals in the state, provide more savings in health care costs and possibly save more lives. “Health care providers wishing to open or expand must prove to an unelected body that their services are needed,” said Jessica Dobrinsky, chief of staff at the Cardinal Institute for West Virginia Policy, a conservative think tank. “The methodology fails to consider meaningful measures of quality and instead examines economic viability. “(CONs) limit access; they increase cost; they fail to improve quality; and they stifle innovation, forcing health care providers to receive approval before opening medically necessary businesses, creating artificial barriers for new health care providers. Health care should be driven by innovation and patients.” Opponents of repeal include the West Virginia Hospital Association, which believes the current CON process ensures that regions of the state have appropriate levels of health care and helps protect rural hospitals from unfair competition. David Goldberg — vice chairman of the West Virginia Hospital Association and president/CEO of Mon Health System and Davis Health System and executive vice president of Vandalia Health — explained that more than 75% of the income hospitals receive comes from reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid and the Public Employees Insurance Agency. Goldberg said eliminating the CON program would cause hospitals around the state to fail due to competition for patients. “Every day, we’re operating to be able to provide for the constituents you represent, and the economics are very tough,” Goldberg said. “The margins are very lean in this environment. From a CON perspective, we’re a very rural state. … There’s reasons why our rural state needs some of those opportunities to keep balance.” Last year, the House of Delegates’ Health and Human Resources Committee recommended for passage House Bill 4909 on a 13-9 vote. HB 4909 would have eliminated CON requirements for all health care services except hospice care services. HB 4909 was never taken up by the full House, remaining in the inactive calendar for the rest of the 2024 session. But conservative free market groups — such as Cardinal, the West Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity and the Pacific Legal Foundation — have been advocating for CON repeal for years and see this year as a prime opportunity to get a bill on the desk of Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who campaigned on repealing CON. Steven Allen Adams can be reached at sadams@newsandsentinel.com . You must be logged in to react. Click any reaction to login.

(mWell) is poised to become a powerhouse in the country’s digital health care ecosystem as it acquires the Ayala Group’s KonsultaMD. mWell, the digital health care arm of Metro Pacific Investments Corp., yesterday said that it has entered into agreements with the Ayala Group to acquire the Ayala-led telehealth provider. No other details of the deal were disclosed by the company, but a representative said that it is a 100 percent acquisition. mWell said the strategic acquisition would strengthen its position as the largest and leading digital healthcare ecosystem in the Philippines by significantly expanding its reach and capabilities. “Progress for any country depends on a healthy citizenry. This agreement represents a giant step forward toward real, immediate and reliable care for our countrymen,” mWell chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan said. KonsultaMD, the flagship health care platform of Globe’s 917Ventures, evolved from a health hotline in 2015 into a superapp that provides comprehensive health services including 24/7 doctor consultations, diagnostics, medicine delivery and homecare. It currently has 2.7 million users and a vast network of partner doctors with deep expertise in mobile-based health care solutions. mWell said the acquisition is highly complementary to its existing business offerings. mWell president Chaye Cabal- Revilla said the signing of the agreement with KonsultaMD is a decisive step to address the challenges in elevating health care in the country. “This purposeful action underscores our commitment to support universal health care in making lasting impacts, particularly in underserved communities throughout the Philippines. By integrating our resources with KonsultaMD, we are well-positioned to provide expansive and high-quality health care to all Filipinos, both locally and globally,” she said. The integration is also set to accelerate the growth and expansion of MPIC’s health business, including Metro Pacific Health. mWell said that KonsultaMD would continue to keep its brand and operate under MPIC/mWell management in the interim, ensuring continued access to key services while enhancing health care delivery. KonsultaMD CEO Beia Latay said that combining the group’s expertise with mWell’s powerful digital health ecosystem is set to bring even greater innovations to telehealth. “KonsultaMD will continue to be the trusted platform our users know and love – now with even more ways to deliver quality, accessible, and seamless health care,” Latay said. As the only health and wellness app with an established digital health ecosystem, mWell brings together consultations and wellness resources both for physical and mind health for its 3.1 million users. Its global reach includes more than 90,000 users from across Asia, South America, Africa, North America, Oceania and Europe. “This acquisition supports our common vision of delivering accessible and inclusive health care solutions to every Filipino,” Ayala Corp. chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala said. “Bringing together the power of mWell’s digital ecosystem and KonsultaMD’s comprehensive services and expansive reach will ultimately benefit Filipino consumers. This synergy will help us more swiftly achieve our shared goal of providing healthcare for all,” Globe president and CEO Ernest Cu said separately. BUSINESS BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

    "article_text": "February 11, 2025 News The state government identified the development of the 4-star hotel as one of the top 15 capital projects of the state for 2025. A review of the Anambra State 2025 approved budget by SaharaReporters has revealed that Governor Chukwuma Soludo’s administration has allocated the sum of N15 billion for the development of a 4-star hotel in Awka, the state capital. This is contained in the Anambra State 2025 Citizens Budget document signed by the state’s Commissioner of Budget and Economic Planning, Mrs. Chiamaka Nnake, and obtained by SaharaReporters. The state government identified the development of the 4-star hotel as one of the top 15 capital projects of the state for 2025. Meanwhile, SaharaReporters’ review of the 2025 Fiscal Appropriation Action of the administration shows that the state government allocated only a total of N195 million to 650 primary health centres, health posts and Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Teaching Hospital, Amaku. According to the approved budget document, each of the 650 primary healthcare centres, health posts and the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu Teaching Hospital, Amaku got N300,000 budgetary allocation only. The N195 million allocated to the 650 primary health centres represents 1.3% of the N15 billion allocated to developing a 4-star hotel. In December 2024, Anambra State celebrated winning the first position in South-East and overall best in Nigeria in the 2nd Edition of the Primary Healthcare Leadership Challenge Awards. The state was awarded a cash prize of $1,200,000 by the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) in collaboration with Aliko Dangote Foundation, the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and UNICEF. A visit to multiple primary healthcare centres and health posts in Awka, the state capital, and over 10 other communities in the state revealed a severe lack of medical supplies, including essential items like drugs, syringes, and gloves. Disturbingly, despite the state government allocating N15 billion for the development of a hotel, many of these primary healthcare centres and health posts are operating out of single-room gatekeeper houses at recreational centres, churches, and residential homes. Many other facilities are operating in dilapidated and wrecked buildings, lacking essential services such as pharmacies, functional toilets, labour wards, and labour equipment, among other necessities.

Article Insights Mintz are most popular: within Law Practice Management and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) Mintz's annual report on False Claims Act case activity analyzes data from DOJ and the firm's Health Care Qui Tam Database, and explores the 2024 record high in FCA case activity, the moderate increase in health care–related activity, and continuing strong recoveries in health care cases. A Letter from the chair In this edition of EnforceMintz, we analyze trends in False Claims Act (FCA) investigations and lawsuits using data recently made available by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in its annual report of FCA statistics and DOJ's discussion of FCA enforcement trends and recoveries that accompanied its annual report. The number of new FCA cases filed in FY 2024 remained high, in large part due to COVID-19 pandemic relief fraud pay-and-chase efforts. While those cases may have been numerous, health care FCA cases largely drove financial recoveries. DOJ recovered over $2.9 billion in FY 2024, and health care cases represented about 57% of that amount. Given the upheaval that the federal workforce is currently experiencing, consistent devotion of resources to government investigations is in question, so these could differ for FY 2025. For additional health care enforcement analysis, view our recently released Health Care Enforcement Trends & 2024 Outlook, which reports on qui tam FCA cases, other government enforcement actions, and significant regulatory developments from the past year. As 2024 Overall New Cases and Investigations Surge to Record Highs, Health Care Cases Continue to Drive Largest False Claims Act Recoveries The post-pandemic increase in False Claims Act (FCA) case activity roared on with a vengeance during the federal fiscal year (FY) ended September 30, 2024. As reported in the annual statistical report published by the Department of Justice (DOJ) FY 2024 saw the highest number of qui tam cases ever filed under the FCA's whistleblower provisions, leading to unprecedented overall FCA activity. While health care case volume grew moderately, the overall increase in reported volume appears again to have resulted primarily from cases alleging fraud and abuse arising from the pandemic-relief Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). These results extend an anomalous recent trend where health care cases no longer constitute a majority of new FCA cases and investigations. However, for settlements and judgments in FY 2024, health care cases continue to account for the vast majority of FCA recoveries, which underscores the higher stakes at play in health care fraud and abuse litigation. Record qui tam case volume led to overall record volume in FY 2024. For the second year in a row, DOJ reported a large spike in total new FCA cases. Even as the number of government cases and investigations slightly declined, 979 new qui tam cases were filed during FY 2024, an annual total that, standing alone, exceeds the total of all new cases and investigations in each year prior to 2023. When added to the still large volume of government-initiated cases and investigations, the net result for FY 2024 was 1,402 new cases, a 15% increase from FY 2023's record 1,218 new cases. Pic As shown here, DOJ-initiated case activity declined about 16% in FY 2024, ending a five-year trend of increased enforcement activity. Even with that decrease, the number of new government cases in FY 2024 remained near historic highs, at a level not seen since the late 1980s. But, as DOJ highlights in its press release on its FY 2024 statistics, the real story is the record number of qui tam filings. Non–health care cases are driving new case volume. That overall case volume continues to be driven by qui tam cases is not a new phenomenon. As we observed nine years ago in our analysis of DOJ's FY 2015 statistics, the immense growth in FCA litigation over the preceding 20 years was almost entirely the result of skyrocketing qui tam case volume. Our analysis found that health care–related cases primarily lead to this growth, which reflects the growing share of the federal budget devoted to health care spending. The historical dominance of health care cases as a function of overall FCA case volume can be seen clearly in the following chart. Pic However, looking closely at the overall trend, it is apparent that health care cases recently ceased to constitute a majority of new FCA cases. The change can be seen most clearly by looking at just the past 10 years of new case activity. As the next chart shows, starting in 2022, non-health care cases supplanted health care–related cases as the largest component of overall FCA enforcement activity. Pic This trend appears to have been driven by aggressive enforcement directed toward fraudulent claims for COVID-19 pandemic relief. According to DOJ's press release, DOJ enforcement efforts in FY 2024 included the pursuit of cases involving improper payments under the COVID-era Paycheck Protection Program. DOJ stated that pandemic-related cases resulted in 250 settlements and judgments, yielding recoveries in excess of $250 million. That large volume of case resolutions tracks the commensurately large volume of new non–health care and defense cases shown in this table. The continuing focus on enforcement efforts directed toward pandemic relief fraud makes it likely that the volume of non-defense and health care case activity could continue to remain high over the next several years before returning to historic levels as the pandemic fully recedes into the past. Health care cases still take precedence, even as they constitute a declining share of overall case volume. Health care's declining share of overall FCA case activity paints a deceptive picture. The stakes are much higher in health care cases, as reflected in the statistics for FCA recoveries. In FY 2024, recoveries in health care cases totaled almost $1.7 billion, compared to defense case recoveries of $93 million and total recoveries in other cases of just under $1.2 billion. This resulted in health care cases accounting for 57% of all recoveries, continuing the trend that has played out over the past 10 years. Even as the number of health care cases and investigations makes up a smaller portion of overall case volume, in each of the past 10 years, health care settlements and judgments have far outstripped recoveries for other types of cases. Pic The preponderance of health care recoveries illustrated in the preceding chart can be further illustrated by looking at total FCA recoveries over the past 10 years. During that time, recoveries for all cases totaled about $33.5 billion. Of that amount, health care cases yielded recoveries of $23.5 billion, which represents 73% of the total. By comparison, over that same period, roughly 54% of new case filings were health care cases. On a per-case basis, the stakes in health care cases are significantly higher than in other cases. This phenomenon again reflects the continuing growth in health care expenditures as a component of total federal spending that we first noted nine years ago. Here, as in many domains, it is dollars, and not raw numbers, that provide the true measure of what is important. By that measure, health care cases continue to be the most important area for FCA enforcement and litigation activity. And, lest there be any doubt about how DOJ views the significance of health care FCA case activity, the first and longest discussion of enforcement activity in the DOJ press release concerns health care fraud. For the foreseeable future, as has been true for the past 30 years, health care cases will continue to be the paramount focus of government and qui tam case activity.

The technology offers solutions to many of the challenges faced by India's healthcare system, especially in terms of dealing with a shortage of healthcare professionals in the most remote corners of the world’s most populous country. To improve accessibility to medical services in rural areas, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is backing the power of AI, focusing on developing broadband connectivity for primary health centers under BharatNet and by providing more than $1 billion in funds for growth of AI-driven digital health services in India’s 2025 union budget. The government is digitalising the healthcare system via the National Digital Health Mission, which aims to create a unified health ID for every citizen, linking their health records and enabling seamless sharing of health data. This initiative is expected to generate vast amounts of structured data, creating a fertile ground for growth of AI applications in healthcare. In addition to the state run schemes, large conglomerates are enabling AI’s expansion in the healthcare sector, and the use of AI in the Indian healthcare market is forecasted to grow at 40.6% to reach $1.6 billion in 2025. Tata Group, through its innovation arm Tata Elxsi , is working on AI-powered medical imaging solutions. In 2024, Google formed an AI partnership with India-based medical device startups Forus Health and AuroLab to scale screening for diabetic retinopathy. One of India's largest digital healthcare startup, Practo, is employing the multilingual ability of AI to power its telemedicine services, which are removing language barriers and enhancing healthcare accessibility considerably. During the pandemic, AI was deployed for predicting outbreaks, but nowadays its usage has spread across the spectrum of different kinds of devices and services. In the realm of diagnosis, AI is processing large volumes of data quickly and accurately in scans like CT, MRI and X-rays, where human eyes might overlook minute anomalies. Bengaluru-based startup Sigtuple has developed a digital pathology platform that can by itself analyse blood samples remotely. Their system is bringing specialist diagnostics to areas without access to specialist care, hematologists. Post-diagnosis, AI is freeing up healthcare professionals to concentrate more on patient experience by automating time-consuming repetitive tasks, follow-ups, patient inquiries, and appointment scheduling. The generative AI systems are also improving in medication adherence rates. Ayush Jain, CEO of healtech provider Mindbowser says, “The pre-configured AI solutions empower healthcare providers to foster trust and build stronger patient-provider relationships and streamline their operations. These advancements simplify healthcare delivery and create a more supportive and connected care journey for patients.” To assist patients in recovery phase, India’s largest hospital chain , Apollo Hospitals, has designed India’s first AI-Precision Oncology Center (POC), which educates patients and family on diagnosis, treatment FAQs and connections to support groups. In addition to playing an intricate role in the latter stages of drug delivery, AI is generating synthetic images to study conditions that have limited real-world data available. The technology is helping researchers to analyse scientific literature, to identify patterns, discover new research topics and generate hypotheses in the formulative stages of drug research. Globally, the use of AI in the medical sector has proved to offer numerous benefits. Machine learning algorithms are assessing biological data, anticipating drug-target interactions, and optimizing chemical structures, resulting in significant savings in terms of time and resources used. “In healthcare more than half of the clinical decisions are still imprecise, so the use of AI and structured data can help make more and better precise decisions,” Michael Sen, CEO of Fresenius, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum last year. However, despite recognizing AI’s advantages, India is still grappling with several roadblocks to accelerate its adoption in the healthcare sector. The ethical and regulatory frameworks for AI in healthcare are still evolving; the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has released guidelines for AI in healthcare, but more comprehensive regulations are needed. The lack of high-quality, structured healthcare data in India poses a significant hurdle for the effective deployment of AI, along with significant data privacy and security concerns. The digital divide in India poses another challenge. While urban areas have seen rapid digital adoption, rural areas still lag behind . Bridging this digital divide and ensuring that AI-powered solutions reach all segments of the population will require significant investments capacity building, specialised training in healthcare AI. Even though India’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence has identified healthcare as one of the key focus areas, according to a survey done by EY, the majority of Indian companies ( 53%) , including those in healthcare, are in the beginners stage of AI implementation, and only a small fraction ( 7%) have advanced to the explorers stage. Realising AI’s full potential in driving transformation of India’s healthcare industry will require a synchronised collaborative effort amongst all stakeholders. The public has to become more familiarized about AI-powered solutions, hospitals must become more willing to leverage products developed by tech companies, and the government must create the necessary regulatory frameworks to develop forward-thinking policies that balance innovations with patient safety. In forthcoming years, establishment of this synergy around AI in the Indian healthcare system could set new benchmarks in terms of quality, develop medical solutions to address its own needs, and it could revolutionize the country into becoming the world’s laboratory, where the future of global innovation for healthcare around the world is being currently crafted.

Medical AI minus side effects AI in healthcare is breaking new ground, but experts caution against pitfalls ahead By K V Kurmanath Updated - February 09, 2025 at 07:57 PM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/pulse/medical-ai-minus-side-effects/article69199855.ece Copy IMMUNISING TECH: AI-led healthcare finds wide usage, but remains vulnerable to cyber threats | Photo Credit: Tippapatt • SpinSci Health Tech India, a US-based digital healthcare solutions company, plans to hire 1,000 skilled AI professionals for its development centre in Hyderabad. • Ciana Health, a healthcare startup, launched a face-reading app based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can provide your key health parameters within seconds. • Vigocare and Monitra, two Hyderabad-based healthcare startups, launched adhesive patches that monitor cardiac vitals and share them with doctors in real time. • A senior endocrinologist works on a ‘digital twin’ for diabetics to help maintain sugar levels. His study, published in Nature , has generated interest in the medical community. • Jivi ai, a year-old large language model, has developed a chatbot that can help both doctors and patients streamline consultations and other medical services. AI in healthcare is no longer science fiction, or a pipe dream. It has arrived. There are AI-led healthcare solutions across specialities and devices. But it’s a pathway to be tread with caution, as unscrupulous elements also sharpen their AI skills. AI helps in understanding and managing chronic conditions like diabetes, for example, explains Dr Ravi Sankar Erukulapati, a senior endocrinologist at Apollo Hospitals. His ‘digital twin’ project for diabetics showed significant improvements in those participating in the study. The ‘digital twin’ AI model combines data from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), activity trackers, and a food logging app to predict individual blood sugar responses to food and activity. It provides personalised recommendations for diet, exercise, and stress management techniques like deep breathing. Nearly 60.3 per cent (1,117) of the participants achieved the recommended HbA1c level — below 7 per cent — without medication. Stumbling block Alongside the benefits of AI deployment in healthcare, challenges emerge too. A key stumbling block to innovation in healthcare, say industry insiders, is the scarcity of data needed to understand disease patterns and health conditions to train machines. Given the unorganised nature of the healthcare sector, startups face an uphill task in building products and solutions, they say. Seeing the torrent of new ideas from startups, the Telangana government has decided to give startups hospital access to build proof-of-concept for their ideas. “Getting data is a difficult task for healthcare startups. So, we have decided to give them access to specific health verticals that they want to work on,” says Jayesh Ranjan, Telangana’s Special Chief Secretary (IT and Industries). These measures, however, come with certain concerns, including privacy, since healthcare data and infrastructure is sensitive. Cyber targets According to a Check Point Software Technologies report, the Indian healthcare sector is experiencing an alarming rise in cyber threats, with 8,614 attacks per organisation per week. The rapid shift to electronic health records, telemedicine, and AI-driven diagnostics has expanded attack surfaces, yet many institutions remain underprepared. Aaron Bugal, Field Chief Technology Officer (Asia-Pacific and Japan) of cybersecurity solutions company Sophos, says there’s an immediate risk to many healthcare organisations as cybercriminals increasingly target them, and with success. “Although Gen AI is helping write better phishing lures without spelling mistakes and poor grammar, major security incidents within healthcare are typical of poorly configured and maintained systems. The lack of multi-factor authentication and sporadic patching of operating systems and applications are prime examples of how cybercriminals get in — no Gen AI required!” he says. “This isn’t attributed to the rise of generative AI — rather, cybercriminals are still on the fence over whether Gen AI will help or hinder them,” he adds. Sundar Balasubramanian, Managing Director for India and South Asia at Check Point Software Technologies, says AI is crucial in enhancing cyber security in the healthcare sector. “One of the most concerning threats is AI-powered ransomware, which automates large-scale attacks, bypasses traditional defences, and encrypts hospital networks within minutes. Beyond system paralysis, cybercriminals steal and monetise sensitive patient data, often using it for extortion,” he says. To mitigate these evolving threats and safeguard medical infrastructure and patient trust, he advises healthcare institutions to move beyond traditional cybersecurity models towards a multi-layered, AI-powered defence strategy, backed by regulatory compliance and continuous security training.

    "article_text": "The use of telehealth for abortion care has continued to grow in the U.S., according to the latest #WeCount report, particularly since five states passed laws legally shielding providers who work with patients living in states with bans. (Warodom Changyencham/Getty Images) Private equity has initiated a wave of acquisitions, transforming hospitals, clinics and nursing homes into profit-driven entities. (Photo by Warodom Changyencham/Getty Images) The struggle for control over our health care system has reached a critical turning point in Oregon, with the influx of private equity firms and other investor-driven entities into the market. Though Oregon has long had a doctrine protecting the patient-doctor relationship, private capital’s intervention in medical decisions now compromises this doctrine. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But this session, lawmakers will again consider legislation that aims to restore a balance and safeguard the core values of Oregon’s health care system, prioritizing patient care over corporate greed. The legislation, Senate Bill 951 , stems from a trend that has occurred over the past decade. Private equity has initiated a wave of acquisitions, transforming hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes into profit-driven entities. While private equity firms promise innovation and efficiency, the reality is much bleaker. Leveraged buyouts burden health care facilities with overwhelming debt, and the consolidation of smaller practices into impersonal conglomerates managed by out-of-state interests diminishes patient care. These strategies are designed to extract profits rather than enhance care. Patients face escalating costs without corresponding improvements in quality, and studies have associated private equity-backed facilities with poorer outcomes, including higher mortality rates. Oregon has experienced these effects firsthand. Once a state renowned for its independent providers and community-focused care, it now struggles with the growing influence of private equity. Management service organizations, which provide business services to medical practices, have become the tools of outside corporations to bypass state laws that prohibit corporate control of medical practices. Under the guise of administrative support, MSOs exert control over staffing, billing, and treatment protocols. The outcome is a healthcare system where MBAs, not physicians, make the decisions, and patient care becomes secondary. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The consequences are glaring across Oregon. In cities like Portland and Eugene, long-standing relationships have deteriorated as private equity-backed entities prioritize high-margin services and decrease time spent with patients to maximize profits. Rural areas face even steeper challenges. Consolidation forces patients to travel long distances for care, disproportionately impacting low-income and underserved populations. This transformation is not merely inconvenient; it endangers the foundational promise of health care to deliver timely, accessible, and compassionate care to all who seek it. The situation for health care workers is equally alarming. Physicians find their clinical decisions overridden by corporate directives focused on profits. Nurses and support staff are pushed to their limits, working in environments plagued by understaffing and relentless cost-cutting. Burnout and turnover rates soar, further destabilizing a system already under significant strain. Transparency is among the most critical issues at stake. Many patients remain unaware that private equity firms control their health care providers, making decisions about pricing, staffing, and care behind closed doors. This lack of transparency undermines trust—a fundamental aspect of effective healthcare delivery—and leaves communities in the dark about the forces shaping their care. One legislative proposal directly addresses these urgent issues. It redefines the control between professional medical entities and management service organizations, ensuring licensed medical providers maintain authority over clinical decisions. It also closes loopholes that permit dual compensation models, where physicians are beholden to these service organizations, ultimately undermining their independence. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The legislation also significantly restricts noncompete and nondisclosure agreements, which inhibit transparency and accountability. Violations of these provisions would be regarded as unlawful trade practices, and strong enforcement measures would be enacted to hold violators accountable. This legislation is not just about a regulatory adjustment: it amounts to a moral stance against the commodification of health care. The bill affirms that health care is meant for patients, not investors. It would ensure that Oregon’s health care system remains grounded in care, trust, and community values, safeguard providers’ independence while protecting patients from predatory practices, and enhance the integrity of our health care system. Oregonians now face a choice: We can allow private equity to continue dismantling the values that make our healthcare system unique or demand transparency, accountability and policies prioritizing people over profits. Enacting legislation to strengthen the prohibition against corporate interference in medicine would reaffirm our commitment to a health care system that serves everyone — not just investors — and preserve the trust and care that characterize Oregon’s approach to medicine.

In addition, the bill extends the acute hospital-at-home program through March 31, 2025. The hospital-at-home program originally launched in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency and allows beneficiaries to receive acute-level care from the comfort of homes when deemed medically appropriate. New State-Level Developments State Activity New Jersey New Jersey passed A3853 , which \"[e]xtends certain pay parity regarding telemedicine and telehealth until July 1, 2026.\" Until July 1, 2026, New Jersey health benefits plans must reimburse telemedicine and telehealth services at the same rate as in-person services, except in the following scenarios: (1) Health care provided by a telehealth organization that does not provide the health care service on an in-person basis in New Jersey; (2) A physical health care service provided through live, two-way audio without a video component; and, (3) A behavioral health service provided through real-time, two-way audio without a video component. New York New York passed A06799 , which establishes a drug-induced movement disorder screening education program; to support this program, the bill requires the New York State Department of Health to develop and disseminate educational materials for health care providers that include information on treating drug-induced movement disorders via telehealth services. This provision ensures that health care professionals are equipped with knowledge on how to manage these disorders remotely, potentially improving access to care for patients who may have difficulty attending in-person appointments. Ohio Ohio passed Senate Bill 95 , which updates pharmacy laws to regulate remote dispensing pharmacies and telepharmacy systems. Specifically regarding telehealth, the bill permits pharmacists to provide telehealth services under section 4743.09 of the Revised Code but prohibits using telehealth mechanisms to dispense dangerous drugs unless explicitly authorized by newly-enacted Section 4729.554 or state pharmacy board rules. It also defines \"remote dispensing pharmacy\" and \"telepharmacy system,\" setting operational standards to ensure safety and accessibility, particularly for underserved areas. Washington, DC The District of Columbia passed C.B. 25-0287, authorizing the Mayor to enter the District into the Licensed Professional Counselors Compact , which will enable professional counselors licensed and residing in DC to practice in other compact member states without obtaining multiple licenses if and when DC officially joins the Compact. Note: As of the time of publication, the compact privileges to practice are not yet available. The Compact Commission anticipates the application process will be available in 2025. Telehealth Payment Parity: State-by-State Tracker \"Payment parity\" requires payors to reimburse for telehealth at the same rate as the equivalent in-person service. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly ten states had implemented payment parity for telehealth (i.e., video visits). Many states implemented temporary payment parity following the onset of the pandemic; since then, several states passed laws implementing payment parity either permanently or with caveats (e.g., on a temporary basis, limited to specific specialties). Payment parity policies are typically codified in state laws, statutes, or regulations that outline coverage and reimbursement requirements for payors. The Manatt Telehealth Policy Tracking team has analyzed the relevant payment parity policies in each state to develop the map and table below; these are updated on a quarterly basis. The map below indicates states that have implemented payment parity permanently or with caveats; the table includes supporting language from each state's relevant law, statute, or regulation. Map of States With Laws Requiring Payment Parity (as of January 3, 2025) As of January 2025, 22 states have implemented payment parity, seven states have payment parity in place with caveats, and 21 states have no payment parity requirement. State-by-State Payment Parity Requirements Table The table below includes state law, statute, or regulatory telehealth reimbursement requirements relevant to insurers (Commercial, Medicaid, Others), and indicates whether each state requires payors to reimburse providers for the delivery of telehealth services at parity with in-person care. State Payment Parity: Does state law, statute, or regulatory requirements require that insurers (Commercial, Medicaid, Others) reimburse for services delivered via video visit at the same rate as those delivered in-person? Alabama No. No relevant policy or statue reference found. Alaska No, mental health coverage parity only. \"A health care insurer that offers, issues for delivery, or renews in the state a health care insurance plan in the group or individual market [THAT PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS] shall provide coverage for [MENTAL HEALTH] benefits provide through telehealth by a health care provider licensed in this state and may not require that prior in-person contact occur between a health care provider and a payment before payment is made for covered services.\" – AK Statute, Sec. 21.42.422 (HB 29 – 2020 Session).

    "article_text": "BERLIN, Vt. (WCAX) - Friday marked the last day of some mental health beds at the Central Vermont Medical Center. It comes as the state is already working with limited mental health care resources. Health care regulators ordered the University of Vermont Health Network to scale back what they can offer patients. CVMC says they were forced to make these cuts. The decisions are once again raising the question of how Vermont can manage the high price of health care. “I think my gut reaction is one of sadness for our community,” said Karen Kurrle of Washington County Mental Health. In an effort to save money in the health care system, the UVM Health Network closed down several services, including a dozen inpatient mental health beds at CVMC. Mental health experts worry a vacuum of services may leave people in crisis without a place to go. “People will have to wait longer for care who need hospital-level care. They will have to go farther away geographically from their homes, their families, their treatment teams,” Kurrle said. The closures sparked by rising health care costs are a large driver of school budgets and property taxes this year. Costs also driven by an aging demographic using more frequent and more expensive health care in a hospital setting which costs more than in the communities. “We have an insurer that is close to insolvency. We have federally qualified health centers potentially closing,” said Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction. Lawmakers say they plan on making sure dollars are going where they’re intended, and that legislation is paying off. “The fragility of our health care system is top of mind for many people, especially us at the agency,” said Brendan Krause, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform. Krause says they are working with hospitals to cut costs and find efficiencies in administrative costs. “It’s important to have a statewide lens and move strategically, but we need to move now,” Krause said. But lawmakers say Gov. Phil Scott needs to lead the charge to come up with an action plan to help bring down the cost for Vermonters and help rural hospitals in danger of financial collapse. “We also have an immediate crisis and we need leadership,” Houghton said. Scott tells us he and his team have to choose their priorities and are focusing on education property taxes and housing, which are also a driver of health care costs. Back in Washington County, experts say CVMC’s mental health closure leaves a big gap in the community. They say they are beginning talks with the Department of Mental Health to stand up a smaller mental health urgent care, similar to one that opened recently in Burlington. Other service cuts are on the way, like inpatient beds in Burlington and primary care in Waitsfield. UVM tells me they won’t fully close until this summer so they can work with patients and providers to find alternative care. Copyright 2025 WCAX. All rights reserved."

Alberta’s government is committed to refocusing the health care system to ensure all Albertans get the care they need when and where they need it. Since it was announced in November 2023 that work would commence to refocus the health care system, significant progress has been made to achieve this goal. Recovery Alberta became fully operational last September. On Feb. 1, Primary Care Alberta will become fully operational and Acute Care Alberta will be established as a legal entity. Seniors, Community and Social Services announced its plans to establish Assisted Living Alberta, the new provincial health agency that will oversee continuing care in the province, on Jan. 30. This agency, the fourth and final provincial health agency to be established, is expected to be operational this fall. While there has been progress made, the efforts to refocus the health care system are at a critical point, and Alberta’s government needs to remain responsive to the health system and the needs of Albertans who continue to access the care they need every day. Effective Jan. 31, interim president and CEO Andre Tremblay will take on an official administrator role in place of the board of directors to oversee all remaining activities to transition AHS to its role as a service delivery provider. He will also retain his position as deputy minister of the Ministry of Health. “We are at a critical time in our efforts to refocus the health care system to better deliver health care to Albertans across the province, and this decision will allow us to be responsive to the health care needs of Albertans. I want to thank the board for its time, effort and dedication to providing governance over the initial steps to refocus the health care system.” “Alberta Health Services will continue to play an important part in the delivery of health care to Albertans across the province. As we continue to advance this important work, I look forward to working with the leadership team and staff across the organization as AHS transitions to a service delivery provider.” As official administrator, Tremblay will oversee the successful completion of the system refocusing initiative at AHS while also ensuring the agency’s seamless transition to an acute care service provider and hospital operator. The official administrator will also assume the regular roles and responsibilities of the board of directors, ensuring Albertans continue to receive high-quality health care across the province. The Ministry of Health will be taking over responsibility for the search of a new permanent president and CEO of Alberta Health Services.

Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major MASH market share @ Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Market Report Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Overview Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease that stems from metabolic dysfunction, often linked to obesity, diabetes, and other conditions of metabolic syndrome. MASH is characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells, accompanied by inflammation and liver cell injury, which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even liver cancer. The primary drivers of MASH include insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Genetic predisposition and a sedentary lifestyle also play significant roles. Environmental factors, such as a poor diet high in sugars and fats, exacerbate the condition. MASH is often asymptomatic in its early stages. When symptoms occur, they can include fatigue, vague abdominal discomfort, or pain in the upper right quadrant. In advanced stages, signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, swelling of the abdomen or legs, and confusion may arise. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Blood tests measuring liver enzymes (ALT, AST) often indicate liver inflammation. Imaging techniques like ultrasound, MRI, or FibroScan can identify liver fat and fibrosis. In some cases, a liver biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Epidemiology Segmentation The MASH epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current MASH patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders. The MASH market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020–2034 in the 7MM segmented into: Prevalent Cases of MASH Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of MASH Gender-specific Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of MASH Severity-specific Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of MASH Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Treatment Market The approval of REZDIFFRA (resmetirom) in March 2024 represents a pivotal achievement in medical innovation, transforming the treatment landscape for MASH disease. This groundbreaking therapy addresses the root causes of MASH, offering renewed hope to patients grappling with this challenging condition. Clinical trials have shown impressive results, with REZDIFFRA effectively reducing symptoms like inflammation and fibrosis, enhancing liver function, and improving patients' quality of life. By providing healthcare professionals with a robust treatment option, this approval addresses a critical unmet need and has the potential to significantly alleviate the complications linked to advanced liver disease. The prevalence of MASLD is strongly linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, particularly in individuals with a higher body mass index. However, MASLD occurrence is reduced in T2DM patients receiving treatments such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and insulin. Vitamin E, with its antioxidant properties, is regarded as a first-line pharmacological option for managing MASH, especially when dietary and lifestyle interventions are insufficient. Antifibrotic agents can help prevent the progression of liver fibrosis and MASLD into fibrotic MASH. The role of pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic medication, in improving MASH histology in T2DM patients is well-documented, but concerns remain regarding potential side effects like weight gain, fluid retention, cancer risk, and bone fractures. Additional therapeutic targets for MASLD and MASH include G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and KLFs. Bariatric surgery, or weight loss surgery, is the most effective intervention for treating obesity and diabetes, as it reduces food absorption while influencing gut hormone secretion and metabolic function.

Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of the MASH market in the 7MM. However, several factors may impede the growth of the MASH market. Lack of awareness and negligence in the early stages of MASH by physicians often lead to disease progression, culminating in irreversible damage where liver transplantation becomes the only viable option. Diagnosing advanced MASH typically requires procedures like liver biopsy, which are costly, invasive, and risky . Regulatory challenges also pose hurdles, as the FDA mandates achieving one MASH endpoint for approval, while the EMA's draft guidance requires efficacy in both endpoints, potentially delaying first-mover approvals in major European markets. Additionally, access to expensive MASH treatments may be limited in certain regions, further hindering patient adoption. Moreover, MASH treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients' overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, MASH market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies , unaffordable pricing , market access and reimbursement issues , and a shortage of healthcare specialists .

Generate Key Takeaways Jan. 30—OLYMPIA — The Washington Health Trust, a statewide initiative for universal health care, is supporting proposals introduced in both the Senate and House (House Bill 1445 and Senate Bill 5233), according to a statement from the group. The two bills are also backed by the Health Care is a Human Right Coalition and aims to establish a comprehensive healthcare model for all Washington residents. \"An ACT Relating to the expansion and consolidation of public health plans in Washington under a unified financing system in order to universalize eligibility to all Washington residents, ensure comprehensive medical coverage including primary care, dental, vision, and prescription drug benefits, and achieve cost savings through administrative efficiency, bulk pricing and cost controls,\" read both HB 1445 and SB 5233. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Carried since 2019 by Senator Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, the bill was introduced for the first time in the House this week by Rep. Lisa Parshley, D-Olympia, a freshman lawmaker who previously served on the Olympia City Council. Assistant Ranking Minority Member of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee Republican Michelle Caldier said she doesn't understand why the bill is proposed when the Legislature doesn't even provide health care coverage to the employees within the state capitol building. \"I will tell you the ironic thing about (the bill) is Washington State in the Legislature, we don't even pay for health care coverage for our own employees,\" Caldier said. \"So, all the temporary staff here in the Legislature that we hire every session, we don't provide them health care coverage.\" Caldier said she instead would like to focus on House Bill 1354, which establishes insurance coverage for public employees during Legislative sessions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The universal health care proposals entered the current session, securing a record 11 cosponsors in the Senate — up from a previous high of seven in 2021. Key supporters in the Senate include Deputy Majority Leader Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, and members of the Health & Long-Term Care Committee. Parshley, now serving as a prime sponsor in the House, is positioned as a crucial advocate due to her seat on the Health & Wellness Committee, according to the statement. She shares sponsorship with Representative Shaun Scott from the 43rd Legislative District. The bill debuted in the House, garnering 17 cosponsors. \"The 2025 session is off to an incredible start for Whole Washington and The Washington Health Trust,\" said Andre Stackhouse, executive director of Whole Washington in the statement. \"We have never felt that we had so many allies in our legislature. With such a strong coalition in both the House and Senate, we believe that our push for universal healthcare is now being taken seriously in Olympia.\" Both the House and Senate bills have been referred to their respective health care committees. The committee chairs will determine whether the proposals will move forward for hearings, setting the stage for the potential implementation of universal health care in Washington State.

United States New York Food, Drugs, Healthcare, Life Sciences Adam Herbst Your Author LinkedIn Connections To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Article Insights Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton are most popular: within Compliance topic(s) In January 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed legislation within her FY 2026 Executive Budget that could significantly reshape healthcare transactions in the state. This legislation introduces a \"Cost Market Impact Review\" (CMIR) process for material transactions involving healthcare entities, aiming to assess their effects on cost, quality, access, health equity, and competition. While the proposal has sparked conversations across the healthcare and private equity sectors, it offers a pivotal opportunity for strategic planning and collaboration if approached with foresight. At its core, the CMIR process signals a broader regulatory shift prioritizing transparency and accountability in healthcare transactions. Under the proposed legislation, healthcare entities contemplating material transactions would face an extended pre-closing notice period, new annual reporting obligations, and the potential for lengthy delays due to comprehensive reviews by the New York Department of Health (DOH). For stakeholders, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity to align transactions with the state's goals of improving healthcare outcomes and equity while ensuring compliance. Understanding the Proposal's Scope and Ambiguities The legislation's potential impact hinges on several undefined terms, such as what constitutes a \"healthcare entity,\" \"material transaction,\" and \"de minimis exception.\" Currently, healthcare entities broadly include physician practices, health systems, insurers, and management services organizations, among others. The law would apply to transactions that increase a healthcare entity's gross in-state revenues by $25 million or more. However, how \"in-state revenues\" are calculated remains ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation. The proposed legislation also empowers the DOH to require extensive documentation during its preliminary review and potential CMIR. While these measures aim to protect patients and communities by fostering competition and health equity, they may add layers of complexity and delay to transactions, particularly for private equity sponsors and healthcare systems accustomed to more streamlined processes. Strategic Planning Amid Heightened Scrutiny Private equity firms, hospital systems, and other stakeholders must adopt proactive strategies to address these regulatory changes. Given the increased focus on healthcare transaction transparency, due diligence will need to evolve. It will no longer suffice to simply evaluate the financial viability and operational synergies of a deal. Instead, stakeholders must incorporate a detailed assessment of a transaction's impact on access, quality, and equity, as perceived by regulators. This requires tailoring transaction structures to align with New York's healthcare priorities. For instance, parties might emphasize commitments to underserved communities, bolster access to primary care, or invest in workforce development as part of their transaction narratives. Doing so not only mitigates regulatory risk but also positions the transaction as a partnership with the state in achieving shared healthcare goals. Implications for Private Equity and Healthcare Systems For private equity firms, the proposed legislation underscores the importance of long-term planning in healthcare investments. Firms will need to engage legal and regulatory experts early to navigate the complexities of compliance. Moreover, these firms should be prepared to articulate how their transactions contribute to innovation and sustainability in healthcare delivery. Healthcare systems, on the other hand, may face challenges balancing transaction timelines with regulatory compliance. However, this moment also presents an opportunity for hospital systems to demonstrate leadership in addressing cost and quality challenges. By proactively engaging with state regulators, healthcare systems can set a collaborative tone, shaping CMIR outcomes in their favor. Opportunities Amid Challenges While the CMIR process may lengthen transaction timelines and require more robust documentation, it also opens the door for stakeholders to differentiate themselves. Transactions that clearly address New York's objectives—whether by improving access to care, addressing social determinants of health, or enhancing health equity—will likely stand out in the regulatory process. Furthermore, the proposal encourages healthcare entities to think beyond traditional metrics of success. Transactions that integrate advanced data analytics, innovative care models, or population health initiatives may not only meet regulatory requirements but also unlock new avenues for growth and patient impact. Looking Ahead The proposed legislation reflects a growing trend across the U.S., where states are increasingly scrutinizing healthcare transactions to ensure alignment with public policy goals. Massachusetts and Indiana have introduced similar requirements, and other states may follow suit. As such, the New York proposal serves as both a cautionary tale and a roadmap for stakeholders navigating this evolving landscape. For private equity firms, hospital systems, and other healthcare stakeholders, now is the time to adapt. This means not only preparing for regulatory compliance but also embracing a more collaborative approach to transactions. By aligning with state priorities, stakeholders can turn regulatory challenges into opportunities to drive meaningful, sustainable change in healthcare delivery. The road ahead requires careful navigation, but the potential rewards—improved healthcare outcomes, stronger partnerships with regulators, and enhanced community impact—make the journey worthwhile.

The clinic spent years arguing B.C.’s Medicare Protection Act was unconstitutionally preventing care Darryl Greer · The Canadian Press · Posted: Jan 29, 2025 1:43 PM EST | Last Updated: January 29 Play Listen to this article Estimated 3 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Dr. Brian Day, a self-described champion of privatized health care, is pictured at his office in Vancouver on Aug. 31, 2016. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) Social Sharing A private medical clinic that launched an unsuccessful constitutional challenge of Canada's public health-care system must pay the B.C. government's legal costs, after what a judge calls a \"gruelling marathon\" of a case. Cambie Surgeries Corp. — owned by private health-care advocate Dr. Brian Day — launched a lawsuit back in 2009. It claimed B.C.'s Medicare Protection Act was unconstitutionally preventing people from getting private health care when the public system was unable to provide it. The B.C. Supreme Court, the B.C. Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada all shot down the private surgery clinic's case, but the issue of trial costs was left in the air. WATCH | Dr. Brian Day says the patients are left suffering: Dr. Brian Day discusses Supreme Court's dismissal of his case April 11, 2023 | Duration 1:14 Vancouver surgeon says it is a bad day for health care and a \"worse day for justice.\" B.C. Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Lynn Whately ruled Monday that Cambie Surgeries should pay the attorney general of British Columbia's trial costs, calling the long-running litigation \"prodigiously lengthy and complex.\" In Depth B.C. can't privatize its way out of long surgical waits, Supreme Court says. What now? Supreme Court dismisses B.C. doctor's appeal in challenge over access to private health care The ruling says the lawsuit by Cambie Surgeries was being funded by the Canadian Constitution Foundation. The ruling doesn't specify the province's costs, but the foundation said last year the B.C. government was seeking $1.7 million from the charitable foundation and \"its partners.\" Dr. Brian Day, medical director of the Cambie Surgery Centre, sits for a photograph at his office in Vancouver on on Aug. 31, 2016. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press) The court ruling says the government argued that Cambie Surgeries was a \"well-resourced\" party that had a financial stake in the outcome of the case, rather than a public-interest litigant going to bat for patients let down by the public health-care system. It says the B.C. government claimed the private clinic was making \"tens of millions\" in profit by violating the public health-care protection law. Doctor's appeal over right to pay for private health care dismissed by B.C. court Should patients be able to pay for private health care to avoid wait times? B.C. Appeal Court set to weigh in The judge found that Cambie Surgeries' financial interest in winning the case \"likely preclude them from being considered true public interest litigants.\" Whately found that the case \"involved matters of great importance to all British Columbians, not only in a legal sense, but in terms of the practical, day-to-day impact on access to health care, the funding of health-care services, and the principles that uphold our public health-care system.\" The private clinic said the case involved \"novel\" legal issues and assessing the \"government's constitutional obligations to provide public health care within a reasonable time, and the 'practical consequences' that must be associated to the failure to do so.\" Private Vancouver clinic loses constitutional challenge of public health-care rules Epic court battle over private health care rages in B.C. courts Both sides tried to blame one another for the case dragging on, with the attorney general of B.C. citing \"egregious\" conduct around document disclosure, experts and witnesses while pursuing a meritless claim under the Charter. Cambie Surgeries and the other plaintiffs, on the other hand, said the B.C. government had its \"own 'massive' shortcomings in document disclosure and production, and that it derailed the litigation process. The case eventually went to trial in 2016 and spanned four years before the B.C. Supreme Court ruled against Cambie Surgeries. That decision was upheld by the B.C. Court of Appeal, before the Supreme Court of Canada denied leave for a further appeal. Neither the attorney general's office nor clinic owner Day immediately responded to a request for comment on the ruling.

Budget 2025 healthcare sector expectations Budget 2025 expectations : Ahead to the Union Budget 2025 , industry stakeholders are expecting reforms that will propel the healthcare sector. The industry want increased government support to address critical challenges in the sector. From boosting healthcare expenditure to expanding public health initiatives, the industry has put forth several demands. Aman Puri, Founder of Steadfast Nutrition, urged the government to increase healthcare spending to 2.5-3 per cent of GDP, aligning with global averages. India's healthcare expenditure has stagnated at 1.5-2.1 per cent of GDP in recent years, resulting in inadequate infrastructure and poor health outcomes. Puri emphasized the need to strengthen primary and secondary healthcare systems, particularly in rural areas and tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which house a significant portion of the population. He also called for greater investment in preventive healthcare, which currently receives only 14 per cent of government funds. Dr. Smeet Patel, Director of Mayflower Women's Hospital in Ahmedabad, emphasized the need for reduced taxation on health insurance, especially as premiums tend to be higher for women due to their specific healthcare needs. He advocated for expanding initiatives to combat cervical cancer, pointing out that the HPV vaccine can reduce the incidence of the disease by nearly 90 per cent, particularly if administered at a younger age. He added \"We also anticipate the Indian Government to launch more public awareness campaigns and improve access to resources for patients affected by these conditions\". Suresh Garg, Founder of Zeon LifeSciences, highlighted the need for tax uniformity in the healthcare sector, along with provisions for research, innovation, and export incentives. With the Indian nutraceutical market expected to grow significantly, these measures can enhance global competitiveness and drive sector growth. He said \"Our expectations from the government are to prioritize policies that not only unlock the immense potential of the healthcare industry but also ensure long-term sustainability, inclusivity, and global recognition\". Anshul Khurana, Co-founder of Entitled Solutions, stressed the need for targeted healthcare policies for urban low-income households that often fall outside existing welfare schemes. \"Incentivizing standard health coverage plans, and expanding the Ayushman Bharat program to include these households could ensure better access to essential healthcare\" he added. Overall, the healthcare industry hopes the government will address these pressing concerns in the upcoming Budget to ensure a healthier, more equitable, and globally competitive healthcare system.

    "article_text": "Transformative advances in healthcare by the UAE Government and private sector set to redefine industry standards. Credit: Jacob Wackerhausen In a groundbreaking move, the UAE is set to redefine the healthcare landscape, blending cutting-edge technology with medical innovation. A series of high-impact initiatives, fueled by the collaboration between government entities and private healthcare providers, are ushering in a new era for healthcare in the region. These initiatives focus on harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and smart healthcare solutions to improve patient outcomes, streamline medical services, and enhance overall efficiency. One of the key components driving this healthcare revolution is the UAE’s commitment to AI and machine learning. By integrating AI tools into the healthcare sector, the country aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, personalize treatment plans, and even predict health trends. These AI-powered systems are poised to assist medical professionals by analyzing large datasets to spot patterns, enabling faster decision-making and reducing human error. Generative AI is one such technology making waves in healthcare. Veneeth Purushotaman, Group CIO at Aster DM Healthcare explained to CIO Middle East that “Gen AI is one of those sets of tools and solutions that come together to deliver significant outcomes, particularly in enhancing the patient experience. The most obvious difference in healthcare is that anything technology does to enhance patient experience or touch a patient’s life is far more impactful than in other industries. This is why technology like GenAI has four times the value in healthcare compared to other sectors. It’s about saving lives, improving recovery, and making lives better, which makes it truly special.” The UAE is also heavily investing in robotic technologies, which are set to transform surgical procedures and patient care. Robotic surgery, for instance, offers precise, minimally invasive operations that reduce recovery times and improve patient outcomes. Hospitals across the UAE are adopting these technologies to increase operational efficiency, providing patients with advanced treatments while reducing the strain on healthcare staff. The rise of telemedicine and digital health platforms is another key development that is making healthcare more accessible. These platforms allow patients to consult with specialists remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits and helping individuals living in remote or underserved areas access timely healthcare services. Additionally, the UAE’s focus on data sharing and digital health records is improving coordination between healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive continuous, high-quality care. This healthcare transformation is not solely reliant on technology but is also complemented by a comprehensive, government-backed regulatory framework. The UAE government has prioritized reforms in the healthcare sector, including investments in medical infrastructure, ensuring that the latest technologies can be implemented smoothly. A robust legal and regulatory framework ensures that patient data privacy and security remain at the forefront of these digital innovations. The partnership between the public and private sectors has enabled the UAE to emerge as a regional leader in healthcare transformation. With initiatives such as the Dubai Health Strategy 2021 and the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Strategy, the country is firmly positioned to lead the Middle East in healthcare innovation. These strategies emphasize the importance of sustainability, technological integration, and patient-centric care, creating a foundation for long-term health improvements. The UAE’s investment in healthcare technology is also expected to position the country as a hub for medical tourism, attracting patients from across the globe seeking access to the latest treatments and technologies. The development of world-class healthcare infrastructure, coupled with cutting-edge technology, will continue to make the UAE an attractive destination for medical care. As the healthcare sector in the UAE moves towards a more digitally integrated future, it presents a model of transformation for other nations to emulate. With the fusion of innovation, technology, and expert collaboration, the UAE is leading the way in healthcare evolution, ensuring a healthier future for generations to come.

    "article_text": "President Trump's DOGE has a chance to lower the costs of the US health-care system. AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein At long last, President Trump is poised to slash government spending and aggressive regulations — and advance his first-term health-spending policies that were obstructed by Congress or overturned by the Biden administration . That’s a big reason why Trump created the now-famous Department of Government Efficiency . The goal: identify and weed out inefficient and counterproductive government spending. Reform could not come soon enough. Health-care costs, in particular, are ballooning the federal deficit and hindering economic growth. DOGE won’t make much progress without lowering the rampant costs of the US health-care system, because an astounding 48% of federal expenditures are devoted to health-care outlays. And it’s going to get worse: Federal health spending is projected to surge from 2023’s $2.2 trillion to $3.8 trillion in 2032, making up a staggering 20% of the nation’s GDP. Yet much of this spending is avoidable. Some experts estimate that 30% or more of it amounts to waste, overcharging and in some cases fraud. This stunts economic growth and destroys incentives for health-care competition and high-quality, low-cost care. The huge discrepancies in charged costs for medical procedures, consultations and treatments, combined with convoluted insurance claims and invoices, leave patients confused and unable to make well-informed health-care decisions. Additionally, lack of price transparency allows hospitals and health-care providers to institute massive markups on medical services — on average, up to 7 times the actual cost of care. These concerns can be mitigated through fostering a culture of transparency, efficiency and competition in the health-care sphere. To do this, the new administration must emphasize disclosure of actual health-care prices — a basic prerequisite for any competitive marketplace that will inevitably put downward pressure on costs and eliminate inefficiency. Increased transparency in health-care prices, bills and claims would reduce federal spending by nearly $1 trillion a year, according to some estimates. It’s a staggering amount, but it’s in line with multiple peer-reviewed studies that have found massive amounts of “administrative waste, errors, overcharging, and fraud” in the system. Because health-care price transparency would incentivize accountability, efficiency and competition among hospitals and care providers, that $1 trillion in reckless overspending could be saved and injected back into the economy each year.

Check out more newsletters That would bring our costs down to near what the Europeans spend — without reducing health access, as we’d experience in a Europe-style socialized medicine system. At a higher level, price transparency will bolster free enterprise in the United States, redirecting spending away from the bloated medical-industrial complex, cutting out inflationary middlemen and increasing innovation and competition. This philosophy of transparency as a lever to push lower prices and higher-quality care is one that Trump prioritized during his first term. In addition to signing executive orders on health-care price transparency and improved quality and efficiency of care, Trump laid the groundwork via congressional and agency policies, including the 2019 Hospital Price Transparency Rule. Unfortunately, the Biden administration repealed many of Trump’s regulations, including the requirement that hospitals publish all actual prices — and refused to enforce the transparency rules. But now, with a united Congress behind him and DOGE committed to bringing more efficiency to our government, Trump has the rare opportunity to restore and advance his first-term transparency policies. Now he can take action to encourage health-care establishments to both decrease prices and increase quality through healthy competition and consumer choice. We hope, too, that Trump will make consumers more health-cost-conscious by expanding health savings accounts and high-deductible insurance policies so that patients have an incentive to shop around and find the lowest-cost alternatives. Trump’s mission must include putting American patients first and draining extraneous costs from the health care complex. Demanding price transparency is an essential step in reforming the American health-care behemoth, stimulating the economy and cultivating an efficient, responsible government.

Cody’s articles from Mintz are most popular: with readers working within the Banking & Credit and Securities & Investment industries Mintz are most popular: within Law Practice Management and Coronavirus (COVID-19) topic(s) On January 13, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta (the California AG) issued two Legal Advisories regarding the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI). The first Legal Advisory provides guidance to consumers and entities developing, selling, and using AI describing their rights and obligations under California law. The second Legal Advisory, entitled Application of Existing California Law to Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare (the Health Care Legal Advisory), is expressly directed at health care providers, insurers, vendors, investors, and other health care entities who develop, sell, and use AI and other automated decision-making tools. In the accompanying press release , the California AG notes that: AI might be changing, innovating, and evolving quickly, but the fifth largest economy in the world is not the wild west; existing California laws apply to both the development and use of AI. Companies, including healthcare entities, are responsible for complying with new and existing California laws and must take full accountability for their actions, decisions, and products. The California AG's Concerns with AI in Health Care The California AG has previously expressed concerns regarding the increased utilization of AI and algorithmic tools and the potential violation of California law. In August 2022, the California AG sent letters to 30 California hospitals requesting information regarding how the hospitals identify and address racial and ethnic disparities that may exist in their commercial decision-making tools. (See California AG press release here ). The California AG raised the issue that such algorithmic tools, which often leverage AI, might have discriminatory impacts based on race and ethnicity. The recent Legal Advisories highlight the California AG's ongoing concerns. On the one hand, the Health Care Legal Advisory notes the potential benefits of AI-enabled tools including improving both patient and population health, reducing administrative burdens, increasing health equity, and facilitating appropriate information sharing. On the other hand, the risks of AI in health care include potential denials of necessary care, misallocation of health care resources, discrimination, and interference with patient autonomy and privacy. Compliance with Existing Laws The Health Care Legal Advisory discusses compliance with existing California consumer protection, unfair competition, civil rights, and patient privacy laws. First, the Health Care Legal Advisory outlines the broad scope of California's Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200) which protects consumers against false advertising, marketing, and anticompetitive practices among other legal protections. Second, the Health Care Legal Advisory highlights California's anti-discrimination law applicable broadly to individuals and entities receiving \"state support\" (Cal. Gov. Code § 11135). In this context, the California AG warns that while AI and other automated decision-making tools may be facially neutral, health care entities may not ignore or avoid data indicating racial, gender, or other protected classification inequities. Third, the California AG notes that in some cases California medical privacy laws are more protective than federal law. As such, California health care entities may have a heightened obligation to preserve the confidentiality of medical information, ensure patient access to their medical information, and obtain robust patient informed consents. Further, the Health Care Legal Advisory posits that California health care providers consider whether disclosure of the utilization of AI and other automated decision-making tools should be included in such informed consents. Lastly and notably, the Health Care Legal Advisory references California's long-standing prohibition against the practice of medicine by corporations and other \"artificial legal entities\" (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 2400). AI and other automated decision-making tools might violate this prohibition in instances where the tools interfere with professional medical judgment regarding patient care and treatment. Compliance with Recently Enacted Laws The Health Care Legal Advisory also mentions compliance with newly enacted California laws specifically directed towards AI. In particular, the Legal Advisory highlights SB-1120 prohibiting health care services plans from utilizing AI and other automated decision-making tools in making final medical necessity determinations to delay, deny, or modify care. Under SB-1120, licensed health care professionals competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved must make these medical necessity assessments. (See our Health Care Legislative Update here ). Potentially Unlawful Activities Under these existing and newly enacted legal authorities, the California AG provides examples of activities that may be unlawful in California when AI or other automated decision-making tools are utilized including: Denying health insurance claims in a manner that overrides a physician's determination regarding necessary treatment. Determining patient access to health care based upon predictions utilizing a patient's past health claims data and having a discriminatory disparate impact. Drafting patient notes, communications, or medical orders that include erroneous or misleading information. Takeaways The Health Care Legal Advisory confirms that the California AG will continue monitoring the increasing utilization of AI in the health care sector. As such, health care providers, insurers, vendors, and investors should continue to test, validate, and audit AI and other automated tools deployed in health care decision-making. Health care industry participants also should understand how the AI tools they utilize are trained, the quality and type of information that is considered, and how outputs and recommendations are generated. Lastly, health care entities should consider being transparent with patients regarding how AI is being utilized in making health care related decisions. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Daniel A.

    "article_text": "For the freshest news, join The Borneo Post's Telegram Channel and The Borneo Post on Newswav . Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Threads WhatsApp Telegram Queen Elizabeth I Hospital in Kota Kinabalu is a major hospital in Sabah that often handles a high number of patients. (Jan 25) Many of my friends express frustration over scheduling appointments at government hospitals in Kota Kinabalu. This is understandable, as Sabah’s healthcare system, like many others, grapples with a high demand for quality care amidst limited resources and staff shortages. Malaysia’s public healthcare system is an asset, offering affordable and accessible care to most citizens. However, this accessibility comes with significant pressure, leading to long wait times for some services. While private hospitals offer advanced facilities, the cost can be prohibitive for many. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes improving efficiency within the public system, raising public awareness about the strain on healthcare resources, and fostering collective responsibility for supporting healthcare workers and utilizing healthcare services responsibly. Queen Elizabeth Hospital 1 (QEH1) in Kota Kinabalu, like many public hospitals, is struggling to cope with an overwhelming influx of patients. This surge, driven by population growth and the presence of both legal and undocumented immigrants, is severely straining available resources. Patients experience significant delays in receiving treatment, while healthcare workers are overburdened and facing high levels of stress and burnout due to relentless workloads and inadequate compensation. Sabah’s unique geography further exacerbates these challenges. Remote communities face significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to limited infrastructure and transportation difficulties. This leaves rural residents heavily reliant on urban hospitals like QEH1, further straining its capacity. These issues mirror the broader challenges faced by many developing nations, where limited resources and uneven access to healthcare contribute to significant public health concerns. While private hospitals in Kota Kinabalu offer modern facilities, shorter wait times, and access to specialist care, their high costs place them out of reach for most Malaysians, including myself. Institutions like Gleneagles Hospital, KPJ Sabah Specialist Hospital and Jesselton Medical Centre (JMC) create a stark disparity in healthcare access. A simple consultation or basic procedure at a private hospital can cost significantly more than at a public hospital. Although private facilities play a crucial role in alleviating the burden on public hospitals, their exclusivity underscores the urgent need for affordable healthcare solutions that are accessible to the entire population. Healthcare professionals bear the brunt of systemic issues, often becoming the target of patient frustration. They are individuals trained and licensed to provide a wide range of health services, ensuring the physical, mental and emotional well-being of individuals and communities. They work in diverse settings, including hospitals, clinics, public health organizations, research institutions, and private practices. This diverse field encompasses a wide range of roles: Physicians and Surgeons: Diagnose and treat illnesses, injuries, and medical conditions. Specializations include general practice, cardiology, pediatrics, neurology and surgery. Nurses: Provide direct patient care, administer medications, and assist with treatment plans. Pharmacists: Dispense medications, counsel patients on their proper use, and ensure safe pharmaceutical practices. Dentists and Dental Professionals: Focus on oral health, including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of dental issues. Allied Health Professionals support diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. They include physiotherapists, radiographers, medical laboratory technologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and dietitians. Mental Health Professionals: These include psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers and counselors who provide mental health support and treatment. Midwives: Specialize in prenatal care, childbirth and postpartum support. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Professionals: Provide pre-hospital emergency care and transportation for patients. Medical Assistants and Technicians: Support healthcare delivery by performing administrative and clinical tasks. Public Health Professionals: Work on disease prevention, health education and policy implementation to promote community health. Alternative and Complementary Health Practitioners: Focus on non-conventional healthcare approaches, such as acupuncture, chiropractic, naturopathy and herbalism. Healthcare Administrators: Manage healthcare systems, ensure the efficient delivery of services, and oversee operations, staff and resources. Healthcare professionals collaborate to provide comprehensive care tailored to the needs of individuals and populations. Acknowledging their tireless efforts and adopting a more considerate approach when engaging with them is essential. Public patience and understanding can alleviate some of the emotional toll on these workers, enabling them to perform their duties more effectively. Patients should strive to express gratitude and respect toward healthcare workers, recognizing that these individuals are doing their best under challenging circumstances. Simple gestures like kind words of “Thank You” or a smile can make a significant difference in their day. Navigating the realities of the public healthcare system requires patience and adaptability. Developing a healthy coping mechanism can improve the experience for both patients and healthcare workers. Navigating hospital visits can be stressful. However, by managing expectations and adopting a proactive approach, you can significantly improve the experience. Firstly, it’s crucial to understand that delays are common, especially in government hospitals due to high patient volumes. Treat appointment times as estimates rather than rigid schedules. To make waiting more bearable, come prepared with a book, snacks and drinks. Find a quiet spot to relax or engage in conversations with other patients to make the time pass more comfortably. Shift your focus from the inconvenience of waiting to the ultimate goal of receiving necessary medical care. This mindset shift can cultivate patience and a more positive outlook. Finally, upon arrival, inquire with the reception staff about the estimated wait time for a clearer understanding of the situation. By implementing these strategies, patients can not only navigate their hospital visits with greater calm and confidence but also contribute to a more positive and efficient healthcare environment. Addressing Malaysia’s healthcare challenges requires more than individual coping mechanisms; it demands comprehensive systemic reforms. A key priority is strengthening primary healthcare, particularly through expanding access in rural areas. Initiatives such as mobile clinics and telemedicine can reduce the burden on urban hospitals and ensure that underserved communities receive better healthcare services. Furthermore, investing in healthcare infrastructure is essential. Modernizing public hospitals with upgraded facilities, and advanced equipment, and providing adequate housing for medical staff will significantly improve patient outcomes and the quality of care. Public-private partnerships also play a pivotal role, with collaborations like subsidized treatments in private hospitals for public patients enabling better resource allocation and broader access to care. Last but not least, supporting healthcare workers is critical for the success of these reforms. Competitive salaries, professional development opportunities, and comprehensive mental health support are necessary to attract and retain skilled professionals, ensuring a motivated and resilient workforce. Public education plays a pivotal role in improving long-term healthcare outcomes. By promoting healthy lifestyles and emphasizing preventive care through awareness campaigns, we can reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases, thereby lowering the demand for hospital services and fostering a healthier society overall. The challenges faced by Kota Kinabalu’s healthcare system mirror a global struggle to balance demand, resources, and accessibility. Systemic reforms, coupled with active public cooperation, are crucial to building a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system. Public behavior significantly impacts the healthcare environment. Demonstrating patience, respecting healthcare workers, and adopting practical coping strategies are essential steps individuals can take to support a more efficient and supportive healthcare system. Addressing the stark disparity between public and private healthcare costs is critical. The government should implement measures to regulate private hospital charges, making them more affordable, while simultaneously increasing funding for public healthcare services. By strategically investing in infrastructure, workforce development, and technology, and fostering greater public understanding and participation, Malaysia can transform its healthcare system into one that is inclusive, resilient and equitable. Through collaborative efforts between the government, private entities, healthcare professionals, and the public, we can create a system that reflects the nation’s aspirations for progress and inclusivity.

Log in here » Opinion Hey there, time traveller! This article was published 24/01/2025 (292 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current. Manitoba’s NDP government could be forgiven if it still hasn’t “fixed” health care — as it promised to do during the 2023 election — after only 15 months in office. After all, it takes time to bring down wait lists and improve the quality of health care — it can’t be done overnight. Still, after 15 months, the public is looking for signs of any kind that improvements are on the way. So far, there appears to be few, if any. MIKE DEAL / FREE PRESS FILES Nearly two-thirds of respondents in the nurses union survey said there’s been either no improvement in health care or things have gotten worse. Even the people who work on the front lines of health care are not seeing improvements. In fact, some of them say the system has worsened. “There’s a true disconnect between what government is saying in news conferences and campaigns, and what people in health care on the front lines see every single day,” said Jason Linklater, president of the Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals, whose organization recently commissioned a survey of its members. The verdict: close to half (48 per cent) said their workplace lost staff last year and 62 per cent said their workload got worse in 2024. That’s bad news for a health-care system that’s been struggling with acute shortages of front-line workers in recent years. There’s more: 59 per cent of respondents in the survey felt morale has worsened in their workplace. It’s not exactly what you’d expect to hear 15 months into the first term of a government that pledged to “listen to front-line workers,” improve morale on the front lines and hire more staff. “When we hear messaging coming from government that doesn’t reflect reality, it leads me to believe we’re at a stalemate in terms of being able to actually fix the system,” said Linklater, whose organization represents allied health workers, including paramedics, respiratory therapists, lab and imaging technologists and mental health clinicians. Government claims to have hired 870 net new health care workers, although that’s difficult to independently verify. Of those, only 10 per cent were allied workers. The association wasn’t the only organization that surveyed its members to gauge progress in health care. The Manitoba Nurses Union released a survey this week that showed 42 per cent of its members gave the province a “D” (no improvement) in health-care delivery. Another 24 per cent said there is “very minimal improvement” and 23 per cent said things have become worse. That means nearly two-thirds of respondents in the nurses union survey said there’s been either no improvement in health care or things have gotten worse. That’s not a great sign. It doesn’t give the public confidence that the province is doing the things necessary to alleviate hospital overcrowding, reduce emergency room wait times and speed up access to surgical procedures and diagnostic testing. If those things were happening, health-care professionals working on the front lines would notice them. It wouldn’t necessarily lead to immediate reductions in wait times, but the preliminary work — including hiring more staff — would be obvious to those who work directly with patients. They’re not noticing it. In fact, many say the system is worse today than it was 15 months ago. It doesn’t help that allied workers have been without a contract since March 31, 2024. The NDP, while in opposition, criticized the former Progressive Conservative government for failing to bargain with health-care workers in a timely manner. Now they’re doing the same thing. It’s hurting morale, something the NDP during the provincial election vowed to change. It also doesn’t help that the NDP has given away hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts, which has contributed to a projected deficit of $1.3 billion in 2024-25. As a result, it has less money to invest in health care and other front-line services. Winnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Jen Zoratti | Next Wednesdays What's next in arts, life and pop culture.

Meanwhile, ER and urgent care wait times were slightly higher in November 2024 at Winnipeg hospitals (the most recent data available) at 3.65 hours (median wait time) compared with 3.57 hours in November 2023, a few weeks after NDP Premier Wab Kinew was sworn into office. Wait times for hip and knee replacement surgery were slightly higher in 2024 than in 2023, as were wait times for MRIs, CT scans and ultrasounds. If things were getting better in health care, even marginally, it would be reflected in surveys conducted by organizations such as the association of health care professionals and the nurses union. It would also start to show up in the data for wait times. So far, a year and three months into the NDP’s first term, there’s no sign of that at all. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Tom Brodbeck Columnist Tom Brodbeck is an award-winning author and columnist with over 30 years experience in print media.

Generate Key Takeaways Jan. 23—Members of the Joplin Regional Alliance for Healthcare and Health Sciences have hired an executive director. Lori Worthington was introduced at a Tuesday meeting of the Joplin City Council by Travis Stephens, president and CEO of the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce. \"We received well over 60 applications for this position when we posted the job in July. We interviewed 10 of those,\" Stephens said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Worthington, of St. Joseph, was president and co-founder of Right Angle Advisors Inc., a consulting firm that specialized in customer engagement, health and productivity at St. Joseph. She had worked in that capacity for more than 11 years. Her responsibilities included recruiting, project management and executive management, according to her information on LinkedIn. \"We are very excited about the work and goals for the Regional Alliance for Healthcare and Health Sciences,\" Worthington told the council members. \"First and foremost, that is to continue to educate, recruit and retain our health care workers. Our top one priority is increasing our retention of health care workers and making sure we have adequate people coming into health care careers and staying in the Joplin area so that we have ample health care. We have worked toward becoming a destination for health care and we will go forward working on economic development to keep our dollars in Joplin and how to bring more into the city.\" The alliance was formed in 2022 with the goal of advancing health care and economic development in the region. In a report assessing the needs of the Joplin area that the alliance should focus on, a consultant found there are 2,000 graduate nurses here but recommended that the number be increased to 4,000 to keep up with health care demand. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Alliance members are representatives of the city of Joplin, the Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce, Freeman Health System, Mercy Hospital Joplin, the Community Clinic of Southwest Missouri, and educational institutions such as KCU, Missouri Southern State University and Crowder College. It also includes regional business and financial leaders, including the Farber Foundation. They all contribute to the business expenses of the group. One of those expenses was a $166,000 study and report on the status of health care and health care institutional needs here. The city paid the largest share of that study— $80,000 — because one of the roles of city government is to advance economic development, said City Manager Nick Edwards. He and Mayor Keenan Cortez are among those working with the alliance. About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Over the years, the battle lines of the health care discussion inside the statehouse have been well worn. This legislative session will be no different. Big insurance companies, big hospitals, big drug companies — and let’s not forget big government — trade barbs over who pays what and how much to whom. Have we accomplished anything? Are we improving the health care of Hoosiers during this race to the bottom? Obviously, the answer is no. That’s because, in the shouting match between big health care and government, there is one crucial voice that is missing: that of the patients. Opinion: Social media influencers sell fake lives to teens. Anxiety, depression follow. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It’s true that today our health care system is facing critical challenges and too often state policymakers myopically look at health care as a difficult math problem and at patients as just numbers on a ledger. It is also true that in spite of increased health care spending, Indiana residents continue to rank poorly according to numerous quality of health key metrics. It is time for patients to regain their voice in this debate and for physicians to use their knowledge and voices to advocate for them. We must protect Hoosier patients. This session, policymakers should protect the patients who place their trust in our health care workers; our talented doctors, nurses, and other professionals who today are largely tired and burned out. To be sure, this is due to several factors, but now in increasing numbers, they are making the difficult choice to leave the field altogether with fewer and fewer qualified individuals ready to replace them. These staff shortages place an undue and unfair strain on our patients and the workers left behind. Indiana must do more to address these workforce concerns, including initiatives to attract and retain health care professionals, improve working conditions and support career development opportunities. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Policymakers must protect the patients living in rural areas, some of whom are now experiencing a breakdown of basic health care options in their own communities as facilities are forced to drastically reduce services or close altogether. All too often, Hoosiers visit hospitals in difficult or time-critical moments in life. Whether you need emergency medical attention, cancer treatments, or even to deliver a baby, it is vital that every Hoosier has quick access to life-saving care in their own communities. Indiana must do more to prevent further closures, support struggling hospitals and ensure access to essential health care services for rural residents. Policymakers must protect the patients who rely on community health care providers playing a vital role in addressing local health care needs, from providing essential services to implementing preventative care programs in the communities in which they operate without regard for the patient’s ability to pay. A hospital waiting room. Indiana must do more to preserve and strengthen community-focused health care services to meet the diverse needs of Hoosier communities. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement These ideas aren’t new. Instead, it is vital that we rely on the foundational principle that Hoosier patients and their families deserve a health care environment that is centered on them and focused on providing easily accessible, quality care in their communities at an affordable price. That’s why it is alarming that most of the policy discussion today is focused on ever increasing government regulations that will increase costs while decreasing access to health care options. Misguided policies just take medical decision-making away from patients and their trusted doctors and nurses, shifting it over to government regulators, insurance companies and think tanks. That isn’t right. By getting the government and middlemen out of the way and putting our trust in health care providers, we can safeguard local health care services, address workforce challenges and promote polices that protect and enhance access to care for all individuals across the state.

    "article_text": "America is more polarized today than it has been at nearly any point in its history. Again, President Donald Trump has capitalized on this division to rise to the most powerful office in the land. As he enters his final term in office, he has a historic opportunity to bridge this divide and heal our fractured nation. Though we remain deeply divided on most political matters, there is one issue that most Americans agree upon: the U.S. health care system is broken. A 2024 Gallup Poll found that Americans are more dissatisfied with our health care system today than at any point during the poll’s 24-year history. Importantly, the dissatisfaction crosses party lines, with only 30% of Democrats and 25% of Republicans rating our health care system favorably. Explore Hundreds of thousands in GA could lose health insurance next year. This is one story. Credit: W Bond Sr Credit: W Bond Sr Credit: contributed Credit: contributed This disdain for U.S. health care is well-founded. The average family spends more than 11% of its income on health care , and 41% of Americans carry some degree of medical debt , which accounts for two-thirds of personal bankruptcy filings. Insurance behemoths are recording record profits , with the five highest-paid chief executives earning more than $20 million a year, while the average American employee faces unyielding wage stagnation. The rising cost of health insurance forces employers to forgo payroll increases for their employees and puts heightened financial pressure on small- and medium-sized businesses. For workers and families, this might be the difference between a comfortable middle-class life and scraping to get by. Fortunately, there is a solution that is widely popular among both political parties: universal health care. A 2018 Reuters-Ipsos poll found that 85% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans support a single-payer health care system, such as that in the Medicare for All Act proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. A single-payer system would benefit lower- and middle-class families, many of whom turned out in huge swathes to reelect Trump. A single-payer system would eliminate all out-of-pocket costs for routine and emergency medical care, and it would ensure that no man, woman or child would go without care because of the inability to pay. Explore Health care for American women is lagging. Does Britain have answers for Georgia? Medicare for All is not a zero-sum game; there are no losers. An ultra-wealthy class of elites would finally be paying its fair share, and the rest of America would pay less for their health care. Trump has flirted with the idea of universal health care before. When asked how he envisioned replacing the Affordable Care Act, Trump stated “ I have concepts of a plan .” Though this plan has yet to materialize, we can look at his past statements for clues. In 2017, Trump praised the Australian health care system , a hybrid public-private system that operates similarly to that proposed by the Medicare for All Act. In 2015, he spoke admiringly about the Scottish health care system, which is one of the purest forms of nationalized health care in the world. Most famously, in his 2000 book, “ The America We Deserve ,” Trump expressed his full-fledged support for a single-payer system stating: “I’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one. We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by health care expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan.” Recent events have made Trump’s nod to single-payer health care even more prescient. The tragic shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO has ignited a national conversation — not just about violence but about the anger and desperation felt by many who are trapped in a health care system that prioritizes corporate profits over people. Explore Health care AI, intended to save money, turns out to require a lot of expensive humans As a nation, we must unequivocally condemn all forms of targeted violence. At the same time, we must acknowledge the overwhelming consensus that has become apparent: Americans, regardless of political affiliation, are fed up with a system that often denies care, burdens families with insurmountable costs and enriches corporate elites. This shared frustration presents Trump with a unique opportunity to align his actions with the populist message that won him the presidency. If Trump truly stands for the working class, he will lead the charge for Medicare for All. Explore We all benefit from and are hurt by health insurance claim denials Not only would this fulfill his unyielding promise to “drain the swamp,” but it would also secure his legacy as the president who finally fixed America’s broken health care system.

    "article_text": "MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - A new proposal would cap the salaries of the highest earners at Vermont hospitals. Vermont’s largest nurses union and lawmakers presented a bill on Thursday that would ensure no hospital executive or clinical leader statewide is paid more than 10 times that of the hospital’s lowest-paid employee. It comes as health care providers across Vermont are struggling to make ends meet and cutting services for patients.

Mari Cordes, D-Lincoln. Vermont’s largest health care provider is the UVM Health Network. A spokesperson says salaries for senior leaders there only make up 1.08% of payroll. A spokesperson said, in part quote, “There is no question that health care is unaffordable for too many Vermonters, and UVM Health Network is committed to working together with our regulator -- state and federal leaders and other partners to identify solutions that help people access and afford the care they need.” Copyright 2025 WCAX.

    "article_text": "January 23, 2025 California Attorney General Issues Warning on Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Daniel Cody , Kathryn Edgerton , Hassan Shaikh Mintz - Health Care Viewpoints + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: On January 13, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta (the California AG) issued two Legal Advisories regarding the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI). The first Legal Advisory provides guidance to consumers and entities developing, selling, and using AI describing their rights and obligations under California law. The second Legal Advisory, entitled Application of Existing California Law to Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare (the Health Care Legal Advisory), is expressly directed at health care providers, insurers, vendors, investors, and other health care entities who develop, sell, and use AI and other automated decision-making tools. In the accompanying press release , the California AG notes that: AI might be changing, innovating, and evolving quickly, but the fifth largest economy in the world is not the wild west; existing California laws apply to both the development and use of AI. Companies, including healthcare entities, are responsible for complying with new and existing California laws and must take full accountability for their actions, decisions, and products. The California AG’s Concerns with AI in Health Care The California AG has previously expressed concerns regarding the increased utilization of AI and algorithmic tools and the potential violation of California law. In August 2022, the California AG sent letters to 30 California hospitals requesting information regarding how the hospitals identify and address racial and ethnic disparities that may exist in their commercial decision-making tools. (See California AG press release here ). The California AG raised the issue that such algorithmic tools, which often leverage AI, might have discriminatory impacts based on race and ethnicity. The recent Legal Advisories highlight the California AG’s ongoing concerns. On the one hand, the Health Care Legal Advisory notes the potential benefits of AI-enabled tools including improving both patient and population health, reducing administrative burdens, increasing health equity, and facilitating appropriate information sharing. On the other hand, the risks of AI in health care include potential denials of necessary care, misallocation of health care resources, discrimination, and interference with patient autonomy and privacy. Compliance with Existing Laws The Health Care Legal Advisory discusses compliance with existing California consumer protection, unfair competition, civil rights, and patient privacy laws. First, the Health Care Legal Advisory outlines the broad scope of California’s Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200) which protects consumers against false advertising, marketing, and anticompetitive practices among other legal protections. Second, the Health Care Legal Advisory highlights California’s anti-discrimination law applicable broadly to individuals and entities receiving “state support” (Cal. Gov. Code § 11135). In this context, the California AG warns that while AI and other automated decision-making tools may be facially neutral, health care entities may not ignore or avoid data indicating racial, gender, or other protected classification inequities. Third, the California AG notes that in some cases California medical privacy laws are more protective than federal law. As such, California health care entities may have a heightened obligation to preserve the confidentiality of medical information, ensure patient access to their medical information, and obtain robust patient informed consents. Further, the Health Care Legal Advisory posits that California health care providers consider whether disclosure of the utilization of AI and other automated decision-making tools should be included in such informed consents. Lastly and notably, the Health Care Legal Advisory references California’s long-standing prohibition against the practice of medicine by corporations and other “artificial legal entities” (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 2400). AI and other automated decision-making tools might violate this prohibition in instances where the tools interfere with professional medical judgment regarding patient care and treatment. Compliance with Recently Enacted Laws The Health Care Legal Advisory also mentions compliance with newly enacted California laws specifically directed towards AI. In particular, the Legal Advisory highlights SB-1120 prohibiting health care services plans from utilizing AI and other automated decision-making tools in making final medical necessity determinations to delay, deny, or modify care. Under SB-1120, licensed health care professionals competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved must make these medical necessity assessments. (See our Health Care Legislative Update here ). Potentially Unlawful Activities Under these existing and newly enacted legal authorities, the California AG provides examples of activities that may be unlawful in California when AI or other automated decision-making tools are utilized including: Denying health insurance claims in a manner that overrides a physician’s determination regarding necessary treatment. Determining patient access to health care based upon predictions utilizing a patient’s past health claims data and having a discriminatory disparate impact. Drafting patient notes, communications, or medical orders that include erroneous or misleading information. Takeaways The Health Care Legal Advisory confirms that the California AG will continue monitoring the increasing utilization of AI in the health care sector. As such, health care providers, insurers, vendors, and investors should continue to test, validate, and audit AI and other automated tools deployed in health care decision-making. Health care industry participants also should understand how the AI tools they utilize are trained, the quality and type of information that is considered, and how outputs and recommendations are generated. Lastly, health care entities should consider being transparent with patients regarding how AI is being utilized in making health care related decisions.

    "article_text": "SA is at a critical juncture in pursuing universal health coverage. The signing of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act brought this vision closer to reality, but it has also revealed challenges that require urgent attention. Stakeholders in healthcare have a shared responsibility to ensure the NHI fulfils its promise to provide equitable, high-quality healthcare for all South Africans. The business community has both a responsibility and a valuable opportunity to propose and develop innovative strategies to create a holistic health ecosystem that upholds SA's constitutional right to progressive healthcare. As part of this ecosystem, the pharmaceutical industry is committed to supporting solutions that enhance access to innovative medicines while ensuring the sustainability of public and private healthcare systems. The signing of the NHI Act sparked a range of perspectives, reflecting the complexity of implementing universal healthcare. While some advocate for immediate implementation to address inequities, others support universal healthcare in principle but have raised concerns about the single-payer system, calling instead for a mixed-payer, phased and sustainable rollout. These differing viewpoints underline the importance of balancing ambition with practicality. At its core, the NHI must unify SA’s healthcare system, bridging the gaps between public and private care while addressing the challenges of implementation in the spirit of collaboration and pragmatism. The principle of progressive realisation in SA's constitution is a guiding framework for addressing the right to healthcare. It recognises that achieving universal healthcare cannot happen overnight, especially given resource constraints, infrastructure gaps and workforce shortages. While SA faces socio-economic challenges, public healthcare remains the backbone of equitable access for millions. Policymakers must ensure the NHI strengthens this backbone, rather than undermine it by addressing gaps in quality and delivery through focused investments, leadership and strategic collaboration. Strategic planning will be critical to improving outcomes by prioritising resource allocation to not overburden SA’s fragile economy. To ensure sustainability in access to quality healthcare, improving access to the public and private healthcare systems is critical. As such, the ministry of health must recognise that it is not the ministry of public health but the ministry of all health. SA's private healthcare system faces strain, with rising costs and stagnant medical aid memberships creating barriers to accessing innovative treatments. This dual fragility of public and private healthcare requires a co-ordinated approach that bridges these systems. Exploring globally proven strategies, such as outcomes-based pricing and mandatory insurance for employed individuals, we can align affordability with innovation while ensuring stability for the healthcare ecosystem. The Hospital Association of SA’s proposal for mandatory insurance offers a compelling option to complement the NHI. It illustrates how hybrid models can bridge the gap between public funding and private capacity, safeguarding the sustainability of both systems. While no single solution will suffice, maintaining an open mind to credible alternatives ensures we consider all pathways to success. This openness to innovation and collaboration will be crucial to success as stakeholders work to implement the NHI effectively. It is encouraging that President Cyril Ramaphosa engaged directly with Business Unity SA (BUSA) to address healthcare challenges. This partnership demonstrates the value of collective problem-solving in tackling systemic issues and it sets the stage for meaningful collaboration across sectors. BUSA’s commitment to proposing workable, affordable solutions aligns with the NHI’s broader goals of advancing universal health coverage. Building on these dialogues, SA can develop a more equitable healthcare system. This collaboration provides an opportunity to rethink SA’s healthcare system holistically. Aligning it with patient needs requires leveraging global best practices such as value-based outcomes, innovative contracting, mandatory insurance for employed individuals and risk equalisation funds. For example, using the Single Exit Price (SEP) policy alongside other legislative tools can improve access to essential medicines for rare diseases and cancer, ensuring patients are not left behind as the system evolves. The pharmaceutical industry acknowledges the importance of price transparency and recognises the positive impact the SEP has had in SA, particularly as it relates to products in a strong competitive landscape. However, we must acknowledge that the SEP has unintentionally restricted access to innovative products. As a committed partner in healthcare, the pharmaceutical industry is prepared to contribute alternative access models, such as cost capitation and outcomes-based approaches. The pharmaceutical industry stands ready to avail access on a sustainable basis, ensuring every patient can benefit from the latest innovation. The pharmaceutical sector, private funders, patient organisations and healthcare professionals have proposed various alternative access models that specifically address the affordability challenges in our country, rooted in the principles of social solidarity – values that resonate deeply with South Africans. Unlocking access to innovative medicine is about more than securing lower prices – it is about ensuring advancements in medicine reach those who need them most. Integrating affordability and sustainability into the NHI’s rollout, SA can create a healthcare system that fulfils its constitutional promise of equitable healthcare ensuring that no patient is left behind as the system evolves.

    "article_text": "Thursday 23 January 2025 - 15:19pm JOHANNESBURG - South Africa stands at a pivotal crossroads as it assumes the presidency of the G20 this year. This role provides an unparalleled opportunity for the nation to advocate for African interests on a global stage, particularly in the realm of healthcare. With the African Union (AU) as a permanent member of the G20, there is a unique chance to elevate the African agenda and push for meaningful implementation of industrial initiatives that will enable the continent to catch up with its developed counterparts. Global Health was first included on the G20 agenda in 2017, during Germany’s Presidency, to underscore the political support needed for health initiatives and the economic dimensions of health issues. At the heart of South Africa’s G20 presidency lies a commitment to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Millions of people across Africa continue to suffer from inadequate access to quality healthcare services. Africa remains disproportionately affected by diseases such as malaria, cholera, and HIV/AIDS, and were ill-equipped to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The continent's healthcare systems are often underfunded and lack critical infrastructure, leading to dire consequences for public health. To address these challenges, South Africa must prioritise healthcare access in its G20 agenda. This involves not only advocating for equitable distribution of resources but also fostering partnerships with more advanced economies to build capacity within local healthcare systems. South Africa can facilitate collaboration that enhances vaccine production capabilities and improves access to essential medications. Things that are key for any healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities within global health systems, particularly in developing nations. Vaccine nationalism during this crisis served as a stark reminder that African countries must be better prepared for future health emergencies. As Deputy Health Minister, Joe Phaahla noted, “As we assume the G20 presidency in 2025, South Africa will continue to champion the agenda of universal health coverage through equity, solidarity, and innovation”. This proactive approach is essential for creating a resilient healthcare system capable of responding effectively to future pandemics. Moreover, addressing systemic inequalities is crucial in breaking the cycle of vulnerability that exacerbates health crises. The antidote to dealing with these challenges lie in our ability to effectively garner resources through multilateral platforms such as the G20. Furthermore, South Africa must focus on strengthening its healthcare infrastructure in order to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). The Second Presidential Health Compact outlines a commitment to enhancing health system performance and implementing National Health Insurance (NHI) effectively. This initiative aims to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare services without facing financial hardship. However, achieving these goals requires significant investment in human resources and finances for health. A study conducted by the African Epidemiological Association identified inadequate human resources as one of the foremost challenges facing healthcare systems across Africa. Training and capacity building for healthcare workers should be prioritised alongside increased budgetary allocations to the sector. Public-private partnerships could play a vital role in this regard as multinational companies operating in Africa could be encouraged to invest in local healthcare initiatives as part of their corporate social responsibility efforts. South Africa's G20 presidency also presents an opportunity to foster international collaboration aimed at addressing global health challenges. South Africa can advocate for policies that promote equitable access to healthcare resources and strengthen multilateral responses to pandemics, particularly in the African continent. The focus should be on creating resilient health systems capable of adapting to emerging threats while ensuring that vulnerable populations are not left behind. Likewise, initiatives aimed at increasing regional production of life-saving medical products can significantly enhance self-sufficiency in healthcare delivery. As highlighted during recent discussions at G20 meetings, boosting local production capabilities is essential for ensuring timely access to vaccines and treatments during crises. South Africa must embrace this moment as an opportunity not just for national advancement but for continental transformation. South Africa can lead efforts toward achieving universal health coverage characterised by equity and accessibility by placing healthcare at the forefront of its agenda The path ahead will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders - government entities, civil society organisations, private sector partners, and international allies to build a robust healthcare framework that meets the needs of all citizens. Through solidarity and collaboration, South Africa can not only enhance its own healthcare system but also set a precedent for other nations facing similar challenges. The time is ripe for action as President Cyril Ramaphosa stated during his remarks at the G20 closing ceremony in Brazil: “We must stand in solidarity with those countries that are most vulnerable to pandemics and other global public health emergencies”. In doing so, South Africa can pave the way toward a healthier future for all Africans—one where quality healthcare is not just an aspiration but a reality."

Images: Video screenshot Home » Blame government, employer for nurse-Zimbabwean patient clash, says union Blame government, employer for nurse-Zimbabwean patient clash, says union A viral clash between a South African nurse and a Zimbabwean patient highlights systemic issues in South Africa’s healthcare sector. By Dumani Moyo 23-01-25 14:16 in News 0 A Zimbabwean patient filmed a video while waiting for treatment. Images: Video screenshot A recent incident involving a clash between a South African nurse and a Zimbabwean patient at a Midrand clinic has highlighted the mounting pressures faced by South Africa’s healthcare workers. Speaking to The South African , general secretary of the Health and Allied Workers Indaba Trade Union (HAITU) , Lerato Mthunzi, shared insights into the challenges healthcare workers face and the broader systemic issues that contribute to these conflicts. A viral video of the incident sparked widespread online abuse of the nurse . It also highlighted the strain on South Africa’s healthcare infrastructure. ADVERTISEMENT Security Measures Strengthened After Clinic Incident After a nurse-patient altercation at Midrand Halfway Clinic, authorities strengthened security for healthcare workers. Lerato Mthunzi stated that the incident stemmed from a history of prior disputes between the patient and the nurse. “We understand that the patient involved is a local resident who frequently visits the clinic for her own treatment and her children’s,” Mthunzi said. She added, “The nurse told us she’s had spinal operations and physically cannot afford to fight patients.” The Role of Systemic Failures in Healthcare Conflicts Mthunzi attributed the conflict to systemic failures within South Africa’s healthcare system. “The biggest culprit here is the employer and the government. By understaffing clinics, the government is frustrating both nurses and patients, creating a breeding ground for these types of conflicts,” she said. “Section 27 of our Constitution ensures healthcare access for everyone, regardless of nationality, but the system is failing both the workers and the people it serves.” Viral Video Sparks Outrage and Solidarity The video of the incident, shared on social media , triggered online abuse against the nurse. The Progressive Forces of South Africa (PFSA) and the Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU), which is now HAITU, have condemned online bullying and rallied in support of the nurse, highlighting the challenges faced by healthcare professionals. Healthcare Infrastructure Under Strain The PFSA has pointed out that the influx of illegal foreign nationals has further burdened an already overstretched healthcare system. This has led to renewed calls for prioritising South African citizens in resource allocation and addressing systemic deficiencies. Mthunzi explained that patients often become frustrated from waiting for hours due to insufficient staff. She added that this frustration leads to unnecessary conflicts, which could be avoided with proper resources. What do you think about healthcare in South Africa?

    "article_text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, funding remains a critical component for the success and sustainability of various initiatives. Nonprofit organizations, community health programs, and innovative healthcare projects often rely on diverse funding sources to deliver essential services, conduct research, and implement community outreach programs. Understanding the myriad of funding opportunities available is crucial for NGO professionals who aim to enhance healthcare access and improve health outcomes in their communities. Healthcare funding opportunities can be broadly categorized into government grants, private foundation grants, corporate sponsorships, crowdfunding, international funding, and nonprofit organization grants. Each of these avenues presents unique advantages and challenges, making it essential for healthcare professionals to navigate this complex terrain effectively. By leveraging these funding sources, organizations can not only secure the necessary financial resources but also foster partnerships that enhance their credibility and reach within the healthcare sector. Government Grants for Healthcare Initiatives Government grants are a cornerstone of funding for healthcare initiatives, providing substantial financial support to organizations that align with public health goals. These grants are typically offered at federal, state, and local levels, with various agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) leading the charge. The application process for government grants can be rigorous, often requiring detailed proposals that outline the project’s objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes. One notable example of successful government funding is the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which provides grants to improve access to healthcare services for underserved populations. Organizations that have received HRSA funding have been able to expand their services significantly, offering everything from mental health support to maternal care. To tap into these opportunities, NGOs must stay informed about grant announcements and deadlines, ensuring they submit well-crafted proposals that clearly demonstrate their alignment with government priorities. Private Foundation Grants for Healthcare Initiatives Private foundations play a pivotal role in supporting healthcare initiatives through targeted grants that address specific health issues or populations. These foundations often focus on areas such as disease prevention, health education, and innovative healthcare delivery models. Unlike government grants, private foundation grants may offer more flexibility in terms of project design and implementation timelines, allowing organizations to tailor their initiatives to meet community needs effectively. For instance, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has been instrumental in funding projects aimed at improving public health across the United States . Their commitment to addressing social determinants of health has led to numerous successful initiatives that empower communities to take charge of their health outcomes. To secure funding from private foundations, NGOs should cultivate relationships with foundation representatives, understand their funding priorities, and craft compelling narratives that resonate with their mission. Corporate Sponsorship for Healthcare Initiatives Corporate sponsorship represents another viable funding avenue for healthcare initiatives. Many corporations are increasingly recognizing the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and are eager to partner with nonprofits to support health-related causes. These partnerships can take various forms, including financial contributions, in-kind donations, or employee volunteer programs. A prime example of successful corporate sponsorship is the collaboration between pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations to promote health awareness campaigns. For instance, a pharmaceutical company may sponsor a community health fair that provides free screenings and educational resources while simultaneously enhancing its brand visibility. To attract corporate sponsors, NGOs should develop clear proposals that outline the mutual benefits of collaboration, including brand exposure and community impact. Crowdfunding for Healthcare Initiatives In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a powerful tool for raising funds for healthcare initiatives. Platforms like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo allow individuals and organizations to share their stories and solicit donations from a broad audience. This method not only provides immediate financial support but also fosters community engagement and awareness around specific health issues. Successful crowdfunding campaigns often leverage social media to amplify their reach and connect with potential donors. For example, a nonprofit organization focused on mental health may launch a campaign to fund a new support program by sharing personal stories from beneficiaries and highlighting the program’s potential impact. To maximize success in crowdfunding efforts, NGOs should create compelling narratives, utilize engaging visuals, and actively engage with their audience throughout the campaign. International Funding Opportunities for Healthcare Initiatives For NGOs operating in a global context, international funding opportunities can provide essential resources for healthcare initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Fund, and various international development agencies offer grants and funding programs aimed at improving health systems worldwide. These opportunities often focus on pressing global health challenges such as infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and access to essential medicines. An illustrative case is the Global Fund’s efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria through strategic partnerships with local NGOs. By providing financial resources and technical assistance, the Global Fund has enabled organizations to implement effective interventions that save lives and strengthen health systems. To access international funding opportunities, NGOs must demonstrate their capacity to implement projects effectively while adhering to donor requirements and reporting standards. Nonprofit Organization Grants for Healthcare Initiatives Nonprofit organizations themselves can be valuable sources of funding for healthcare initiatives through grant programs designed to support specific health-related projects. Many larger nonprofits allocate a portion of their resources to fund smaller organizations that align with their mission. These grants can be particularly beneficial for grassroots initiatives that may struggle to secure funding from traditional sources. For example, the American Heart Association offers grants to support research and community programs aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors. By applying for these grants, smaller organizations can gain access to vital resources that enable them to implement impactful health interventions in their communities. To successfully secure nonprofit organization grants, NGOs should focus on building strong networks within the nonprofit sector and actively seek out grant opportunities that align with their mission. Tips for Securing Funding for Healthcare Initiatives Securing funding for healthcare initiatives requires a strategic approach that combines thorough research, relationship-building, and effective communication. First and foremost, NGOs should invest time in understanding the specific funding landscape relevant to their initiatives. This includes identifying potential funders—whether government agencies, private foundations, or corporate sponsors—and researching their priorities and application processes. Building relationships with funders is equally important; networking at conferences, workshops, or community events can open doors to valuable connections. Engaging with funders through informal conversations can provide insights into their interests and expectations while also allowing NGOs to showcase their work. When crafting proposals or applications for funding, clarity is key. Organizations should articulate their mission clearly while outlining how their proposed initiative aligns with the funder’s goals. Providing data-driven evidence of need—such as statistics on health disparities or testimonials from community members—can strengthen proposals significantly. Finally, NGOs should be prepared for follow-up communication after submitting proposals. Funders often appreciate updates on project progress or outcomes even if they do not award funding immediately. This proactive approach not only demonstrates professionalism but also keeps organizations on funders’ radars for future opportunities. In conclusion, navigating the diverse landscape of healthcare funding opportunities requires diligence, creativity, and strategic thinking. By understanding the various sources of funding available—from government grants to crowdfunding—NGO professionals can enhance their ability to secure resources that drive impactful healthcare initiatives forward. With a commitment to building relationships and crafting compelling narratives, organizations can position themselves as valuable partners in improving health outcomes within their communities."

Chip Roy, R-Texas, issued a diagnosis for America’s broken health care system, and he says the problem isn’t what people think. America’s health crisis doesn’t come from health insurance, Big Pharma, or even food additives, Roy says. “It’s the fact that politicians, bureaucrats, and corporations are all benefitting from a broken, cronyistic system that lets them put profits over patients with impunity,” Roy told The Daily Signal. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! In Roy’s new report, “The Case for Healthcare Freedom,” the House Freedom Caucus member says Congress has the opportunity to make America healthy again by promoting expansive health savings accounts in the upcoming budget reconciliation process. Health savings accounts allow individuals and families to save money and spend it tax-free on health care expenses. “Giving the same actors more power and money won’t work; if we want to Make America Healthy Again, the answer is health care freedom,” Roy said. “If we want to control our budgets and health care spending, the answer is health care freedom.” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas The report, first shared with The Daily Signal, says our current health care system is neither free nor competitive. “It is government-regulated, government-funded, Big Insurance-managed ‘care’ resulting in a broken system on the brink of fully government-run health care,” the report says. “Half measures by Republicans will not save us from this disaster.” The rising costs of health care, reduced choices, and complexity of the system lead some to advocate for more government control over the system, but this perspective ignores the true culprit, Roy said. “What they will fail to notice is that it is the very government they are willing to give control of the health care system [to] that destroyed our health care system,” the report says. Though the United States spends more on health care than any other developed country, America has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases, and one of the highest obesity rates among other wealthy countries. “America is the center of medical innovation in the world. It is not something we should take for granted,” the report continues. “This role as a world leader does not mean that we need a drug for everything. Especially things that could be mitigated by eating a balanced diet, sleeping more, and exercising.” The federal government will likely spend $250 billion on junk food over the next 10 years through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. Yet much of American health care spending—$4.9 trillion in 2023—will pay for drugs instead of addressing the root causes of illness and obesity. The drugmaker behind weight loss drugs Wegovy, Saxenda, and Ozempic, Novo Nordisk, has spent $25.8 million over the past decade promoting its obesity drugs, the report says. Instead of “free market” health care, America has “textbook crony capitalism” to the “detriment of the patient and providers,” according to the report. “Our system is run by government and insurance bureaucrats and is ‘private’ in name only,” the report states. “Health care special interests spend $750 million annually lobbying to keep this racket going.” American health care is “hostile” to innovation as the “regulations and restrictions that have been placed on the health care system claiming to ‘protect patients’ have only led to the opposite,” according to Roy. The average annual premium for employer-sponsored family health insurance is close to $25,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Our ‘health’ focused government agencies are littered with conflicts of interest,” the report says. “And unsurprisingly, American health is impacted. Indeed, chronic food illness kills up to 678,000 Americans per year.” Food-related chronic diseases, like Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, are caused by an unhealthy diet. “As a share of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), health spending accounted for 17.6%, and costs are growing around 1% faster than the annual GDP,” Roy’s report continues. “If conservatives care about a strong national defense and low taxes, these trends have to be reversed.” [ Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal . ] big pharma , Chip Roy , health care , Medications , Prescriptions"

Follow Author Jan 22, 2025, 02:06pm EST Share Save Comment Big data and artificial intelligence concept. Machine learning and cyber mind domination concept in form of women face outline outline with circuit board and binary data flow on blue background. getty Healthcare for neurodivergent individuals has long been riddled with challenges, from delayed diagnoses to fragmented care systems . The burden often falls disproportionately on families, particularly caregivers, who navigate waitlists, insurance battles, and limited resources. But as awareness of neurodivergence grows, so does the opportunity to rethink how healthcare is delivered, taught, and financed. With innovative tools and a shift toward inclusive, patient-centered care, organizations like the Institute for Exceptional Care ( IEC ) are driving systemic change. As Dr. Mai Pham, founder of IEC, explains, the goal is to create a healthcare system that works for everyone, not just those who fit neatly into its traditional framework. A Personal Mission Becomes a Systemic Solution For Pham, the journey to reimagine healthcare began at home. getty For Pham, the journey to reimagine healthcare began at home. “My second-born, Alex, is 22 and autistic,” she shares. “Our family’s experience with their mental health crisis in high school led to questioning and exploration on my part about how we failed them and how the healthcare system failed us.” MORE FOR YOU Despite her position as a national healthcare leader, Pham found herself unprepared for the realities of navigating a system ill-equipped to serve families like hers. “I realized families without our resources and healthcare connections would face even worse challenges,” she says. This realization galvanized Pham to launch IEC, which focuses on preparing clinicians to work with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), designing systems to meet diverse patient needs, and finding better ways to finance those services. “We need to balance professional expertise with the wisdom of patients’ and caregivers’ lived experiences,” Pham emphasizes. “Healthcare should aim for holistic well-being, not just the absence of disease.” The Caregiver Burden The gaps in the healthcare system place an incredible burden on caregivers, often mothers, who are forced to become full-time coordinators of their child’s care. getty The gaps in the healthcare system place an incredible burden on caregivers, often mothers, who are forced to become full-time coordinators of their child’s care. Robin McIntosh, CEO of Avela Health, shares her personal experience: “Many caregivers, myself included, quit their jobs to manage the overwhelming coordination required to access quality healthcare. From navigating waitlists to driving to distant appointments, it’s an exhausting journey.” Compounding the issue is the lack of diverse care options. Most families are funneled into Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), which may not be suitable for every child. “This overreliance on caregivers and the limited spectrum of services make an already challenging journey even more daunting,” McIntosh notes. Building a Culture of Inclusion For meaningful change, healthcare systems must embrace inclusivity at every level. getty For meaningful change, healthcare systems must embrace inclusivity at every level. IEC is leading the charge by building coalitions that bring healthcare leaders and community members together to co-create solutions. “Our healthcare partners tell us that the process changes them,” says Pham. “It creates a new appreciation for the value of community input and results in better solutions that are more likely to be effective. It also takes the pressure off healthcare leaders to have all the answers.” One example of this collaborative approach is the Always Uniquely Me app , developed by IEC in a project on Long Island. The app allows individuals with IDD or their caregivers to upload personal information, such as communication preferences, anxiety triggers, and tips for effective interactions. “It humanizes the person to that clinician and helps reduce stress for everyone involved,” Pham explains. Pham envisions the app being useful beyond the IDD community. “Wouldn’t that also be incredibly helpful for people with dementia? Or non-English speakers?” she asks. “We’re trying to create the healthcare equivalent of curb cuts—a system designed to be inclusive rather than retrofitted.” The Role of Technology in Transforming Care Technology is proving to be a game-changer in improving healthcare for neurodivergent individuals. Telehealth, for example, allows clinicians to observe patients in their home environments, reducing the stress of traveling to medical offices. getty Technology is proving to be a game-changer in improving healthcare for neurodivergent individuals. Telehealth, for example, allows clinicians to observe patients in their home environments, reducing the stress of traveling to medical offices. “Telehealth offers a clearer window into a patient’s daily life,” says McIntosh. “It’s improving both accessibility and quality of care for autistic individuals .” AI-powered platforms are another promising innovation. Avela Health uses AI to deliver scalable, personalized care plans grounded in evidence-based methodologies like Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions ( NDBI ). “These tools integrate seamlessly into daily routines, offering families practical solutions,” McIntosh says. Beyond care delivery, technology is also enhancing clinician efficiency. Pham highlights the potential of AI to streamline administrative tasks, such as notetaking, allowing clinicians to focus on patient care. “No one enters this field to take notes,” she says. “Technology can free up time for what truly matters.” Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

    "article_text": "Researchers at the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University found that these individuals also report experiencing lower quality healthcare than both autistic and non-autistic people whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth (cisgender). The findings have important implications for the healthcare and support of autistic transgender/gender diverse (TGD) individuals. This is the first large-scale study on the experiences of autistic TGD people and the results are published today in Molecular Autism. Previous research suggests that both autistic people and TGD people separately have poorer healthcare experiences and are more likely to be diagnosed with physical and mental health conditions than other people. In addition, a 2020 study of over 640,000 people, carried out by the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, found that TGD people are more likely to be autistic and have higher levels of autistic traits than other people. Several other studies now confirm this finding and show that autistic people are more likely to experience gender dysphoria than others. Despite these findings, there are no studies that consider risks of mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and healthcare quality among autistic TGD people. In the largest study to date on this topic, the team at the Autism Research Centre used an anonymous, self-report survey to compare the experiences of 174 autistic TGD individuals, 1,094 autistic cisgender individuals, and 1,295 non-autistic cisgender individuals. The survey assessed rates of mental health conditions and physical health conditions, as well as the quality of 51 different aspects of healthcare experiences. The healthcare experiences questions were wide-ranging and included questions about communication, anxiety, access and advocacy, system-level issues, and sensory experiences among others. They addressed several very basic aspects of healthcare, including asking participants to endorse statements such as ‘If I need to go to see a healthcare professional, I am able to get there’, ‘I am able to describe how bad my pain feels’, and ‘I usually understand what my healthcare professional means when they discuss my health’. Both autistic TGD and autistic cisgender adults reported significantly poorer healthcare experiences across 50 out of 51 items compared with non-autistic cisgender people, confirming that autistic people appear to have poorer quality healthcare than non-autistic cisgender individuals, regardless of their own gender identity. Compared to non-autistic cisgender individuals, autistic TGD people were three to 11 times more likely to report anxiety, shutdowns, and meltdowns related to common healthcare experiences. For every 10 cisgender non-autistic adults who endorsed the following statements, on average, only two autistic cisgender adults and only one autistic TGD adult stated that they: (i) understood what their healthcare professional meant when discussing their health; (ii) knew what was expected of them when seeing a healthcare professional; or (iii) were able to describe how bad their pain felt. Autistic TGD people and autistic cisgender people were more likely to report both long-term physical and mental health conditions that were formally diagnosed, suspected, or that had been recommended for assessment by clinicians. For every 10 non-autistic cisgender people who had at least one diagnosed physical health condition, there were 15 autistic cisgender people and 23 autistic TGD people. For every 10 non-autistic cisgender people who reported at least one diagnosed mental health condition, there were 50 autistic cisgender people and 109 autistic TGD people who reported the same. Alarmingly, it is now well-established that autistic people and TGD people are each at a much higher risk of suicide and suicide-related behaviours than other people. In 2023, the Department of Health and Social Care specifically recognized autistic people as a priority group in their Suicide prevention strategy for England: 2023 to 2028 . The new study found that, compared to people who are non-autistic and cisgender, autistic cisgender individuals were 4.6 times more likely and autistic TGD people were 5.8 times more likely to report self-harm. Dr Elizabeth Weir, a postdoctoral scientist at the Autism Research Centre, and one of the lead researchers of the study, said: “These findings add to the growing body of evidence that many autistic people experience unacceptably poor mental health and are at a very high risk of suicide-related behaviours. We need to consider how other aspects of identity, including gender, influence these risks.” These results emphasise the importance of considering intersectionality in clinical settings, including health risks for individuals who hold multiple minoritised identities. The researchers say clinicians should be aware of these risks and the unique barriers to healthcare that autistic TGD people may experience. The findings also underscore that people who are autistic and transgender/gender diverse experience particularly high rates of mental health conditions and risks of self-harm. Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: “We need to consider how to adapt healthcare systems and individual care to meet the needs of autistic transgender/gender diverse people. Policymakers, clinicians, and researchers should work collaboratively with autistic people to improve existing systems and reduce barriers to healthcare.” Reference Green, K.*, Weir, E.*, Wright, L.*, Allison, C., & Baron-Cohen, S.

    "article_text": "Allen OLAYIWOLA Audio By Carbonatix …Transforming Ghana's healthcare with next-generation technology Ghana's healthcare sector is a vital pillar of the nation's development, encompassing a broad network of public hospitals, private clinics, and community health centers. Despite its critical role, the sector faces numerous challenges, including outdated infrastructure, staffing shortages, and limited access to advanced technologies. Similar to healthcare systems worldwide, Ghana’s healthcare infrastructure often struggles with inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, impacting the quality of care provided to patients. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the weaknesses in global healthcare systems, including those in Ghana, highlighting the need for rapid modernization. Pre-pandemic, telemedicine and digital health solutions were underutilized, but the urgent need for remote care pushed the adoption of these technologies forward. This accelerated digital transformation was a wake-up call, revealing how far behind healthcare systems were compared to other sectors. The role of the government in driving healthcare innovation The government of Ghana plays a crucial role in leading the transformation of the healthcare sector. By setting strategic priorities, investing in technology, and creating policies that foster innovation, the government can pave the way for a modern, efficient, and inclusive healthcare system. Public sector leadership is essential in mobilizing resources, guiding the implementation of new technologies, and ensuring that healthcare services reach every corner of the country. Government initiatives such as the digitalization of medical records, expansion of telemedicine services, and investment in healthcare infrastructure are steps in the right direction. However, continued commitment is needed to keep pace with technological advancements and to address the sector's pressing challenges. The government's support in creating an enabling environment for innovation will be key to unlocking the full potential of healthcare in Ghana. The need for technological innovation in Ghana’s healthcare Despite some progress, Ghana’s healthcare system still has a long way to go in fully leveraging the benefits of next-generation technology. The constant pressure to manage tight budgets often means that investment in technological innovation is delayed, leaving the sector trailing behind others. To bridge this gap, there must be a concerted effort to prioritize technology as a means of enhancing healthcare delivery. With the global shift towards digitalization, there is an urgent need for Ghana's healthcare providers to adopt innovative solutions that can streamline operations and improve patient outcomes. For instance, the increasing reliance on digital platforms for patient consultations, diagnostics, and treatment highlights the potential of technology to revolutionize healthcare delivery. However, achieving this requires strategic investment and a willingness to embrace new ways of working. Automating routine tasks to improve efficiency A key area where technology can significantly impact Ghana’s healthcare system is in the automation of routine tasks. For example, patients often endure long wait times when scheduling appointments or requesting repeat prescriptions, sometimes competing with those needing urgent medical care. Automating these processes through modern chatbots can alleviate these bottlenecks, allowing healthcare workers to focus on more critical tasks. Advanced chatbots and virtual assistants can guide patients through routine inquiries, offer appointment scheduling, and even provide basic medical advice, reducing the workload on frontline staff. For sensitive issues, patients may even prefer interacting with a machine, which offers privacy and reduces anxiety. These technologies, already common in the corporate world, must now be integrated into healthcare where they can make a significant difference. Leveraging technology for routine medical procedures Beyond administrative tasks, technology can also play a transformative role in routine medical procedures. Consider the process of monitoring patients’ vital signs, such as blood pressure. Currently, healthcare workers often need to manually call patients, record readings, and input data several times a day. Automating this process with smart devices can save time, reduce errors, and allow healthcare workers to focus on more skilled and patient-centric tasks. By integrating automated monitoring systems, healthcare providers can ensure that patient data is captured accurately and in real time, improving the overall quality of care. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also empowers healthcare workers, allowing them to concentrate on complex cases that require human judgment and expertise. Addressing language barriers with technology Ghana is a diverse country with over 80 languages spoken across its regions. Communication barriers in healthcare can significantly impact patient outcomes, especially in rural and underserved communities. Technology can play a critical role in bridging these gaps through intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) that utilize language engines to provide inclusive services in multiple languages. This capability ensures that all patients, regardless of their native tongue, can access care that is clear, understandable, and tailored to their needs. The government’s role in supporting technological adoption The Ghanaian government’s role extends beyond policy-making; it includes being a catalyst for technological adoption in healthcare. By investing in national health tech infrastructure, subsidizing the cost of digital tools for public health facilities, and fostering partnerships with private tech firms, the government can help accelerate the deployment of innovative solutions across the country. Collaboration between government bodies, tech innovators, and healthcare providers is essential to creating a sustainable healthcare ecosystem that is both modern and accessible. Through public-private partnerships, Ghana can leverage global expertise and best practices, ensuring that the country's healthcare system is equipped to meet the challenges of the future. The path forward: a modern, inclusive, and tech-driven healthcare system Technology alone will not solve all of Ghana’s healthcare challenges, but it is undoubtedly a critical part of the solution. By automating routine tasks, enhancing patient communication, and integrating smart technologies into everyday healthcare practices, Ghana can build a more efficient, inclusive, and patient-centered healthcare system. The government’s continued leadership in driving healthcare innovation, coupled with the adoption of advanced technologies, will position Ghana to not only improve healthcare outcomes but also set a benchmark for digital health transformation in Africa. The future of healthcare in Ghana lies in our ability to adapt, innovate, and invest in the technologies that will shape the sector for years to come.

Critics have said B.C.'s health administration is too bloated , with a gynecologist telling CBC News in October that the number of administrators at health authorities was not tenable. The province spent $347.5 million on health-care administration in the 2022-23 fiscal year, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information — nearly 50 per cent more than the province of Alberta, which has around four million residents to B.C.'s five million, and spent $181.2 million that same fiscal year. \"We made the commitment to review health authorities,\" Osborne told CBC News in an interview. \"And so we will be ... working with health authorities to look to those ways to cut administration.\" How the parties are proposing to fix B.C.'s health-care system B.C. ministry mandate letters focus on affordability, public safety, economic growth The health minister says work is just getting underway on her review, and stopped short of committing to a full reform of the health-care authority model, which sees five different authorities responsible for regional care. \"Regional health authorities have a really important role in understanding the context of the communities that they serve and the delivery of those services,\" she said. The two other health authorities in the province, the First Nations Health Authority and Provincial Health Services Authority, are responsible for improving care for First Nations people and co-ordinating provincewide care, respectively. The First Nations Health Authority is governed separately from the other authorities . B.C. Conservative Party finance critic Peter Milobar says B.C.'s health-care administration has more than 70 presidents and vice-presidents, while Alberta — which has around four million residents compared to B.C.'s five million — has f ewer than 10 . \"There's a massive growth that we're seeing in administration and bureaucracy, not just in health care but across government over the last seven years,\" he told CBC News. \"And so it's good to hear the premier recognizing that, but why they've refused to recognize that over the last six years, to get us in the fiscal mess that we're in right now, is a concern.\" B.C. Conservative finance critic Peter Milobar says the premier needs to quantify how big the cuts to health-care budgets will be. (Antonin Sturlese/Radio-Canada) The B.C. Greens, who signed a co-operation agreement with the NDP after the election, had previously pushed for a review of health-care authority expenditure. \"There are far too many [vice-presidents], managers and executives with amorphous job descriptions,\" the Greens say on their website . \"The health-care authority model needs to be examined for its effectiveness and streamlined to cut out wasted time and resources.\" Doctors ask for focus on primary care Those representing doctors in the province say a review of health-care administrative costs is welcome news, and that the province should turn its attention to primary care. Dr. Darren Joneson, president-elect of the B.C. Family Doctors group, says the NDP government has been making strides in solving a primary care shortage, particularly with a longitudinal doctor payment model introduced in 2023. The organization representing family doctors in B.C. has welcomed a new payment model, but says more needs to be done to ensure primary care coverage in the province. (Minerva Studio/Shutterstock) \"[It] has actually seen, you know, a net increase of 250,000 British Columbians being attached to a family doctor, being able to access that primary care,\" Joneson said of the new payment model. But the Chilliwack-based family doctor says the government should continue to prioritize setting up team-based primary care models in order to reduce administrative time for doctors. B.C. election comes at pivotal moment for health care: workers 700 more family physicians in B.C. since payment revamp: doctors Nurses ask for ratios to be implemented Adriane Gear, president of the B.C. Nurses' Union, says she welcomed the commitment in Osborne's mandate letter to implement minimum nurse-to-patient ratios , but wants more done to make existing nurses feel safer and healthier at work. \"We still need to recruit thousands of nurses to this province in order for us to be successful at implementing minimum nurse-patient ratios,\" she told CBC News. Adriane Gear, president of the B.C. Nurses' Union, says the province needs to step up nurse hiring efforts and ensure there are supports for internationally-trained nurses. (Ben Nelms/CBC) And Gear was critical of the ongoing practice of hiring private agency nurses , especially in rural B.C. where emergency room closures have led to \"travel nurses\" being brought in on a temporary basis. \"Where I'm really challenged is these for-profit companies that really are exploiting a situation, and have been charging exorbitant amounts to supply nurses in situations where, frankly, we're quite desperate,\" Gear said. 5 emergency rooms close in B.C. Interior over long weekend B.C. sets nurse-to-patient ratios for 6 areas of hospital care Osborne says having travel nurses being able to undertake locums has ensured emergency rooms are fully staffed. \"I think people understand that we need to take those steps to ensure that the services are there,\" she said. \"Ideally, of course, having locally hired nurses, people who are part of the community ... too is ideal and we'll continue to work toward that.\" Corrections An earlier version of this story, paraphrasing Peter Milobar, incorrectly said there are more than 70 vice-presidents working in health-care administration in B.C. and seven in Alberta. In fact, there are more than 70 presidents and vice-presidents in health-care administration in B.C., and fewer than 10 presidents and vice-presidents in Alberta. Mar 31, 2025 6:57 PM EDT A previous version of this story used an inaccurate number for the province's health-care administration costs in 2022.

I mean, usually you can tell when people are actually making changes, but it looks like they just keep recycling the terms that they’ve already given.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement When KOIN 6 News reached out to Providence, they declined to comment.

Chandra R Srikanth & Naina Sood January 19, 2025 / 21:54 IST Dr Shyam Bishen, Head, Centre for Health and Healthcare; Member of the Executive Committee, World Economic Forum India is poised to establish itself as a key global player in AI-driven healthcare, with innovations such as the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission offering scalable solutions that can be exported to other countries as well, particularly within the Global South, said Dr Shyam Bishen, head of the Centre for Health & Healthcare and member of the executive committee at the World Economic Forum (WEF). \"AI has huge potential to transform healthcare, and India plays a critical role here. The country has already begun working on this by leveraging AI to overhaul health systems. Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and the integration of healthcare accounts provide a strong foundation for private sector innovation,\" Dr Bishen explained. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad “These solutions can be scaled domestically and exported globally, especially to the Global South,” he added during an interview with Moneycontrol at WEF 2025 in Davos. Dr Shyam Bishen, Head of the Centre for Health & Healthcare and Member of the Executive Committee at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in conversation with Chandra R Srikanth, Deputy Executive Editor, Moneycontrol at WEF 2025 in Davos The senior healthcare executive pointed out that India’s ability to leverage AI to extend healthcare access to rural areas—particularly through telemedicine—demonstrates the country’s capability to address global healthcare challenges. He believes India’s experience in building digital public infrastructure serves as a model for other nations, enabling the leapfrogging of traditional healthcare systems.

To address this, the WEF’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) in Hyderabad, launched in February 2024, is collaborating with both the Indian government and the private sector to ensure high-quality, interoperable health data. \"AI is nothing without data, and while there’s no shortage of health data in India, access to good-quality, interoperable data remains a challenge. We are actively working to solve this,\" he noted. India’s vast health data is seen as an asset in creating AI solutions that can improve healthcare delivery, not just domestically but on a global scale, particularly in resource-constrained settings. India’s AI-driven healthcare initiatives are not confined to its own borders. Dr Bishen shared that India is working on a global initiative to scale successful AI applications and export them worldwide. “Our Centre (in Hyderabad) runs the digital healthcare transformation program, where we’re launching activators in India and other regions. India will be one of the key launchpads, collaborating with both the government and the private sector to scale successful AI solutions,” he explained. “The goal is not only to scale these solutions but to ensure they can be adapted and implemented globally, bringing together a global exchange of ideas and initiatives.” In this global push, the focus is on building local healthcare ecosystems that can pilot, scale, and eventually expand successful solutions to other regions, furthering AI’s role in transforming healthcare worldwide. Preparing for next pandemic During the interview, Dr Bishen emphasised the growing threat of future pandemics due to climate change, stating, “New pathogens, new viruses, will become a part of our living on this planet.” He stressed the need for global healthcare systems to be well-prepared, ensuring access to primary care, healthcare products, and services across countries. He highlighted the WEF's efforts to launch initiatives like the Bridge disease intelligence initiative, which focuses on global pathogen surveillance and data sharing, and the regional vaccine manufacturing initiative to improve vaccine access, particularly in regions like Africa. \"We need to bring both public and private sectors together to solve these challenges and prepare health systems for what's coming,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news GLP-1s and Brian Thompson's killing loom large at top health-care conference By Ashley Capoot,CNBC • Published January 18, 2025 • Updated on January 19, 2025 at 9:44 am BOOKMARKER Reuters Thousands of health-care executives descended on JPMorgan's annual health-care conference in San Francisco this week. The conference took place a month after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot in New York City. Artificial intelligence, president-elect Donald Trump and weight loss drugs were popular topics of discussion. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) during the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024. San Francisco, famed for its abundance of hoodie-clad tech workers, was overrun by thousands of executives in suits this week for JPMorgan 's annual health-care conference . Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Leaders from major health systems, venture capital firms and companies around the globe clustered in hotel lobbies to talk business and strategy for 2025. The sunny skies were a welcome reprieve from the downpours of years past, but other absences were harder to ignore. This year's conference, colloquially known as JPM, took place a month after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot in New York City. The news was welcomed by Americans with numerous social media posts expressing resentment toward the health-care industry , with many sharing stories about their negative experiences with insurers. Courtesy: UnitedHealth Group Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare. More than 10 companies, including Cigna and Walgreens , subsequently pulled their appearances at JPM, according to CNBC's analysis of the conference agenda. There was a noticeably large police presence at the conference's main venue, the Westin St. Francis Hotel, and many companies beefed up security at their private events and parties. \"The subterranean topic that I think people are talking about around the water and the cocktails is obviously what happened to the UnitedHealthcare CEO,\" said Wei-Li Shao, president of metabolic health startup Omada. \"What does that mean for health-care? What transformation should occur? And how do things get more responsible?\" Thompson's murder was a \"stunning, sad event\" that has served as a wake up call for the health-care industry, said Erik Wexler, CEO of the nonprofit health system Providence, which is made up of 51 hospitals and 1,000 clinics across seven states. \"Why are we on a separate pathway here? Why are we fighting?\" Wexler said. \"Our job is to do good for people who desperately need us at the most important time of their lives, whether you're the payer or you're the hospital.\" While Thompson's death loomed large over the conference, there was also palpable excitement and buzz about 2025. There was no shortage of discussions about the potential benefits of artificial intelligence and the blockbuster weight loss drugs called GLP-1s, and investors seem cautiously optimistic that the digital health market could turn a corner. Kevin Mohatt | The Washington Post | Getty Images Containers of Ozempic and Wegovy seen at Children's Hospital in Aurora, CO, Nov. 18, 2024. \"There are so many amazing things on the horizon for health-care,\" said Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer. \"Drug companies and companies like ours, we try real hard to improve people's lives, and we make a huge difference,\" said Sayer, who knew Thompson well. \"Be a little optimistic and give us a bit of a break, we're all trying to do good stuff.\" Here are CNBC's big takeaways from JPM 2025: Generative AI stole the show Generative AI was undoubtedly health-care's \"it girl\" of 2024, and that seems unlikely to change in 2025. Health systems in the U.S. are struggling to contend with burnout, staffing shortages and razor thin margins, so companies are racing to develop AI tools that can streamline some of the industry's more tedious administrative tasks. The subject was practically impossible to avoid at JPM. For instance, health-care payments company Waystar announced a new generative AI feature that aims to help doctors quickly fight insurance denials by automatically drafting appeal letters. Amazon Web Services and the venture firm General Catalyst announced a new partnership that aims to speed up the development and deployment of health-care AI tools. Health-care startup Abridge announced Mayo Clinic will roll out its AI-powered clinical documentation technology to around 2,000 clinicians across the entire enterprise. \"At the highest level, I don't think it can be understated how much impact AI is already creating in health-care,\" said Dr. Shiv Rao, founder and CEO of Abridge. \"At least in our segment, the feedback that we get on a daily basis is just incredible, and the adoption rate demonstrates that this is a real thing.\" Nvidia , which makes the hardware that powers AI applications, was a particularly popular attendee at JPM this year. The company announced partnerships with several health-care organizations including the clinical research provider IQVIA , neurotech startup Synchron, genomics company Illumina and academic medical center Mayo Clinic.

(Photo Illustration by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \"We're well over a billion dollar business between direct revenue and revenue with our partners,\" said Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health-care. She added that Nvidia sees more room for growth for AI health-care applications. Executives are bullish on GLP-1s At presentations and cocktail parties this week, CNBC spoke with executives who marveled about the benefits of the booming class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s. Novo Nordisk's and Eli Lilly's diabetes and obesity treatments have been wildly successful at helping patients lose weight in recent years. A May study found that patients taking Novo 's obesity drug Wegovy maintained an average of 10% weight loss for up to four years, for instance. Research shows that GLP-1s could also help treat cardiometabolic disease, kidney disease and addiction, among other conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound as a treatment for sleep apnea in December. Some analysts estimate that anti-obesity medications could grow into a $100 billion industry by the end of the decade. \"These drugs are remarkable, and they're not going away,\" Dexcom's Sayer said. Supply shortages are one of the big hurdles for companies in the market, as soaring demand has made it difficult for many patients to access the treatments. The drugs typically cost $1,000 per month without insurance, and coverage still varies for many Americans. Even so, many health-care executives are optimistic that GLP-1s will meaningfully improve public health in the U.S. \"I have been joking, it's been the two G's, right? It's like, GLP, GPT,\" Omada CEO Sean Duffy said. Uncertainty around the Trump administration Jeenah Moon | Reuters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks after a meeting with Republicans in Congress at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington on Jan. 8, 2025. Ahead of President-elect Donald Trump 's Monday inauguration, executives at JPM had many unanswered questions about what his administration has in store for the health-care sector. Health-care was not a big focus for Trump on the campaign trail, which means his policy aims for the industry are murky. Additionally, he's made some controversial cabinet picks since the election. Trump nominated vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, celebrity TV host Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and pancreatic surgeon Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration. All three nominees still need Senate confirmation. \"Until we have a little bit more visibility into this administration that's coming in in the U.S., the market is going to be volatile and somewhat more depressed,\" Rebecca Stevenson, HSBC's head of health-care investment banking for the Americas, told reporters during a roundtable. Owen Tripp, the CEO of the virtual care platform Included Health, said the Trump administration appears to be business friendly and has suggested it will push for increased access to care. \"It's not even so much who's in the White House, but actually the fact that you've got a Republican Congress and Senate that have on principle aligned with expanding access and transparency,\" Tripp said. \"I think you're going to see more transparency on drug pricing and health care pricing too, which is also hugely positive.\" Watch: UnitedHealthcare tragedy is a wakeup call for corporate America, says Wharton’s Americus Reed Also on CNBC TikTok creators post farewell videos to their fans ahead of expected U.S. ban TikTok says it will go dark on Sunday unless Biden intervenes Crypto firm Digital Currency Group to pay SEC $38.5 million for misleading investors Subscribe to the CNBC YouTube Channel Morning Squawk Newsletter Copyright CNBC This article tagged under: news"

    "article_text": "January 17, 2025 DOJ’s False Claims Act Recoveries Top $2.9 Billion in FY 2024, but Health Care Numbers Dip—What Could FY 2025 Hold for Health Care Enforcement? George Breen , Daniel Fundakowski Epstein Becker & Green + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: On January 15, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a press release announcing its fiscal year (FY) 2024 False Claims Act (FCA) recoveries and reported that settlements and judgments exceeded $2.9 billion in 2024 —up from $2.68 billion in FY 2023 . Recoveries from entities in the health care and life sciences industries continue to represent the lion’s share of the dollars. However, health care recoveries have dropped year over year, and 2024 saw a decrease in the number of cases pursued by the DOJ on its own. What does the future hold as we look forward to a new administration? History might provide some interesting guidance. Overview of the Statistics While the 423 FCA cases filed by the DOJ in FY 2024 represented a marked decrease from the 505 FCA cases filed the previous year, FY 2024 saw the highest number of qui tam actions filed in history. FY 2024, coincidentally, ended on the same day (September 30, 2024) that a Florida judge ruled in U.S. ex rel. Zafirov v. Florida Medical Associates that the qui tam provisions of the FCA were unconstitutional. Qui tam relators, or whistleblowers, filed 979 suits in FY 2024, up from 713 in FY 2023 and eclipsing the prior record of 757 filings set in FY 2013. Whistleblower and DOJ cases combined resulted in 558 settlements and judgments, on par with 566 last year. Counting the $2.9 billion recovered in FY 2024, total recoveries under the FCA since the 1986 amendments now exceed $78 billion and have exceeded $2 billion annually for 16 consecutive years. Health Care Statistics While several of the health care statistics dipped slightly, recoveries from the health care sector remained steady at $1.68 billion (compared to $1.86 billion in FY 2023) and drove the overall FCA recovery figures. While the FCA statistics show overall increases in total fraud recoveries and the number of cases filed by whistleblowers in FY 2024, the health care statistics portray a slightly different picture. While more health care cases were filed by relators in FY 2024 than in FY 2023, the number of cases brought by the DOJ, on its own, dropped by more than 10 percent compared to FY 2023. Other health care statistics that dropped in FY 2024 compared to FY 2023 included: total health care fraud recoveries, recoveries in cases pursued by the government, recoveries in cases in which the government intervened, and recoveries in cases where relators pursued matters on their own. In DOJ’s press release announcing the FCA recoveries, the agency reaffirmed its commitment to enforcement in the health care sector, highlighting key recoveries in the following areas: health care entities contributing to the opioid crisis; providers billing federal health care programs for medically unnecessary services and substandard care; cases alleging false claims in the Medicare Advantage program; matters involving unlawful kickbacks and Stark Law violations; pandemic-related fraud (including cases involving improper payments under the Paycheck Protection Program and alleged fraud affecting Medicare and other federal health care programs for services related to COVID-19 testing and treatment); and cybersecurity enforcement and holding contractors accountable for compliance with applicable cybersecurity requirements (one example was a case against the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia Tech Research Corp., which we covered in an earlier blog post ) . What to Expect in FY 2025 As a general matter, the FY 2024 statistics demonstrate that FCA enforcement continued to be a top DOJ priority, particularly within the health care sector. As we look ahead to the incoming Trump administration, it is noteworthy that the first Trump administration saw almost 370 more health care FCA cases brought by relators than those filed during the Biden administration. The first Trump administration also saw the highest number of health care-related FCA cases brought in a single year by the DOJ. History would suggest a continued focus on health-care related FCA enforcement during President Trump’s second term. Epstein Becker Green Attorney Ann W.

    "article_text": "SHARE The Governor of Kogi State, Ahmed Ododo, has unveiled reforms aimed at revolutionising the state’s primary healthcare system to deliver high-quality and accessible health services. Speaking at a stakeholders’ engagement on primary healthcare revitalization held in Lokoja, Governor Ododo, represented by his Deputy, Comrade Joel Salifu, announced the introduction of periodic spot checks on all Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) across the state. This initiative, led by the Primary Healthcare Task Force in collaboration with local government authorities and traditional rulers, is designed to ensure accountability, enhance coordination, and elevate the standard of services provided by PHCs. Reaffirming his administration’s commitment to improving healthcare services, Governor Ododo highlighted the critical role of PHCs in reducing maternal and infant mortality rates, boosting immunization coverage, and raising awareness about the importance of primary healthcare in the state’s healthcare value chain. “Our administration is determined to address the challenges in the primary healthcare system and ensure better health outcomes for our citizens. This will be achieved through improved data collection and adherence to best practices in case management across all PHCs,” the Governor stated. Governor Ododo also expressed profound gratitude to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his unwavering support for healthcare reforms across the country, emphasizing that such backing has been instrumental in driving the state’s efforts. Earlier in the event, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Abdulazeez Adams, emphasized the significance of collaboration among stakeholders in sustaining healthcare initiatives. He revealed that at least one PHC in each of the state’s 239 wards is currently operational and supported by funding, with plans underway to increase the number of fully functional PHCs across all wards. In his remarks, the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, His Royal Majesty, Ahmed Tijani Muhammed Anaje, commended the Ministry of Health for its relentless efforts to improve primary healthcare delivery. He pledged the continued support of traditional rulers in monitoring and supervising PHCs to maintain service delivery standards.

Kemp's new proposal, Medicaid coverage expands to cover parents and legal guardians in households with incomes at or below the federal poverty level who have children, 6 years of age and younger. Yet, when asked, the governor said he doesn't support Medicaid expansion. The Brief Gov. Kemp's healthcare proposal aims to expand the Georgia Pathways program to include Medicaid coverage for parents and legal guardians with young children in low-income households. The plan includes additional coverage for eligible new mothers beyond the one-year post-partum period and introduces coverage for eligible new fathers at childbirth. Nearly $4 million is allocated for enhancing Maternal Health Services under the new proposal. ATLANTA - Gov. Brian Kemp unveiled his health care proposals for the upcoming legislative session on Wednesday. Georgia Pathways provides Medicaid coverage to low-income adults in Georgia. Health care in Georgia The backstory: Gov. Kemp has introduced a series of health care proposals aimed at improving access to medical services in Georgia. These proposals are set to be discussed in the upcoming legislative session. The focus of Kemp's plan is to expand the Georgia Pathways program, which currently provides Medicaid coverage to low-income adults in the state. Gov. Brian Kemp unveils his health care plan during a press conference at the Georgia Capitol on Jan. 15, 2025. (FOX 5) Georigia Pathways future What we know: Under the new plan, eligibility for the Georgia Pathways program will be expanded to include parents and legal guardians in households with incomes at or below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level, specifically those with children up to six years of age. Additionally, the plan proposes to extend coverage for eligible new mothers beyond their one-year post-partum period and to offer previously unavailable coverage to eligible new fathers upon the birth of their child. The proposal also includes an allocation of nearly $4 million in additional funding for Maternal Health Services. Kemp's heath care proposals What they're saying: Gov. Kemp emphasized that his initiatives are designed to ensure that Georgians have access to quality health care across the state and to address the issue of maternal mortality rates in Georgia. On the other hand, House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley highlighted that while Medicaid expansion remains a top priority for Democrats, they are also advocating for legislation that will broaden health care access and increase the number of medical personnel statewide. Despite these calls, Governor Kemp remains opposed to full Medicaid expansion. House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, D-Columbus, responds to Gov. Brian Kemp’s health care proposal on Jan. 15, 2025. (FOX 5) Medicaid expansion in Georgia? What's next: As the legislative session approaches, the debate over health care access and Medicaid expansion is expected to intensify. Governor Kemp's proposals will be scrutinized and discussed, with potential amendments and counter-proposals likely to emerge from both sides of the political aisle. The outcome of these discussions will have significant implications for health care access and quality in Georgia.

    "article_text": "Change Healthcare, the UnitedHealth-owned health tech company that lost more than 100 million people’s sensitive health data in a ransomware attack last year, said on Tuesday that the company has “substantially” completed notifying affected individuals about the massive data breach. The February 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, one of the biggest processors of patient billing in the United States, resulted in months-long outages that disrupted care across the U.S. healthcare system. The data breach also became the largest known theft of medical data in U.S. history . Change Healthcare paid the hackers a ransom with the aim of preventing them from publishing any more of the stolen data, and in exchange, obtained a copy of the stolen data to begin notifying people whose information was taken. In an update to its data breach notice on its website on Tuesday, Change Healthcare said it has “notified its impacted customers” for whom the company has a postal address on file. The healthcare giant said it “may not have sufficient addresses for all potentially impacted individuals,” and that the website notice was to “provide customers and individuals with information about the criminal cyberattack.” But if you search the web for the Change Healthcare data breach notice, you’re unlikely to find the web page in search engine results. TechCrunch’s review of the breach notice’s web page source code reveals Change Healthcare included hidden “noindex” code on the notice, which tells search engines to ignore the web page, making it more difficult for anyone searching the web for the notice to find it in search results. Change Healthcare had been including the “noindex” code on its data breach notice since at least November 20, 2024 . It’s unclear why Change Healthcare hid the page from search engines. UnitedHealth spokesperson Tyler Mason did not comment on the reason why Change Healthcare included the code to hide the data breach notice. When asked, the spokesperson was unable to provide a specific number of individuals that Change Healthcare had notified of the breach beyond the estimated 100 million number shared with the U.S. government’s health department in October 2024. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, which oversees federal investigations of data breaches involving protected health information, did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. Change Healthcare has been criticized for being slow to notify affected individuals of the breach — the company only started to do so four months after it had received a copy of the stolen files. The delay in public disclosure prompted several U.S. states, including California , Massachusetts , Nebraska and New Hampshire , to intervene by notifying residents to stay alert to identity theft and fraud following the data breach. In December 2024, Nebraska brought legal action against Change Healthcare for a string of security failings that led to the breach. The state’s attorney general, Mike Hilgers, said Change Healthcare’s lack of adequate notice to affected individuals left the state’s citizens “more vulnerable to exploitation of the sensitive personal financial, health, and identifying information.” Corrected link to California’s notice in eighth paragraph."

    "article_text": "Jan. 14, 2025, 11:34 AM EST / Source : CNBC By Greg Iacurci, CNBC The health sector holds many of the best job opportunities for workers in 2025, due to factors like high labor demand and pay, according to a new ranking from job search site Indeed. Health care roles account for six of the top 25 jobs for 2025, according to Indeed: veterinarian ( ranked No. 1 ), physician (No. 3), clinical psychologist (No. 8), radiologist (No. 14), registered nurse (No. 18) and director of clinical services (No. 22). That’s the highest share of top jobs relative to other sectors, and the second year in a row health care dominated the list. Indeed’s analysis looked at professions that met three criteria: a minimum salary of $75,000 per year, growth of at least 20% in postings on the site over the last three years and offerings of remote or hybrid roles for at least 5% of postings. The jobs are ranked by their share of postings on Indeed. Health care has seen “extremely, extremely rapid” job growth, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “It is just relentless,” Pollak said. “It’s extremely robust and consistent, and we don’t see any slowdown at all.” The U.S. economy added 902,000 health care and social assistance jobs in 2024 — more than double the closest competing segment, government, which added 480,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Total employment in health care occupations is “projected to grow much faster than the average” for all U.S. jobs from 2023 to 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ample job opportunity in the sector stems from many factors, said Jennifer Herrity, a career expert at Indeed. For example, an aging U.S. population increases the need for health care; retirements among workers in the health field have created shortages in some roles; and health care jobs are at a lower risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence than those in other industries like software developers and engineers, Herrity said. 'Surprisingly high' salaries, high barrier to entry Strong labor demand has contributed to many health care jobs being “surprisingly high paying,” Pollak said. For example, radiologists earn a median annual salary of about $385,000, the top-paying job on Indeed’s list. The typical physician earns $225,000 a year, the second-highest salary of the bunch. “High salaries and a history of stability make health care a highly attractive field, albeit with a high barrier to entry, especially for roles like radiology, which require a minimum of 13 years of school,” Indeed wrote about its 2025 list. The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump may bring a shake-up to the health care sector, though. For example, Trump and Republican allies may cut federal spending for Medicaid or allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire to raise money for other policy priorities like tax cuts, which could lower health care demand. Conversely, mass deportations could exacerbate labor shortages and lead to higher pay. Immigrants accounted for 18% of health care workers in 2021, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Job seekers hoping to “cash in on high-paying and fast-growing jobs without a long-term investment in education” can perhaps look outside the health sector, in an occupation such as a sales representative, Indeed said. Many companies hiring sales reps may consider applicants with a high school diploma and the right mix of skills, it said. Sales reps make a $182,000 median annual salary, according to Indeed.

    "article_text": "Healthcare Industry seeks tax cuts on insurance premiums & increased budgetary allocation in Budget 2025 ANI | Updated: Jan 14, 2025 11:44 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [India], January 14 (ANI): Ahead to the Union Budget 2025, industry stakeholders are expecting reforms that will propel the healthcare sector. The industry want increased government support to address critical challenges in the sector. From boosting healthcare expenditure to expanding public health initiatives, the industry has put forth several demands. Aman Puri, Founder of Steadfast Nutrition, urged the government to increase healthcare spending to 2.5-3 per cent of GDP, aligning with global averages. India's healthcare expenditure has stagnated at 1.5-2.1 per cent of GDP in recent years, resulting in inadequate infrastructure and poor health outcomes. Puri emphasized the need to strengthen primary and secondary healthcare systems, particularly in rural areas and tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which house a significant portion of the population. He also called for greater investment in preventive healthcare, which currently receives only 14 per cent of government funds. Dr. Smeet Patel, Director of Mayflower Women's Hospital in Ahmedabad, emphasized the need for reduced taxation on health insurance, especially as premiums tend to be higher for women due to their specific healthcare needs. He advocated for expanding initiatives to combat cervical cancer, pointing out that the HPV vaccine can reduce the incidence of the disease by nearly 90 per cent, particularly if administered at a younger age. He added \"We also anticipate the Indian Government to launch more public awareness campaigns and improve access to resources for patients affected by these conditions\". Suresh Garg, Founder of Zeon LifeSciences, highlighted the need for tax uniformity in the healthcare sector, along with provisions for research, innovation, and export incentives. With the Indian nutraceutical market expected to grow significantly, these measures can enhance global competitiveness and drive sector growth. He said \"Our expectations from the government are to prioritize policies that not only unlock the immense potential of the healthcare industry but also ensure long-term sustainability, inclusivity, and global recognition\". Anshul Khurana, Co-founder of Entitled Solutions, stressed the need for targeted healthcare policies for urban low-income households that often fall outside existing welfare schemes. \"Incentivizing standard health coverage plans, and expanding the Ayushman Bharat program to include these households could ensure better access to essential healthcare\" he added. Overall, the healthcare industry hopes the government will address these pressing concerns in the upcoming Budget to ensure a healthier, more equitable, and globally competitive healthcare system.

To achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030, experts are pushing for a significant rise in public healthcare spending, innovative funding models and policies that ensure access to quality care particularly in rural areas. Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google Representative Image- FP As the Union Budget approaches, the healthcare sector raises concerns and outlines critical expectations to address systemic challenges. Leaders from major healthcare institutions call for comprehensive reforms and substantial investments to ensure equitable and affordable healthcare for all. Although India’s out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure has decreased from 64.2% in 2013-14 to 39.4% in 2021-22, according to the National Health Accounts Estimates, achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) remains a difficult task. While public healthcare spending has risen from 1.13% to 1.84% of GDP during the same period, experts argue that this is still far from the goal of 3% by 2030. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “We expect a clear roadmap to increase public healthcare spending. Strategic investments coupled with supportive policies can bridge the rural-urban divide and ensure access to critical care, especially in underserved regions,” said Dr. Praveen Gupta, Principal Director & Chief of Neurology at Fortis Hospital. He said that a holistic approach involving all stakeholders is essential to ensure healthcare reaches every corner of the country.

Experts recommend innovative funding mechanisms such as a “Fund of Funds,” public-private partnership (PPP) models, and the creation of healthcare-specific business trusts like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). “Tailored funding mechanisms can drive innovation and expand infrastructure to meet the growing demands of our population,” said Dr. Gupta**.** One of the primary expectations from the upcoming budget is tax reforms. Industry leaders and experts are advocating for zero-rating GST on healthcare services or rationalizing it to a 5% slab, which can significantly reduce costs for hospitals and nursing homes.

Such measures will ease the financial burden on healthcare providers and ensure that cost savings are passed on to patients, making healthcare more affordable,” said Dr. Aashish Chaudhry, Managing Director at Aakash Healthcare. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD India’s healthcare sector stands at a crossroads, with immense potential to transform its delivery systems. A sizeable investment in infrastructure, rational policies, and increased collaboration between stakeholders are vital to achieving the ambitious goal of Healthcare for All by 2030. Health sector experts believe the Union Budget offers a unique opportunity to address these challenges and lay the groundwork for a sustainable and inclusive healthcare system. “This is the time for decisive action. By prioritising funding, accessibility, and innovation, the government can make healthcare accessible, affordable, and equitable for all citizens,” Dr. Chaudhry added. Anup Mehra, DGM Finance at PSRI Hospital said “Reclassifying hospitals as infrastructure can open up avenues for long-term investments, enabling the sector to expand capacity and improve service delivery.” The sector also seeks government support to address the acute shortage of healthcare professionals and critical care facilities in rural and semi-urban areas. While 70% of the population resides in rural India, 80% of specialists are concentrated in urban centers. This disparity, coupled with a shortage of advanced medical equipment in smaller towns is a major hurdle in providing quality care. Bridging this gap requires collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “The government must create incentives to attract skilled professionals to underserved areas and invest in building comprehensive healthcare ecosystems,” Mr Mehra added. India’s Tier II and Tier III cities continue to be underserved in terms of healthcare infrastructure, emphasizing an urgent need to expand private healthcare facilities in these areas. The Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY scheme, designed to improve healthcare access, has led to increased demand in smaller cities. However, the scheme’s existing pricing models do not accurately capture the true cost of service delivery, putting healthcare providers in a financially challenging position. “Rationalising package pricing and providing operational subsidies for power and utilities, akin to those offered to government hospitals, can ease this burden. Without equitable pricing models and relief on operational costs, healthcare providers cannot sustain operations in these regions,” said Dr. Rajendra Patankar, Chief Executive Officer, of Jupiter Hospital, Baner Pune**.** The rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) poses another significant challenge. By 2030, NCDs are projected to cost India $6 trillion, making comprehensive screening and diagnostics programs an urgent priority. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Dr. Aakaar Kapoor, CEO of City X-Ray, stressed the importance of these programs, stating, “Early detection can reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Incentives like tax exemptions for diagnostic centers and lower import duties on equipment are necessary to make this vision a reality.” India also has tremendous potential in medical value travel (MVT), but current policies do not fully support this burgeoning sector. “Introducing tax exemptions for earnings from medical tourism and streamlining visa processes for international patients can make India a global hub for healthcare services. India’s medical expertise and cost advantage are unmatched, but policy reforms in medical visas and rationalizing fees are essential to attract more patients,” said Dr. N. K. Pandey, Chairman and Managing Director of Asian Hospital. Manun Thakur, Founder & CEO of Veda Rehabilitation and Wellness said that investing in mental health is crucial for not only enhancing productivity but enhancing overall happiness across sectors as it is causing Indian companies a loss of over $14 Billion (INR 1,19,000 crores) annually. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “The Union Budget for 2024-25 allocated approximately ₹90,659 crore to the healthcare sector, a modest increase of 2% from the previous fiscal year. However, only about 1% of this allocation is dedicated to mental health initiatives, with ₹850 crore for the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), ₹60 crore for the Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, and ₹90 crore for the National Tele-Mental Health Programme (TELE Manas). Despite these allocations, there is a pressing need for increased funding and awareness, especially regarding postpartum depression. Reports indicate that around 22% of new mothers in India suffer from postpartum depression, yet many remain unaware of their condition,” he said. He also suggested that by dedicating more resources to mental health services and launching focused awareness campaigns about conditions like postpartum depression, the government can drastically enhance national well-being. Another critical demand is the reclassification of hospitals as infrastructure investments. This move can attract substantial private sector participation, essential for building state-of-the-art healthcare facilities. Coupled with interest rate subvention for medical equipment, these reforms can provide the financial impetus needed to modernise India’s healthcare sector, said Mr Thakur. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Healthcare leaders and experts also stressed the importance of insurance reforms. Despite schemes like Ayushman Bharat, insurance penetration remains low, leaving many households vulnerable to catastrophic health expenses. Implementing mandatory health insurance for all citizens and gradually extending coverage to self-employed professionals can make healthcare more equitable.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Mary O'Connell January 8, 2025 2 min read UPS UPS ( NYSE: UPS ) has completed an acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, a leader in health care logistics solutions across Europe. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. In a news release , the company said it is looking to enhance the end-to-end capabilities for UPS Healthcare customers, which have seen rising demand for temperature-controlled and time-cricial logistics solutions on a global scale. “Frigo-Trans’ network includes temperature-controlled warehousing ranging from cryopreservation (-196°C) to ambient (+15° to +25°C) as well as Pan-European cold chain transportation. This combined with the logistics solutions brought by BPL’s time-critical freight forwarding capabilities further enhances UPS Healthcare solutions for customers in Europe,” said the company. Known for its small package business, UPS has been consistently investing in the health care sector. By the end of 2023, UPS Healthcare was a $10 billion business , accounting for one-tenth of total revenue. The company aims to double that number by 2026, primarily through acquisitions and new ventures. “The fast-paced innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is creating the need to have more integrated cold and frozen supply chains,” said Kate Gutmann, UPS EVP and president of international, health care and supply chain solutions. “Frigo-Trans will help deepen our portfolio of solutions for our customers and accelerate our journey to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world addressing their needs.” The health care industry is less subject to economic cycles and more focused on the progression and development of the industry as a whole. According to McKinsey and Co , “healthcare profit pools will grow at a 7 percent CAGR, from $583 billion in 2022 to $819 billion in 2027.” Health care is moving toward a more personalized model with an emphasis on convenience to the patient. Gutmann said in March at the 2024 Investor and Analyst Day presentation , “the health care logistics market is a major strategic move for UPS because the demand of health care is growing, and health care companies of all sizes are rapidly innovating to keep pace with the needs of an aging population and problems related to chronic disease. For example, new medical devices, especially ones suitable for home use, are on the rise.” UPS is specifically targeting cold chain, clinical advanced therapies, labs and diagnostics, pharma, home health care, and medical devices – essentially products or lab samples that are time- and temperature-sensitive.

In November 2023, Alberta’s government announced plans to refocus the health care system to strengthen services, empower local decision-making, enhance support for front-line workers and improve health outcomes for all Albertans. Throughout this process, the government has held in-person public sessions and used online tools to help gather feedback and input on the new system from Albertans and health care providers. Alberta’s government is committed to using the insights and experiences of Albertans to shape the new system, and will be holding a second round of engagement, including in-person public sessions, beginning Jan. 21. In addition to updating Albertans on the latest refocusing work and what it means for them, these sessions will gather perspectives on access to health care and the current experiences of the health care workforce, and identify opportunities to improve local decision-making. “From the very start, we have been committed to building a health care system that works for every Albertan. By continuing the conversation, we are ensuring that their experiences, perspectives and expertise are reflected in our decision-making.” Starting this month, all Albertans are invited to participate in one of the in-person engagement sessions being held across the province. The schedule can be found online and registration for the sessions is now open on alberta.ca. The findings from the first sessions, summarized in the What We Heard report, have helped guide the design and implementation of the refocused health care system. Findings from the second round of engagements will further inform this work. Since the first round of engagements, Alberta’s government has launched the provincial health agencies Recovery Alberta and Primary Care Alberta, announced Acute Care Alberta, implemented legislative amendments to support the transition to the new system and continues work to establish an assisted living provincial health agency and regional advisory councils. Albertans interested in keeping up to date on health care system refocusing and engagement opportunities can also sign up for an e-newsletter. Quick facts The initial round of engagements, held between January and June 2024, featured 65 in-person public sessions held across the province. Almost 3,000 Albertans, health care workers, patients and caregivers participated in these sessions.

En novembre 2023, le gouvernement de l’Alberta a annoncé son intention de recentrer le système de soins de santé afin de renforcer les services, de promouvoir la prise de décision locale, d’offrir un meilleur soutien aux travailleurs de première ligne et d’améliorer les résultats en matière de santé pour toutes les Albertaines et tous les Albertains. Tout au long de ce processus, le gouvernement a tenu des séances publiques en personne et utilisé des outils en ligne pour aider à recueillir les commentaires et les suggestions de la population albertaine et des fournisseurs de soins de santé sur le nouveau système. Le gouvernement de l’Alberta s’engage à utiliser les connaissances et les expériences des Albertaines et des Albertains pour façonner le nouveau système. À partir du 21 janvier, une deuxième série de consultations, incluant des séances publiques en personne, sera organisée. En plus d’informer la population albertaine des derniers travaux de recentrage et de leur impact, ces séances permettront de recueillir des points de vue sur l’accès aux soins de santé et les expériences actuelles des professionnels de la santé, et d’identifier les occasions d’améliorer le pouvoir de décision au niveau local. « Depuis le début, nous nous sommes engagés à bâtir un système de santé qui répond aux besoins de toutes les Albertaines et de tous les Albertains. En poursuivant le dialogue, nous veillons à ce que leurs expériences, leurs perspectives et leur expertise soient reflétées dans nos décisions. » Dès ce mois-ci, on invite toutes les Albertaines et tous les Albertains à participer à l’une des séances de consultation en personne qui se déroulent dans toute la province. L’horaire est disponible en ligne et l’inscription aux séances est maintenant ouverte sur le site alberta.ca. Les conclusions des premières séances, résumées dans le rapport « Ce que nous avons entendu », ont aidé à orienter la conception et la mise en œuvre du système de santé recentré. Les résultats de la deuxième série de consultations permettront d’éclairer davantage ce travail. Depuis la première série de consultations, le gouvernement de l’Alberta a lancé les agences provinciales de santé Recovery Alberta et Primary Care Alberta, a annoncé Acute Care Alberta, a mis en œuvre des modifications législatives pour soutenir la transition vers le nouveau système, et continue de travailler à l’établissement d’une agence provinciale de santé pour le logement avec assistance ainsi que de conseils consultatifs régionaux. Les Albertaines et les Albertains intréressés à se tenir au courant des nouvelles perspectives de recentrage du système de soins de santé et des possibilités de participation peuvent également s’inscrire à un bulletin électronique. Faits en bref La première série de consultations, qui s’est déroulée entre janvier et juin 2024, comprenait 65 séances publiques en personne organisées à travers la province. Près de 3 000 Albertaines et Albertains, professionnels de la santé, patients et soignants ont pris part à ces séances. Plus de 18 000 personnes ont également fait part de leurs commentaires par l'intermédiaire d'outils en ligne et près de 10 000 personnes ont pris part à des assemblées générales virtuelles. En plus des séances de consultation publique, des consultations dédiées ont eu lieu avec les communautés autochtones, la communauté francophone et d’autres partenaires clés de la santé.

Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser subscriber? Log in now to continue reading. Get unlimited access From as low as $12.95 /mo. Subscribe Now Hawaii continues to suffer from a serious shortage of health care workers, according to the latest findings from the Healthcare Association of Hawaii. The 2024 Hawaii Healthcare Workforce Initiative report , published every two years by the nonprofit trade group, noted some easing of shortages for some categories, but found the state short of more than 4,600 health care workers in 94 professions. Overall, the state experienced a job vacancy rate of 14% for health care workers, down from 17% in 2022. In 2019, when the first report came out, unfilled positions represented 10% of total health care positions in the state. “The health care workforce initiatives are showing tangible success,” said Hilton Raethel, HAH president and CEO. “There’s still more to be done in health care, education and training efforts across the state in order for our industry to meet the growing health care needs in Hawaii, and as Hawaii’s population ages, there will continue to be a greater demand for medical serv­ices in the health care environment.” The greatest needs still persist in nursing, entry-­level positions and imaging. Hawaii is short of more than 1,000 registered nurses, along with more than 1,000 entry-level positions such as certified nurse aides, and nursing and medical assistants.

Nursing professions combined overall show a vacancy rate that is about 11% down from 2022. For entry-­level professions, however, the rate is 8% higher than two years prior. The state is also experiencing a growing shortage of imaging technologists, in particular, CT, mammography and ultrasound techs. “We’re using more of them, and it’s creating a growing concern among health care employers,” said Raethel, who estimated the need for imaging techs to have increased by close to 40% from 2022. “There’s a national demand, so we’re competing against the rest of the country.” One glaring gap is a lack of training programs in Hawaii available to certify these technicians. Many aspiring technicians have to go to the U.S. mainland to undergo several years of training, and consequently, might not return to work in Hawaii. The goal of the reports is to better match supply with demand, he said, and identifying where the greatest demand is to meet it. The 2019 report, for instance, documented the lack of physical or occupational therapy programs available in Hawaii. Now, Hawaii Pacific University has stepped up to offer these training programs. Raethel said he hopes this report spurs efforts, which are underway, to launch tech imaging programs in the state. Initiatives working Some initiatives that the state and industry have taken to recruit young health care workers appear to be working. Among these are programs targeting Hawaii students, from high school to college, to create career paths leading to health care professions. HAH training programs are offered at 14 public high schools across the state that help bring in certified nurse aides, medical assistants and patient service representatives. Three-fourths of these students went on successfully to secure their first health care job after graduation. Additionally, there are bridge programs — specialized 12-month “earn and learn” programs — that allow students to work while pursuing requirements to become a licensed practical nurse. Students enrolled in these programs continue working as certified nurse aides or medical assistants, and are able to increase their salaries significantly as LPNs. Approximately 50 candidates are enrolled in the program this year. The 2024 report found the vacancy rate for LPNs dropped to about 23%, compared to 30% in 2022, attributing some of the decline to the bridge program. Still, demand is expected to outpace supply, and the state faces more challenges ahead in the need to expand its health care workforce. “The good news is that, in a direct comparison with professions and respondents surveyed in 2022, we see the positive impact of health care workforce initiatives on entry-level positions and specialty nursing professions,” said Raethel. “However, due to the increasing need for care, workforce demand remains high for these and other professions.” Challenges ahead Hawaii’s silver tsunami, or growing population of aging seniors from the baby boomer generation, is expected to drive even more demand for health care professionals in the years to come. Wesley Lo, CEO of Ohana Pacific Health, said as people age, their health care needs grow more complex, with potentially more severe illnesses. “We are seeing greater demand for nursing home beds and home health,” said Lo. “Certainly, the aging population is starting to catch up with us.” The number of openings for certified nurse aides and nursing assistants overall has increased when compared with 2022 due, in part, to growing demand from long-term nursing facilities. There is also a demand for home health aides, with a vacancy rate of 30%. This affects the whole “continuum of care,” as lack of available beds at long-term nursing facilities means more beds taken up at hospitals with nowhere to discharge patients. The 2024 report is more comprehensive than past ones, and expands on the previous one by accounting for five additional professions, as well as additional data from two federal facilities, including the Tripler Army Medical Center and VA Pacific Islands Health Care System. HAH added positions such as psychiatric aides, and environmental service and food service positions to the survey for 2024 because of their importance. The reports do not count medical doctors or surgeons. The report also looks at shortages based on type of facility. Hospitals have the largest shortages, due to employing the most staff, followed by skilled nursing facilities and health clinics. Hospitals have more registered nurse openings, while the nursing facilities and clinics have the most openings for licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. The 2024 report is HAH’s third workforce report, following ones in 2022 and 2019. The 2022 report, which was delayed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, found a drastic 76% jump in health care job vacancies when compared to 2019, with more than 3,800 openings across 89 professions.

Healio Community will include key features such as a mentorship program. Healio has launched the Healio Community platform to empower and connect professionals in health care. Health care professionals must navigate intense workloads and demanding schedules, which can leave them feeling isolated, Healio said in a press release, adding that Healio Community will offer a supportive, safe space to connect with each other and access resources that were designed to help them thrive both professionally and personally. The new resource, designed to support the holistic well-being of physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioner and other advanced practice professionals, aims to create an improved sense of community in medicine while also addressing individual needs. The wellness of health care professionals “often takes a backseat” as they “dedicate their lives to helping others,” Joan-Marie Stiglich, chief content officer and chief strategic alliance + KOL officer at Healio, said in the release. “Healio Community was created to change that narrative.” Joining a clinician-first mindset and user-friendly technology, Healio Community will include several key features: a mentorship program to connect those seeking guidance with more seasoned professionals; career growth opportunities via a job board that has been curated to connect professionals with new roles aligned with their expertise and future goals; and dedicated spaces such as groups and forums for meaningful discussion on important topics like mental health, financial literacy, fitness and nutrition. “At Healio, we understand that clinician wellness is critical not only for individual health, but also for the overall health care system,\" Stacey Adams , vice president of Healio Community, said in the release. \"With Healio Community, we are creating a space where health care professionals can find the resources, support and connections they need to thrive.\" As a “gated destination built on a foundation of innovation and empathy, reflecting the needs of today’s health care professionals,” according to the release, Healio Community will enable community connections, boost joy and empower professionals in health care — regardless of career stage or specialty — to take charge of their well-being.

    "article_text": "ETMarkets.com Shares of Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals will trade on an ex-split basis from Wednesday, following the company's plan to split its shares. Shares of Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals will start trading on an ex-split basis on Wednesday, as the company had set January 8 as the record date for determining the shareholder eligibility for their 1:2.5 bonus issue. “Pursuant to Regulation 42 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, it is hereby informed that, the Board of Directors of the Company has passed the necessary resolution through Circular Resolution, on Tuesday, December 17, 2024 and has fixed the record date on Wednesday, January 8, 2025 for the purpose of Sub-division/Split of equity shares of the Company such that 1 (one) equity share having face value of Rs. 5/- (Rupees five only) each, fully paid-up, be sub-divided into such number of equity shares having face value of Rs. 2 (Rupee two only) each,” the company had said in a previous exchange filing. Trading on an ex-split basis refers to when a stock begins trading at its adjusted price after a stock split. A stock split increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the share price, without affecting the company’s overall market capitalization. From the ex-split date onward, investors who buy the shares will not be eligible to receive the benefits of the stock split. Only those who were shareholders before this date are entitled to these benefits. Also read: FIIs bet $1 billion on IT stocks before Q3 results. Does it signal a happy new year?

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) By Brian P. Simpson PUBLISHED: January 7, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST | UPDATED: January 7, 2025 at 3:04 PM PST People are shocked at the murder of the United Healthcare CEO and those who support the actions of the murderer. They rightfully denounce the murderer and those who support him. However, no one has identified the fundamental reason why many people think the murder is justified. The problem is the belief that health care is a right. If health care is a right, then we’re morally obligated to provide health care to people. And if one is denied health care by an insurance company, this is an injustice and morally wrong. The solution to this alleged injustice requires some kind of punishment. And given that people believe—however mistakenly—that this is such an important right, some obviously think that murder is appropriate. But health care is not a right. A right, as shown so eloquently by Ayn Rand, is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a person’s freedom of action in a social context. Rights define and protect our freedom. Freedom refers to the absence of the initiation of physical force, the absence of compulsion and coercion. If health care is a right, it means forcing doctors and nurses to provide the health care or taxpayers to pay for it. This violates the rights and freedom of these individuals. Each of us has a right to his or her own life and no one has the right to force people to provide things that other people want or need. Rights and freedom are necessary because of the nature of human beings: we need freedom to use our basic tool of survival—our reason—to think and act to further our own lives and happiness. If we don’t have our freedom protected, we’re basically enslaved to those who are able to force us to provide what they want or need. People are frustrated with health insurance companies. I can empathize because I have had claims denied by my own insurance company. But insurance companies are engaging in voluntary trade. They are respecting the rights of others. If one doesn’t like the actions an insurance company takes, one is free to argue with the company to get it to approve the claim, advocate for changes to its policies, sue the company if it isn’t following its policies, or do business with another company. What we need to have better and less expensive health care is for rights to be protected more in this industry. It’s violations of rights that have led to the current situation. For example, it was maximum wage controls during World War II that led to the rise of employer provided health care. Employers began providing other benefits since they couldn’t pay wages above the government imposed maximum wage. Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare violate rights as well. These and other violations of rights have led to an insatiable demand for health care and made it harder to provide health care, all the while leading to rapidly rising prices. If these violations of rights were abolished, the profit motive would provide the strongest possible motivation and ability to provide more and better health care. The cosmetic surgery industry provides a great example of what could be achieved. In this industry, which has far less government interference, quality has improved and prices have fallen in real terms to the point where people can afford such procedures on a much wider scale. Instead, people call for greater violations of rights in health care. But government provided health care, such as in Canada and Britain, is of lower quality and one faces far longer wait times to obtain it. Health care in these countries would be even worse if they didn’t benefit from innovations in the freest health care market: the U.S. What about health care under outright socialism? If you think it’s better, please go to Cuba or North Korea to experience that type of health care. How would the poor obtain health care under a free market? They would do so through voluntary charity. If one wants to help the poor, one has every right to do so. However, no one has the right to force others to help the poor obtain health care. The solution to the problems in health care isn’t violating rights to a greater degree through socializing medicine or acts of violence. The solution is greater protection of individual rights and freedom. This, ultimately, is the only way to create a more peaceful and prosperous society for everyone. Brian P.

Health care in these countries would be even worse if they didn’t benefit from innovations in the freest health care market: the U.S. What about health care under outright socialism? If you think it’s better, please go to Cuba or North Korea to experience that type of health care. How would the poor obtain health care under a free market? They would do so through voluntary charity. If one wants to help the poor, one has every right to do so. However, no one has the right to force others to help the poor obtain health care. The solution to the problems in health care isn’t violating rights to a greater degree through socializing medicine or acts of violence. The solution is greater protection of individual rights and freedom. This, ultimately, is the only way to create a more peaceful and prosperous society for everyone. Brian P.

    "article_text": "A New York police officer stands on 54th Street outside the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan where Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) By Brian P Simpson PUBLISHED: January 7, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST | UPDATED: January 7, 2025 at 3:04 PM PST People are shocked at the murder of the United Healthcare CEO and those who support the actions of the murderer. They rightfully denounce the murderer and those who support him. However, no one has identified the fundamental reason why many people think the murder is justified. The problem is the belief that health care is a right. If health care is a right, then we’re morally obligated to provide health care to people. And if one is denied health care by an insurance company, this is an injustice and morally wrong. The solution to this alleged injustice requires some kind of punishment. And given that people believe—however mistakenly—that this is such an important right, some obviously think that murder is appropriate. But health care is not a right. A right, as shown so eloquently by Ayn Rand, is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a person’s freedom of action in a social context. Rights define and protect our freedom. Freedom refers to the absence of the initiation of physical force, the absence of compulsion and coercion. If health care is a right, it means forcing doctors and nurses to provide the health care or taxpayers to pay for it. This violates the rights and freedom of these individuals. Each of us has a right to his or her own life and no one has the right to force people to provide things that other people want or need. Rights and freedom are necessary because of the nature of human beings: we need freedom to use our basic tool of survival—our reason—to think and act to further our own lives and happiness. If we don’t have our freedom protected, we’re basically enslaved to those who are able to force us to provide what they want or need. People are frustrated with health insurance companies. I can empathize because I have had claims denied by my own insurance company. But insurance companies are engaging in voluntary trade. They are respecting the rights of others. If one doesn’t like the actions an insurance company takes, one is free to argue with the company to get it to approve the claim, advocate for changes to its policies, sue the company if it isn’t following its policies, or do business with another company. What we need to have better and less expensive health care is for rights to be protected more in this industry. It’s violations of rights that have led to the current situation. For example, it was maximum wage controls during World War II that led to the rise of employer provided health care. Employers began providing other benefits since they couldn’t pay wages above the government imposed maximum wage. Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare violate rights as well. These and other violations of rights have led to an insatiable demand for health care and made it harder to provide health care, all the while leading to rapidly rising prices. If these violations of rights were abolished, the profit motive would provide the strongest possible motivation and ability to provide more and better health care. The cosmetic surgery industry provides a great example of what could be achieved. In this industry, which has far less government interference, quality has improved and prices have fallen in real terms to the point where people can afford such procedures on a much wider scale. Instead, people call for greater violations of rights in health care. But government provided health care, such as in Canada and Britain, is of lower quality and one faces far longer wait times to obtain it. Health care in these countries would be even worse if they didn’t benefit from innovations in the freest health care market: the U.S. What about health care under outright socialism? If you think it’s better, please go to Cuba or North Korea to experience that type of health care. How would the poor obtain health care under a free market? They would do so through voluntary charity. If one wants to help the poor, one has every right to do so. However, no one has the right to force others to help the poor obtain health care. The solution to the problems in health care isn’t violating rights to a greater degree through socializing medicine or acts of violence.

    "article_text": "Home Editorial Poor UHC coverage Only half of Pakistan has universal healthcare access, with significant regional disparities impacting citizens. Editorial January 04, 2025 1 min read facebook twitter whatsup linkded email Poor UHC coverage Listen to article Despite significant strides in the right direction since the start of the 21st century, only about half the population of Pakistan has access to universal healthcare, which is generally accepted as being a necessity for development. In fact, the only developed country without a true universal healthcare system is the US, which is one of the reasons why the country lags far behind other rich countries in terms of health outcomes and cost. But unlike the US, where the influence of the insurance industry and Big Pharma are generally blamed for the lack of universal healthcare, in Pakistan, cost is the main factor - population growth is outpacing the economic growth needed to finance the existing healthcare system, let alone an expanded universal healthcare system. A recent report also shows major regional disparities in universal healthcare (UHC) coverage. While no Pakistani province or territory is anywhere close to the global target of 80% UHC coverage, Islamabad is performing relatively well, with 63.9% coverage, followed by Punjab with 55.5%, K-P 51%, Sindh 50.7%, and Balochistan just 38.4% coverage. These regional disparities exist despite the much-hyped efforts of PTI, PML-N and PPP-led governments in the provinces and at the Centre to introduce universal insurance programmes. The implications of limited UHC coverage are clear to see - in 2021 alone, about 5.4% of households spent over 10% of their income on healthcare, which is unsustainable and potentially bankrupting for people who often also have to deal with lost income during their illness and recovery period on top of the healthcare costs. And those lost hours add up. Studies have shown that in countries with UHC, people are healthier and take less time off due to illness, resulting in higher economic output, which, in turn, could end up paying for the additional UHC costs. If the leaders of the provinces and Islamabad come together to work in the interest of their citizens, there is no reason they could not come up with a plan that regards healthcare expansion as an investment rather than an expense. facebook twitter whatsup linkded email COMMENTS Replying to X Saved !

    "article_text": "Small Business How To Close The Healthcare Desert Gap And Improve Access In The US By Jesse Corn , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 02, 2025, 09:30am EST Share Save Jesse Corn, CPO Zivian Health , is a digital health executive and health tech founder with over 14 years of experience in digital solutions. getty Healthcare deserts, areas in the United States with limited or no access to essential medical services, are a growing concern, leaving millions of Americans without the care they need. The U.S. healthcare system is currently contending with a growing healthcare worker shortage. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has recently proposed significant restrictions on telehealth prescribing in 2025. It’s clear that healthcare access is a true problem that will require innovative solutions from healthcare business leaders. Over the past 16 years, I’ve had the privilege of driving digital solutions in sectors that are crying out for transformation. My current focus is healthcare access and equity. As the co-founder of Zivian Health, our team has created a digital solution to bridge gaps in healthcare compliance and collaboration, with the explicit aim of streamlining the collaborative healthcare model and opening pathways for physicians and advanced practice clinicians to provide more equitable healthcare access. This article explores the issue of healthcare deserts and highlights innovative solutions to increase access, improve health outcomes and bridge the healthcare gap across the nation. The Healthcare Desert Problem Healthcare deserts are geographic regions where residents face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services. These areas can be rural, urban or even suburban, and the lack of healthcare infrastructure can vary widely. In 2021, a GoodRx Research report found that over \"80% of counties across the U.S. lack proper access to the services needed to maintain health.\" According to the report, individuals living in these areas have \"less than adequate access to pharmacies, primary care providers, hospitals, trauma centers, and/or low-cost health centers.\" Studies have also shown that other problems—long waiting times, high costs, poor patient experiences—are occurring as a byproduct of infrastructural deficiencies and healthcare worker shortages. A 2023 study released by The Harris Poll and the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) found that 56% of adults wait more than a week for an appointment and 65% say that coordinating and managing healthcare is overwhelming and time-consuming. In addition, concern over cost was cited as the main reason for skipping or delaying healthcare. The consequences of these issues are far-reaching: • Health Disparities: Healthcare deserts often correlate with higher rates of chronic diseases, preventable hospitalizations and overall poorer health outcomes. • Economic Impact: Communities in healthcare deserts suffer economically, as the absence of healthcare facilities can deter businesses and hinder economic growth. • Reduced Quality Of Life: Limited access to healthcare can have profound effects on the quality of life for residents, particularly those with chronic conditions or in need of regular medical care. Solutions To Improve Access Addressing healthcare deserts is a complex challenge, and there is a range of solutions that healthcare leaders are pursuing to make a difference in these populations. Telehealth Expansion: Further expansion and improvement of telemedicine services can bring healthcare directly to patients in underserved areas, offering remote consultations, monitoring and treatment. Mobile Clinics: Mobile clinics and telehealth-enabled vehicles can provide medical services to rural and underserved communities, offering a range of primary care, screenings and preventive services. Community Health Workers: Trained community health workers can bridge the gap by providing health education and preventive care and assisting residents in navigating the healthcare system. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborations between government, nonprofits and private healthcare providers to establish clinics in underserved areas can address worker shortages and increase access to care. Rural Health Incentives: Financial and educational incentives for healthcare professionals to practice in rural and underserved areas can help alleviate shortages. Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Making use of EHRs and building telehealth infrastructure in underserved regions can improve coordination of care and enable patients to access their medical history and communicate with healthcare providers. Retail Clinics: Retail clinics and pharmacies can be used as healthcare access points to address basic healthcare needs in areas where traditional medical facilities are scarce. Transportation Solutions: Solutions such as ride-sharing programs for healthcare appointments can help residents reach medical facilities more easily. Telepharmacy Services: Telepharmacy, which allows pharmacists to provide remote medication management and consultation, can play a crucial role in medication access. Taking Initiative Healthcare professionals, advocates and organizations play a vital role in raising awareness about the healthcare desert problem. My first recommendation is to prioritize scalability and sustainability. Initiatives like telehealth expansion and mobile clinics offer the largest potential, as they require relatively modest investments in technology and infrastructure compared to brick-and-mortar facilities. Partnering with technology providers and local organizations can help leaders pilot these solutions, demonstrating value before scaling up. I also encourage leaders to use data-driven storytelling to highlight the human impact of these gaps. Launch public campaigns, join or support initiatives like National Rural Health Day, or partner with organizations that focus on health equity. Lastly, in my experience, tying these efforts to measurable outcomes, such as reduced wait times or improved health metrics, builds credibility and attracts further investment and support. Of course, implementing these strategies can come with challenges. Resistance to change, limited local buy-in and the ongoing shortage of healthcare professionals are hurdles that must be addressed proactively. For example, while telehealth holds promise, the lack of broadband access in rural areas can hinder adoption. Similarly, when recruiting providers for underserved areas, offering financial incentives such as loan forgiveness or stipends for relocation can make these roles more appealing. The key is to identify potential barriers early and align with both community needs and available resources. The Road Ahead There is not a single, overnight solution for healthcare deserts in America. Healthcare business leaders must work together—implementing the right strategies and investments—to improve access and reduce health disparities. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that rapid changes in healthcare delivery are possible, and further innovation can benefit communities that have long struggled with healthcare access. By continuing to explore creative solutions, foster public-private collaborations and promote policy changes, we can take meaningful steps toward closing the healthcare desert gap and ensuring that all Americans have access to the healthcare services they need for a healthier, more prosperous future.

    "article_text": "Authored by Panos Mourdoukoutas via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours), The health care industry will be at the crossroads of several trends in 2025: demographics, proposed Medicare changes, staffing constraints, AI innovations, and deregulation. \"Why hello there young man...\" (Drazen Zigic/Shutterstock) Demographics will determine the demand for health care services, while Medicare changes, staffing constraints, and technology will determine the supply of these services. Together, these trends will determine the quantity and quality of industry growth in the new year. Ben Johnston, chief operating officer of Kapitus, sees favorable demographics and innovative treatments driving health care industry growth in the new year. “ We continue to be bullish on the health care industry as the macro forces of an aging U.S. population and new treatment innovations make health care an attractive industry in 2025 and beyond, ” Johnston told The Epoch Times. However, he sees proposed changes to Medicare that would give the states more control of the program and proposed work requirements in exchange for coverage limiting the total number of insured, thus constraining demand for health care services. In addition, Johnston believes staffing shortages across the industry are exacerbated by limits on immigration, constraining the supply of health care services. “ Reducing future legal immigration could pose a significant challenge to the industry and drive both prices and wait times higher ,” he said. Thomas Kluz, the managing director of Venture Lab, is also concerned about staffing constraints in 2025 for different reasons. “The pandemic, system inefficiencies, and wage cuts continued to be a present burden on health care workers on top of their drained physical and mental health,” Kluz told The Epoch Times. He thinks AI technology could help ease the situation. “ AI and automation will be key to taking some of this pressure off by reducing administrative burdens, ” he said. For Dr. Ofer Sharon, CEO at OncoHost, the use of AI in health care and life sciences, such as machine learning and advanced image processing, will significantly drive the health care industry’s growth in the new year. “For instance, in drug discovery, 2025 may see the first AI-discovered or AI-designed therapeutic targets progressing to first-in-human clinical trials ,” he told The Epoch Times via email. “At the same time, AI-powered diagnostic tools are expected to gain wider adoption in clinical settings, contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and more personalized patient care.” Pradeep Kumar Jain, senior director of health care at Tredence Inc., sees care shifting to telehealth, home care, and ambulatory care, making it more accessible and focused on patients. “These models ensure people get timely and convenient care while improving coordination across different settings,” he told The Epoch Times via email. “ Value-based care focuses on prevention rather than treatment, addressing health issues earlier. ” Dr. Stacey Lee, a professor of health care and business law at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and Bloomberg School of Public Health, sees the prospect of changing rules and choices in the health care industry to improve access to services and rein in costs. “The projected 8 percent rise in health care costs next year will force providers and patients to rethink how care is delivered and paid for,” he told The Epoch Times. “ My work with health care organizations shows that direct primary care isn’t just another payment model—it fundamentally changes how doctors and patients work together. When we strip away layers of billing complexity, we often find that quality and efficiency improve.” Lee believes that the soaring health care costs will reshape the demand for and supply of health care services, with price transparency becoming a critical factor for the functioning of health care markets. “My research in health care negotiations shows that when patients can compare prices, it doesn’t just help them make better choices,” he said. “It changes how health care organizations compete and set their prices. The incoming administration’s emphasis on transparency could accelerate these changes.” If that turns out to be the case, transparency will test how well health care markets balance efficiency with patient protection. “In my work studying health care law, I’ve seen that successful deregulation requires understanding which rules truly protect patients and which ones just add cost without benefit,” Lee said.
