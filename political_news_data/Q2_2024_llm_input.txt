Top Stocks to Consider After Cooler PCE Data Shaun Pruitt June 28, 2024 3 min read SDAWW Notably, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index tracks changes in the cost of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States through the lens of businesses. Additionally, Core PCE is a key economic indicator the Federal Reserve uses to gauge inflation by measuring the average change in these consumer goods prices when excluding volatile items like food and energy. With Core PCE being the Fed's preferred inflationary measure, this reading optimistically cooled to a 0.1% uptick in May compared to a 0.3% increase in April. Year over year, Core PCE rose by 2.6% which Yahoo Finance points out was the slowest annual gain in three years. Although this is still above the Fed’s preferred target of a 2% annual inflation rate, May’s Core PCE data is a positive sign for the economy and stocks. Considering last month’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a cooler print as well, here are three stocks investors may want to consider on the prospects of a more favorable operating environment. Yahoo Finance Image Source: Yahoo Finance Nvidia NVDA Easing inflation is crucial to the tech sector regarding internal operating costs and the willingness of not only consumers but also businesses to spend on technology which in many instances can be deemed non-essential despite its clear importance. Perhaps broader spending on artificial intelligence continues to increase and keeps Nvidia’s stock attractive as the leader in producing AI chips. Tracking Nvidia’s performance since its 10-1 stock split on June 10, NVDA is only up +2% but had already more than doubled this year beforehand with a very positive trend of earnings estimate revisions suggesting more upside. Correlating with such, the chip giant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) amid what continues to be captivating growth on its top and bottom lines. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Amazon AMZN Outside of the tech sector, the obvious beneficiaries of a more stable inflationary environment are consumer retail-driven companies and no one stands out more in this regard than e-commerce giant Amazon. The market is suggesting this as well as Amazon’s stock spiked +10% this month and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with gains already at +27% for the year. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bank of America BAC Although banks can benefit from a high inflationary environment higher loan volumes and net inflows from depsits look plausible in both commercial and consumer segments if reseeding PCE and better-than-expected CPI data were to continue. Story Continues Furthermore, one bank that excels in its use of technology and can benefit from the perceived notion of lower technology costs is Bank of America which sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Bank of America’s attractive price tag may also interest investors as its stock costs less than many of the other big banks at just under $40 while its forward P/E of 12.1X is on par with most of its peers. While Bank of America has traded at sharper P/E discounts in the past it's noteworthy that earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 are slightly up over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BAC also has a 2.45% annual dividend yield that only trails Citigroup’s C 3.44% out of the big four domestic banks as this edges Wells Fargo’s WFC 2.44% and JPMorgan’s JPM 2.31%. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Final Thought Rounding out Q2, reseeding core PCE is a good sign for businesses and the broader economy with Nvidia, Amazon, and Bank of America being three stocks to keep an eye on next quarter.

Bill Gates and Warren Buffett Team Up to Transform Nuclear Power Oil Price ^ | 06/27/2024 | Haley Zaremba Posted on 06/27/2024 9:14:55 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Bill Gates is pledging billions to promote next-generation nuclear power through TerraPower, focusing on innovations that could make nuclear a key player in global decarbonization. Increasing energy demands from the AI sector prompt tech leaders like Sam Altman and Bill Gates to advocate for nuclear power as a sustainable solution. Innovations in nuclear technology, including smaller, more standardized reactors, aim to reduce construction costs and compete with natural gas. Bill Gates is ready to sink billions into getting next-generation nuclear energy off the ground in the United States. The world’s sixth richest man has been a staunch nuclear supporter for years now, and has already sunk over a billion dollars of his own money into his innovative nuclear power start-up TerraPower LLC. But according to Gates, that cool billion is just the beginning. “I put in over a billion, and I’ll put in billions more,” Gates was recently quoted by Bloomberg. Nuclear power has been gaining traction around the globe as a viable option for national and private decarbonization strategies. Nuclear advocates argue that we can no longer afford to ignore nuclear’s immense clean energy potential, as it is a proven technology with plenty of existing infrastructure, legal precedent and huge output capacity. While it is not considered to be a renewable energy, nuclear energy emits zero carbon emissions and could be a key part of a viable pathway to meeting global emissions targets. Finding new ways to drum up a whole lot of clean energy output in a hurry has become increasingly urgent as the tech sector, and Artificial Intelligence in particular , suck up rapidly increasingly colossal amounts of energy.

As It Happens The wage gap for women in Canada's tech sector is only getting worse: report The wage gap between women and men in Canada's tech sector has tripled over the course of five years, a new report shows. Black and Indigenous people, non-permanent residents also facing big disparities, census data shows Sheena Goodyear · CBC Radio · Posted: Jun 21, 2024 6:34 PM EDT | Last Updated: June 21, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 6 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. A new report has found the pay gap between women in men in Canada's tech industry is only getting bigger. (Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock) Social Sharing As It Happens 6:45 The wage gap for women in Canada's tech sector is only getting worse: report When Viet Vu first calculated the gender pay gap for women in the Canadian tech industry, he was blown away. Despite recent efforts to boost equity and diversity in the field, the pay gap between men and women tripled over five years between 2015 and 2021, according to a new report from Toronto Metropolitan University. As of 2021, the average woman in the industry was making roughly $20,000 less than her male counterpart, up from $7,200 five years prior. "I thought that I had made a coding error," Vu, the report's co-author, told As It Happens host Nil Köksal. "I had to check the number again and again." Vu is the acting director of The Dais, a public policy organization at the Toronto university behind the new report called " Canada's Got Tech Talent ," which is based on Canadian Census data. While the report found increased representation for immigrants and racialized groups in Canada, it also found continued salary disparities for Black and Indigenous workers, several other visible minority groups, and non-permanent residents. Diversity initiatives are not enough The report found that, even when factoring in things such as switching jobs and having kids, the wage gap persisted. Marissa McNeelands, the chief executive and co-founder of women's tech collective Toast, says that proves the only viable explanation is that "the people in power controlling salary decisions are letting women get paid less." The findings did not come as a shock to Saadia Muzaffar, founder of TGC, a Canadian non-profit that advocates for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In fact, she says TGC's own data over the last seven years show the same pay disparity. And it's one that's even more stark for women who also belong to other marginalized identities, she said. "What this shows us is that while we can roll out DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] initiatives and advocacy campaigns to address the skewed worker demographics in STEM, if these efforts are not firmly tethered to accountability measures … we will not make the progress we claim we want," Muzaffar told CBC in an email. Saadia Muzaffar, founder of TGC, a non-profit that advocates for women science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). (saadiam.com) By accountability measures, she means things like pay transparency, and strategies that focus not not just on hiring underrepresented people, but also keeping them around — and promoting them. "DEI efforts can mean that experienced talent, particularly if they are immigrants, get brought into entry-level jobs and then get stuck there," she said. Muzaffar says the majority of women in STEM   — 52 per cent — are immigrants . But those same women face worse outcomes for employment and salary. "Imagine our largest talent pool for in-demand innovation sector jobs, facing the worst outcomes across the board? A bad deal for all involved, including employers and the Canadian economy," she said. Immigrants, overall, make up 44 per cent of the tech industry, according to the report, and earn an average salary of $88,000, just slightly below non-immigrants at $89,800. But non-permanent residents, it found, are lagging at $52,000. Black, Indigenous people workers paid less When it comes to race, Vu says the picture becomes more complicated. "If you look at the overall representation of the tech sector in employing people with visible minority identities, it's actually doing really great. There are more tech workers with visible minority identities who work in tech than outside of tech," he said. But, he says, there are stark differences within that broad category. With tech incubators bringing investment and inspiration, Black entrepreneurs feel they can 'change the world' Pay gap between men and women starts right out of the gate for college, university grads The report defines "visible minority identities" as South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean, and Japanese. Overall, workers in those groups made an average of $78,800 a year in Canada in 2021 compared with $93,000 for those not considered to be part of a visible minority group. Arab Canadian workers had an average salary of $98,581, more than any other group, including non-minorities. Japanese and Chinese Canadians were not far behind, at $92,082 and $91,525, respectively. Viet Vu is the acting director of the Dais, a public policy organization at Toronto Metropolitan University. (Submitted by Viet Vu) But Black workers, Vu said, "are not doing so great in tech right now." Black workers had an average salary of $70,955 in 2021. That's up from $63,000 in 2016, but still accounts for the largest pay gap among the identified minority groups. The average salary for an Indigenous person in tech was $72,000. That's $14,000 less than non-Indigenous tech workers. Indigenous people were also hugely underrepresented in the field. While 4.8 per cent of Canadians work in tech, only 1.4 per cent of Indigenous people in Canada have careers in the industry. What are the solutions? Vu says he hopes people don't take away from this report that tech is an industry for marginalized people to avoid, or that diversity initiatives are a waste of time. "Often these initiatives are led by the people who are underrepresented themselves in the tech sector," he said. "And quite frankly, they're always going to be outnumbered. And if we are to solve this example with a gender issue, men in the tech sector absolutely must play a crucial role." Women-led startups get much less funding than men. Female investors hope to change that Video This Black mother-daughter team is being recognized for their contributions to tech These programs also need to be paired with practical measures, he said, like gender-blind parental benefits, and access to childcare. Putting in the work to narrow these gaps, he says, is well worth the effort. "What I often tell men in the tech sector is: 'Guess what? You're losing out on an opportunity to work with some of the most brilliant minds in the country by basically making it such an alienating space,'" he said. "And so actually enjoying an inclusive workspace isn't actually about doing anyone any favour. It's actually creating opportunities." With files from The Canadian Press.

Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Close Key Takeaways The S&P 500 declined by 0.3% on Thursday, June 20, 2024, after briefly crossing the 5,500 level for the first time before falling on declines in the technology sector. Chipmakers fell, with Nvidia, Qualcomm, Micron Technology and On Semiconductor all moving lower. Gilead Sciences jumped after it announced tests of its HIV prevention drug proved 100% effective in tests on women. Major U.S. equities were mixed on Thursday as investors drew back from Nvidia ( NVDA ) and several other chipmakers to send the tech sector lower After briefly crossing the 5,500 level for the first time , the S&P 500 moved lower by 0.3% to step back from its record high. Nasdaq dropped lower by 0.8% on the tech turndown, while the Dow jumped 0.8%. Shares of Gilead Sciences ( GILD ) soared 8.5% after the company announced that tests of its HIV prevention drug proved 100% effective in women in trials. The results were so successful that an independent monitoring committee recommended expanding testing of the drug called “lenacapavir." More trials are needed before it can apply for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, including testing on men. Consulting firm Accenture ( ACN ) stock was 7.3% higher after it reported a jump in bookings related to its artificial intelligence (AI) products. Accenture beat its profit expectations despite its revenue declining from its year-ago levels. Electronic equipment supplier Jabil ( JBL ) moved lower by more than 11.4% after company executives discussed softness in several of its markets during a call on its quarterly results. Jabil gets nearly a fifth of its revenue from Apple ( AAPL ), so its results can give investors an indicator of the iPhone maker’s performance. Several chipmakers declined amid a pullback in the tech sector , including a decline of more than 3% by Nvidia. Qualcomm ( QCOM ), Micron Technology ( MU ), Microchip Technology ( MCHP ) and Western Digital Corp ( WDC ) each dropped around 5%, while ON Semiconductor ( ON ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) moved lower by about 4%. While other tech firms struggled, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) jumped by more than 4% after Piper Sandler analysts moved the company to “top pick” status on the strength of its AI chip strategy.

Title: The Smartest Tech ETF to Buy With $500 Right Now

Picking individual stocks to add to your portfolio can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when there are thousands to pick from in the market. Even when you've settled on a specific sector or industry, picking stocks within those can be tedious. Thankfully, you don't have to spend time researching and picking individual stocks; you could invest in an exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) that provides broad exposure to the sector or industry you're interested in. The tech sector has often been the most popular part of the stock market -- and the most rewarding -- for investors over the past couple of decades. If you have $500 available to invest (meaning you have an emergency fund saved and high-interest debt paid down) and want exposure to some of the world's top tech companies , the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ 0.27% ) is a great option. Expand NASDAQ : QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Today's Change ( -0.27 %) $ -1.66 Current Price $ 621.57 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 617.52 - $ 622.72 52wk Range $ 402.39 - $ 637.01 Volume 45M Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A A tech ETF in its own right The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF mirrors the Nasdaq-100 , an index that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Although it's not a pure tech ETF, the tech sector makes up around 59% of the fund and contains many of the world's most important tech companies. Here are the ETF's top 10 holdings, which include the " Magnificent Seven " (as of March 31). Microsoft : 8.75% Apple : 7.41% Nvidia : 6.32% Amazon : 5.25% Meta Platforms : 4.76% Broadcom : 4.44% Alphabet (Class A): 2.49% Alphabet (Class C): 2.42% Tesla : 2.37% Costco Wholesale : 2.35% The ETF is in a nice sweet spot -- not quite as broad as the Nasdaq Composite Index (which contains over 3,000 companies), but broad enough to cover virtually all areas of the tech industry. Its tech companies are involved in software, semiconductors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence , and dozens of other industries poised to drive growth. An inexpensive way to get exposure to top tech companies The ETF's expense ratio is 0.20%, which works out to $1 annually per $500 invested. It's not as cheap as some popular S&P 500 ETFs , which could have expense ratios as low as 0.03%, but it's still a lower-cost option than many other comparable ETFs. An ETF's expense ratio may seem like a small detail that can be ignored, but the smallest differences on paper can equal a decent amount of money in real life. For example, imagine you invest $500 monthly into two ETFs that average 10% annual returns over 20 years. Below is how your investment totals would differ between 0.20% and 0.40% expense ratios: Expense Ratio Amount Paid in Fees Ending Investment Total 0.20% $7,700 $335,900 0.40% $15,200 $328,400 Calculations by author. Figures rounded to the nearest hundred. Even a slight 0.20% difference equaled thousands more paid in fees over time. Don't overlook ETF expense ratios; they matter. The ETF has a history of market-beating results The ETF is up close to 1,000% since its March 1999 inception, with many of those gains coming in the last decade. In that span, it has considerably outperformed the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. A $500 investment at its inception would be worth close to $5,500 today. QQQ Total Return Level data by YCharts An ETF returning close to 19% in a single year is impressive in itself, but averaging that over a decade is a testament to the consistency and resilience of the companies leading the way. Past results don't guarantee future performance, but for the sake of illustration, let's assume the ETF averages more modest 15% annual returns over the next decade. A $500 investment now could be worth close to $2,000 after fees. You should never invest in a stock assuming you can predict its performance, because you can't. That's like counting your chickens before they hatch and one of the easiest ways to set yourself up for disappointment. However, history can give you insight into a stock's ability, and this ETF has shown it can deliver consistent returns and capitalize on the tech sector's growth.

TORONTO – The gender pay gap in Canada’s tech sector almost tripled between 2016 and 2021, amounting to the average salary of a woman in the industry being about $20,000 less than her male counterpart, according to a new report. The report called “Canada’s Got Tech Talent” was released Thursday by researchers at The Dais, a public policy organization based at Toronto Metropolitan University. Among the report’s key findings was data revealing the average female tech worker was making $71,400 in 2021 compared with $91,000 earned by their male counterpart. The numbers indicate the gender pay gap among tech workers has widened significantly since 2016, when men earned $7,200 more than women. A new study shows the gender pay gap in Canada's tech sector almost tripled between 2016 and 2021. A man walks though a downtown Toronto office building with other buildings reflected in a window in this June 11, 2019 photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graeme Roy Viet Vu, The Dais’s acting director of policy and research, said the increase surprised him given the attention that has been paid to equity, diversity and inclusion in recent years. While everything from pay associated with remote work to seniority can shape the gap, he said a “peculiar” trend also contributed to the figures. Vu said women in tech who were earning within the 60th to the 80th percentile, such as senior people who are not yet at the executive level, didn’t experience any wage growth over those five years. However, men in the same range saw their earnings jump and those in the higher groups received hourly wage increases of $15 more than women received. “This is a fascinating thing because we’ve controlled for so many of these usual suspects, whether that be a new child that arrived or also things like how often people switched jobs,” Vu said. Because the study controlled for all the common arguments Marissa McNeelands hears for why the gender pay gap still exists, the chief executive and co-founder of women’s tech collective Toast said the report proves “the people in power controlling salary decisions are letting women get paid less.” Her fellow co-founder April Hicke added the results also reflect how much “performative allyship” permeates the industry and the vast amount of work still to be done to bring parity to the sector. Women were not the only group of tech workers to experience a pay gap. When researchers looked at the earnings of visible-minority tech workers, they found those in the group made an average of $78,800 a year in Canada in 2021 compared with $93,000 for those not considered to be part of a visible minority group. The lowest paid were Black tech workers, who earned $70,955 on average, and Filipino workers who made $73,079. “For Black tech workers, this is a sad news story where we found that in 2016, the pay gap was about $16,000. Now it’s actually about $22,000,” Vu said. Arab tech workers, who had an average salary of $98,581, however, outearned even those not from visible minority groups. Looking at trends among Indigenous tech workers, researchers found the average salary was $14,000 less than non-Indigenous counterparts making $86,800. The research The Dais published is based on census data concluding Canadian tech workers earn $40,000 more per year than workers employed in other fields. However, those behind the study say Canadian tech workers still make 46 per cent less on average than Americans. The study also took a peek at capital gains among Canadian tech workers. The measure has been in the spotlight since April, when the federal government’s budget proposed increasing the “inclusion rate” from one-half to two-thirds for people who see more than $250,000 in capital gains in a year. The Dais’s research suggests the median Canadian tech worker has $84,000 in equity gross value that has not yet been sold and that 1,960 tech workers declared more than $250,000 in capital gains in 2021. Based on those numbers, the report said 0.20 per cent of tech workers would be affected by the change, compared with 0.15 per cent of non-tech workers. “A couple of percentage points change or even like a 10 to 20 per cent point change in the tax system is likely not going to fix that 50 per cent pay gap … with the States,” Vu said. The government estimated the increase would only impact the wealthiest 0.13 per cent and result in $19.3 billion in revenue over the next five years. However, the prominent members of the tech industry, including the leaders of Shopify Inc. have railed against the changes. This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2024.

A stock market correction is coming as rates, inflation, and valuations darken the outlook for investors, strategist says Jennifer Sor June 19, 2024 2 min read The S&P 500 is in for a 5% drop, according to CFRA's Sam Stovall. The veteran strategist warned of a veteran backdrop for stocks. The market could see its first "crack on the ice" in the tech sector, he warned. The stock market is in for a correction, as a trio of unfavorable factors will weigh on equity prices, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research. The Wall Street veteran pointed to the strong performance of stocks so far this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% in 2024. However, the benchmark index is poised to dip 5% , he predicted, thanks to the bearish setup in interest rates, inflation, and stock valuations. Inflation is declining but is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, leading central bankers to project just one rate cut by the end of the year. Higher rates have triggered the longest-ever inversion of the 2-10 Treasury yield curve , the bond market's famous gauge of a coming recession. The indicator, which flashes when the 2-year yield surpasses the 10-year yield, has been a reliable recession signal throughout history, and economists have said that this time likely won't be different. Stock valuations are also high by historical standards, which hints at future downside. The S&P 500 is priced at a 32% premium compared to its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last 20 years, Stovall noted. Tech stocks, which have dominated the market in recent years, are trading at a 68% premium. "I think we're really stretched and we got to see some upward revisions to earnings estimates, I think, in order to justify that," Stovall said in a recent interview with CNBC . Stocks could see their first "crack in the ice" in the tech sector, he added, pointing to lofty valuations among mega-cap tech stocks. "It's only been tech that's been outperforming the market. I sort of feel this is a jumbo jet that's flying on one engine, and you wonder how long it will stay aloft," he warned. Other forecasters have warned of limited upside to the market as stocks — particularly tech stocks — continue to climb higher. According to one valuation metric, the stock market looks to be the most overvalued since 1929, which could pave the way to a steep correction , elite investor John Hussman warned.

Title: Adobe and Broadcom Results Look Like Great News for the Rest of the Tech Sector
Date: 20240619T123000Z
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/19/adobe-broadcom-tech-sector-buy-growth-stock/
Source: fool.com

Article Content:
The current technology sector rally has been largely driven by Apple , Microsoft , and the semiconductor industry. Broadly speaking, the software industry has been lagging behind. However, Adobe 's ( ADBE +1.33% ) latest quarterly results show that its artificial intelligence (AI) investments are paying off. Meanwhile, Broadcom ( AVGO 1.79% ) is on track to generate over $50 billion in revenue this fiscal year -- a milestone for the chip company. And the things that are going right for Adobe and Broadcom show why the technology sector deserves its premium valuation. Image source: Getty Images. Adobe is justifying increased AI spending After releasing downbeat full-year guidance in its fiscal first-quarter report , Adobe surprised investors by raising its guidance after delivering blowout fiscal second-quarter earnings. For the period, which ended May 31, the company announced solid results across its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud segments, especially with enterprise customers. Adobe and other enterprise software companies have been investing heavily in AI . But so far, their results haven't been that great. Salesforce shares fell hard after it published its latest quarterly report, which showed growth stalling as its expenses mounted. Adobe's latest report changed the narrative for enterprise software companies and proved that these investments can pay off in time. However, Adobe's growth is still far from rapid. Its updated fiscal 2024 guidance calls for $21.40 billion to $21.50 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $18 to $18.20. For context, in its fiscal 2023, it brought in $19.41 billion in revenue and $16.07 in non-GAAP EPS. If it hits the midpoint of its guidance ranges, that will amount to just 10.5% revenue growth and 12.6% EPS growth. There's an old saying: "When there's a gold rush, sell picks and shovels." That advice certainly applies in the tech sector right now. There are more reliable profits to be made in selling tools to the prospectors than there are in digging for gold. In this case, it's easier to mint cash by selling high-powered chips to power AI systems than it is to get rich with AI services. Adobe and its software peers are pouring money into AI investments in the hope of striking gold. Adobe's innovative product developments and improving financials indicate that it is on the right track, but it is still far from striking gold with AI. Expand NASDAQ : ADBE Adobe Today's Change ( 1.33 %) $ 4.37 Current Price $ 333.22 Key Data Points Market Cap $138B Day's Range $ 329.13 - $ 334.00 52wk Range $ 323.03 - $ 557.90 Volume 2.8M Avg Vol 4.3M Gross Margin 88.43 % Dividend Yield N/A Despite a four-fold surge in three years, Broadcom isn't overpriced Broadcom is a perfect example of the power of a "pick-and-shovel model" during a gold rush. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ended May 5), Broadcom's revenue hit a record $12.49 billion, $3.1 billion of which was related to AI products. For its full fiscal year, Broadcom is guiding for $51 billion in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $31.1 billion. In its fiscal 2023, it brought in $35.8 billion in revenue -- so it's projecting a top-line increase of 42.4%. However, a lot of that is due to its $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which it completed in November. The infrastructure and software solutions company has seen its market cap more than quadruple over the last three years to more than $800 billion. That makes Broadcom the ninth most valuable company in the S&P 500 -- behind Eli Lilly and ahead of JPMorgan Chase . Even after that run-up, Broadcom isn't a terribly expensive stock. Analysts' consensus estimates for its EPS are $47.30 for its fiscal 2024 and $58.87 for its fiscal 2025. That gives it a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29.5 for fiscal 2025. That's not a bad price for a stock that is up a ton over a short period of time. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Broadcom's results could fall badly short of expectations if client spending slows. Broadcom has announced a 10-for-1 stock split that is scheduled to take effect on July 15. Companies' share prices often pop following splits -- case and point, leading AI chipmaker Nvidia surged shortly after its recent split. Broadcom's stock split will allow investors to buy a full share for around a tenth of the $1,735 that it currently trades for, which will make the stock more liquid, and more accessible to small investors who might not have access to fractional share trading. Still, investing in a company just because it is splitting its stock is a bad idea. A split does nothing to fundamentally change the value of the underlying business. However, Broadcom's strong results and guidance are important for the wider tech sector because they showcase the depth and breadth of AI-driven value creation. The company's Ethernet networking switches and AI accelerators for hyperscale customers are driving its AI revenue -- which is now expected to be $11 billion in fiscal 2024. That's more than the entire company's top line less than a decade ago. Broadcom makes tons of storage and system products, wireless and wired connectivity solutions, fiber optic solutions, cable modems, software and cybersecurity products, and more. Its broad-based portfolio of semiconductor and infrastructure solutions makes it a good bellwether for the broader industry -- perhaps an even better one than Nvidia. So when Broadcom's core business and AI growth are both doing well, it's a great sign that conditions are strong across the semiconductor industry. Expand NASDAQ : AVGO Broadcom Today's Change ( -1.79 %) $ -6.43 Current Price $ 351.96 Key Data Points Market Cap $1692B Day's Range $ 349.67 - $ 361.88 52wk Range $ 138.10 - $ 386.48 Volume 16M Avg Vol 23M Gross Margin 63.13 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % The best way to approach the tech sector The tech sector is one of the most uniquely diversified sectors in the market. There are the integrated majors like Apple and Microsoft. Then there are the software giants, cloud infrastructure companies, semiconductor designers and manufacturers, electronic parts and components suppliers, and more. Which of those subgroups is leading the way for the sector can change based on myriad factors, such as valuation, growth, or the cyclicality of the business cycle. Now that the semiconductor industry has rallied so much in such a short period of time, some investors may be inclined to sell tech stocks in search of other opportunities. But some pockets of the sector, like enterprise software, have lagged behind, and they still have the opportunity to make up that ground. Instead of betting on a particular tech industry segment or company, some investors may prefer to put their money into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF . Its expense ratio is just 0.1% and it provides diversified exposure to the entire sector , so it's a low-cost way to bet on a sustained gold rush in AI rather than choosing a particular supplier of "picks and shovels" like Broadcom or a specific "miner" like Adobe. Ultimately, the sector's performance heavily depends on Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia since they all sport market caps over $3 trillion. Strong results and upbeat guidance from industry leaders like Adobe and Broadcom indicate that the sector isn't overextended and could still be a good value. Aside from buying an ETF, the best way to approach the tech sector is by investing in companies you believe can compound their earnings growth over the long term rather than beat expectations for a quarter or two. The higher the expectations built into a stock's price, the more room there is for disappointment to send it tumbling. Maintaining a time horizon of at least three to five years will help ensure your priorities align with an investment thesis rather than getting too caught up in the market's noise.

Latest News National Sports World Business Entertainment Royal Videos Hollywood Technology Health Trending Today's Paper Opinion Writer's Archive Magazines TNS Instep Money Matters YOU US Tech sector endures slowest quarter in three years The sector’s contribution to GDP in the fiscal quarter ending June is projected to be just Rs258.3 billion By Sami Subhani June 17, 2024 A representational image of young people working in a company. — AFP/File KARACHI: After over a decade of robust performance, Pakistan’s information and communications sector has recorded the lowest growth in three years (12 quarters) as per a report by IT consulting firm Data Darbar. The sector’s contribution to GDP in the fiscal quarter ending June is projected to be just Rs258.3 billion. Based on the report’s analysis of data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the sector’s GDP contribution is projected to decline by 3.02 per cent in FY2023-24 overall. This is the second consecutive fiscal year the sector has contracted. Notably, the drop is much sharper this year after a more modest 0.8 per cent fall off in FY2022-23. This decline comes after a decade as the fastest growing broad sector in the economy, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of over 6.0 per cent between FY2014-15 and FY2023-24. Often used as a proxy for the tech sector, information and communications also includes telecommunications and broadcasting and publishing. According to the report, the current slowdown extends to tech as well -- with ICT exports rising by just 2.5 per cent in 2023 to $2.72 billion. This is the slowest rate of increase since 2015 and the second year in a row ICT exports growth has been in the single digits. Pakistan’s ICT exports also remain highly concentrated, with the UAE and US accounting for almost 74 per cent of the country’s ICT exports. Talking to The News, Data Darbar co-founder Mutaher Khan says that, while there has been a global slowdown in IT, this should not have an outsized impact on Pakistan’s tech sector given the country’s relatively small footprint in the global market. Instead, he points to the uncertainty in the rupee since May 2022 that has led to more money being parked outside the country which translates into lower export figures. Khan also points to a stagnation in terms of the supply of IT and other technical graduates in Pakistan. “The entry of technical people into the market is no longer growing as fast and the supply of the universities is roughly where it was three years ago”, he adds, highlighting the lack of growth in terms of those with the required skills. A post-budget press release by the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) also highlighted the skills deficit in the tech sector. The higher income tax burden on the salaried class “will further fuel the brain drain of the skilled workforce from the IT industry of Pakistan”, explained P@SHA, its Chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan saying that the IT industry is already grappling with a lack of skilled and highly-skilled workforce. He added that “the government should have given a special package to the human resource pool to enable IT companies [to] continue with the momentum of double-digit growth in IT exports”. In terms of what the government can do to help the sector, Mutaher points towards facilitating access to hardware instead of making devices more expensive through additional taxes, allowing export-oriented companies complete retention for forex and easing the repatriation process and ensuring connectivity by not throttling internet speeds and encouraging investments. For sustained long-term growth, making investments in the education sector and expanding the labour supply will be imperative.

Apple ( AAPL +2.12% ) and Oracle ( ORCL 2.05% ) blasted to all-time highs on Wednesday. Apple is up over 14% in the last month -- the recent rally primarily fueled by a positive response to its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple is integrating artificial intelligence (AI) across several key product categories. Meanwhile, Oracle is up 19% in the last month, getting an additional boost from its recent financial results and guidance. Since Oracle is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, you won't find it in the Nasdaq Composite or Nasdaq-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But you will find both Apple and Oracle in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( VTI +0.24% ) , the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO +0.23% ) , and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) . Here's a primer on each fund, why all three funds just hit all-time highs, and the best one to buy now. Image source: Getty Images. Diversified exposure The Total Stock Market ETF and S&P 500 ETF are the two largest Vanguard ETFs -- both featuring over $1 trillion in net assets. Both funds have 0.03% expense ratios -- or $3 in annual fees per $10,000 invested. The low cost and simplicity of these funds make them great choices for folks looking for a passive yet effective way to mirror the broader market's performance. The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has 3,719 holdings compared to 504 holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. However, the largest companies are so valuable that the S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of the market cap of the U.S. stock market. This dynamic makes the performance of the two ETFs very similar. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will generally do better than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if mega-cap and large-cap stocks are outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The last 18 months or so is a great example of what you can expect when megacaps are leading the market higher. MGK data by YCharts . As you can see in the chart, mega-cap growth has crushed the S&P 500, while mega-cap stocks have done well, while mid and small caps have done poorly. But even under those circumstances, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has only outperformed the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF by a couple of percentage points. So despite the significant difference in quantity of holdings between the two funds, both perform practically the same because the S&P 500 makes up such a large share of the broader market. An inexpensive way to invest in the hottest stock market sector The simplest way to invest in companies like Apple and Oracle without racking up large fees is through the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. It has a higher expense ratio at 0.1% compared to 0.03% for the larger Vanguard funds. But that's only a $7 difference per $10,000 invested. The tech sector is chock-full of high-octane growth stocks -- including the three most valuable companies in the world -- Apple, Microsoft ( MSFT +0.53% ) , and Nvidia ( NVDA 3.06% ) . But it also includes more pick-and-shovel plays -- like materials and component suppliers. Still, the fund is basically going to boom or bust according to the performance of its three largest holdings and the two largest industries, semiconductors and software. The semiconductor industry has been a huge winner from the AI-induced run-up in the market. The two best examples are Nvidia, which became the third company valued at over $3 trillion, and Broadcom , which surpassed $800 billion in market cap on Friday after blowing earnings expectations out of the water. With the tech sector contributing 30.6% of the S&P 500 and the semiconductor industry comprising 27.6% of the tech sector, some simple math tells us that the industry now makes up a whopping 8.5% or so of the entire S&P 500. For context, that means the semiconductor industry has about the same weighting as the entire industrial sector or energy, utilities, and materials combined . The tech sector includes companies that provide the computing power needed to run complex AI models, as well as companies that are investing in ways to apply AI for enterprises and consumers. For that reason, it stands out as the best sector to invest in if you want exposure to the growing trend . A well-deserved premium valuation The danger of buying red-hot tech stocks right now is valuation. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a 42.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Earnings growth has been strong, but many of the gains have been due to a valuation expansion. Apple's P/E ratio is up to 33.2 compared to its three-year median of 28.1. Microsoft has a 38.2 P/E, while its three-year median is 33.3. Oracle's P/E is 37 compared to a three-year median of 30.2. The list goes on and on. Over the long term, tech companies are perfectly positioned to deploy capital toward high-margin opportunities that lead to earnings growth. The sector is admittedly a little overextended at this point from a valuation standpoint, but it still has what it takes to be a good investment. And for that reason, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a better buy than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if you have a high risk tolerance.

Jennifer Bush Fenwick & West LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Lynk Labs has presented an argument to the Federal Circuit, asserting that patent applications should only be utilized to invalidate patents in inter partes reviews based on their publication date. Currently, the filing date of the printed publication is typically the prevailing consideration. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Samsung, and various tech industry groups, including the High Tech Inventors Alliance, are encouraging the Federal Circuit to dismiss Lynk Labs' assertion. Some opponents argue that focusing solely on the publication date could potentially exclude up to 18 months' worth of prior art from the scope of review. If the Federal Circuit sides with Lynk Labs, it could significantly impact the practice of inter partes reviews, with further implications for patent law and innovation. It's crucial to monitor the outcome of this debate, as it may influence the way patent applications are evaluated in the future. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Samsung and several tech industry groups, including the HTIA, have urged the Federal Circuit to reject Lynk Labs' argument that patent applications can only be used to invalidate patents in inter partes reviews based on their publication date, saying the filing date is what counts. www.law360.com/...

Business | Business News Raspberry Pi shares jump 40% after London IPO The computing firm said the listing would raise £166 million, in a welcome boost for the London Stock Exchange. Raspberry Pi’s shares jumped on Tuesday morning (Raspberry Pi/PA) PA Media Alex Daniel 11 June 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . UK budget computer firm Raspberry Pi’s shares soared as much as 40% on Tuesday morning after its initial public offering (IPO). Raspberry Pi’s shares hit 392p in early trading, above its IPO price of 280p, which was announced before markets opened. The IPO terms suggested a valuation of £541.6 million, the company said in a stock market update. Raspberry Pi said the listing would raise £166 million. Shares began trading in “conditional dealing”, where institutional investors and those on the London Stock Exchange on June 11, with a full open trade due to begin on Friday. Eben Upton, chief executive of Raspberry Pi, said: “The quality of the interactions during the marketing process has underlined our belief that London has the right calibre and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi. “The reaction that we have received is a reflection of the world-class team that we have assembled and the strength of the loyal community with whom we have grown.” The IPO has been hyped as a welcome victory for the London market, which has been hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad. Paddy Power-owner Flutter has moved its main stock market listing to New York while German-owned Tui approved a plan to delist from London in February, and in another blow UK chip maker Arm Holdings chose Wall Street over London for its stock market return. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said the listing was a “warm welcome” from investors. She added: “This is a sign that there is life in the London stock market, and companies can derive value from listing in London. “It is also a decent payday for the company’s founders and directors. “While the value PC maker has a small listing, especially compared to some of the tech giants in the US, it is a company with links to its bigger brothers and sisters in the tech sector, and prior to listing it had recently secured funding from Sony – and Arm is one of its cornerstone investors.” Read More Ireland’s competition watchdog to investigate Ticketmaster Oasis ticket sales Man who tried to smuggle migrants crammed in motorhome seat compartments jailed PM attends small boats summit as Home Secretary insists progress is being made Save £20 per person on autumn and Christmas days out by steam It comes amid reports that Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is also preparing to file for a listing in London. Arm and fellow Raspberry Pi investor Lansdowne Partners have agreed to also buy 35 million US dollars (£27.5 million) and 20 million US dollars (£15.7 million) worth of shares respectively as part of the IPO plans. Raspberry Pi said it would use cash from the equity raised for engineering projects, improving its supply chain, and other general corporate purposes. Raspberry Pi was founded by computer scientist Eben Upton in 2008 before releasing its first product in 2012. It has since sold more than 60 million of its single board computers alone. The group’s products are sold across more than 70 countries worldwide. It is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation – a UK charity founded when the company was set up in 2008, with the goal of promoting interest in computer science among young people. As a major shareholder in Raspberry Pi, the foundation has received around 50 million US dollars (£39.7 million) in dividends since 2013, which has been used to advance its educational mission globally, according to the group. Raspberry Pi reported revenues of 265.8 million US dollars (£211.1 million) in 2023, with operating profits of 37.5 million US dollars (£29.8 million).

Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Artificial intelligence ( AI ) leader Nvidia ( NVDA ) is now trading on a split-adjusted basis. The company successfully underwent a 10-for-1 stock split, and shares are now trading at a lower level. For retail investors, this will likely be a tempting opportunity to acquire shares. Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Today marks a key event that many investors have been waiting for. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), the artificial intelligence ( AI ) leader dominating the tech sector, begins trading on a split-adjusted basis . After weeks of anticipation, NVDA stock now trades at a much lower price. As of this writing, it is trading at $120 per share after closing out trading last week at more than $1200. Investors who held shares last week have seen their holdings increase, as the company has issued 10 shares for each previous one. They haven’t lost money, but they stand to make more when the new stock returns to its previous levels. NVDA on a Post-Split Basis NVDA stock dipped slightly in pre-market trading today. While it is currently still down, the stock is likely to pick up momentum soon. For anyone who didn’t purchase Nvidia prior to the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, which sent it soaring, this is a chance to add it to their portfolio. Companies enact stock splits to organically lower share prices to make them more accessible to new investors, and there is likely no shortage of people who want to acquire NVDA stock. One interesting factor to consider is that NVDA stock traded at $120 per share less than two years ago. In October 2022, before OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and sent AI stocks into new territory, it hovered right around that price. Since then, the tech sector leader has enjoyed a 900% growth rate, dominating markets and ushering in a new wave of industry. And plenty of experts believe it will continue rising from here. As MarketWatch reports : “For investors who think Nvidia already rules the S&P 500 SPX , Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis outlined a path for the stock to become even more dominant within the index. Nvidia has a similar weighting to Apple Inc. within the S&P 500, at around 6% to 7%, he flagged. But Lipacis thinks Nvidia’s weighting could grow to 10% to 15% as the market is still in the midst of a transition into a new computing era.” Analysts Remain Bullish on NVDA Stock Other Wall Street firms remain as bullish on NVDA stock as ever. Just today, analysts from both Barclays and Susquehanna raised their price targets, while one from TD Cowen updated his “buy” rating. The stock still receives a “strong buy consensus” on TipRanks, with 37 out of 40 analysts calling it a “buy.” Even while short bets on Nvidia stock increased ahead of the stock split, most experts clearly aren’t worried about the company’s growth prospects as it adjusts to trading on a split-adjusted basis.

Internet 2 min read Mississippi is the latest state sued by tech group over age verification on websites The lawsuit challenging the new Mississippi law was filed in federal court in Jackson by NetChoice, whose members include Google, which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. AP Updated On Jun 8, 2024 at 07:55 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch waves to the crowd at a Trump for President rally in Jackson, Miss., Thursday, June 6, 2024. Fitch was named a defendant in a lawsuit filed Friday, June 7, 2024, in federal court over a new Mississippi law requiring users of websites and other digital services to register their age. The suit by the tech industry group NetChoice contends the law will unconstitutionally limit access to online speech for minors and adults. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) JACKSON, Mississippi: A new Mississippi law requiring users of websites and other digital services to verify their age will unconstitutionally limit access to online speech for minors and adults, a tech industry group says in a lawsuit filed Friday. Advt Legislators said the new law is designed to protect children from sexually explicit material. The measure passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate without opposition from either party. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed it April 30, and it is set to become law July 1. The lawsuit challenging the new Mississippi law was filed in federal court in Jackson by NetChoice , whose members include Google , which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. NetChoice has persuaded judges to block similar laws in other states, including Arkansas, California and Ohio. The Mississippi law "mandates that minors and adults alike verify their ages - which may include handing over personal information or identification that many are unwilling or unable to provide - as a precondition to access and engage in protected speech," the lawsuit says. "Such requirements abridge the freedom of speech and thus violate the First Amendment." The lawsuit also says the Mississippi law would replace websites' voluntary content-moderation efforts with state-mandated censorship. "Furthermore, the broad, subjective, and vague categories of speech that the Act requires websites to monitor and censor could reach everything from classic literature, such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'The Bell Jar,' to modern media like pop songs by Taylor Swift," the lawsuit says. Advt Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch is the defendant named in the lawsuit. The attorney general's office does not comment on active litigation but "looks forward to defending the State's law that gives parents the help they need to protect their children online," communications director MaryAsa Lee said. Utah is among the states sued by NetChoice over laws that imposed strict limits for children seeking access to social media. In March, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed revisions to the Utah laws. The new laws require social media companies to verify their users' ages and disable certain features on accounts owned by Utah youths. Utah legislators also removed a requirement that parents consent to their child opening an account after many raised concerns that they would need to enter data that could compromise their online security.

After more than two decades of service to the country’s Info Tech industry as a reliable supplier to customers across the spectrum, and by enhancing the visibility and use of information technology in Guyana, Starr Computers is ‘shifting gears’ in response to what it sees as further investor interests in the country’s expanding investment profile. Speaking with the Stabroek Business from the company’s multistoried complex on Tuesday, Starr President, Mike Mohan. unveiled plans that are now in train to retain the company’s long-term interest in directly serving the local tech industry, whilst directing its attention to other entrepreneurial opportunities to fit in with what he sees as the direction in which the local economy is heading. Starr’s new focus is centered on providing various forms of support, including accommodation in the Starr Complex and access to the conveniences that it offers, according to Mohan. Starr Computers President Mike Mohan While a visit by Stabroek Business on Wednesday to the company’s Brickdam business premises revealed that Starr has retained and even extended the extent of the range of goods and services which it provides to the information technology sector, an interview with Mohan revealed that the company’s Brickdam complex is undergoing physical adjustments in line with the management’s decision to expand its suite of services in order to render the company adaptable to the interests of would-be investors. During last Thursday’s interview, Mohan named a highly visible US technology company which he is seeking to ‘entice’ into utilizing the physical space and operating conveniences currently being offered at the Brickdam complex. During the interview Mohan told the Stabroek Business that while Star remains committed to the growth of the information technology sector in Guyana, and particularly to the development of IT as a discipline in the school system, the company was seeking to accomplish this goal whilst seeking to respond to the transformations which Guyana is now experiencing, including those that offered new opportunities and new income streams to investors. Mohan told the Stabroek Business that from his vantage point in the United States, he had been “monitoring closely” some of the responses of would-be investors and has decided that both Starr and its multi—storied Brick-dam complex can help ‘fit in’ with Guyana’s investment objectives. The move, according to Mohan, is designed to allow Starr Computers to remain aligned to its original business model whilst following what he sees as the direction in which the company is heading. From the Guyanese businessman’s vantage point in the United States, he has been monitoring the flood on investor interest in Guyana and has decided that a complex that currently houses his own company can become a focal point for expatriate businesses wishing to pay an interest in the investment opportunities that exist here.

Title: Nvidia ( NVDA ) Stock Grabs No . 2 Spot from Apple After Huge Move to $3 Trillion

Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Nvidia ( NVDA ) managed to become the world’s second-most valuable company this week. Yesterday, Nvidia surpassed Apple’s ( APPL ) market capitalization, topping $3 trillion. This means NVDA stock currently only lags behind Microsoft ( MSFT ), which it could catch up to soon. Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Yesterday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) achieved yet another milestone. The semiconductor and artificial intelligence ( AI ) leader surpassed one of the tech sector’s biggest names on the market capitalization list, blowing past Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) this week. With NVDA stock continuing its winning streak, Nvidia touched a market cap of $3 trillion, ultimately reaching $3.005 trillion earlier today. At $3.002 trillion, Apple was just below it, although Nvidia is now back at $2.98 trillion as of this writing. Meanwhile, both tech giants still trail Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and its market cap of $3.14 trillion. At this point, it seems as though Nvidia can’t be stopped. What’s more, with its upcoming 10-for-1 stock split, interest in NVDA stock will likely keep rising as investors rush to pile into the AI breakout sensation. What’s Happening With NVDA Stock? Even after yesterday’s good news, NVDA stock slipped into the red this morning, now down about 1%. Still, Nvidia has performed extremely well over the past month, rising above the $1,200 mark with gains of more than 30%. As CNBC reports, this type of growth shows that investors are becoming more and more comfortable with Nvidia’s growth prospects. NVDA stock has demonstrated an impressive ability to climb through volatile economic conditions throughout the past year. But now it is becoming clear that the AI leader can continue to dominate the booming market by making sales to a “handful of cloud companies.” Indeed, even Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk expects to make a large chip order from Nvidia later this year. Nvidia stock has shown that it can become even more valuable than many of the tech sector’s biggest names. The upcoming NVDA stock split is likely to spur even more growth . Per InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto: “Of course, with this intense performance comes the reality that the per-share price is too expensive for retail investors lacking access to fractional ownership capabilities. By splitting NVDA stock, nothing fundamentally changes in terms of the action itself. However, the move dilutes the share pool to make each unit cheaper, thus enhancing accessibility . This, in turn, may cause retail investors on the sidelines to jump in.” As it stands, Nvidia essentially has one more name to pass before it becomes the world’s most valuable company. The stock split could help it accomplish just that. And even if it doesn’t, Nvidia could still reach that milestone this year given its current growth trajectory.

Hamza Shaban June 5, 2024 at 12:32 PM 1 Copied As Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) pivots to incorporate AI technology across its array of services , its parent company, Alphabet, is bringing on a new CFO. Anat Ashkenazi, a 23-year veteran of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly ( LLY ), will become the top financial officer and senior vice president of Google and Alphabet at the end of next month, the tech giant announced Wednesday. The move comes at a pivotal moment for Google . The two-trillion-dollar tech company is waist-deep in a transition to harness the power and excitement around generative AI. It’s churning out huge investments in data centers and infrastructure and is retooling flagship products to claim turf in the burgeoning market for AI tools. The digital advertising king aims to be the dominant player in the next era of computing. Ashkenazi comes to Google after overseeing a period of staggering growth . Eli Lilly’s share price has surged close to 700% over the past five years. Among its newer products are Mounjaro and Zepbound. Both medicines are from the increasingly popular class of drugs that lower blood sugar and promote weight loss. Ruth Porat, who has served as Google’s CFO since 2015, was promoted to president and chief investment officer last year . She will oversee investments in Other Bets, as well as regulatory matters and international expansion. Google shares gained 0.9% Wednesday. This year’s heated competition to deploy new software built around large language models follows a period of uncertainty and volatility for Google and its Big Tech rivals. Liz Reid, Google head of Search, speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) After investors flocked to tech companies during the acute phase of the pandemic, the stay-at-home economy began to open up. And as inflation reached historic levels, the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign initially squeezed the tech sector, prompting mass layoffs and a brutal period of financial bloodletting. But the enthusiasm around AI's potential has reinvigorated the tech sector, providing Ashkenazi with immense opportunities and challenges. While Google was seen by many to have been caught flat-footed after the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the company has gone on to unveil a slew of AI services for businesses and consumers. But there have been missteps. Several of the company’s newest AI features were deficient , providing fodder for competitors and critics of the company’s haphazard rollout. At a crucial promotion last year, Google’s chatbot Bard shared incorrect information about a NASA space telescope, leading to a $100 billion loss in the market value of the company. A year later, users of Bard’s successor, Gemini, discovered that the image generation tool created inaccurate or unexpected results of historical figures. And last month, after Google unveiled AI Overviews, a new search tool that gives users AI-generated answers to search results, the service gave users incorrect or absurd results in response to some queries. A key challenge for Ashkenazi will be monetizing these and other AI tools while safeguarding Google’s legacy search business, which may itself be threatened by users increasingly turning to AI services. Despite the recent blunders, many view Google as well positioned to capitalize on the AI transition. The company posted standout quarterly results in April and further incentivized shareholders with the double whammy of a new cash dividend and a massive stock repurchase program. Shares are up more than 25% for the year. Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban .

Australian shares snapped a three-day losing streak on Friday, sending the S & P/ASX 200 up 1 per cent, or 73.5 points, to 7701.7 points. For the week, the benchmark index finished down 0.3 per cent as investors sold equities after hotter-than-expected inflation data for April pushed back the timeline for when the Reserve Bank may start cutting interest rates. On Wall Street overnight the Nasdaq index retreated 1.1 per cent after enterprise software giant and Slack-owner Salesforce plummeted 19.7 per cent on its trading update. The yield on one-year Australian bonds added 4 basis points to 4.45 per cent over the session and has added 12 basis points since Wednesday. On Friday night AEST the US personal income, spending and price report is expected to influence the direction of sharemarkets next week as a key signpost for the future direction of US interest rates. Economists expect the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation – will rise 0.2 per cent in April. Stocks in focus On the ASX every sector finished higher, except the interest rate sensitive property sector which lost 0.2 per cent. The best-performing sector on the day was consumer staples, boosted by a 2.8 per cent rise for Treasury Wine estates to $11.33. Bega Cheese surged 6.2 per cent to $4.46 and Woolworth rose 2 per cent to $31.60. The big four banks also finished higher with Commonwealth Bank rallying 1.3 per cent, to 119.54 and ANZ climbing 1.2 per cent to $28.25. Westpac and National Australia Bank rose less than 1 per cent. The best-performing stock on the benchmark index was Telix Pharmaceuticals. It jumped 15.3 per cent to $18.15 after broker Wilsons issued a positive note on the business and its latest clinical trial results. The biotech sensation has climbed around 1380 per cent in five years to a $5.4 billion valuation.

Canada’s main stock index differentiated itself from sliding U.S. markets Thursday, gaining more than 150 points on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results from Royal Bank and CIBC. The S&P/TSX composite index was up 173.73 points at 22,071.71, driven by gains in the financial sector, which climbed 1.89 per cent in the day’s trading. The big winners were Royal Bank — which closed up 5.19 per cent after announcing a dividend hike and share buyback plan in the wake of the successful close of its HSBC Canada acquisition – and CIBC, which gained 7.01 per cent after reporting a second-quarter profit of $1.75 billion, up from $1.69 billion in the same quarter last year. South of the border, it was a different story. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 330.06 points at 38,111.48, while the S&P 500 index was down 31.47 points at 5,235.48. The Nasdaq composite closed down 183.50 points at 16,737.08. Story continues below advertisement The declines were largely the result of losses in the tech sector. U.S. software giant Salesforce saw its stock suffer its worst day in nearly 20 years, losing nearly a fifth of its value after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Nvidia also fell Thursday, sinking 3.8 per cent for its first drop since soaring more than 20 per cent following its earnings report last week. The tech-sector losses were significant enough to drag down the main U.S. indexes even though the majority of Wall Street stocks gained Thursday.

Markets are keenly watching for any signs that could indicate the U.S. Federal Reserve might be getting ready to cut interest rates. Story continues below advertisement While Thursday’s report could be interpreted as evidence in that direction, Gardner said investors are more interested in a different U.S. government report — one that the Federal Reserve prefers to use to measure inflation — set to be released Friday.

While summer is typically a quieter time for stock markets, Gardner said the unusual lack of volatility on the TSX so far this year makes her wonder if the market could be headed for a bit of summer-time choppiness. In the meantime, she said there are still pockets of opportunity out there for savvy investors. “The S&P is still 1.3 per cent below its peak, while the TSX is 1.88 per cent below its peak. So there’s still some room to run, and we are still more bullish than bearish on the stock market,” Gardner said.

Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Excessive volatility presents a case for oversold stocks to buy on the dip. Baidu ( BIDU ): Baidu is a heavily discounted AI play that deserves closer inspection. Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ): Ulta Beauty could rise on the retail revenge concept. Kosmos Energy ( KOS ): Kosmos Energy could swing higher on a geopolitical pivot. Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock.com With the equities space continuing to enjoy its blistering recovery from the doldrums of the Covid-19 crisis, fewer and fewer ideas exist that are considered genuine discounts. Nowadays, several of the desirable market ideas just seem overpriced. However, if you look around, there are still some promising enterprises that make up the ranks of oversold stocks to buy on the dip. The ideas that comprise this category attract eyeballs for one main reason: humans love their discounts. Even those who are financially well off typically can’t resist the allure of getting more for their money. It’s like shopping in the grocery store and coming across a two-for-one deal of products you already buy anyways. Why wouldn’t you take the discount? It’s essentially a gift. That’s roughly the same principle here. Of course, red-stained securities are always liable for even more losses. However, some downtrodden names seem ready for a rebound, particularly because of their relevant businesses. With that in mind, below are oversold stocks to buy on the dip. Baidu (BIDU) Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) makes a great case for oversold stocks to buy on the dip thanks to its underlying innovations. To be sure, it’s understandable why the market doesn’t care for BIDU stock. Since the start of the year, shares have plunged more than 23%. The Chinese economy seems suspect, leading to an exit out of the arena. However, the company is also one of the world’s top internet technology firms. What should really attract contrarians is that the company has invested heavily into artificial intelligence and large language models. Still, few want to give the time of day to BIDU, which suits speculators just fine. Right now, shares trade at 1.69X trailing-year revenue. That’s below the 2X multiple that was seen just in the first quarter. And it’s significantly below the 2.95X posted in Q1 2023. Further, in the past four quarters, Baidu’s average earnings per share reached $2.94. In terms of earnings surprise, this performance translated to 26.23%. That’s impressive. For fiscal 2024, analysts are anticipate a slight dip in EPS to $11.21. On the top line, it sees modest growth of 2% to reach $19.34 billion. Still, with the way the company has been performing, Baidu can surprise. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com I know that the consumer economy is struggling under the weight of inflation and high borrowing costs. Therefore, demand for many enterprises under the discretionary category faces significant pressure. However, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA ) arguably deserves a rethink. As a beauty care specialist, it aligns with the experiential focus that has driven travel-sector-related demand. Fundamentally, the forced quarantines that occurred during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis sparked pent-up demand for vacations and other social events and gatherings. So, I anticipate that Ulta Beauty would benefit a bit more from the retail revenge phenomenon. After all, it was the social mobility aspect that was denied during Covid. Unfortunately, the market doesn’t quite see it that way. Since the year’s start, ULTA stock dipped more than 21%. Fine – but let’s also consider that in the past four quarters, the company’s EPS averaged $6.41. This translated to an earnings surprise of 4.08%. For the current fiscal year, analysts see 3.2% sales growth to $11.56 billion. In the following year, revenue may rise by 6% to hit $12.26 billion. Given the aforementioned fundamentals, ULTA ranks among the oversold stocks to buy on the dip. Kosmos Energy (KOS) Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com Specializing in the upstream oil segment of the hydrocarbon value chain, Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS ) has struggled for traction this year. Since the beginning of January, KOS stock fell almost 22%. That’s ugly and there’s more going on than just a broader focus on clean and renewable energy sources. Instead, geopolitics may be playing a huge role in the undervaluation of KOS. Essentially, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be having a detrimental impact on the part of the aggressor. Ukrainian forces have been attacking Russia’s oil refineries (downstream) in a bid to slow its invasion. As a result, Moscow is losing a key revenue stream. It’s got to make up for that loss by selling huge volumes of crude oil (upstream). Naturally, this dynamic has an impact on upstream specialists. Here’s the thing: this geopolitical crisis can pivot in any number of ways. Further, the cooled tensions in the Middle East could easily reignite. That would surely boost demand for upstream companies. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe Kosmos’ sales could hit $2.01 billion. If so, that would imply almost 50% growth. That seems quite reasonable given the circumstances. Thus, KOS is one of the oversold stocks to buy on the dip.

Title: Biden Border Chief Claims Power to Admit More Illegals

Article Content:
Illegal migrants who are caught and bussed out of the country can use the “CBP One” cellphone app to get government permission to re-enter the United States, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas declared on June 26. “If an [caught] individual has agreed to and been returned voluntarily [to Mexico], are they eligible for a CBP One appointment? They are,” he told a reporter at his tightly managed Tucson press conference on June 26. “They don’t want to actually bar people from coming into the country,” responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “They just want the [illegal migrants] to be laundered through the CBP One process, and this enables them to do that,” he added. “CBP One” is a smartphone app that allows migrants to request entry into the United States via an official gate, dubbed a “Port of Entry.” Mayorkas’s deputies use the process to give a “parole” legal status to illegal economic migrants. That legal spin helps Mayorkas provide the migrants with the work permits they need to pay off their smuggling debts and bring up their family members. A migrant uses the CBP One application during an Al Otro Lado training session in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, Nov. 28 2023. President Biden has argued that he can bring order to the border, while preserving pathways for people to enter the country legally, by taking a more high-tech approach. CBP One is part of the pledge but advocates say the app has crucial flaws. Photographer: Sandy Huffaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Mayorkas — who was recently impeached by the House — also suggested he has the legal authority to raise the inflow of parole migrants via CBP One, regardless of immigration numbers set by Congress in 1965 and 1990. “The number of appointments that are permitted through CBP One — approximately 1,400 to 1,500 a day — are based on the capacity of our ports of entry,” he told a reporter. “They are antiquated ports of entry that are also in need of funding to modernize them.” Mayorkas’s current inflow of 1,500 per day adds up to almost 550,000 a year, or one illegal migrant for every seven American births. “What he’s saying is, if Congress gives us more money [for improving the Ports of Entry], we will wave in illegal aliens even faster — which is the objection Republicans have been making all along,” Krikorian said. He added: This administration has created a parallel illegal method of letting people into the country. There are twice as many illegal aliens coming in as legal immigrants, so this ad hoc, bootstrapped immigration system that they’re creating is twice as large as the actual legal immigration system. The current legal immigration system allows roughly one million migrants, or roughly one extra migrant for every 3.5 American births. Mayorkas’s migration enables the annual inflow of at least three migrants — or almost one migrant for every American birth. Biden’s White House deputies support Mayorkas’s border inflow, Krikorian said: If they wanted to truly veto something that he was doing, they could do it. But I don’t think there’s enough energy in the executive [staff] in the White House to actually change Mayorkas’ behavior, and they don’t necessarily really want to anyway. Mayorkas is perhaps the most powerful member of Biden’s cabinet. He is strongly backed by Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us advocacy group, which represents the interests of West Coast investors. The investors gain wealth and power when the government pulls in consumers, renters, and workers from foreign countries. Mayorkas argues that more migration is an economic and moral necessity, regardless of the damage it does to ordinary Americans, the U.S. economy, and the countries that lose their migrants to the U.S. economy. For example, Mayorkas says he supports migrants and claims the “core founding principle” of the United States is “equity,” and that he is building an immigration system that ensures “equity” for migrants who wish to live and work in Americans’ homeland. Mayorkas is also using immigration as an economic strategy to inflate the overall size of the U.S. economy with extra consumers, renters, and workers. “Regrettably, our legal immigration system is not designed to meet the need of employers here in the United States,” Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkjas told the Senate’s judiciary committee in March 2023. He continued: Individuals from other countries want to come here to work, even seasonally, even temporarily, earn the money that they can bring back to their home countries and support their families there … To fulfill the need for labor here in the United States, we can screen and vet these individuals in their home countries, and they can travel safely to the United States by air, gain lawful employment, contribute to our economy, return to their home countries with the earnings that they’ve made and address fundamentally the root causes of why people travel irregularly in the first place … In December 2022, Mayorkas told ElPasoMatters.org : We look to our partner to the north that has a much more nimble immigration system that can be retooled to the needs at the moment. For example, Canada is in need of 1 million workers and they have agreed that in 2023, they will admit 1.4 million … immigrants to fill that labor need that Canadians themselves cannot. We are stuck in antiquated laws that do not meet our current needs. And they haven’t been working for many, many years. This Mayorkas plan echoes President George W. Bush’s planned “ Any Willing Worker ” plan of 2004. Bush’s plan would have tilted the labor market against families by allowing U.S. employers to freely hire people from around the world “ when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs .” Mayorkas’s migration policies unite the progressive and investor wings of the new Democratic Party into a “ We Coalition .” That coalition uses migration to shift wealth and political power from a broad swath of ordinary Americans towards CEOs, wealthy coastal investors, and government elites. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The rarely mentioned economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.

US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut Business Business US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut Close PCE price index flat in May, up 2.6pc on year-on-year basis Consumer spending gains 0.2pc Personal income up 0.5pc Follow on Updated On: Sat, 29 Jun 2024 08:56:04 PKT WASHINGTON (Reuters) – US monthly inflation was unchanged in May as a modest increase in the cost of services was offset by the largest drop in goods prices in six months, drawing the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting US interest rates later this year. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed US consumer spending rose marginally last month. Underlying prices advanced at the slowest pace in six months, raising optimism that the central bank could engineer a much-desired "soft landing" for the economy in which inflation cools without triggering a recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. Traders raised their bets for a Fed rate cut in September. "This was a very Fed-friendly report that should keep the September rate cut in play, while at the same time increasing investor confidence that moderate economic growth can be maintained even as rates stay higher for longer," said Scott Anderson, chief US economist at BMO Capital Markets. "The sharp slowdown in core inflation is just what the doctor needed to see to keep the economy on the soft-landing glide-path." The flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3 per cent gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. It was the first time in six months that PCE inflation was unchanged. Goods prices fell 0.4pc, the biggest drop since November. There were big declines in prices of recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment. The price of gasoline and other energy goods dropped 3.4pc, the biggest slide in six months. Clothing and footwear were also cheaper, while food prices rose marginally. The cost of services increased 0.2pc, lifted by higher prices for housing and utilities as well as healthcare. Financial services and insurance costs declined 0.3pc after rising for five straight months. These costs, together with housing, have been among the major drivers of services inflation. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6pc after advancing 2.7pc in April. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. US inflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the central bank's 2pc target. Financial markets saw a roughly 68pc chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September compared to about 64pc before the data, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The US central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25pc-5.50pc range since last July. Economists were divided on whether the Fed would still reduce borrowing costs twice this year amid solid wage growth. The release of the US employment report for June next Friday could shed more light on the monetary policy outlook. Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were mixed. SPENDING RISES MODERATELY Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1pc last month, the smallest gain since November. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3pc rise in April. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have climbed 0.2pc in April. Core inflation increased 2.6pc on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8pc in April. It rose at a 2.7pc annualized rate over the past three months, slowing from a 3.5% pace in April. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2pc over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing also ticked up 0.1pc last month after advancing 0.3pc in April. This measure is being watched by policymakers to measure progress in lowering price pressures. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased 0.2pc last month after rising 0.1pc in April, the report also showed. Spending was supported by a 0.3pc gain in services, mostly outlays on hospital care, housing and utilities as well as air transportation. Services spending increased 0.4pc in April. Goods spending rebounded 0.2pc, lifted by outlays on prescription medication, recreational goods and vehicles, and clothing and footwear. Spending on goods fell 0.5pc in April. Inflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs as well as the exhaustion of excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are holding back spending. Nonetheless, consumer spending remains underpinned by a resilient labour market, which continues to generate strong wage gains. Personal income increased 0.5pc after climbing 0.3pc in April. Wages shot up 0.7pc, which some economists said could concern policymakers. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose a solid 0.5pc. Consumers saved more, lifting the US saving rate to 3.9pc from 3.7pc in April. Spending adjusted for inflation rebounded 0.3pc after slipping 0.1pc in April. The rise in the so-called real consumer spending left growth in consumption this quarter on track to match the first quarter's 1.5pc pace. The Atlanta Fed is currently estimating US gross domestic product to rise at a 2.2pc rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4pc pace in the first quarter. "There was no inflation in May, but there was also no indication of the kind of soft demand – undermined by slower income growth – the Fed believes necessary to keep inflation on a low track," said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial.

The flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said today. In the 12 months to May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index unchanged on the month and rising 2.6% year-on-year. US inflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in April. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have gained 0.2% in April. Core inflation increased 2.6% year-on-year in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8% in April. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. The Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.5% range since last July. Though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook, financial markets expect the Fed to start its easing cycle in September. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in April, the report also showed. Inflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs, a moderation in wage gains as well as dwindling savings are holding back spending. US consumer spending slowed sharply in the first quarter, helping to restrict the economy to a 1.4% annualised growth pace. The economy grew at a 3.4% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the second quarter are mostly below a 2% rate.

US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut Grocery store in Washington · Reuters Lucia Mutikani Updated June 28, 2024 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly inflation was unchanged in May as a modest increase in the cost of services was offset by the largest drop in goods prices in six months, drawing the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting interest rates later this year. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed consumer spending rose marginally last month. Underlying prices advanced at the slowest pace in six months, raising optimism that the U.S. central bank could engineer a much-desired "soft landing" for the economy in which inflation cools without triggering a recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. Traders raised their bets for a Fed rate cut in September. "This was a very Fed-friendly report that should keep the September rate cut in play, while at the same time increasing investor confidence that moderate economic growth can be maintained even as rates stay higher for longer," said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. "The sharp slowdown in core inflation is just what the doctor needed to see to keep the economy on the soft-landing glide-path." The flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3% gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. It was the first time in six months that PCE inflation was unchanged. Goods prices fell 0.4%, the biggest drop since November. There were big declines in prices of recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment. The price of gasoline and other energy goods dropped 3.4%, the biggest slide in six months. Clothing and footwear were also cheaper, while food prices rose marginally. The cost of services increased 0.2%, lifted by higher prices for housing and utilities as well as healthcare. Financial services and insurance costs declined 0.3% after rising for five straight months. These costs, together with housing, have been among the major drivers of services inflation. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after advancing 2.7% in April. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. Inflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the central bank's 2% target. Financial markets saw a roughly 68% chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September compared to about 64% before the data, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The U.S. central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. Story Continues Economists were divided on whether the Fed would still reduce borrowing costs twice this year amid solid wage growth. The release of the U.S. employment report for June next Friday could shed more light on the monetary policy outlook. Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. SPENDING RISES MODERATELY Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since November. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in April. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have climbed 0.2% in April. Core inflation increased 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8% in April. It rose at a 2.7% annualized rate over the past three months, slowing from a 3.5% pace in April. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing also ticked up 0.1% last month after advancing 0.3% in April. This measure is being watched by policymakers to measure progress in lowering price pressures. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in April, the report also showed. Spending was supported by a 0.3% gain in services, mostly outlays on hospital care, housing and utilities as well as air transportation. Services spending increased 0.4% in April. Goods spending rebounded 0.2%, lifted by outlays on prescription medication, recreational goods and vehicles, and clothing and footwear. Spending on goods fell 0.5% in April. Inflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs as well as the exhaustion of excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are holding back spending. Nonetheless, consumer spending remains underpinned by a resilient labor market, which continues to generate strong wage gains. Personal income increased 0.5% after climbing 0.3% in April. Wages shot up 0.7%, which some economists said could concern policymakers. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose a solid 0.5%. Consumers saved more, lifting the saving rate to 3.9% from 3.7% in April. Spending adjusted for inflation rebounded 0.3% after slipping 0.1% in April. The rise in the so-called real consumer spending left growth in consumption this quarter on track to match the first quarter's 1.5% pace. The Atlanta Fed is currently estimating gross domestic product to rise at a 2.2% rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4% pace in the first quarter. "There was no inflation in May, but there was also no indication of the kind of soft demand - undermined by slower income growth - the Fed believes necessary to keep inflation on a low track," said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial.

Title: Retail media is seeing a surge this year

Retail media will account for more than a fifth of all digital ad spending in 2024 (Image credit: AlexSecret / Getty Images) By Justin Klawans, The Week US published 28 June 2024 There may be no bigger scramble in business right now than the race to dominate retail media. What was a relatively new concept just a few years ago has now been brought to the forefront of the digital advertising world , and looks primed to become one of the main sources of revenue for major brands. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than at Cannes Lions, a global advertising festival held in France just weeks after the prestigious Cannes Film Festival . Cannes Lions attracts advertisers from around the world, and this year, retail media dominated the event; this comes as major retailers' "online businesses continue to intersect with the marketing world," said Marketing Brew . But how does retail media work, and why is it primed to dominate the advertising industry? What is retail media? At its most basic, retail media is "when a retailer offers advertising capabilities and services, similar to what media outlets such as publishers and television networks have done for years," said Retail TouchPoints . These advertisements can play out in a variety of ways. The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Sign up This can include "'on-site' advertising opportunities — such as ads and videos on [a retailer's] own website, app or even in its physical stores ," said Retail TouchPoints. The flipside of this is "off-site" advertising, when a retailer "lets advertisers leverage its first party data to reach customers on third-party channels like social media." These two forms make up the majority of the retail media network, though "off-site retail media is typically more complex than on-site." How big is the retail media industry? Massive — to a level the average consumer may not realize. Global retail media spend will reach $140 billion this year, according to eMarketer . This will account for more than a fifth of all digital ad spending in 2024 and marks a 21% increase year-to-year from retail media spending in 2023. When looking at individual companies, the scale of their retail media revenues is staggering; one notable example is Amazon , which earned $46.9 billion from retail ads. This figure "exceeds the annual global revenue of Coca-Cola and makes Amazon the third-largest advertising platform in the United States, behind only Google and Facebook," said the Harvard Business Review (HBR) . What comes next for retail media? The industry isn't slowing down anytime soon: Another report from eMarketer found that U.S. retail media spend alone will reach $129 billion by 2028, up from $54 billion this year. Global retail media spend will likely balloon accordingly as well. The industry is "becoming vital to ad channels outside of retail media networks as the first-party data it gathers from retailers allows for better targeting across social, search, and the open web," said eMarketer.

It is now shoppers themselves that are the "new product being sold in-store and online," said Mark Boidman, the head of global media at Solomon Partners, to Axios. Competing within the retail media space "might mean changing what you stand for as a business. It might mean I am no longer a retailer; I am instead a category owner," said Donna Sharp, a managing director at MediaLink. This marks a noted changed in the landscape over the past decade. Few brands "anticipated 10 years ago that advertising would become a huge growth driver for them , but Amazon's success has goaded them into action," said HBR. Companies "as varied as Dick's Sporting Goods, Home Depot, Instacart, Lowe's, Macy's, Ulta, and Walmart now all own and operate retail media platforms." Many of these companies are entering the space because they are "recognizing that it's a growth opportunity not to be missed," and that it is a "high-growth, high-margin advertising business, one that contrasts favorably with retailers' low-growth, low-margin core businesses." But there are still challenges surrounding retail media; this is especially true for brands "within retail media networks where the retail media teams operate separately from their sales or merchandizing teams," said Adweek . And trying to compare trends across retail media networks is still "apples and oranges," General Mills Head of Experience Sarah Leinberger said to Adweek. "Sometimes they're not even fruit," added Clorox Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Eric Schwartz.

Title: Why You Should Care About A Revision To the Country Economic Growth Measure

SAUL LOEB / Contributor / Getty Images Close The third and final estimate of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed economic growth was a tick higher in Q1 than previously thought, but still considerably slower than the prior quarter. One thing dragging on GDP is slowed consumer spending, and this revision showed those levels are even lower than originally thought. Consumer spending has been the engine of the economy in the recovery from the pandemic and slower spending could indicate that the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation is taking a toll. The final word on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter is out, and it confirms that U.S. economic growth slowed considerably in the first quarter, but not quite as dramatically as an earlier estimate showed. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.4% in the first quarter, down from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. It was the third and final estimate of GDP growth, revising figures that first came out in April. The second estimate, in May, had shown a 1.3% growth rate. The latest reading on GDP, which measures the country’s entire economic output, incorporated new data showing that the U.S. imported fewer goods and services than previously thought. More imports take away from the country's economic output. GDP Revision Shows Slower Consumer Spending The lessened impact of imports outweighed declines in the estimates for several other areas, including consumer spending, the main engine of the economy. The 1.4% rate was in line with the expectations of forecasters, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal . The GDP reading indicates the economy has slowed as the Federal Reserve’s high interest rates have discouraged borrowing and spending, as intended, to subdue high inflation. The economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, meaning that those high rates have yet to cause a recession. That could change if consumer spending continues to drop. “The cycle that we’re in has been led by consumer spending and if that slows then it could be the beginning of a downturn in economic activity, which would have negative implications for corporate profits and the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, wrote in a commentary. However, economists expect GDP won't signal an economic slump this year. According to the early estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, GDP is expected to nearly double in the second quarter, rising to 3.0%. "The monthly data are beginning to flag some slowdown though we think the economy will hold up well in the back half of the year," wrote Nationwide's Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin.

The pandemic savings cushions that helped Americans weather high prices in recent years have worn through, contributing to a loss of consumer firepower that’s rippling through the economy. Delinquencies are rising. Executives are flagging caution among shoppers in recent earnings calls, and retail sales barely increased in May after falling the month prior. Economists forecast solid inflation-adjusted consumer spending in data out Friday, helped by lower gasoline prices, but that would follow an outright decline in April.

Title: How do Prop Firms Make Money ? ( Updated [ year ])

Retail prop trading continues to expand and ranks among the hottest trends, but most potential retail prop traders do not understand the business model. They only look at massively funded accounts, but how do prop firms make money? I will explain the business model of retail prop firms, the difference between retail prop firms and professional prop firms, and help interested traders make an informed decision before starting a paid-for challenge with a Forex prop firm. The first step is understating how retail prop firms make money. Top Forex Brokers 1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read Review Understanding the Business of Proprietary Trading Firms There is a stark difference between the revenue models of retail prop trading firms and those of licensed, professional financial firms, hedge funds, and firms that specialize in high-frequency trading . I will focus on the business model of retail forex prop trading firms and explain their approach. Before answering the question of how prop firms make money, retail prop traders must understand the following: They will never trade real money and always manage demo accounts Retail prop firms use copy trading software to copy trades from demo to live accounts they manage Here is the business model of retail prop trading firms: Managing partners have trading capital Retail prop firms seek profitable retail traders that lack capital A paid-for challenge model serves as an initial test and a massive monthly revenue stream Few retail traders pass the challenge. Retail prop traders pay a monthly fee for access to capital A profit-share model provides the prop firm with ongoing capital and rewards traders with income Strict risk management protocols leave little room for error, and retail prop firms kick out traders as soon as they breach a tight drawdown window Do Prop Firms Use Real Money? Most retail prop firms never use real money or live accounts when dealing with prop traders. All challenges or evaluations are in demo accounts, and no actual trading occurs at retail prop firms. So, the name is misleading as it suggests a professional trading firm, while retail prop firms fall into the category of financial games, which is why they remain unregulated. Prospective traders pay for an evaluation account, which retail prop firms provide as a demo account in partnership with their broker or brokers. The one-time evaluation fee is the primary revenue source for retail prop firms, which they may use in live accounts managed by professional prop traders. Funded accounts are also demo accounts, ensuring the retail prop firm has zero risk. Prop traders trade in demo accounts but receive real money payouts funded by the 90%+ of failed challenges. Only a few retail prop firms have a defined path for traders to manage live portfolios with an employment contract, a monthly salary, and performance bonuses. Some retail prop firms that offer no challenge accounts with monthly subscriptions may grant access to live portfolios with tight risk management rules, often limiting the loss to the monthly subscription fee. How Do Prop Firms Make Money? While most retail prop firms may claim that they earn when their prop traders earn, supported by the profit-share model, many retail prop firms earn most of their revenues from paid-for challenge fees and monthly subscriptions. Here is an example: Assume prop trading firm ABC has 10,000 funded prop traders who pay $150 per month for access to capital, generating $1,500,000 in monthly revenue without placing a trade For each funded account, assume 100 traders fail the challenge, which costs $100, or 10,000 (funded traders) x 100 (failed traders per funded account) = 1,000,000 x $100 for a total of $100,000,000 in one-off revenue Noteworthy: The more capital traders seek, the higher the one-off challenge fee and monthly subscription Prop firms have restrictive trading conditions and the retail trader will lose access to capital if they hit the tight daily and overall loss limits. This results in traders either blowing their account or generating relatively small profits, of which the prop trading firm takes between 10% and 50% The Challenge Model The challenge model presents the most substantial one-off revenue stream. Potential retail prop traders pay a fee to participate in the challenge. They must meet select criteria to pass the challenge and receive a funded account. The size of the participation fee depends on the amount of capital they seek. The Profit Split Model The few retail traders that pass the challenge receive a funded account with a profit-split model, where the prop firm makes between 10% and 50% of revenues. Prop traders must consider this against the monthly subscription fee to compute their break-even point. Where Do Prop Firms Get Their Money? Most retail prop firms get money from one-off challenge fees and monthly subscription fees paid by funded prop traders. Trading revenues, if any at all, rank third among their income streams. Managing partners usually provide the initial capital to fund operations. Profitable Traders Profitable traders form the backbone of professional prop trading firms. Regrettably, at retail prop firms, profitable traders fulfill a much less integral role. The best retail forex prop firms will maintain a group of profitable traders with a proven history as an income source. Monitoring of Revenue Streams Retail prop firms deploy sophisticated software to monitor traders, assess risks, and decide which trades to copy into their live accounts. Retail prop traders always manage demo accounts, and prop firms choose which strategies to execute. Bottom Line How do prop firms make money? Retail prop firms generate most of their income from one-off challenge fees and monthly subscriptions by funded traders. Trading revenues come in third, and some retail trading prop firms have no trading revenues. Retail traders should not consider prop trading, which is a challenging profession. In fact, most retail prop firms bank on traders failing their fee-based challenges or violating strict risk management rules.

close video Biden administration gives Freddie Mac green light to guarantee second mortgages Structured Finance Association CEO Michael Bright weighs in as the U.S. approves Freddie Mac's second mortgage pilot program on 'The Bottom Line.' The Biden administration has approved a move that could essentially put taxpayers on the hook for risky borrowing practices and potential real estate losses — and a former mortgage insider is sounding off on the plan. "The people who should be really mad, I think, are first-time homebuyers who are trying to get their foot in the housing market. They can't because housing is unaffordable," Structured Finance Association CEO Michael Bright, also a former president of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae sister company Ginnie May, said Tuesday on " The Bottom Line ." "This is going to exacerbate that problem." Mortgage giant Freddie Mac received the green light from the White House to offer second-lien mortgages, aiming to help homeowners who are locked into lower rates access their home equity. REAL ESTATE EXPERT DEFINES HOUSING MARKET DOOMSDAY: SOMETHING WE ‘HAVEN’T SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME' The proposal allows homeowners to access their home equity while keeping their low interest rate on their current loan. The Urban Institute has reported that it could be a cost-effective alternative to cash-out refinances at today's higher rates, which sat at 6.87% for 30-year fixed rates and 6% for 15-year fixed rates as of Tuesday. The Biden administration approved Freddie Mac's plan to offer second-lien mortgages. (Getty Images) But Bright warned that there are consequences of the government stepping in and guaranteeing second mortgages. "Freddie Mac is doing this, but Fannie Mae is going to have to follow. They always do," the CEO said. "I really think we've jumped the shark on this one. Having the government subsidize and incentivize equity extraction through second mortgages, we're not solving any problems in our economy. Consumer spending is actually too high. The Fed is working on that through inflation." "You can get mortgage loans through banks and everything, but if the government comes in and really amps this up, you're talking about additional inflationary pressures," he expanded. "You're talking about additional rate-lock effect. People taking equity out of their home means they're not going to sell their home and move. We already have a supply crisis." close video Larry Kudlow: Take home pay and mortgage rates will be 'front and center' at the debate FOX Business host Larry Kudlow breaks down America's cost of living crisis on 'Kudlow.' Credible, which is majority owned by Fox Corporation, broke down one example given by the Urban Institute where a borrower with a 3% rate on a $300,000 mortgage would have a monthly payment of about $1,265, but their home is now worth $500,000 and they want to access $100,000 for home improvements. With refinancing at an assumed rate of 7.25%, new monthly payments would be about $2,729. With Freddie Mac’s new proposed plan, the borrower can keep their current monthly payment and take out a new 20-year mortgage for the additional $100,000, adding only $965 per month for a new monthly mortgage total of $2,130.

Bright called this a "consumer loan." "So while the Fed is fighting inflation and trying to manage consumer spending incomes, Fannie and Freddie uses the taxpayer balance sheet to try and juice consumer spending for reasons we don't really understand," he said. "Taxpayers are going to bear the risk, more second liens. I just don't think this is the trend we want to be going." READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS

29% of Vacationers Say Better Finances Mean More Summer Travel By PYMNTS | June 25, 2024 | July Fourth is just around the corner and, if you haven’t already done so, there is still time to make last-minute travel plans. But be warned: about half of Americans who plan to travel already have their vacation itineraries mapped out.

Δ In fact, according to PYMNTS Intelligence’s summer travel edition of our “ Consumer Credit Economy Monitor ” report, 48% of U.S. consumers who intend to travel this summer had their plans in place as of April. Why the impatience? PYMNTS Intelligence found several key factors are driving consumers to travel more this year. Forty-one percent of those consumers who are vacationing this summer say they simply have a greater interest in traveling, and that is the reason they want to get out of town (21% say it’s their top motivation). In other words, many Americans may be suffering from post-pandemic cabin fever. Optimism around money-related matters is also a major motivator. Twenty-nine percent say improved personal finances sparked their yearning to travel, while 19% credit having stable employment. Similarly, lower travel costs are inspiring 16% of tourists, while 12% say their faith in the economy is driving their vacation plans. But just because consumers are optimistic about their finances doesn’t mean they aren’t concerned about travel costs. According to our report, those with travel plans this summer anticipate spending about $2,400 on their getaways — and 78% say they plan to pay for at least a proportion of their trip with a credit card. The eagerness to travel isn’t limited only to tourists. As PYMNTS reported recently, business travel is on the rebound as well. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Merchants and agencies have taken note of this uptick in the urge to travel and are responding in kind. For instance, as PYMNTS recently reported , Starbucks is teaming up with Marriott’s marketplace Bonvoy to enable loyalty account holders for both brands a chance to earn points they can apply to free food and beverages, as well as rewards at select Marriott destinations. For those travelers seeking a more immersive experience, Sabre Hospitality — a travel software and technology provider — recently introduced a solution that enables select hoteliers to sell travelers unique experiences, services and goods that can be purchased through virtual storefronts. The company also launched an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered retailing platform that gives airlines the ability to offer travel solutions customized to meet the needs of individual travelers. Advanced technology is also being deployed to aid those travelers who are itching to go beyond U.S. borders. The U.S. State Department recently announced earlier this month that it is beta testing a platform that will allow consumers to renew their U.S. passports online. Although access to the platform is currently limited, the State Department said it will eventually be fully available to streamline the passport renewal process. Not to be outdone, the TSA , the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection have all announced they are developing digital functions to simplify meeting travel requirements going forward. Despite ongoing concerns about inflation, consumers and businesses alike are feeling optimistic enough about the economy to make travel plans in the months to come, and leaders in the hospitality industry — and even government agencies — are doing their part to make summer trips a little smoother.

Economists raise China growth forecasts as exports improve Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Exports are expected to climb 4.3 per cent this year, a jump from the 2.8 per cent gain forecast in a May survey. PHOTO: AFP Follow topic: China Published Jun 26, 2024, 07:55 AM Updated Jun 26, 2024, 06:36 PM BEIJING - The outlook for China’s exports is set to improve, buttressing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy even as consumer spending slows, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Exports are expected to climb 4.3 per cent in 2024 from a year ago, according to the median forecast of 22 economists surveyed from June 17 to 24. That is a jump from the 2.8 per cent gain forecast in a May survey. China’s economy may expand 5 per cent, up from the 4.9 per cent projected in May, according to the median of 68 estimates. “We look for an improving trade outlook over the coming months, driven by a shift in global demand from services back to goods,” said Ms Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia. China’s exports beat expectations in April and May, reflecting strong demand from overseas and the increasing competitiveness of Chinese producers. While this supports Beijing’s strategy of relying on exports to spur growth and offset weak spending by Chinese households, risks are mounting as its companies start to face more trade barriers from the United States and Europe. The survey findings contrast with a recent report by Goldman Sachs Group, which said its clients in China are increasingly sceptical about the outlook for export growth in the coming quarters. Investors are worried about the sustainability of supply-side expansion, especially when domestic demand is weak, and the risks of trade friction, the bank said in the note dated June 23. Economists have pared back their expectations for retail sales growth – a key gauge of consumer spending – as well as consumer and factory-gate price inflation in 2024 , reflecting pessimism over demand as a sharp housing contraction continues, according to the Bloomberg survey. “Recent macro data confirms that drags from the property sector remain,” said Mr Arjen van Dijkhuizen, senior economist at ABN Amro Bank. “Growth is still supported by a stronger momentum in exports, but external risks are rising, as China’s overcapacity contributes to trade spats, with the US and Europe trying to protect strategic industries.” China is unlikely to shake off deflationary pressures in 2024, with economists becoming more downbeat about the prospects . They expect the consumer price index to rise only 0.6 per cent in 2024 , while the producer price index is forecast to drop 1 per cent, both weakening from the estimates in May. This reflects consumers’ reluctance to spend amid concerns about their job security, income prospects and falling property values. “Strains in the job market are still weighing on consumer spending,” said Ms Erica Tay, an economist at Maybank Investment Banking Group. “Even as the advanced manufacturing sectors are winning global market share, their gains can only go so far in offsetting the drag on GDP growth from sluggish consumption.” Economists pushed back their expectations for a cut to the reserve requirement ratio – the amount of cash banks must set aside in reserve – to the third quarter from the second quarter. The People’s Bank of China held off on easing in recent months to protect the yuan and as market liquidity was ample. They also projected a slower growth of money supply in 2024, compared to May, as the central bank signalled a shift in focus to the efficiency of funds rather than pure expansion. Economists maintained their projections for policy interest rates and the loan prime rate to be cut in the third quarter.

Money The Wealthiest 10% Owns 71% Of US Household Money Market Funds By Ivan Illan , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Finance Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 25, 2024, 08:00am EDT Share Save Ivan Illan is Chief Investment Officer at AWAIM® and bestselling author of Success as a Financial Advisor For Dummies. getty You’ve probably heard that the level of assets in U.S. money market funds has breached an extraordinary threshold. As of Q4 2023, total money market fund assets totaled more than $6.357 trillion . For some perspective, in Q4 2018, it was $3.289 trillion—a 93% increase in just five years. In financial media, I keep reading about how special this $6 trillion-plus cash cushion is for the future prospects of the U.S. economy and its consumer-based economy. However, on closer inspection, any confidence one might have for this colossal heap of money market funds quickly abates. Even though some simple math reveals that the household sector represents 60% of all money market fund shares , it’s unfortunately highly concentrated within the top 10% of households (based on wealth percentiles). And the wealthiest (relatively) few Americans are unlikely to prop up aggregate consumer spending forever when downside volatility hits capital markets and real estate values. Based on data reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the top 1% (representing 99th to 100th wealth percentiles) holds more than $1.2 trillion in money market fund shares. This translates to a 32.4% share of the entire household sector. Compare this to the bottom 50% (representing 1st to 50th wealth percentiles), where only $36 billion of money market fund shares are held. That’s a mere 3% of the level that the top 1% holds. To appreciate the scale of this economic dispersion, the bottom 50% represents more than 66 million households compared to just over 1.185 million in the 99th to 99.9th percentile and 133,364 households in the top 0.1% . Between the 50th to 90th wealth percentiles, the count was close to 53 million households , which hold only $839 billion in money market funds (or 22% of all household money market fund shares). There are 11.9 million households in the 90th to 99th wealth percentiles. They hold $1.479 trillion in money market funds (or 39% of all household money market funds). It’s not difficult to deduce that with only a relatively small minority percentage of households having the liquid funds available to support their consumption should economic conditions deteriorate, overall aggregate demand is likely to continue to wane as high prices persist and real disposable incomes flatline across wealth percentiles. For financial professionals particularly, understanding this landscape is crucial in navigating whatever may come next for the U.S. economy. Consumers outside of the top 10% wealthiest are much more likely to implement spending cuts as their resources become more limited. This may impact the consumption of goods and services across industries, placing more pressure on profit margins as top-line revenue stagnates. Additionally, bottom-line net income may also feel the pressure as interest expense remains high. For businesses holding cash reserves at banks, be aware of FDIC insurance limits. Don’t presume that the depositor bailouts seen last year will become routine, as federal resources are limited in this area and moreover perpetuate a moral hazard already observed by those that have stayed within the stated limits of FDIC protection. A prudent next step would be to review your company’s corporate treasury operations to ensure you don’t have unknown risks in this area. There are a few ways to mitigate such risks in the marketplace through specialized service offerings, particularly from nonbank financial services firms.

Business | Business News Tortilla wraps up deal to buy French burrito rival Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France. The company acquired rival Mexican chain Chilango last year (Tortilla/PA) Anna Wise 25 June 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Burrito chain Tortilla has bought its biggest European competitor in a deal worth nearly £4 million, as it hopes to attract new consumers on the go, ahead of the Paris Olympics. Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos, in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France . The acquisition also includes a network of 19 franchised locations and the rights to the brand. The London-based company, which has 89 stores, predominantly in the UK, said the purchase will give it a “launchpad” to expand further into Europe. “Tortilla’s international ambitions are no secret, and acquiring Fresh Burritos is our gateway to mainland Europe. “With Mexican cuisine surging in popularity, these prime French locations give us a solid launchpad.” He said the purchase comes “just in time for the Paris Olympics”, with businesses hoping to cash in on the millions of expected visitors to the French capital to watch the games. The 3.95 million euro (£3.3 million) acquisition has been funded through a combination of cash payment and existing debt facilities, Tortilla said. It is forecast to take a £500,000 hit to adjusted earnings this year, but will start to generate a profit for the business, estimated at £500,000 next year then about £2.5 million per year. Fresh Burritos was operating at a loss last year, reporting an annual loss before tax of 100,000 euros (£84,500) on revenues of nine million euros (£7.6 million). Tortilla has previously said that despite consumer spending on eating out still under pressure from the higher cost of living, it has seen long-term interest in Mexican-inspired burritos that are quick and affordable. It said its locations in busy city-centre locations, shopping centres and travel hubs were doing especially well, but it had found trading in quieter locations in regional towns and cities more challenging.

Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu The risk of an economic slowdown now outweighs the risk of inflation, according to Morgan Stanley. At the midpoint of the year, stocks are near all-time highs, buoyed mostly by a handful of megacap technology stocks tied to the artificial intelligence trade. The S & P 500 has surged nearly 15% this year, having notched more than 30 record closes along the way. But Morgan Stanley worries that the poor breadth of the market , measuring the number of advancing stocks against those declining, is a sign that slowing economic growth is becoming a bigger risk than stubbornly high inflation. As evidence, the Wall Street investment bank is citing downside surprises in recent macroeconomic data. "With macro data broadly coming in softer YTD, many lower quality and economically sensitive areas of the market have lagged, while a narrow list of higher quality mega caps have carried performance," wrote Mike Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. "In our view, this is a sign the market is becoming more focused on growth softening and less focused on inflation and [interest] rates," Wilson said. While the relatively tech-heavy S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have surged nearly 15% and 17% this year, respectively, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is far less exposed to the AI theme, is up close to 5%. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 has also lagged. The small-cap index has gained just 0.5% in 2024. "This backdrop syncs with our long-standing view that the current policy mix of heavy fiscal and higher front end rates is effectively crowding out many economic participants," Wilson wrote. To be sure, the Morgan Stanley strategist does not expect weak breadth to herald weak returns. But he does expect any market broadening will for now be restricted to high-quality, large-cap and defensive stocks, especially in the event of a slowdown that he expects is the most likely future scenario. "A growth scare that is substantial enough to turn bad economic data into bad news for equity [price-to-earnings] multiples across the board," Wilson said. "We think this is the most likely risk, and our conversations with clients echo this view." Here are some of the quality large-cap and defensive stocks with strong upward earnings revisions that can outperform, according to Morgan Stanley. These stocks are in the top 1,000 stocks by market cap and score in the top one-third of composite, high-quality composites readings. Burlington shares are higher by 25% this year, and the stock is overweight-rated by Morgan Stanley. On Monday, a Bernstein note said off-price retailers like Burlington will continue to outperform the retail sector. "We expect BURL to steadily improve margins and ROIC on new stores, as well as margins in the existing business from better buying and supply chain processes — we model ROIC reaching 10% by 2026," the firm's Aneesha Sherman wrote. Monster Beverage emerged on Morgan Stanley's list. The overweight-rated stock is down by more than 14% this year. A Jefferies note this month called Monster Beverage one of the firm's top picks in a bifurcated consumer economy, saying the brand has the "least exposure to trade-down & private label." Nvidia and HubSpot also surfaced on Morgan Stanley's screen.

In an interview with BT, he says that middle-class and rich households will drive nearly $2.9 trillion of incremental consumption spend by 2030. He, however, cautions that the lowest 20% of the income pyramid still faces challenges in returning to pre-pandemic financial status. Edited excerpts: Advertisement Q. There seems to be a consumption conundrum in the spending patterns of Indians. While high-end products see robust sales, the demand for more affordable goods remains muted. What are the reasons for this? The Indian economy is witnessing a significant shift towards premiumisation, driven primarily by the large middle class and affluent consumers who prefer high-end products like luxury cars, upscale houses, leisure holiday trips, apparel, and personal care. This growth in premium consumption is not confined to metropolitan elites, the aspirational households in boom towns, niche cities, and developed rural areas are also contributing significantly to this trend. Influenced by global trends and digital media, these consumers are demanding premium offerings, highlighting the need for innovation and quality in products and services. Advertisement The pandemic has significantly impacted the bottom 60% of India’s income pyramid, leading to depleted savings and increased debt as individuals struggled with the economic fallout. Despite some recovery in this segment post-Covid, the lowest 20% still faces challenges in returning to the pre-pandemic financial status. This group, primarily consumers of low-end products such as affordable two-wheelers and basic FMCG items, has shifted its focus towards essential spending, emergency savings, and debt repayment. The situation is exacerbated by high inflation and limited job opportunities, preventing many from regaining their financial stability. This shift towards necessary expenditures and the emphasis on saving has curtailed discretionary spending, significantly affecting broader consumer market dynamics. Q. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey results also showed a move towards premiumisation. Could you give your take on this please? Advertisement Indeed, it reflects how household spending priorities are evolving, particularly post-Covid, as there is a clear trend towards investing in lifestyle, well-being, and aspirational products over basic necessities. This shift towards quality and premium spending is indicative of a broader desire among consumers to enhance their quality of life and opt for products that not only provide convenience but also offer significant health benefits. The increased expenditure on health-related products and consumer durables further highlights this structural shift in the consumption patterns across households. Q. Could you share some data on how the household consumption pattern has changed? India has been evolving as one of the world’s most dynamic consumption environments and is expected to maintain steady economic growth. Indian consumers in 2030 will be richer and as young and as diverse as they are today. At the same time, innovation and technological development will elevate consumption models to the next level. Rising incomes and the expansion of the middle-class and high-income segments will reshape future consumption. Middle-class and rich households will drive nearly $2.9 trillion of incremental consumption spend by 2030, nearly all of the incremental spending will be led by consumers upgrading to premium offerings or adding new categories of consumption. Advertisement Specific categories will drive significant growth in spending. Households moving up an income level will spend two to three-and-a-half times more on essential categories such as food, housing, transport and communication and also on apparel and personal care. They will also spend four to six times more on well-being, entertainment and household services. Those entering the upper middle class will drive an increase of 15–30% in penetration of consumer durables. Affordable, mid-priced products and services will drive aggregate growth. By 2030, 53% of incremental spending will be led by middle-class consumers. Nearly half of the total incremental spend ($1.5 trillion) will be on “more of the same” products and services. Price points similar to those today will continue to be important. Premiumisation and new category adoption will primarily be led by middle-class and rich consumers. The remaining $1.6 trillion incremental spend will be led by consumers upgrading to packaged, branded or higher-priced offerings, or adding new products or services to their consumption routine. Consumers will especially upgrade or expand their choices in apparel, personal care and food and beverages. India’s income growth will drive a huge opportunity for packaged, branded offerings. Q. FMCG companies expect a good monsoon to help revive rural demand. What are your thoughts on this? Advertisement The expectation is grounded in several factors. A successful monsoon typically results in increased agricultural income and economic stimulus in rural areas, driving higher purchasing power and demand for essential FMCG products. With ongoing investments in distribution networks, FMCG companies are well-positioned to capitalise on this increased demand. However, potential challenges such as inflation, shifting consumer preferences, and pandemic-related disruptions could impact the extent of this revival, necessitating adaptability and responsiveness from FMCG companies to fully leverage the opportunities presented by favourable agricultural conditions.

Rising cost of living leaving many Canberra small businesses in a precarious position By Ali El Zein M By Monte Bovill Topic: Small Businesses Thu 20 Jun 2024 Thursday 20 June 2024 Thu 20 Jun 2024 at 8:34pm Canberra cafe owner Sunil Bandi says the rising cost of living is taking its toll. ( ABC News: Mark Moore ) Sunil Bandi's motto is: when his customers are happy, he's happy. He's been serving up Indonesian cuisine and coffee at his north Canberra cafe for four years, but the rising cost of living is taking a toll. "I am just struggling because costs are going very high," he said. Mr Bandi said raw materials are getting harder and harder to buy, some having doubled in price. Sunil Bandi says he's had to reduce both his staff and trading hours as the cost of materials rises. ( ABC News: Mark Moore ) In the past year, he's seen a significant drop in the number of people coming into his cafe, and those who do are spending less. "The cost of what I'm spending, so what I have to charge for the customers, they are not ready for it. You know why? Because they're struggling too," Mr Bandi said. "I'm reducing staff … and I even changed our trading hours." It's a sentiment shared in other parts of the city, with increasing operational costs combined with customers spending less putting many small businesses in a precarious position. Customers 'coming in with a budget' Homeware and gift shop owner Thea Bollington says this has been the store's hardest year ever. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) It's not just the hospitality industry that's feeling the pinch. Thea Bollington opened her homeware and gift shop in Aranda eight years ago, but has never felt so much pressure as right now. "I reckon this is probably our hardest year yet, even with COVID," she said. "We have seen a drop in customers over the last 12 to 18 months." Ms Bollington said she's had to adapt to changing customer habits like spending less. "We are having to find a little bit more variety in products with different price points," she said "Customers are really coming in with a budget and they are really thinking about what they are spending. Thea Bollington says if Canberrans want to have local businesses they must support them where possible. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) "There's no longer consistency in when people come in. "[In the past] we could really guarantee weekends would always be busy, and more of a flow during the week. "These days you can't pick it, from week to week it is really different." Ms Bollington said it was worrying to see businesses struggling across the board. "We have had a lot of makers in the last 12 months that have closed and it's scary," she said. "If you can support small businesses, do it where you can. "If you want them to be here and stay in your local area, spend when you can." 'We have had to pass on quite a few costs' Coffee roaster Al Evans says cafes are buying less beans directly. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Al Evans and Paul Reed made the decision in 2014 to sell their cafe to become coffee bean roasters and suppliers. Mr Evans said the number of beans they sell direct to cafes was down, while sales through supermarkets and online were increasing. "Cafes are suffering a lot — rents are high, wages are high, and everyone is drinking coffee from home," he said. "They might have their first coffee at home and maybe only have one out, where as before they would have like three coffees [out]. "A lot of people are staying home, they are working from home, so that is where we have seen an increase in online sales." Al Evans says the cost of coffee beans has risen significantly. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Mr Evans said bean costs have also increased "massively". "We have had to pass on quite a few costs," he said. "We tried to hold tight for about a year-and-a-half, but then everything became too much. "There's not much you can do about it. If your base product is going up, you can only take so much." Their business had between 40 and 50 staff when it was first established, but that has reduced to about 10. Paul Reed says the number of home machines he's repaired has risen as more people opt to make coffee at home. ( ABC News: Nick Haggarty ) Coffee machine repairer Paul Reed, who services Canberra and parts of regional New South Wales, said it's clear more people are opting to go without a cafe-made coffee. He's been repairing machines for 16 years, and said he's been doing an increasing amount of home repairs. "I got a lot of phone calls about people wanting them repaired or serviced because they're using them a lot more," he said. He said cafes he services have been particularly quiet in the "last year or two". Biggest challenge are high interest rates Canberra Business Chamber CEO Greg Harford says the biggest challenge for small businesses is high interest rates. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Canberra Business Chamber CEO Greg Harford said business sentiment was currently "pretty gloomy". "There's a couple of reasons behind that. First, it's costing people more to run their businesses. Second, customers aren't out spending," he said. "Businesses are looking very hard at their costs and obviously looking at what they can do to get customers to get back in the door." Mr Harford said stubbornly high interest rates were the biggest challenge facing small businesses. "What we really need to see is the Reserve Bank start to bring interest rates down to inject a bit of confidence back into the consumer economy and to take the edge off the cost of doing business," he said. "Customers just don't have as much money in their pockets to get out and spend as much as they normally would be." Mr Harford said nearly two thirds of businesses had told the Business Chamber that they did not hit their sales targets for the last quarter, while he said only 29 per cent felt confident about the future.

Despite this, April-May real retail sales were down 1.2 per cent annualised from Q1, indicating weak consumer spending in Q2. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2024. The US’ nominal retail sales saw a slight increase of 0.1 per cent in May, following a 0.2 per cent decline in April, according to The Conference Board (TCB). Real retail sales, adjusted for inflation, also rose by 0.1 per cent in May after a significant 0.5 per cent decline in April. Despite this modest uptick, real retail sales over the April-May period were down 1.2 per cent annualised from the first quarter (Q1), indicating continued weakness in consumer spending, particularly on goods, in Q2. US nominal retail sales rose by 0.1 per cent in May after a 0.2 per cent decline in April, while real retail sales, adjusted for inflation, also increased by 0.1 per cent. Despite this, April-May real retail sales were down 1.2 per cent annualised from Q1, indicating weak consumer spending in Q2. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2024. Retail control, which excludes volatile sectors such as gasoline, motor vehicles, building material store sales, and food and drinking places, rose by 0.4 per cent in May after a 0.5 per cent decline in the previous month. Sales increased in clothing, sporting goods, general merchandise, non-store retailers, and miscellaneous stores. The May retail sales data support expectations that real GDP growth continued to slow in Q2 2024, following a modest 1.3 per cent annualised rise in Q1 2024. The Federal Reserve is likely to view these figures as indicative of the economy cooling down, a necessary step to bring inflation back to its 2-per cent target, as per TCB. Economic indicators suggest that two interest rate cuts are anticipated towards the end of 2024, likely during the November and December meetings. Despite the slight rise in real sales in May, the annualised decline of 1.2 per cent from Q1 highlights a reduction in consumer demand. This trend reflects a broader shift away from spending on goods, driven by slower real wage growth, depleted excess savings, and rising credit card debt. High interest rates, elevated prices, and increasing insurance premiums, particularly for autos, are further dampening goods purchases. Weaker consumer spending aligns with the Fed’s strategy to cool economic activity and curb inflation without triggering a recession. Projections suggest that Q2 and Q3 real GDP growth will be anaemic, ranging between 0 per cent and 1 per cent quarter-over-quarter annualised. However, a recession remains unlikely as businesses are generally retaining their top talent. Given the backdrop of slower real GDP growth and inflation, coupled with a relatively healthy labour market, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice this year. The cuts are anticipated at the November and December meetings. Although only a slight majority of FOMC participants supported one cut at the June meeting, most are anticipating two cuts by the end of the year.

Germany's Ifo institute slightly raises 2024 GDP forecast Published on 06/20/2024 at 04:30 am EDT Reuters Share BERLIN, June 20 (Reuters) - Germany's Ifo institute slightly raised its 2024 forecast for economic growth in Europe's top economy on Thursday, citing stronger consumer purchasing power and recovery in global trade in goods and industrial production in the second half. Ifo raised its growth forecast to 0.4%, from 0.2% in March, which roughly is in line with the German government's spring projection of 0.3% growth. "New hope is now emerging," said Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser. "The German economy is slowly working its way out of the crisis. The second half of 2024 should be significantly better than the first." The German economy, which was the weakest performer among big euro zone countries last year, is expected to gain some momentum in its recovery over the course of this year, with inflation expected to fall and nominal wages forecast to rise. "As the year progresses, the purchasing power of private households should continue to gain strength and the overall economic recovery should pick up speed as the consumer economy normalizes," said Wollmershaeuser. Global trade in goods and global industrial production should continue to recover, particularly from the second half, helped by a gradual upturn in investment as monetary policy in industrialized countries is set to ease, added Ifo. Ifo maintained its forecast for economic growth of 1.5% in 2025, while inflation is expected to fall to 2.2% this year from 5.9% last year, and drop to 1.7% next year.

America's 'cardboard-box recession' is finally over, BofA says Filip De Mott June 19, 2024 2 min read The cardboard box recession is ending, as packaging prices climb, Bank of America says. This recession indicator flashed last year when demand for packaging fell to 2009 lows. Now, the industry expects 3% growth outlooks for the coming quarters. Packaging prices are poised for a rebound, spelling the end for America's cardboard box recession, Bank of America said. While industry data has been negative since the second half of 2022, new surveys from the bank reveal a surging growth outlook for the quarters ahead. That's good news for the broader economy, as it puts to rest at least one recessionary indicator. When last year's demand for cardboard packaging dropped to 2009 lows , analysts feared it meant a major consumer spending pullback. Charles Schwab declared a "cardboard-box recession " last June, warning that it would impact everything from labor markets to equities. Since then, both the economy and markets have broadly surprised to the upside. Until recent months , consumer spending has been resilient , which has helped keep stocks pushing on to record highs. Now, things are also looking up for the packaging industry. "Out of the independent box makers that we survey, we went from a 0.6% growth outlook to over 3%, which, in my world, that's significant," research analyst George Staphos told Yahoo Finance . "Additionally, what we're hearing from the respondents is an overwhelming sense that prices would continue to move higher." Bank of America Global Research While he acknowledged that a good part of the uptick comes from inflation, BofA's survey shows that demand expectations are also playing a role. Over the next six to twelve months, 62% respondents see demand either "better" or "much better," the note said. That's compared to 39% who thought this in April.

With moderation in inflation India will see higher consumer spending: Fitch Ratings ANI | Updated: Jun 19, 2024 15:48 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi[India], June 19 (ANI): Putting an end to the debate on India's growth based on the government's capex push, global rating agency Fitch Ratings said that consumer spending will increase with elevated consumer confidence, a sign of enhanced income for people. The credit rating agency in its June report of Global Economic Outlook (GEO) said that India will see higher Consumer spending with elevated consumer confidence. Expectations of better than expected monsoon will support growth and make inflation less volatile. The rating agency has elevated India's growth forecast by 20 basis point to 7.2 per cent for fiscal year 2024-25. Earlier in March Fitch has forecasted India's growth at 7 per cent. Backing its anticipation for consumer spending in coming quarters, the rating agency said, that average rainfall during June-September is likely to limit the inflationary risks from a food price spike, incentivising spending. According to official forecasts in the country, the rainfall during June-September is likely to be above average. The report forecasts headline inflation declines to 4.5 per cent by calendar year-end, and average inflation rests at 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026, staying slightly above the midpoint of RBI's target of 4 per cent with a variation of 2 per cent. Headline inflation is a measure of the total inflation within an economy, including the prices of commodities like food and energy. India's retail inflation rate softened marginally in May to 4.75 per cent, continuing its moderation trend, though food prices continue to remain a pain point. In May, the annual retail inflation stood at a 12-month low of 4.75 per cent, marginally down from 4.83 per cent in April. Core inflation shows a trend in the cost of goods and services, excluding food and energy has also fallen to 3.0 per cent in May but the country faced high food price inflation of an average of 7.8 per cent in the first five months of 2024. In the final quarter of the financial year ending March 2024, real GDP increased by 7.8 per cent year on year. The real GDP of India grew at 8.2 per cent in FY2023-24. (ANI)

iStock BUDGET 2024 TAX CUT: Such a move would likely put more money in the wallets of consumers thus boosting spending. Related Income tax relief for those in lowest slab may need to be considered in Budget: CII CII pitches for marginal tax relief for individuals, higher wages under MNREGA in Budget India’s industry lobby groups have asked officials of the Finance Ministry consider personal tax benefits for the country’s middle-class and a simplification in direct tax regime in the upcoming Union Budget announcement. In a meeting with Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, CII President Sanjiv Puri advocated for marginal tax relief for incomes up to Rs 20 lakh and called for reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel. He noted that while Brent crude prices have dropped by 40 per cent, pump prices in Delhi have only fallen by Rs 1.8 per litre. Certain sectors in India have been impacted due to skewed consumer spending, as highlighted in the country’s latest GDP readings. This gulf between India's enviable GDP growth rate figures and the slowing consumer demand seem to be a spot of bother for certain businesses. Sops aimed at reducing tax burden are likely to have a positive impact on consumer spending in the country.

He argued that these measures would boost disposable income and stimulate consumer spending. "The middle class is currently taxed at a rate of 30%, leaving them with little disposable income for savings and other needs. We suggested that the 30% tax slab should apply only to incomes above Rs 40 lakh," news agency ANI quoted Mukul Bagla, chair of the direct taxes committee at PHDCCI as saying. FICCI has proposed simplifying the capital gains tax system by streamlining it into two or three broad categories based on asset types, holding periods for long-term status, and eligibility for indexation benefits. They suggest categorizing assets into three groups: equity instruments, debt, and other assets, with specific rates set for both long-term and short-term gains. FICCI also recommends uniform tax rates for residents and non-residents, eliminating the current distinctions. "Our suggestions have focused on maintaining the growth momentum, while seeking simplification for ease of doing business and reducing litigation. Where litigation has started, the idea should be to find a workable solution for everyone," said Subhrakant Panda, the chamber's immediate past president.

For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively.( DC File Photo) Mumbai: Global rating agency Fitch Ratings upped India’s growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.2 per cent, up from 7 per cent projected in March due to a recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. The rating agency’s growth and inflation forecast are in line with the central bank’s estimates. For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively. In its global economic outlook report, Fitch said, “We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2 per cent in FY24/25, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points from the March Global Economic Outlook (GEO).” It noted that high frequency indicators of domestic activity were showing resilience. The South-West monsoon is expected to be above normal, which augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in manufacturing and services activity, this should enable a revival in private consumption. RBI earlier this month projected a 7.2 per cent growth for the current fiscal year, supported by improving rural demand and moderating inflation. In its latest biannual Global Economic Prospects it said India will remain the fastest-growing of the world’s largest economies, although its pace of expansion is expected to moderate. After a high growth rate in FY 2023/24, steady growth of 6.7 per cent per year, on average, is projected for the three fiscal years beginning in FY 2024/25. The rating agency said that the investment will continue to rise, albeit more slowly than in recent quarters. Consumer spending is expected to recover, supported by high consumer confidence. “We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,” Fitch added, indicating that growth will be driven by consumer spending and investment. An ‘above normal’ monsoon forecast for June-September is expected to mitigate risks of food price spikes. Fitch projects that headline inflation in India will decrease to 4.5 per cent by the end of 2024, averaging 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026.

The Census Bureau said Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.1% from the month prior, coming in slightly below economists’ expectations. Sales were 2% higher from a year ago. April’s figures were also revised lower to a slight decline of 0.2% from being flat compared to March. Sales at clothing and accessory stores rose 0.9%, while electronics and appliance stores saw a 0.4% gain. Online sales were up 0.8%. Gas station sales were down 2.2%, powered by a drop in prices at the pump. Consumer spending is an important metric to watch for economic health and growth, as it makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. Economists said Tuesday’s report showed consumers being more cautious in the face of inflation and tougher credit conditions.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The release comes after the latest consumer price index showed inflation falling for the second consecutive month, though progress in getting inflation back to 2% is going slower than the Federal Reserve would like. Fed officials said at their June meeting that they are only anticipating one cut to its benchmark interest rate this year as they would like to see more progress in cooling inflation before lowering rates. Higher rates help cool economic activity by moderating consumer spending, but the Fed is also trying to find the right balance of getting inflation back to 2% without the economy tipping into recession. “What we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a good level and with a strong labor market,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said after the June meeting. “Ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far they haven’t had to.” Consumer spending has remained resilient throughout most of the Fed’s inflation crackdown despite higher prices and interest rates but has gotten bumpier in 2024 as shoppers try to make their budgets stretch. A handful of major retail chains like Target and Walmart have rolled out discounts to entice shoppers to keep up the spending. “May’s retail sales give us a snapshot of a reasonably healthy consumer even though spending growth is fluctuating somewhat,” NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. “These numbers indicate that the economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, generally supporting consumers’ ability and willingness to spend. Inflation pressure has fallen, especially for retail goods, but higher prices for services continue to weigh on the minds of households.” Some economists have predicted consumer spending would slow some this year as the labor market — while still strong by historical standards — cools from the highs observed over the last two years. A report earlier this month showed businesses added 272,000 jobs in May, a significant increase from April that helps boost wages and give shoppers confidence to keep spending.

Huh) “Looking ahead, positive labor market gains should continue to carry the consumer forward and prevent a spending retrenchment. But we continue to expect softer consumer spending trends as cost fatigue and cooling labor market conditions curb income growth and lead households to exercise more spending restraint,” EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said. Consumer sentiment has been down in the first half of the year as Americans are expecting higher prices to linger and are frustrated with inflation, a key issue in the looming November election. A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index released on Friday showed attitudes were continuing to sour, dropping to 65.6 in June from 69.1 in May. “Assessments of personal finances dipped, due to modestly rising concerns over high prices as well as weakening incomes. Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May,” survey director Joanne Hsu wrote in the preliminary release. Americans have had a negative outlook on the economy for months, often holding contradicting views with positive interpretations of their own finances while also saying the U.S. economy is struggling as a whole. Many of the beliefs consumers hold about the economy are in direct contrast with the data federal agencies are releasing every month, which have shown continued growth, low unemployment and moderating inflation. A poll from last month found more than half of Americans believe the economy is in recession and shrinking, nearly 50% believe unemployment is at a 50-year high and that the S&P index is down for the year, all of which are opposite from the data.

Updated / Tuesday, 18 Jun 2024 14:09 The pace of spending is likely sufficient to sustain the economic expansion. US retail sales increased less than expected in May as lower prices for gasoline weighed on receipts at service stations. Retail sales rose 0.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.2% drop in April, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Retail sales were previously reported to have been unchanged in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, gaining 0.3% in May. Retail sales have in recent months been distorted by an early Easter. Nonetheless, the trend in sales growth has been slowing as higher prices and interest rates force households to prioritize essentials and cut back on discretionary spending. Banks are also tightening access to credit as lower income borrowers increasingly struggle to keep up with their loan payments. Though the labor market remains on a solid footing, it is becoming a bit difficult for people who lose their jobs to quickly find new work and wage increases are moderating. Savings have also been whittled down. Still, the pace of spending is likely sufficient to sustain the economic expansion. The Federal Reserve last week kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since last July. US central bank officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year. They, however, maintained their gross domestic product growth estimates. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.5% drop in April. These so-called core retail sales were previously reported to have declined 0.3% in April. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. Consumer spending increased at a 2.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, helping to restrain the economy to a 1.3% growth pace. Growth estimates for the second quarter are as high as a 3.1% rate.

Fitch raises India’s GDP forecast marginally to 7.2% in FY25 Investment expected to rise, but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending would recover, the rating agency said By Shishir Sinha Updated - June 18, 2024 at 02:05 PM. | New Delhi, June 18 × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/fitch-raises-indias-gdp-forecast-marginally-to-72-in-fy25/article68303109.ece Copy Taking a cue from a rise in consumer spending, Fitch Ratings has upped India’s growth forecast, measured in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Products) to 7.2 per cent during fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25), from the earlier print of 7 per cent. The economy grew by 8.2 per cent during FY24 . “Investment will continue to rise, but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending will recover with elevated consumer confidence. Purchasing managers’ survey data points to continued growth at the start of the current financial year,” the agency said in its annual publication ‘Global Economic Outlook.’ The publication has raised its forecast for world growth in 2024 to 2.6 per cent from the previous forecast of 2.4 per cent. Fitch’s forecast is on a par with RBI’s latest estimate. Earlier this month the central bank, too, had revised upwards the forecast by 20bps to 7.2 per cent. It noted that high frequency indicators of domestic activity were showing resilience. The South-West monsoon is expected to be above normal, which augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in manufacturing and services activity, this should enable a revival in private consumption. However, Fitch’s revision is higher than that of the IMF and ADB . In April, the IMF revised its projection to 7 per cent from 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal. In the same month, ADB revised its projection to 7 per cent from 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal. S&P has projected a growth rate of 6.8 per cent Also read: Fitch affirms India’s rating at ‘BBB-’ Meanwhile, Fitch said signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heat-wave poses a risk. It expects growth in later years to slow and approach its medium-term trend estimate. “We forecast real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in FY25/26 (unchanged from March), and 6.2% in FY26/27, driven by consumer spending and investment,” it said. Further, it noted that at its latest meeting, the RBI maintained the policy rate at 6.5 per cent and confirmed its hawkish stance of “withdrawal of monetary accommodation” and the need to bring down inflation towards target. “We still expect the RBI to cut its policy rate this year, but only once, to 6.25 per cent. In the March GEO, we expected 50bps of cuts this year. We then expect 25bps of cuts in both 2025 and 2026,” it said. As confidence in European recovery prospects improve, the world growth forecast has been revised upward. China’s export sector revives and domestic demand in emerging markets, excluding China (EM excl. China), shows stronger momentum. The US is slowing, but only gradually and our 2024 growth forecast is unchanged at 2.1 per cent. ”The expected pivot to global monetary policy easing is now taking shape, with the ECB recently cutting rates and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE) both expected to follow suit in 3Q24. But inflation is surprisingly persistent and we now expect global rates to decline at a shallower pace over the next 12-18 months,” Fitch said.

File photo | Photo Credit: The Hindu Fitch Ratings on Tuesday raised its GDP growth forecast for India to 7.2% for 2024-25 from 7% estimated earlier, citing higher consumer confidence despite an anticipated slowdown in new investments, but has pared its interest rate cut hopes from the Reserve Bank of India to just one round of 25 basis points (bps) from two such cuts anticipated earlier. One bp equals 0.01%. What is next for the Indian economy? | Explained Noting that India’s rapid growth , reflected in a faster-than-expected 8.2% uptick in 2023-24, is underpinned by a fast expansion in investment, Fitch added a caveat to say that the economy’s Gross Value-Added (GVA) at basic prices “is currently a better guide to underlying momentum and has been growing at just over 7%”. Fitch reckoned that fixed Investments will rise 7.2% this year , slowing from a 9% growth in 2023-24, before rebounding to a 7.8% uptick in 2025-26. GDP growth is expected to moderate to 6.5% next year and 6.2% in 2026-27, with consumer spending and investment remaining the key growth drivers. “Signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heatwave poses a risk. We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,” it said. Stating that above average rainfall during June to September should limit the inflationary risks from food price spikes, the rating firm projected retail inflation to average 4.5% this year, in line with the RBI’s estimates, before dropping to 4.3% and 4.2% over the next two years. The dynamics of household consumption “At its latest meeting, the RBI maintained the policy rate at 6.5% and confirmed its hawkish stance of “withdrawal of monetary accommodation” and the need to bring down inflation towards target. We still expect the RBI to cut its policy rate this year, but only once, to 6.25%. We then expect 25bp of cuts in both 2025 and 2026,” the firm said. In March, it had penned in 50 basis points (bps) of rate cuts this year. In its updated Global Economic Outlook, the rating major has raised its global growth projections for this year to 2.6% from 2.4% estimated in March, noting that though growth is slowing from the 2.9% rise recorded in 2023, the deceleration is not as sharp as it previously expected. For 2025 and 2026, it expects the world economy to expand 2.4%, and stressed that these forecasts “paint a picture of a much more stable world economy in the middle of the decade compared to the volatility in 2020-2023”.

Japan marks 70 years since the establishment of the Self-Defense Forces on Monday, as the country’s defense establishment grapples with dramatic policy shifts and faces down challenges ranging from recruitment to rising Chinese military assertiveness. In a statement released on the anniversary of the creation of the SDF and Defense Agency — the precursor to the current Defense Ministry — defense chief Minoru Kihara pledged to continue working to build trust in the ostensibly pacifist country’s armed forces amid “the most severe and complicated security environment of the postwar era.” “As minister of defense, I am determined to work together with the members of our armed forces so that we can continue to live up to the trust and expectations of the people,” Kihara said Monday.

China News Xi signals further military purges to eradicate corruption June 22, 2024 2:20 AM By William Yang TOPSHOT - Russia's national flag flies beside the Chinese flag in front of Tiananmen Gate next to Tiananmen Square, during the state visit of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin in Beijing on May 16, 2024. Xi signals further military purges to eradicate corruption Print Washington — Speaking at China’s first military political work conference in a decade this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the need for the military to eliminate corruption and strengthen its loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. He also warned of "deep-seated issues" in the military’s politics, ideology, work style and discipline. "The gun barrels should always be in the hands of those who are loyal and reliable to the party and there must be no place for corrupt elements to hide in the military," Xi said in his remarks, according to China’s state broadcaster CCTV. In a lengthy overview, Xi urged the military to enhance the thoroughness of its ideological transformation by following the Communist Party’s theories, improving the leadership of party organizations, and eradicating conditions that may allow corruption to thrive. Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the National Policy Foundation in Taiwan, said the remarks show that "Xi wants to emphasize the importance for the military to be loyal to the party and his leadership while signaling his concerns about how corruption affects the military" and its capabilities. Xi "hopes the warnings can help accelerate the development of advanced technologies and equipment," Chieh told VOA by phone. Since last July, China has ousted more than a dozen top military commanders, including former defense minister Li Shangfu, and leaders of the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force. While the Chinese government hasn’t publicly linked their removals to corruption, some foreign media outlets and experts see their removal as part of the extended anti-corruption campaign Xi initiated since he came to power in 2012. Reuters reported last September that Li was facing an investigation related to the procurement of military equipment. The removal of top military leaders not only highlights the prevalence of corruption; it also raises other questions. "Since corruption has hampered Russia’s ability to supply its military in the Ukraine war, it raises the question of whether the Chinese military’s capabilities have been compromised by corruption or not," Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. FILE - A child sits near canons on a retired warship at the Chinese People's Liberation Army Naval Museum in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province on April 23, 2024. There is also a concern about the impact Xi’s persistent attempts to eradicate corruption will have on the military internally. "When a former defense minister can be abruptly removed from his position without any clear explanation, it will create a deep sense of fear within the military because no one knows when they might be the next one to be purged," said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. Su said this is part of the Communist Party’s strategy of "ruling with terror," which allows Xi to concentrate decision-making power on the top leadership within the party. "While tackling corruption in the military is important to Xi, the anti-corruption campaign has become a political tool for him to consolidate his control over the military," Su told VOA by phone. In January, the state-run People’s Liberation Army Daily published an opinion piece that emphasized the importance of implementing Xi’s instructions for the military and extending the party’s governance to the grassroots level. "By strengthening the supervision of military personnel, it builds a firm first line of defense for soldiers to comply with the rules and refuse to be corrupted," said the opinion piece run by the PLA Daily. While Xi looks to consolidate control and build loyalty, both Chieh and Su see other potential side-effects such as the promotion of unqualified leaders and the impact that could have on the military’s capabilities and readiness. "When Beijing puts so much emphasis on loyalty to the party, it could reduce the military’s combat capabilities and make the military huge but weak," Su said. Xi’s expressed desire to continue cracking down on corruption also means the Chinese military may need to go through a period of adjustment, Chieh said. "Normally, the military’s combat capabilities will decrease following several rounds of purges, so I expect the Chinese military to go through a tough period of adjustment and reorganization over the next few years," he told VOA. And while top officials in the U.S. have repeatedly highlighted 2027 as the year that the Chinese military aims to possess the capabilities to invade Taiwan, Chieh thinks the purges and Xi's remarks at the political work conference suggest the PLA may be hard pressed to achieve that goal. "Since the Chinese military’s command system and the rocket force’s capabilities may not have reached the goal set by the top leadership due to rampant corruption, I think this makes it even less likely for the Chinese military to have the capabilities required to invade Taiwan by 2027," he said.

Dublin, June 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Austria Defense Market - Size and trends, budget allocation, regulations, key acquisitions, competitive landscape and forecast, 2024-2029" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The report covers industry analysis including the key market drivers, emerging technology trends, and major challenges faced by market participants. It also offers insights regarding key factors and government programs that are expected to influence the demand for military platforms over the forecast period. Austrian defense spending, as with many other European nations, has seen an appreciable uptick as the crisis in continental security stemming from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Austria is not a member of NATO, however it is an EU member, and still contributes to European security initiatives through the EU as well as other organizations like the OSCE and the UN. Being a formally neutral nation also comes with its own implications for security and defense: Austria maintains a small but well-equipped and highly professional standing army, alongside a robust system of 'people's militia' reserve forces - all males aged 18-35 must complete a minimum of 6 month's military service, or 9 months in 'alternative public service' for objectors. Those who have completed training are eligible to be called up again in times of national emergency. In response to the deteriorating security environment, Austria is beginning to modernise aspects of its existing forces as well as expanding to newer capabilities, such as new medium and long-range air defense systems. It is increasing the mechanisation of its forces with additional orders of Pandur APCs, and will begin seeking a replacement for its Eurofighter combat jet fleet in the coming years, alongside other purchases such as new helicopters from Augusta Westland (Leonardo). Whilst total spending had a historic tendency to fluctuate, since 2022 Austria has seen consistent increases in defense spending, and this is anticipated to continue through until 2029, where spending peaks at $5.8 billion. Key Highlights Drivers of Defense expenditure include Russia, Ukraine and European Security, tensions in the Middle East, and military technology and rearmament Major ongoing procurement program include procurement of long and medium-range air defense systems.

Written by Cherry Gupta Updated: December 21, 2024 09:33 AM IST 6 min read Whatsapp twitter Facebook Reddit PRINT With a Power Index score of 0.1023 and a total military personnel of approximately 5,137,550, India is ranked as the fourth most powerful country globally in 2024, by military strength. (AP/ representational Image) Top 10 countries with the strongest military in the world 2024: The global military expenditure has reached $2.443 trillion, marking the ninth consecutive year of increase, as per a recent data study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). “The increase in military spending is seen as a direct response to the global deterioration in peace and security,” warns Nan Tian, Senior Researcher with SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme, underscoring the risk of an action-reaction spiral in the increasingly volatile geopolitical and security landscape. Amid rising insecurity and geopolitical conflicts and tensions, most nations today are racing to establish a strong military might, positioning themselves as formidable contenders for the title of the most powerful country in the world by military capabilities, as it reflects their economic and strategic position in the world, enabling them to play a vital role in global politics, defence , and international relations. The Global Firepower Military Strength Ranking recently listed the most powerful militaries in the world, evaluating the military strengths of 145 countries based on over 60 individual factors, contributing to a PowerIndex score (the lower scores indicate stronger military capabilities), making them key players in the global arena.

Photo: Tu Chien-jung, Taipei Times PROCEDURE: If any Chinese aircraft enters within 12 nautical miles of the nation’s territorial airspace and water, the right of self-defense would be invoked, minister said By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter 請繼續往下閱讀... The military would be ordered to exercise the right of self-defense if the Chinese People’s Liberation Army （PLA） attacks Taiwan or its outlying islands, or enters without permission within 12 nautical miles （22.2km） of its territorial airspace and waters, Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo （顧立雄） told lawmakers yesterday. Koo, who was head of the National Security Council under former president Tsai Ing-wen （蔡英文）, gave briefings to lawmakers at the meeting of the legislature’s Foreign and National Defense Committee for the first time after being sworn in on May 20. He is the nation’s seventh defense minister without a military background. During the question-and-answer session, Chinese Nationalist Party （KMT） legislators Huang Jen （黃仁） and Wang Hung-wei （王鴻薇） inquired about the ministry’s definitions of “first strike” and the right of defense. Koo said that the military would be ordered to exercise the right of defense if the PLA launches a first strike against Taiwan or its outlying islands, or its facilities, aircraft and sea vessels in operation. “The right of self-defense would also be invoked if any Chinese aircraft enters within 12 nautical miles of our territorial airspace and waters, and the military should defend and respond in proportion to the size of the attack,” Koo said. Wang also asked how the military obtained information about China’s “Joint Sword-2024A” military exercise on May 23 and 24, and whether its assessment showed that more military exercises are expected in the second half of the year. Koo said he cannot say how the military secured information about the exercise, but it forms assessments based on various signs. “Our military has always been able to obtain the updated status of the PLA, but there is no telling whether they would hold another exercise. We will closely monitor the situation,” he said. Meanwhile, Koo said that the ministry has lifted travel restrictions imposed on active military personnel. Although military personnel were not banned from traveling overseas, they were required to join group tours to ensure their safety and prevent them leaking confidential national security information. Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hung Sun-han （洪申翰） on Facebook wrote that such travel restrictions are meaningless as there is no mechanism to verify whether military personnel would only join group tours. More than 180,000 military personnel in the past few decades were subject to the restriction, including doctors and nurses in military hospitals or faculty members and instructors in military academies or colleges who do not teach subjects related to national intelligence, Hung said. Based on the revised regulations announced by the ministry on Wednesday, military personnel are allowed to travel independently as long as they provide a detailed itinerary, including flights and accommodation. They must present documents proving that they had traveled overseas when they return, such as a photocopy of their passports with arrival and departure stamps, boarding passes or documents provided by hotels. If military personnel join group tours, they must present travel itineraries and a copy of their travel service contract, the regulations say. Koo also said that military personnel with intelligence clearing would be regulated based on the level of confidential information to which they have access, rather than on their rank. The policy is to be changed after consulting with the US military system, he said. In addition, the ministry has relaxed a policy that bans chiefs of military units and their deputies from leaving their barracks at the same time, Koo said. “The requirement was previously set because of frequent harassment from Chinese military aircraft,” Koo said. “However, the military has a well-established chain of command and accumulated experiences. Following detailed discussions about the issue, we have decided to return to the normal division of labor between unit chiefs and deputies so military personnel at all levels can take care of their families as well,” he said. Food stipends for military personnel of all levels would increase, he added. 新聞來源： TAIPEI TIMES 免費訂閱 《自由體育》電子報 熱門賽事、球星動態不漏接 不用抽 不用搶 現在用APP看新聞 保證天天中獎 點我下載APP 按我看活動辦法 相關新聞 焦點今日熱門 看更多！請加入自由時報粉絲團 網友回應

Article Content:
PETALING JAYA: Even though Malaysia aspires to be a regional centre of excellence for civil aviation, the journey towards global recognition is way more than just having infrastructure – such as KLIA, Subang Aerotropolis and the Senai Aerospace Park, just to name a few. One low-key movement that the country is quietly undertaking is the quest to be South-East Asia’s leading aerospace nation by 2030 – as underlined in the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030 (MAIB2030), a plan running from 2015 to 2030 that. If implemented correctly, it should generate RM55.2bil in total revenue and more than 32,000 positions with high income salaries, positioning Malaysia as an essential link in the global aerospace supply chain. The country’s aerospace sector has shown huge promise, emerging as South-East Asia’s second-largest aerospace industry that generates over 27,500 jobs, primarily in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) and aero-manufacturing subsectors, with a report from the Malaysia Investment Development Authority Website attributing these investments as coming from more than 230 domestic and foreign companies. In terms of revenue, the industry is anticipated to provide RM20.4bil in revenue for MRO, RM21.2bil for aero manufacturing as well as RM13.6bil for engineering and design services by 2030. With all of these in place, Malaysia must shine in another area, which is embracing industry-recognised certification linked to safety, reliability, and quality, along with the need for rigorous standard operating procedures. “To achieve their goals and ensure excellence, safety and global recognition, aerospace organisations are embracing AS9100, the Aerospace Quality Management Systems (AQMS) certification scheme,” said Zakaria Mohamad Nor, head of the Mechanical, Electrical and Automotive Sector of Sirim QAS International Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Sirim Group. He said in this regard, Sirim QAS is ready to play its role in assisting industry players to be proficient with AS9100 Aerospace Quality Management Systems (AQMS) certification. “The AS9100 is more than just a set of rules and regulations; it is a strategic tool for achieving success in the aerospace industry. “It provides guidelines and regulations for implementing a quality management system tailored to aviation, space, and defence organisations. “Companies operating in the aerospace sector must consistently manufacture and improve safe, dependable products that meet or surpass consumer and regulatory criteria to ensure satisfaction,” said Zakaria. The AS9100 Aerospace Quality Management Systems Certificate Scheme is essential for all businesses and organisations in the aerospace sector, including those involved in designing, manufacturing, maintenance and services. “Whether a company operates in commercial or military aviation, space or defence, it is imperative that the brand be associated with safety, airworthiness and adherence to global quality standards. Moreover, all leading aircraft OEMs require their suppliers and subcontractors to be AS9100-certified,” he said. The benefits of being AS9100-compliant are manifold, starting with enhanced access to global markets and improving a company’s standing with current and potential customers. “Organisations with AS9100 AQMS certification are better positioned to engage with aerospace industry players worldwide, from companies to government bodies. “This certification opens doors to larger-scale business opportunities. “Many government contracts, especially in aerospace and defence, mandate relevant certifications, making AS9100 certification a critical asset. “In line with the government’s strategy to bolster the local aerospace industry, having the AS9100 certification ensures product safety and reliability,” said Zakaria, adding that Sirim has a team of experienced auditors in this regard. As far as certification goes, Sirim QAS has a critical role in the fulfilment of Malaysia’s Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030, as coordinated by the National Aerospace Industry Corporation Malaysia (Naico Malaysia). “Through Naico Malaysia, the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry has designated Sirim as one of the service providers in the aerospace industry supply chain. “In accordance with international aerospace standards AS9100 (aero production), AS9110 (maintenance, repair and overhaul), and AS9120 (aerospace parts distribution), Sirim QAS initiated a five-year programme for the development of the Aerospace Quality Management Systems, making Sirim QAS an active contributor to Malaysia’s aerospace industry’s growth and competitiveness. According to Zakaria, Sirim QAS’ recent participation in the Singapore Air Show 2024 was intended to showcase his company’s expansion into the South-East Asia market for aerospace quality certification services, particularly highlighting its status as the first Asean-based company to offer aerospace standard 9100 in the region. “We also wanted to showcase Sirim QAS International as Malaysia’s leading testing, inspection, and certification services provider, emphasising its accreditation under various bodies. “We believe we have increased our visibility through good engagement with the aerospace community in South-East Asia, with Sirim successfully raising awareness about its expertise and offerings in aerospace quality certification services,” he added.

Pratyush Kumar, who was Boeing India chief till recently and then went on to head the F-15 programme in the US, has left his corner office to become an angel investor for desi aerospace supply chain startups. Apart from putting in an undisclosed amount of his own, Kumar is also advising VCs in Europe and North America to invest in the right startups here. "The aerospace industry has a tiered supply chain level right across. This ecosystem suffered a pretty large shock during the pandemic with a lot of the demand going away; OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) slashing output and employees retiring," Kumar told TOI from the US. Then from 2022, travel saw a way faster than expected rebound and suddenly from almost all planes grounded globally airlines did not have enough aircraft to fly people around. Kumar, who spent over two decades in leadership roles at GE & Boeing, said: "During Covid, we saw the 'Great Resignations' when a lot of experienced talent actually walked out. (When demand returned), many in (the talent pool) never came back in the western world," he said. As a result, there weren't adequate number of trained people to meet the sudden spurt in demand for parts, engines, and planes. That's when Kumar saw an opportunity for the Indian aerospace startups which were beginning to come of age due to the tremendous availability of talent in the country. "The western world has a great shortage of manpower for highly skilled jobs. The big OEMs can find people but not the tier II, III & further down the line. So, there is an acute shortage of quality suppliers for aerospace. If you look at the output of the big OEMs, you can see that they are not able to meet even half the demand or less than that," said Kumar. "At this point, I started thinking how we can alleviate this. Where do you go? You have to go to what are the friendly countries. India was in the short list with a deep experience and huge talent pool." At this "unique moment of time" he thought of leaving Boeing and did so last year. Since then he has backed startups like Jeh Aerospace in India and is in talks with several more apart from advising VCs to do the same by shortlisting the right ones. "I know over 200 suppliers (in India) really well. They have a really great opportunity and some truly world-class fantastic people. If you bring them together, you can create sustainable long-term successful businesses. That's how I got associated with these guys. The demand for aerospace products is tremendous and the supply chain will remain constrained. So as long as they (Indian supply chain industry) can maintain two things -- quality and delivery, -- there's infinite demand for these products," he said. Asked the size of his investments in India, Kumar just said he is "investing some of my own personal savings in some companies. I'm also advising some big VC companies to find the right companies to support." "I'm in touch with at least 50 different Indian companies in that space. I'm not going to commit investment to all 50. In some I will do so and some I will refer to the VCs," he said. "Most Indian startups don't have access to global markets. I am able to bridge that gap. Connecting the aerospace industry in the west with the Indian startup scene, that's what I'm trying to do," said Kumar who was the VP of Boeing F-15 programme when he left the aerospace major last year. He is now an angel investor in aerospace and defence startups like Jeh Aerospace and Conforming Inc and an advisor to leading VC firm General Catalyst.

However, details were not furnished on the concrete efforts discussed between the Defense Ministry and the Air Force to improve the air defense field. President-elect Subianto, on Instagram account @kemhan , conveyed the need for sound coordination between the Air Force and the Defense Ministry to improve Indonesia's air defense. "Synchronization and synergistic coordination between the Air Force and the Defense Ministry are necessary," he emphasized. Based on an earlier report, Harjono expressed keenness to bring all ranks of the Indonesian military (TNI) and National Police (Polri) together to work to bolster Indonesia's air defense. "We expect guidance and support from various parties, including from TNI and Polri officials and seniors, so that we can carry out this mandate well," he remarked while giving a speech at the Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base here on Friday (April 5). He explained that his side had received a direct order from President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) to strengthen air defense. He said his side will carry out the mandate by strengthening security detection technology and the main defense equipment.

Title: GE Aerospace Stock Has 22 % Upside , According to 1 Wall Street Analyst

Article Content:
GE Aerospace ( GE 0.44% ) is the legacy business of the former General Electric, which recently completed its separation into three distinct businesses. In adjusting his take on the company now that it has "Aerospace," attached to its name, one pundit following the stock reduced his price target. He still feels the shares have plenty of room to move higher, though. General Electric slims down into GE Aerospace The analyst behind the adjustment is Deutsche Bank 's Scott Deuschle, who lopped off $20 from his previous price target (back when the stock was just plain old General Electric) for a new level of $190 per share. That implies a nearly 22% upside from the current price. He also ported over his buy recommendation to GE Aerospace. The company, which is now more focused than the former General Electric, is deserving of a premium over its peers. Deuschle wrote that this is due to GE Aerospace's "wide moat, dominant share position, strong long-term growth outlook, pricing power, high [return on total capital], high balance sheet optionality, and track record for beating and raising." Deuschle is convinced GE Aerospace can soar. He pegged it as being one of Deutsche Bank's top stock picks in the aerospace and defense field. Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.44 %) $ -1.37 Current Price $ 310.57 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.21 - $ 312.62 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 128K Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Good timing I feel this assessment is realistic, as GE Aerospace is coming into existence at a busy time for the commercial aviation industry , an important customer base for the company. With tourism demand strong and sustainable, those customers will need turbofan engines like the LEAPs GE Aerospace and European peer Safran Aircraft Engines produce in their joint-venture CFM International. The former's stock feels like it can gain more altitude.

Why GE Aerospace Stock Is Up Today Lou Whiteman, The Motley Fool April 5, 2024 2 min read GE As the dust settles on the breakup of the industrial conglomerate known as General Electric, markets are still trying to figure out how to price the different parts of the business. Shares of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) traded up 5% as of 10:30 ET on Friday as investors took a fresh look at the potential of the aircraft-focused part of the business. A powerful force unleashed Amid all the issues experienced by General Electric over the last decade, aerospace was always a standout piece of the operation. The GE ticker took a plunge earlier this week to reflect that its energy business is now trading as a new entity, GE Verona , but the stock is slowly climbing back toward previous highs thanks to the potential of the aerospace market. GE Aerospace has exposure to some of the best-selling aviation platforms, including the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 neo, thanks to its stake in the CFM International engine joint venture. Both Boeing and Airbus have order backlogs that will last through the rest of the decade, providing predictable growth. GE Aerospace also could have opportunities to take market share from rival RTX thanks to issues with that company's Pratt & Whitney engines . Half a dozen analysts have adjusted their price targets on GE downward this week to reflect the spinoff, but only one of those targets is below GE Aerospace's current share price. Now flying solo, is GE Aerospace stock a buy? GE Aerospace faces some near-term headwinds, including Boeing's ongoing issues with the 737 MAX and questions about how rapidly engine companies can ramp up production. But its potential for long-term growth is hard to ignore. For years, even as GE struggled under the weight of its debt burden and due to problems in its energy business and elsewhere, investors marveled at the strength of its aerospace segment and the potential for growth from here. Now, investors finally have the chance to buy into that potential without the baggage. For long-term focused investors, GE Aerospace ranks as one of the more attractive opportunities in its sector. Should you invest $1,000 in GE Aerospace right now?

Article Content:
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 — Fifteen Malaysian companies are set to showcase their capabilities at the Farnborough International Airshow (FIA) 2024, to be held July 22-26, 2024 in the United Kingdom (UK). Abu Bakar Yusof, Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation’s (Matrade) deputy chief executive officer of export acceleration, said the companies’ expertise encompass aerospace manufacturing, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), system integration, engineering services, education and astronautics. He said Matrade would lead the Malaysia Pavilion at the prestigious airshow, in collaboration with National Aerospace Industry Corporation Malaysia (Naico). “We would like to invite Malaysian aerospace companies to take this opportunity and join us at FIA 2024,” he said. Abu Bakar also expressed confidence in Malaysia’s aerospace sector, citing a remarkable 31 per cent surge in exports of aerospace products to reach RM979.9 million in the first two months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Major export destinations for Malaysia’s aerospace products include the United States, China, Indonesia, the UK and Singapore. According to Matrade, the UK is a significant export destination for Malaysian aerospace products, as exports of aerospace products (parts of planes and helicopters) to the country stood at RM287.2 million in 2023. “The UK’s demand for aerospace products and services is anticipated to maintain its upward trajectory, driven by the resurgence of air travel, a spike in aircraft orders, and the expansion of the MRO sector. “Malaysian companies are encouraged to leverage this burgeoning demand by engaging with potential clients, project leaders and aerospace procurement officials during FIA 2024,” added Matrade. This year will mark Matrade’s fifth participation in the FIA. In 2022, Matrade had set up 332 business meetings and linkages, resulting in total sales of RM572.6 million. Malaysian companies wishing to participate in FIA 2024 may send in their application before April 26. Those who wish for more information may contact Matrade at 03-6207 7933. — Bernama

BEIJING , April 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A report from People's Daily Today, countries around the world are facing the challenges brought by climate change. Over 130 countries and regions have set carbon neutrality targets, and the development of new energy industries and the achievement of green and low-carbon transformation are common aspirations. In Thailand , Chinese electric vehicle brands are known by more and more people, and several Chinese car companies are expected to achieve localized production. In Kazakhstan , Chinese enterprises have turned wind into a resource, enabling the small town of Zhanatas with a population of only about 20,000 to catch up with the wave of new energy development. In Brazil , Chinese companies are investing in solar photovoltaic, onshore wind power, and hydropower projects, providing a stable source of clean electricity. China's continuous provision of high-quality new energy products is effectively promoting global green and low-carbon transformation. China is an important participant, contributor and trailblazer in the global climate governance process. It is also a significant producer of green products and a key engine driving global energy transformation. China has been vigorously promoting the development of ecological civilization and actively developing the new energy industry, demonstrating its determination and action in addressing climate change. The export of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, and more from China has not only enriched global supply and alleviated inflation but also provided significant support for countries to achieve carbon reduction goals and accelerate green transformation. According to the International Energy Agency's 2023 market report on renewable energy, global annual renewable capacity additions reached 510 gigawatts last year, growing at a faster rate than any other time in the past 30 years, and China was the largest driving force for the growth. Data released by China's National Energy Administration last year showed that over the past decade, China contributed over 40 percent to the growth in the world's non-fossil energy consumption. In 2022, China's exports of wind and solar power products helped other countries reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 600 million tons. World Meteorological Organization secretary-general Celeste Saulo pointed out that comprehensive participation from major countries like China is necessary in addressing climate change. China adheres to open development and shares advanced green technologies with the world, significantly improving the accessibility of technology. From a global perspective, green and low-carbon development is a major direction of the innovation in energy technology. Through continuous research and efforts, China has become a global leader in several new energy technologies and equipment manufacturing. It has built the world's largest clean power supply system, with its hydropower, wind power, solar power, and biomass capacities consistently ranking first in the world for years. China's new energy generation technology is at the forefront globally, effectively driving down the costs of wind and solar power generation. Tim Gould , chief energy economist at the International Energy Agency, said that China possesses unique advantages in the development and application of clean energy technologies. China has achieved fruitful results in a number of major engineering projects, providing strong technological support for global energy transformation. China is actively promoting international cooperation in the field of new energy, aiming to build a new model of green and low-carbon energy transformation for mutual benefit. So far, China's overseas investment in non-fossil energy has surpassed that in fossil energy, leading to the successful completion of several landmark projects in clean, efficient, and high-quality green energy cooperation. China is steadily advancing the development of a green Belt and Road and has engaged in green energy project cooperation with over 100 countries and regions, providing strong support for their green and low-carbon energy development. China has proposed the Belt and Road Energy Partnership and has set up six regional energy cooperation platforms, promoting the establishment of global clean energy partnerships. These efforts have played an important role in promoting global clean energy transformation and ensuring global energy security. Erik Solheim , vice chairman of the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition and former under-secretary-general of the United Nations, believes that China has made significant contributions to global renewable energy development, bringing innovation that drives economic development and green and low-carbon transformation to other developing countries. China's continuous provision of high-quality capacity in the new energy industry has made significant contributions to global green development, and it has been widely welcomed by the majority of countries worldwide.

Nevada utility NV Energy’s largest battery energy storage system sits on a former coal-fired power plant site and will save customers a lot of money. Swiss-US battery energy storage specialist Energy Vault (NYSE: NRGV) built the 220 MW/440 MWh grid-tied Reid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Moapa, Nevada, 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Energy Vault will maintain the system. The new BESS is on the site of the former 557-megawatt (MW) coal-fired Reid Gardner Generating Station, which was demolished in 2019. It’s a two-hour energy storage system that stores and dispatches excess wind and solar power. It’s charged and discharged daily and dispatches stored renewable energy at peak consumption hours to help meet demand. Advertisement - scroll for more content NV Energy CEO Dough Cannon explained to local TV network KTNV: The hours that [NV Energy] really get concerned about are from about 5 pm to 9 pm. Because what happens, at that point, is the solar energy has really started to ramp off as the sun’s going down. And so, we have often had to go out to the market, the energy market, and buy energy to meet the needs between 5 pm and 9 pm. Over the last couple of years, on average, we’ve paid $250 a unit of energy during those hours. We look at a project like this, and this can deliver energy for closer to $100 an hour a unit of energy. Top comment by Luis Alejandro Masanti Liked by 7 people Both… the closed coal plant… and the storage plant… need to be connected to the grid. If they put the storage in another place… they would need to build a new connection to the grid. Just ‘logical’ place. View all comments The Inflation Reduction Act covered 40% of the project’s $250 million cost. Cannon told KTNV that thanks to the new BESS, the utility’s customers would see a 15-20% reduction in their bills by the end of 2024.

Customers could receive up to $9,000 as a one-time incentive to help lower the cost of installing solar and battery storage Programs explore new ways to help manage low carbon grids of the future CHARLOTTE, N.C. , April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ) is implementing PowerPair SM , a new incentive-based pilot program for installing home solar generation with battery energy storage in its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress service areas in North Carolina . The company received approval from the North Carolinas Utility Commission (NCUC) for the program on January 11, 2024 . The one-time incentive-based program, designed to help make a home solar plus battery system more affordable for customers, offers up to $9,000 in incentives for residential customers who install a solar plus battery system. The total incentive is based on the type of solar array and battery installed. PowerPair was designed in collaboration with numerous stakeholder groups pursuant to the direction of the NCUC. "PowerPair gives Duke Energy an added tool to provide more reliability to solar energy which in turn benefits all customers as North Carolina grows in population," said Lon Huber , Duke Energy senior vice president, Pricing and Customer Solutions. "And by participating, customers are helping to support the state's clean energy goals." Some PowerPair customers and customers with existing battery storage may also participate in the company's expanded demand response programs. The Power Manager ® and EnergyWise ® Home programs will now include the newly approved battery control option, available in July. By enrolling, customers allow Duke Energy to temporarily adjust the system's operating setting a minimum of 30 times per year up to a maximum of 36 times per year, to provide stored electricity back to the grid. Participants receive a bill credit each month for enrolling a qualifying battery storage system and meeting program requirements, including internet connectivity. Customers may opt out of four events per year and still be eligible to receive bill credits. "As we continue to strengthen our grid and bring clean energy resources online, our customers are important partners in our clean energy future – and can receive upfront and potential ongoing financial incentives for coupling solar power and battery storage on their residential systems," said Huber. "These programs enable Duke Energy to maximize the use of popular consumer technologies to support the overall energy grid." Participants in the pilot will have two enrollment options. They can enroll in the PowerPair pilot on a residential solar choice rider (RSC) or through a net metering bridge rider (NMB) and receive a one-time incentive of up to $9,000 . NMB customers will be required to enroll in the new Power Manager and EnergyWise Home Battery Control option. They will receive the additional monthly bill credits for their participation. To help ensure incentive equity, PowerPair pilot participants will initially be selected through a random selection process (RSP), which will open May 10 . The RSP window for the PowerPair program will be four weeks in length, allowing customers time to apply on the Duke Energy website. Customers can sign up to receive program updates, view the approved battery vendor list and view information on equipment eligibility (not all systems will be eligible) at duke-energy.com/PowerPair . Participating PowerPair customers must employ a Duke Energy Trade Ally, a solar and battery installer that has been approved by Duke Energy. Customers can use the Company's Find It Duke program to locate approved companies knowledgeable about the program. Installers may apply to become a Duke Energy Trade Ally here . Ranked fourth in the nation for overall solar power, North Carolina has approximately 45,000 customers who generate power with solar panels with a total capacity of about 350 megawatts. The expanded demand response offerings will add to the existing 100 megawatts of residential flexible winter capacity in North Carolina. Duke Energy Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ), a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C. , is one of America's largest energy holding companies. The company's electric utilities serve 8.4 million customers in North Carolina , South Carolina , Florida , Indiana , Ohio and Kentucky , and collectively own 54,800 megawatts of energy capacity. Its natural gas unit serves 1.7 million customers in North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee , Ohio and Kentucky . Duke Energy is executing an ambitious clean energy transition, keeping reliability, affordability and accessibility at the forefront as the company works toward net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas business by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. The company is investing in major electric grid upgrades and cleaner generation, including expanded energy storage, renewables, natural gas and advanced nuclear.

Title: A stronger electric grid , enhanced customer services and environmental obligations are some of the drivers of Duke Energy Indiana rate request

Article Content:
Electric grid security and investments to serve a growing state are also key parts of the request Voluntary 'time-of-use' rates proposed to help manage customer bills PLAINFIELD, Ind. , April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A modernized electric grid more resistant to power outages, hundreds of miles of new power lines, environmental responsibilities, increased electric grid security and new systems for customer convenience are some of the key parts of Duke Energy's Indiana rate request submitted to state utility regulators. "Since our last base rate increase in 2020, we've invested $1.6 billion in our electric grid, power plants and overall system on behalf of our customers, including advanced technology that has helped prevent more than 185,000 power outages," said Duke Energy Indiana President Stan Pinegar . "We know that utility costs can be a major part of a household and business's budget and that customers expect us to do our part to keep bills as low as possible," Pinegar said. "We have kept our day-to-day operating costs flat since 2020 while we make long-term investments to serve customers. We also are proposing voluntary, 'time-of-use' rates to help manage customer bills. Fortunately, fuel costs for our electricity production have declined, and residential customer bills are about 25% lower than they were in late 2022." Filed April 4 with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the request is for an overall average bill increase of approximately 16%, which, if approved, would be added to bills in two steps, approximately 12% in 2025 and about 4% in 2026. The annual revenue increase would be $492 million . The increase will vary among consumers depending on the cost to serve different types of customers, such as residential and business. The total monthly impact of the two steps for a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month would be about 19%, or $27.63 . As a regulated business, Duke Energy's rates can only be changed after approval from state utility regulators, so there is no immediate impact from this request. There will be extensive public proceedings, including opportunities for customer input. A regulatory decision is possible in early 2025. To help customers manage their electric bills, Duke Energy is proposing time-of-use rates where customers can shift some of their power use to times of day when energy is less expensive. If the program is approved, it would be voluntary for residential, commercial and industrial customers interested in participating. Investments, improvements and upgrades Some of the components of Duke Energy's request include: Duke Energy is adding state-of-the-art sensors to its Indiana power lines. Much like the GPS in a car that can identify an accident ahead and reroute a driver around the incident, the technology can quickly identify power outages and alternate energy pathways to restore service faster for customers when an outage occurs. For a video of how the technology works, visit Self Healing Technology - Duke Energy (duke-energy.com) The company is hardening its system against severe weather to reduce power outages, including changing wood poles to steel, undergrounding power lines in targeted, outage-prone areas, and rebuilding miles of overhead lines. When last spring's tornadoes ripped through Indiana , steel structures on Duke Energy's Indiana system withstood the weather. In the wake of physical attacks to the electric grid nationally, the company is taking steps to improve physical security and protections at some of its key infrastructure delivering power to Indiana communities. Indiana's economy is growing, and Duke Energy expects to have more than 60,000 new residential and business customers by 2025. The company is adding 345 miles of new power lines and infrastructure to serve them. Federal rules require changes to the way we manage coal ash generated from electricity production and stored at our power plant sites. Duke Energy is closing its Indiana ash basins responsibly and in compliance with environmental regulations. The company needs to keep pace with evolving customer needs and expectations and has installed new systems, such as the ability for customers to initiate service at a new location online and receive service the same day. Energy assistance and bill management In addition to the proposed time-of-use rates, Duke Energy has more than a dozen energy assistance and bill-lowering tools, including: Usage Alerts that send customers a notification of how much electricity they are using and its cost so they can make adjustments before their billing period ends. Free Home Energy House Calls , where energy professionals assess a home for efficiency and provide homeowners with a toolkit of energy saving devices. Budget Billing, which helps ease the impact of higher seasonal bills by leveling out monthly payments. Interest-free payment plans for customers needing flexibility. Share the Light program funded by Duke Energy shareholders for qualifying customers who may be struggling to pay their energy bills. For more information about these programs and others, visit: duke-energy.com/LowerMyBills . There is also more information on this rate request at duke-energy.com/IN-Rates .

Views Views Energy price hikes make clean energy compelling for Bangladesh Thu Apr 4, 2024 07:00 AM Last update on: Thu Apr 4, 2024 12:45 PM Shafiqul Alam Thu Apr 4, 2024 07:00 AM Last update on: Thu Apr 4, 2024 12:45 PM Photo: Reuters The Bangladesh government recently increased power tariffs for all consumer categories due to the upheavals caused by a significant gap between power generation costs and corresponding revenue. It also revised the natural gas price for power generation. While inflationary pressures will likely remain high in the wake of electricity and gas price hikes, different energy consumers will now find clean energy investment more compelling. A brief survey of around 40 industries by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) indicates that the industry sector has significant untapped energy efficiency potential. This is despite the fact that a good number of the surveyed industries have already installed efficient lights, motors and fans, variable-frequency drives, waste heat recovery boilers, etc. However, a considerable proportion of the surveyed industries are not utilising waste heat produced by their captive generators. Only a small number of industry samples use engine jacket water in chillers and water heaters. If all industries gradually install waste heat recovery boilers and start using engine jacket water in chillers and water heaters, they can save significant energy consumption per annum on an aggregate basis. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Read more What to make of Petrobangla’s new oil and gas exploration tender? The survey also finds that cutting costs and reaching sustainability targets are the two main drivers influencing industrial energy efficiency investment. Therefore, the recent increase in electricity tariffs—around 9.9 percent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for medium and large industries—and gas price—2.5 percent per cubic metre for captive power generation —will likely motivate industries to foster energy efficiency further. Bangladesh's household sector consumed 55.69 percent of the grid electricity produced in FY2022-23. As such, increasing energy efficiency in this sector holds significant importance. Although many households are already accustomed to buying efficient appliances, 120W ceiling fans are still in the market when energy-efficient 35W ceiling fans are available. Perhaps people who can purchase efficient fans are unaware of the economics of using fans that consume less energy. A ballpark assessment shows that the payback period of a 35W ceiling fan costing Tk 6,490 has now come down to 3.3 years for a household with a monthly energy consumption of around 150kWh (assumptions: 10 hours of operation for 310 days a year and five percent VAT on energy bills). The payback period was 3.5 and 4.1 years in March 2023 and December 2022, respectively. Similarly, the payback for the same fan is now 3.1 years for a household consuming around 250kWh of energy per month. Such a financial return should motivate households to use ceiling fans with lower wattage. Households battling high energy tariffs should, therefore, assess the energy consumption of different appliances and their respective purchase prices to make prudent investment decisions. The recent power tariff adjustment is a boon for rooftop solar expansion, both in industries and commercial buildings. They can now enjoy more savings per kWh of energy. While the first movers had less savings, the lucrative rooftop solar should now make inroads into all industries and commercial buildings with enough space and load-bearing capacity. Regulatory intervention will further catalyse the accelerated adoption of energy efficiency measures and rooftop solar. The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), established in 2014 on the back of the growing need to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in Bangladesh, has notable tasks ahead. As the combined rooftop solar capacity, under both net-metered and non-net-metered systems , is less than 200MW, SREDA can take a more proactive role through its solar help desk to assess what holds back industries and other establishments from investing in rooftop solar systems. Likewise, if SREDA organises periodic knowledge exchange events on successful energy efficiency projects, it can tempt designated energy consumers and industries to gradually implement the remaining low-hanging energy efficiency measures and beyond. Tellingly, SREDA should monitor the status of the mandatory submission of energy auditin g reports by different industrial sub-sectors applicable from 2023 and 2024, respectively. For households, the awareness level of energy efficiency should go beyond the general understanding that energy-efficient appliances save energy. Instead, they need to grasp that an appliance with the lowest wattage among its peers and serving the same needs is the most energy-efficient. Energy labels can help consumers choose the most efficient appliance. SREDA should coordinate with the government's Power Division to promptly approve and enforce the standards and labelling regulations. While energy efficiency and rooftop solar offer green energy investment opportunities, challenges in accessing finance or limited financing lead to negative knock-on effects. The Bangladesh Bank's refinancing scheme of Tk 400 crore ($36.44 million) is the least costly loan facility on offer for which environment-friendly projects of 70 categories compete. The rooftop solar financing facility of the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) is just a fraction of what the sector needs. Likewise, IDCOL's credit line of $256.5 million for RMG and textile sector energy efficiency, supported by the Green Climate Fund, is not enough. Conversely, the commercial banks' ability to deploy funds for loans at current market rates would not garner the interest from industries or commercial buildings. Read more We need smart policymaking, not smart blame games in the energy sector It is therefore necessary to mobilise finance at scale, drawing on the window of opportunities that different multilateral development banks offer. The Bangladesh Bank may create a dedicated low-cost financing scheme for rooftop solar like it developed for the brick kiln sector, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In the throes of energy sector challenges, rooftop solar and energy efficiency would help Bangladesh manage the situation better. And if the country can advance energy efficiency and rooftop solar, taking a sectoral approach, it will end up with manifold larger benefits than one may think of. The investment signal is favourable as Bangladesh is already in the high energy cost regime and tariffs will rise further.

It also revised the natural gas price for power generation. While inflationary pressures will likely remain high in the wake of electricity and gas price hikes, different energy consumers will now find clean energy investment more compelling. A brief survey of around 40 industries by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) indicates that the industry sector has significant untapped energy efficiency potential. This is despite the fact that a good number of the surveyed industries have already installed efficient lights, motors and fans, variable-frequency drives, waste heat recovery boilers, etc. However, a considerable proportion of the surveyed industries are not utilising waste heat produced by their captive generators. Only a small number of industry samples use engine jacket water in chillers and water heaters. If all industries gradually install waste heat recovery boilers and start using engine jacket water in chillers and water heaters, they can save significant energy consumption per annum on an aggregate basis.

The survey also finds that cutting costs and reaching sustainability targets are the two main drivers influencing industrial energy efficiency investment. Therefore, the recent increase in electricity tariffs—around 9.9 percent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for medium and large industries—and gas price—2.5 percent per cubic metre for captive power generation —will likely motivate industries to foster energy efficiency further. Bangladesh's household sector consumed 55.69 percent of the grid electricity produced in FY2022-23. As such, increasing energy efficiency in this sector holds significant importance. Although many households are already accustomed to buying efficient appliances, 120W ceiling fans are still in the market when energy-efficient 35W ceiling fans are available.

Gov. Josh Shapiro: My commonsense plan for a new era of energy leadership in Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro Tuesday, April 2, 2024 11:00 a.m. | Tuesday, April 2, 2024 11:00 a.m. Go Ad-Free Today! Commonwealth Media Services Gov. Josh Shapiro announces his new cap-and-trade program in March in Scranton. Pennsylvania’s energy industry has long created good-paying jobs and ensured consumers have reliable, affordable power. The coal mines and oil fields of Northeastern and Western Pennsylvania fueled the Industrial Revolution, which powered the middle class and led to the creation of the American labor movement. When fascism threatened freedom overseas, our commonwealth produced the energy that made the arsenal of democracy the most powerful manufacturing base in the world — all powered by Pennsylvania workers. Unfortunately, due to inaction and partisan standoffs of recent years, Pennsylvania has failed to capitalize on our legacy as an energy leader, and other states are moving to overtake us. We need to be more competitive — and it’s time we write the next chapter. Soon after I took office as governor , I brought together a working group of leaders from the energy industry, organized labor, environmental groups and consumer advocates to come up with a plan to protect Pennsylvania’s position as an energy leader and develop a strategy for the future. I’ve made clear that any energy policy supported by my administration must meet a three-part test: it must protect and create energy jobs, take real action to address climate change, and ensure reliable, affordable power for consumers in the long term. Following the recommendations of that working group, last week, I announced my plan to build on Pennsylvania’s legacy of energy leadership by protecting and creating energy jobs and lowering electricity costs for consumers. My plan calls for two key initiatives. First, it would create the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction (PACER), which would set a cap for the amount of carbon that large power plants can produce and release into the air and reinvest the money raised directly in Pennsylvanians to lower their electricity bills, increase energy efficiency and create energy jobs. Here’s how it would work: the approximately 55 large power plants in Pennsylvania purchase credits from the commonwealth to offset the amount of carbon pollution they’re putting out. With that funding, we’ll give Pennsylvanians an electric bill rebate , so no one pays more on their electricity bill — and some will even pay less . The remaining 30% of the funding generated will be reinvested in large energy-producing facilities in Pennsylvania — like Homer City in Indiana County — used to lower costs further for those who need help the most, and allocated to support projects that increase energy efficiency. Importantly, this is a plan tailored for Pennsylvania and run by Pennsylvanians. We will set our own cap and our own price for those carbon credits. We won’t have other states determining what’s right for us. If the General Assembly passes my plan, I will sign it — immediately removing us from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The second part of my plan calls for Pennsylvania to create a more reliable and sustainable energy grid in Pennsylvania. Twenty years ago, Pennsylvania was one of the first states to pass Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which established what kind of energy we use here in Pennsylvania and where it comes from. We haven’t made any major updates to those standards in 17 years , but in that time, 30 other states — including states run by both Democrats and Republicans — have updated their standards . We’re losing out on new investment and innovation — and that means we’re losing out on jobs and growth. My plan creates the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS.) PRESS updates our energy standards and expands the tiers of what kind of energy sources can qualify. It will create new markets for clean energy, while also supporting key energy industries that have helped Pennsylvania become a national leader. PRESS accomplishes that by calling for 35% clean energy by 2035 — and expanding the number of zero-emission sources that qualify. It’s not just solar and wind — it also includes sources like methane digesters, new fusion technology and small modular nuclear reactors — all things Pennsylvania has invested in in recent years. A few months ago, I was in Etna in Allegheny County to announce a new investment by our commonwealth in Westinghouse, a company developing and producing the small modular reactors that will help power our future. PRESS encourages investment into that kind of technology, supporting Pennsylvania-grown innovation and good jobs. Taken together, PACER and PRESS would save Pennsylvania ratepayers $252 million over the next five years, create 14,500 jobs, and once again position Pennsylvania as a leader in the energy industry. I know energy is a challenging topic and there are passionate views on all sides of this issue, but doing nothing is not an option. If those who propose to sit tight and do nothing have their way, consumers will end up paying more for their electricity bills, we won’t create enough jobs, and we’ll see more pollution and damage in communities already suffering from the impacts of climate change. I’m sick and tired of falling behind other states — on energy, on economic development, on creating opportunity for our people. It’s time to take commonsense steps to cut costs, protect our planet and create jobs. I’m calling on the General Assembly to step up to the plate, take action to move Pennsylvania forward and pass these bills. Send them to my desk and let’s ensure Pennsylvania is again an energy leader and remains so for decades to come. Josh Shapiro is Pennsylvania governor.

CEBU, Philippines — A bustling hub in the Visayas, Cebu symbolizes the Philippines’ economic vitality. However, the province is confronting a significant challenge—an impending energy shortage that threatens its stability. Cebu’s economy thrives, buoyed by tourism and a flourishing IT-BPM industry. In recent years, tourist arrivals have surged, and the IT-BPM sector has seen remarkable growth, contributing to Cebu's economic resilience. Despite its economic success, Cebu faces an energy crisis due to rising demand and aging infrastructure. The reliance on external power sources poses vulnerabilities, particularly during periods of high consumption, like the approaching El Nino. While the Department of Energy has approved projects for Central Visayas, addressing Cebu’s projected energy shortfall requires localized solutions. Key economic hubs drive substantial energy demand, underscoring the urgency of ensuring sufficient and stable power sources. While renewable energy offers promise, a gradual transition is necessary to meet Cebu’s growing energy needs. The Philippine Energy Plan advocates for a balanced approach, aiming for a mix of renewable and non-renewable energy sources by 2040. Leadership from entities like the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia emphasizes the importance of addressing Cebu’s energy challenges promptly. Investments in reliable power infrastructure and a diversified energy portfolio are essential for sustaining economic growth and protecting residents’ well-being. As Cebu’s economy continues to expand, addressing energy concerns becomes increasingly crucial. Through collaborative efforts and strategic investments, Cebu can navigate the energy landscape toward a more stable and sustainable future. CEBU ENERGY BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

This column reflects the opinion of the writer. Learn about the differences between a news story and an opinion column. X Email Reddit SMS Crystal Pyrak, M.D. By Crystal Pyrak, M.D. Welcome, summer! As families across Idaho gear up for outdoor adventures and quality time together, I’m compelled to address a significant legislative change that will impact pediatric health care access starting July 1. Senate Bill 1329, recently passed into law, introduces critical adjustments that warrant our attention and concern. This new law primarily focuses on increasing parental involvement in minors’ health care decisions. While parental consent is undeniably crucial in certain medical situations, the broad scope of this legislation extends its impact across all health care providers who interact with minors, including physical therapists, counselors and chiropractors. This legislative breadth necessitates compliance from a wide array of health care professionals, not just doctors. The repercussions for noncompliance with the law are severe, including potential jail time. This punitive measure has understandably instilled fear among health care providers, leading many to contemplate reducing or limiting services for minors altogether. Consequently, adolescents may experience a significant loss of autonomy in managing their health care decisions, previously acquired through practice and guidance from trusted health professionals. Moreover, the law’s stringent requirements have had a chilling effect on community-oriented health care activities. Providers, fearful of legal liabilities stemming from inadequate parental consent, are increasingly withdrawing from volunteer services at events like sports games and educational gatherings. This withdrawal not only affects the availability of health care services but also diminishes valuable community interactions and support. It’s also important to note that youth mental health and substance abuse screening is often most effective when a parent is not present. I encourage all parents to talk to your child’s physician about working together to ensure your child can receive supportive and effective mental health screening and services. Recognizing the challenges posed by the new law, health care entities across Idaho are striving to streamline the parental consent process. Efforts are underway to ensure that parents are informed and empowered without unnecessary burdens or confusion. However, despite these efforts, the implementation of the law requires careful monitoring and flexibility from all stakeholders, including parents and health care providers. It’s crucial for Idaho residents to remain vigilant about any negative impacts resulting from this new law. If you observe instances where minors are denied access to necessary health care services or if you notice a disruption in community health initiatives, I encourage you to engage with your legislators. While the legislation may be rooted in good intentions, any law that hampers patient-provider relationships or instills undue fear among health care providers risks causing unintended harm. As we embark on a season of outdoor enjoyment and family bonding, let’s also stay informed and proactive about legislative changes that affect our health care system. Let’s work together to ensure that minors in Idaho continue to receive the care they need while fostering a supportive environment for health care providers to serve our communities effectively. By remaining attentive and advocating for thoughtful adjustments where necessary, we can uphold the well-being of our youngest citizens and the integrity of our health care system.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr. Updated June 28, 2024 at 3:27 PM 1 Copied Spencer Platt During Thursday night’s debate, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump spent a considerable amount of time trying to claim credit for lowering the high cost of insulin . But the back and forth over insulin prices failed to address the underlying issue that many Americans fret over: the exorbitant cost of health care . “The United States has a health care affordability crisis and this stark fact was utterly absent from the presidential debate,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. A February poll by KFF, a nonprofit group that researchers health policy issues, found that unexpected medical bills and the cost of health care are at the top of the list of peoples’ financial worries, with about three-quarters of the public saying they’re at least somewhat worried about being able to afford unexpected medical bills or the cost of health care for themselves and their families. “It was a huge swing and a miss,” Drew Altman, the president and CEO of KFF, said of the debate. “There was no meaningful attention to health care and, more importantly, to health care costs, which is absolutely an issue of major concern for voters.” People in the U.S. pay roughly twice as much for health care than any other nation on earth, Gostin said, and yet the country's health outcomes are inferior to most peer nations. What's more, health care costs continue to rise in America. National health care spending — which includes spending on physicians, services from hospitals, and prescription drug costs — is projected to grow to almost $4.8 trillion in 2023, increasing faster than the projected growth of the overall economy, according to a report published this month from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said Biden and Trump’s attention on insulin was likely an appeal to the large core of voters with diabetes who have been advocating for lower insulin costs for years. More than 8 million Americans rely on insulin to survive, according to the American Diabetes Association . Still, Caplan said, insulin and drug costs in general are just one component of the overall health care system. “It was a hugely missed opportunity,” Caplan said. “Drug costs are a problem, but so are hospital charges and nursing home costs. Driving down drug prices helps, but it’s far from going to solve our cost issues.” There will be another opportunity, Altman said, for Biden and Trump to address health care costs during the next presidential debate, which is scheduled for September. Beyond the debate stage, Altman said he expects Biden to keep hammering away at health care costs because it's an issue the president has an advantage over Trump. Another KFF poll published in May found that more independent voters trusted Biden over Trump when it came to many areas of health care, including health care costs. “Despite the fact that there was little or no focus on it, it will be a continuing focus for Biden and the Democrats,” Altman said. “I expect Trump to stay silent on this issue.”

Forbes Digital Assets Healthcare Breaches Are More Costly Than Financial Breaches: Here's Why By Chrissa McFarlane , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am passionate about all things digital health. Follow Author Jun 28, 2024, 01:21pm EDT Share Save Comment In Healthcare and Finance money is solicited by cyber hackers as result of data theft. StockImages The Hidden Costs of Data Breaches in the Healthcare Sector While the Kraken exchange exploit cost them more than $3 million dollars in stolen cryptocurrency, Change Healthcare was exploited for more than $22 million in cryptocurrency, even more than the average cost of a cyber security incident which can cost a healthcare organization more than $10 million dollars. The average cost of a data breach across industries was $4.45 million, yet the average cost of a healthcare data breach was the highest among all industries at $10.93 million in 2023. In today's digital age, data breaches have become a common threat across various industries. While the financial sector is often perceived as the primary target for cybercriminals due to the direct monetary gain involved, recent studies show that breaches in the healthcare sector are significantly more costly. The reasons for this disparity are rooted in the unique nature of healthcare data, the complexities of the industry, and the profound impact on affected individuals. 1. The Value of Healthcare Data Healthcare data is incredibly valuable on the black market. Unlike financial data, which can be rendered useless relatively quickly through account freezes and fraud alerts, healthcare information has a longer shelf life. Medical records contain a wealth of sensitive information, including personal identification details, medical history, insurance information, and even payment details. This data can be exploited for various malicious activities, such as identity theft, insurance fraud, and the creation of fake medical records. 2. Regulatory Fines and Penalties The healthcare industry is heavily regulated to protect patient privacy and data security. Regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States impose strict requirements on how healthcare providers handle patient information. Breaches of healthcare data often result in substantial fines and penalties from regulatory bodies. These fines can be much higher than those in the financial sector, reflecting the critical importance of safeguarding patient data. 3. Long-Term Consequences The repercussions of a healthcare data breach extend far beyond the immediate financial loss. Patients affected by data breaches can suffer long-term consequences, including medical identity theft, compromised health outcomes, and loss of trust in healthcare providers. Addressing these issues requires significant resources, including credit monitoring services, legal fees, and public relations efforts to rebuild trust with patients and the public. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor 4. Operational Disruption A cyberattack on a healthcare organization can severely disrupt its operations. Unlike financial institutions, which can often continue functioning while addressing a breach, healthcare providers may face significant operational challenges. Ransomware attacks, in particular, can force hospitals and clinics to shut down critical systems, delay treatments, and compromise patient care. The cost of these disruptions, both in terms of financial loss and human impact, can be staggering. 5. The Cost of Remediation Remediating a healthcare data breach is a complex and expensive process. Healthcare organizations must conduct thorough investigations to understand the extent of the breach, implement enhanced security measures, and comply with regulatory requirements for breach notification and reporting. Additionally, they often need to provide affected patients with identity theft protection services, further adding to the overall cost. 6. Loss of Trust and Reputation The loss of trust and damage to reputation can be devastating for healthcare providers. Patients trust healthcare organizations with their most sensitive information, and a breach can shatter that trust. Rebuilding a damaged reputation requires time, effort, and significant financial investment in marketing and public relations campaigns. For smaller healthcare providers, the impact of a breach on reputation and patient trust can be particularly challenging to overcome. Conclusion While financial data breaches are undoubtedly costly and damaging, the unique characteristics of healthcare data and the stringent regulatory environment make healthcare breaches even more costly. The long-term consequences, operational disruptions, and the profound impact on patient trust underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare sector. As cyber threats continue to evolve, healthcare organizations must prioritize data security and invest in advanced cybersecurity technologies and practices. By doing so, they can protect their patients' sensitive information, maintain regulatory compliance, and mitigate the financial and reputational risks associated with data breaches.

Quarter of all American healthcare records have been breached Joshua Silverwood June 27, 2024 2 min read GLDAF Approximately a quarter of Americans have had their medical records leaked, with research finding that more than 79.6 million people have been caught up in data breaches. Around 71% of the breaches originate due to the hacking of a healthcare provider. Research carried out by the US-based cybersecurity company Incogni, alongside data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, detailed how since 2020, healthcare providers were reported to have experienced 1,572 breaches, accounting for 57.6% of all American healthcare profiles that have been exposed. At the same time, the report by Incogni found the same pattern with reported ransomware attacks finding that since 2020 approximately 76.1% of attacks targeted healthcare providers. The most common cause for a breach is described by the research as hacking and IT incidents, accounting for 1,622 breaches and affecting 136.8 million healthcare profiles. The biggest breach named in the report was the 2021 breach of the optometry company 20/20 Eye Care Network, which saw the healthcare data of approximately 3.3 million Americans breached after hostile actors were able to access the company’s cloud storage systems. Darius Belejevas, head of data protection service Incogni, said: “The transition to electronic health systems has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to the healthcare sector, but it has also introduced significant risks. The exposure of sensitive health information can have devastating consequences for individuals, as their data might be further used by data brokers or even criminals. Incogni advocates for more stringent privacy and security measures for entities that manage patient information. “As breaches continue to compromise patient privacy, they also put patients’ safety at risk and erode their trust in the healthcare system. Moreover, they can lead to identity theft, medical fraud, and other forms of exploitation.” The healthcare-centric cybersecurity market is expected to steadily grow alongside the rise in attacks on healthcare facilities. Research by GlobalData found that the global cybersecurity market will be worth $334bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% between 2022 and 2030. Additionally, separate research by UK cybersecurity company Sophos , found that only 24% of healthcare organisations were able to disrupt a ransomware attack before the attackers encrypted their data – down from 34% in 2022. The reasons for cyberattacks on healthcare facilities vary across several causes, but in the past few years cyberattacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities have been used as a tool for disruption from hostile states such as Russia .

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways When President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump face off Thursday during the first general election debate, health policy experts say tackling the exorbitant cost of health care is as much a top issue for voters as the U.S. economy. Health care costs in the United States continue to rise — and Americans increasingly say they are unable to afford the care they need. There is no issue in health care even remotely close to voter frustration over the high prices patients have to pay for medical care, said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “People tend to think about health care as separate from the economy,” he said. “But when you talk to voters, it’s not separate at all in their heads. Health care is a dimension of their pocketbook economic concerns.” National health care spending is projected to have increased 7.5% in 2023 to almost $4.8 trillion, faster than the projected growth of the overall economy, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . The estimated health care spending per person — the average amount spent on health care services for each individual — reached $14,423 in 2023, up from $13,493 in 2022 and $13,012 in 2021. The rising cost is hitting Americans’ wallets. About half of U.S. adults say it is difficult to afford their health care costs, according to a recent poll from KFF . About 1 in 4 say they — or a family member — had problems paying for health care in the past year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement That often means people will have to skip or delay the care that they need, said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician at the Cambridge Health Alliance, who was not involved in the polling. A family member may try to provide financial aid, he added, but attempts to help another can sometimes aggravate problems for the entire family — most notably with medical debt. "For American households, health care costs are one of the most important economic issues," he said. “What we spend on health care is going to be one of the biggest line items for a lot of families, particularly families with children or with elderly people with chronic diseases.” No sweeping reform Although Trump has revived threats to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, major health care reform is unlikely to be a central issue during the debate, Altman said. Biden is likely to tout the Inflation Reduction Act, which he signed into law in 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Among the provisions is allowing Medicare, for the first time, to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Earlier this year, the government began negotiating prices on the 10 costliest prescription drugs covered by Medicare, which included heart medications and diabetes drugs. The government is expected to publish the new negotiated prices by Sept. 1. Earlier this month, the administration also announced a plan to eliminate debt from medical reports . Aside from Obamacare and abortion, Trump has provided little detail on what health care policy would look like in a potential second term. He made addressing the high cost of prescription drugs a tentpole of his previous term, including a push to allow states to import drugs from Canada and a rule that would tie prices for certain drugs to prices paid by countries overseas. The greatest challenge for both Biden and Trump will be pitching health care cost policies that both sides of Congress can get behind, said Robin Feldman, a professor of law and director of the Center for Innovation at UC Law San Francisco. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Notions of unity and compromise seem to be a distant memory in Congress, as they are in the nation,” she said. ”The idea of a big major sweeping reform has felt unlikely in recent years,” Gaffney said. Breakthrough reforms remain challenging — but important. “This distinction between health care as an issue and the economy as an issue at this point drives me crazy, because for real people, there is no distinction,” Altman said. “It’s one of their biggest economic concerns.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com About Our Ads

Supply chain management is projected to account for a notable share of the global Blockchain Technology in Healthcare Market. Blockchain technology helps optimize the healthcare supply chain by reducing costs, minimizing data losses and tampering, and optimizing resource utilization. Blockchain solutions in the healthcare space also promote the interoperability of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other connected technologies. Healthcare Providers to Take the Lead in Terms of Blockchain in Healthcare Adoption Healthcare providers are projected to be the most opportune end user sub-segment for blockchain in healthcare companies over the coming years. The use of blockchain technology enables transparency between providers and patients whilst ensuring the security of the transaction as well. Adoption of electronic health records and other digital health solutions will also create new opportunities for blockchain in healthcare providers in this sub-segment. Meanwhile, the payer end user segment is also expected to offer highly lucrative opportunities for blockchain in healthcare companies in the long term as crypto payments and wallets gain popularity among users around the world. Blockchain in healthcare companies should target healthcare providers and payers to generate maximum revenue over the coming years. Investing in supply chain management applications is the right move for established blockchain in healthcare companies but new companies should target clinical trial applications to penetrate the market successfully in the future.

Title: Rising health care prices are driving unemployment and job losses

Rising health care prices in the U.S. are leading employers outside the health care sector to reduce their payroll and decrease their number of employees, according to a new study co-authored by Yale economist Zack Cooper. The study, published June 24 as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ), found that when health care prices increased, non-health care employers responded by reducing their payroll and cutting the jobs of middle-class workers. For the average county, a 1% increase in health care prices would reduce aggregate income in the area by approximately $8 million annually. The study was conducted by a team of leading economists from Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Harvard University, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. “When health care prices go up, jobs outside the health care sector go down,” said Cooper, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health and of economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “It’s broadly understood that employer-sponsored health insurance creates a link between health care markets and labor markets. Our research shows that middle- and lower-income workers are shouldering rising health care prices, and in many cases, it’s costing them their jobs. Bottom line: Rising health care costs are increasing economic inequality.” To better understand how rising health care prices affect labor market outcomes, the researchers brought together insurance claims data on approximately a third of adults with employer-sponsored insurance, health insurance premium data from the U.S. Department of Labor, and IRS data from every income tax return filed in the United States between 2008 and 2017. They then used these data to trace out how an increase in health care prices — such as a $2,000 increase on a $20,000 hospital bill — flows through to health spending, insurance premiums, employer payrolls, income and unemployment in counties, and the tax revenue collected by the federal government. “Many think that it’s insurers or employers who bear the burden of rising health care prices. We show that it’s really the workers themselves who are impacted,” said Zarek Brot-Goldberg, an assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. “It’s vital to understand that rising health care prices aren’t just impacting patients. Rising prices are hurting the employment outcomes for workers who never went to the hospital.” For the new study, the authors used hospital mergers as a vehicle to assess the effect of price increases. From 2000 to 2020, there were over 1,000 hospital mergers among the approximately 5,000 U.S. hospitals. In past work , the authors found that approximately 20% of hospital mergers should have been expected to raise prices by lessening competition, according to merger guidelines from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. These mergers, on average, raised prices by 5%. “We can use our analysis to estimate the effect of hospital mergers,” said Stuart Craig, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School. “Our results show that a hospital merger that raised prices by 5% would result in $32 million in lost wages, 203 lost jobs, a $6.8 million reduction in federal tax revenue, and a death from suicide or overdose of a worker outside the health sector.” The study also showed that because rising health care prices leads firms to let go of workers, a knock-on effect of hospital mergers is that they lead to increases in government spending on unemployment insurance and reductions in the tax revenue collected by the federal government. “It’s vital to point out that hospital mergers raise spending by the federal government and lower tax revenue at the same time,” said Cooper. “When prices in the U.S health sector rise, it’s actually a net negative for the economy. It’s leading to fewer jobs and precipitating all the consequences we associate with workers becoming unemployed.” Other authors of the study were Lev Klarnet from Harvard University, Ithai Lurie from U.S. Department of Treasury, and Corbin Miller from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Article Insights Goodwin Procter LLP are most popular: within Transport topic(s) On April 26, 2024, almost a year after issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Privacy Rule, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) finalized the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy (Final Rule). In practice, the Final Rule shields patients' protected health information (PHI) related to a patient seeking and/or receiving lawful reproductive health care and to a health care provider facilitating and/or rendering such health care services from civil, criminal, and administrative scrutiny. We review key facets of the rule below. Background The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (the Privacy Rule) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally prohibits covered entities such as health care providers and health plans (Covered Entities) from disclosing PHI without patient authorization except for treatment, payment, and health care operations. However, pursuant to certain exceptions under the Privacy Rule, Covered Entities have historically been allowed to disclose PHI without patient authorization in connection with certain public health activities; health oversight activities (e.g., in response to a request from a health oversight agency for audits; civil, administrative, or criminal investigations; proceedings; or actions); or judicial and administrative proceedings when disclosure is ordered by the court or pursuant to a non-court-ordered subpoena when the disclosing party receives satisfactory assurance that the receiving party will appropriately safeguard the PHI(i.e., reasonable efforts were made to ensure the individual subject of the PHI was given notice of the request or to secure a qualified protective order). The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ( Dobbs ) and the subsequent passing of laws restricting abortion in some states have created concern about law enforcement authorities and others accessing PHI using the exceptions that allow the disclosure of PHI for health oversight and judicial and/or administrative proceedings and using it to prosecute patients and health care providers. The OCR proposed changes to the Privacy Rule to address these concerns last year. The Final Rule Uses and Disclosures: Prohibited Purposes The Final Rule expands and strengthens patient privacy protections by prohibiting Covered Entities and their business associates (together with Covered Entities, Regulated Entities) from using or disclosing patients' PHI related to the provision of "lawful reproductive health care," including abortion care, for the following "prohibited purposes": (1) conducting a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation or imposing criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating lawful reproductive health care, or to identify any person to initiate such activities; or (2) identifying any person to conduct criminal, civil, or administrative investigations for such activities. 1 Lawful Reproductive Care "Lawful reproductive health care" is defined as health care that "affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system, including its functions and processes," and that is: (1) lawful under the laws of the state where such healthcare is provided under the circumstances in which it is provided (e.g., an abortion performed at 12 weeks' gestation in a state that permits abortions through 24 weeks' gestation): or (2) protected, required, or authorized by federal law, including the US Constitution, 2 regardless of the state where such health care is provided (e.g., miscarriage management care provided as necessary, stabilizing care under the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act [EMTALA] to a patient in an emergency department in a state with a fetal-heartbeat-based abortion ban). 3 Presumption of Lawful Reproductive Health Care Under the Final Rule, there is a presumption that reproductive health care provided by a person other than the Regulated Entity receiving the request for disclosure of PHI is lawful, and that related PHI is, therefore, protected from disclosure, unless one of two conditions is met: (1) the Regulated Entity has actual knowledge that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided, or (2) the Regulated Entity receives information from the person making the request for the use or disclosure of PHI that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. 4 For example, the Regulated Entity knows, or receives credible information from the requesting entity, that an abortion was illegally performed in a state where such care is banned or was performed by a unlicensed individual. Attestation When PHI related to lawful reproductive health care is requested for health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, or disclosures to coroners and medical examiners, the Regulated Entity must obtain an attestation from the requesting party that the use or disclosure of such PHI is not for a prohibited purpose. 5 Public Health The Final Rule also modifies the definition of "public health" to clarify that public health activities do not include activities: "(1) To conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating health care; (2) To impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating health care." 6 Notice of Privacy Practices Covered Entities are required to revise their Notice of Privacy Practices to reflect the Final Rule's updated privacy and other protections for reproductive health care. 7 Supporting Access to Care and Protecting Patient Privacy In making these updates to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, HHS-OCR continued to emphasize its goal of encouraging individuals' trust and confidence in accessing high-quality reproductive health care by "carefully balancing individuals' privacy interests with others' interests in using or disclosing PHI." 8 HHS-OCR referenced concerns that patients may be reluctant to seek such care if they fear that their PHI could be requested from Regulated Entities to investigate and potentially impose liability upon them for having sought, obtained, or facilitated lawful reproductive health care. 9 Alternatively, patients who doubt the confidentiality of their discussions with healthcare providers may choose not to disclose their complete or accurate medical or reproductive-health care history for fear of repercussions. This could, in turn, hinder health care providers from offering safe and effective information or treatment recommendations to their patients. Health care providers may also be reluctant to provide legal reproductive health care for fear of facing investigation or liability in the fluctuating legal environment that currently surrounds such care. HHS-OCR implemented the Final Rule to mitigate these concerns by protecting particularly sensitive PHI. Key Insights Regulated Entities must comply with the Final Rule by December 23, 2024, but Covered Entities have until February 16, 2026, to make necessary corresponding updates to their Notice of Privacy Practices. 10 As rulemaking develops in this area and as the Final Rule goes into effect, Regulated Entities offering reproductive health care services should update their policies and procedures related to the use and disclosure of PHI as appropriate. Regulated Entities that receive requests for disclosures of PHI related to lawful reproductive health care should ensure they are not disclosing PHI for any prohibited purpose and should obtain attestations when appropriate. In addition, Covered Entities should ensure that their Notice of Privacy Practices accurately reflects their practices with respect to compliance with the Final Rule's additional privacy protections for reproductive health care. It is important to note that health care providers providing reproductive-health care services who are not engaging in "standard transactions" under HIPAA (i.e., pre-authorization services and/or submission of electronic claims to health plans) and other entities not regulated by HIPAA (e.g., fertility- and pregnancy-tracking apps) are not considered Regulated Entities under HIPAA, and their patients' or users' personal information is, therefore, not considered PHI and would not be protected from use or disclosure under the Final Rule. As rulemaking develops in this area, Regulated Entities offering reproductive health care should consult with lega... [truncated]

As healthcare expenditures surge, organizations face mounting pressure to optimize financial efficiencies. Outsourcing non-core functions such as medical billing and claims processing to specialized BPO providers offers substantial cost savings by streamlining operations, reducing labor costs, and optimizing resource allocation. This strategic approach not only enhances productivity but also empowers healthcare entities to prioritize core competencies like patient care and innovation. Leveraging offshore capabilities further enhances cost-effectiveness while ensuring compliance and service excellence amid financial constraints. Navigating Financial Challenges: Mitigating Hidden Costs in Healthcare BPO Strategies Hidden outsourcing costs present a significant challenge in the healthcare BPO market. Despite anticipated cost savings, companies often underestimate the financial complexities associated with outsourcing. From vendor selection challenges to managing transition costs and enhancing data security, unforeseen expenses can erode anticipated benefits. Addressing these financial intricacies through meticulous planning and strategic partnership management is crucial for healthcare organizations aiming to maximize the value of BPO arrangements while minimizing financial risks. Data-Driven Growth: Leveraging Advanced Analytics for Strategic Healthcare BPO Success Advanced data analytics emerges as a transformative opportunity driving growth in the healthcare BPO market. By leveraging sophisticated analytics tools, service providers can optimize operational workflows, enhance customer retention, and improve financial performance. These capabilities enable healthcare organizations to identify cost-saving opportunities, ensure regulatory compliance, and deliver personalized service offerings tailored to specific industry needs. Embracing data-driven strategies not only enhances operational efficiency but also positions BPO providers as indispensable partners in the evolving landscape of healthcare service delivery. Protecting Patient Trust: Safeguarding Data Integrity in Healthcare BPO Operations Data security remains a critical challenge confronting the healthcare BPO market, threatening patient confidentiality and regulatory compliance. With the proliferation of digital records and outsourced processes, the risk of data breaches escalates without robust cybersecurity measures and comprehensive training programs. Compliance with stringent regulations such as HIPAA requires proactive measures to uphold data integrity and mitigate potential risks to patient trust and organizational reputation. Addressing these challenges through collaborative efforts and technological innovations is essential to maintaining the highest standards of data security and confidentiality in healthcare BPO operations. Innovative Care Delivery: Transforming Efficiency in Healthcare BPO Services The healthcare BPO market ecosystem revolutionizes service delivery through strategic outsourcing of administrative and medical functions to specialized providers. From streamlining medical billing and claims processing to enhancing telehealth support with AI and automation, these innovations drive operational efficiency and accuracy. By reducing operational costs and elevating service quality, the ecosystem empowers healthcare executives to prioritize patient-centric care while navigating the complexities of modern healthcare delivery. Request Sample Pages: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=472 Streamlining Healthcare Documentation: Dominance of Medical Transcription in BPO Services The medical transcription segment has secured the largest share within the Healthcare BPO industry, particularly in patient care. Known for its efficiency in transcribing medical records, this segment offers healthcare organizations swift and precise transcription processes. Outsourcing medical transcription not only meets stringent quality standards but also alleviates workload and reduces costs. Specialized BPO providers ensure accuracy through rigorous checks, allowing healthcare providers to focus on core activities while maintaining compliance with industry regulations. Optimizing Claims Processing: Claims Adjudication Leads Healthcare BPO Market Services Claims adjudication services dominate the Healthcare BPO industry under claims management, playing a crucial role in processing and resolving healthcare claims. Healthcare payers rely on efficient adjudication to determine coverage and facilitate timely reimbursements. Outsourcing these services enhances accuracy and operational efficiency, mitigating risks and ensuring compliance. By leveraging specialized BPO expertise, payers can streamline processes and uphold customer satisfaction while focusing on core business functions. Driving Pharmaceutical Success: Sales and Marketing Services Spearhead Healthcare BPO Growth Sales and marketing services claim the largest share in the Healthcare BPO market's non-clinical segment, driven by pharmaceutical companies outsourcing these functions to enhance market presence and focus on core competencies like R&D. BPO providers bring industry-specific knowledge and advanced technologies to optimize marketing efforts, reduce costs, and adapt to market dynamics efficiently. Outsourcing enables pharmaceutical firms to remain agile and competitive, accelerating growth and innovation in the healthcare BPO sector. Leading the Charge: North America Dominates Healthcare BPO Market as Source Geography North America holds the largest share in the Healthcare BPO market as a source geography, attributed to widespread EHR adoption mandated by HIPAA 5010 regulations. These regulations promote standardized electronic transactions in healthcare, driving demand for BPO services to manage and optimize electronic health records. The region's complex healthcare operations and stringent regulatory environment necessitate external support, positioning North America as a primary hub for healthcare BPO services.

Title: What U . S . Providers Can Learn From The Indian Healthcare System

Small Business What U.S. Providers Can Learn From The Indian Healthcare System By Hitesh Dev , Former Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 17, 2024, 07:00am EDT Share Save Author Hitesh Dev is the COO at Devout Corporation and a health tech consultant, supporting Federal and Commercial organizations since 2002. getty I grew up in India and came to the U.S. for my graduate studies. My mom is a pediatrician and still manages her practice at the age of 75. While growing up, I sometimes helped my mom with clinic management, paperwork and pharmacy settlements. I recently visited India and got my Executive Check done at a fraction of the price. This experience motivated me to write this article. The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other high-income country , yet it does not achieve commensurate outcomes in terms of life expectancy and overall health. Meanwhile, India, with its diverse and vast population, has managed to create cost-effective healthcare solutions . By examining the key elements of India's healthcare system, I believe U.S. healthcare providers can identify actionable strategies to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. 1. Cost-Efficient Healthcare Delivery Public-Private Partnerships India's healthcare system is working on leveraging public-private partnerships (PPPs) to extend healthcare services to a larger segment of the population. These partnerships enable the sharing of resources, expertise, and infrastructure between the government and private entities. Healthcare providers could enhance its healthcare reach by fostering similar PPPs, and encouraging collaboration with government bodies to reduce costs and improve access to care. Low-Cost Healthcare Models India has pioneered low-cost healthcare models that focus on delivering high-quality care at minimal expenses. Institutions like the Aravind Eye Care System and Narayana Health have demonstrated that it is possible to provide world-class medical services affordably. Providers can adopt low-cost healthcare models, particularly for common procedures and routine care to significantly reduce expenses. Encouraging innovation in cost management, and care delivery can lead to more affordable healthcare solutions. Federal and State Governments would need to step in and provide incentives to providers/health institutions to have their resources dedicated to low-income groups. Also, this should become a license requirement for doctors and medical institutions. 2. Technological Innovations Telemedicine and Remote Consultations India has made significant strides in telemedicine, allowing patients in remote areas to access specialist care, reducing the overall cost of healthcare by minimizing the need for physical infrastructure and travel expenses. Healthcare providers can expand telemedicine services by implementing robust telemedicine infrastructure to improve accessibility and efficiency. Healthcare providers would need to work with insurance companies to provide incentives for patients to leverage telemedicine services. Also, rural patients would see the value in telemedicine if providers were able to use remote diagnosis tools and portable devices. Use of Mobile Health Technologies Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are becoming widely used in India to monitor and manage health conditions, provide health education and ensure adherence to treatment plans. These technologies are cost-effective and scalable. Integrating mHealth technologies into the U.S. healthcare system can enhance patient engagement, improve health outcomes, and reduce costs by enabling continuous monitoring and early intervention. In order for mHealth to succeed, providers would need to become more tech-savvy as well as proactive in responding to patient queries, and appointment requests and work in collaboration with pharmacies and insurance companies. 3. Community-Based Health Programs Preventive Health Initiatives India is engaging in community-based health programs focused on the prevention and early detection of diseases. These initiatives involve community health workers who educate and screen populations for various health conditions. Providers should consider investing in preventive health programs to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and lower long-term healthcare costs. Emphasizing prevention and early detection can lead to significant savings. Integrating Traditional Medicine India is known for providing traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Yoga as an option into its healthcare framework, offering alternative and complementary treatments that can often be cost-effective. Exploring the integration of offering alternative and complementary medicine into the U.S. healthcare system can provide cost-effective treatment options and enhance patient choice. Providers can encourage research and evidence-based practice in these areas to support their inclusion. 4. Administrative and Operational Efficiency Streamlining Administrative Processes Healthcare providers are employing streamlined administrative processes to minimize overhead costs. This includes reducing paperwork, optimizing staffing, and implementing efficient billing systems. U.S. providers can significantly reduce administrative costs by adopting streamlined processes, utilizing electronic health records (EHRs) more effectively and minimizing bureaucratic inefficiencies. This can be done by reducing the paperwork associated with insurance claims, HIPAA compliance requirements, and the number of lab and imaging requirements as mandated by insurance companies. Task Shifting and Multiskilling India is engaging in task shifting —where tasks are delegated to less specialized health workers—helps address workforce shortages and reduce costs. The multiskilling of healthcare workers ensures that they can perform various roles. Implementing task shifting and multiskilling in the U.S. healthcare workforce can optimize resource utilization and reduce labor costs. Create training programs that focus on enhancing efficiency and service delivery. Conclusion The U.S. healthcare system faces significant challenges related to high costs and inefficiencies. By learning from the Indian healthcare system, providers can adopt several strategies to enhance cost savings and improve patient outcomes. Implementing these lessons requires a commitment to innovation, policy reform, and a focus on value-based care. By doing so, I believe the U.S. can make substantial strides towards a more sustainable and equitable healthcare system.

30 Cities for Renters Where Your Income Goes the Furthest Milan Markovic / Getty Images Jami Farkas June 15, 2024 6 min read You may have seen the headline browsing through your phone. For You: Housing Market 2024: 50 Most Affordable Cities for Homebuyers Try This: Become a Real Estate Investor for Just $1K Using This Bezos-Backed Startup “Rent in this city now averages $2,700 per month” – or whatever the figure is. And you think to yourself, how can anyone afford to live there? It’s a good question, and the people at RentCafe have the answer. A 2024 study by the group, which analyzes the rental market, showed that high rent often comes with a high annual income in that same locale. RentCafe found 30 cities where renters can maximize their income – where the rent and monthly expenses don’t overwhelm their budget – even if the rental price is above the national median of $2,138 as of June 2024. In its analysis, RentCafe used the median income, average rent and average prices for the basics in 189 cities across the United States in its calculation. The cost of things such as utilities, food and healthcare are limited to specific bills. These certain grocery items frequently appear in a shopping cart and specific medical procedures, and they don’t reflect average monthly spending. RentCafe found that some places where rent is most easily affordable are traditionally expensive places to live, including the suburbs around Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., where incomes are commensurate.

Report Health Care Reform BG1168es: Building Bureaucracy and Invading Patient Privacy:Maryland's Health Care Regulations April 16, 1998 3 min read Download Report Dale Snyder Visiting Fellow ... Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Maryland is a microcosm of the serious problems besetting the health care system in the United States. Health care in Maryland is a $15 billion industry in which doctors and patients are losing control and the number of uninsured persons is rising. The state's health care policy-an incoherent bundle of regulations and contradictions-is driving up the cost of health care while artificially trying to hammer down prices. In 1996 alone, the cost of a hospital stay increased almost twice as fast as the national average. Yet, by mid-February 1998, legislators had introduced 85 new health care and companion bills and 18 mental health bills in the state's General Assembly. Politics, not patient choice, has been the driving force behind the growth of Maryland's health care system. The health care behemoth grew rapidly after the enactment of the Health Care and Insurance Reform Act, an 81-page, last-minute bill pushed through in 1993 at the height of the national debate on the failed Clinton Health Security Act. One legislator aptly described it as the "Clinton Plan in miniature." As a result, Maryland's system now features: No fewer than five regulatory bureaucracies to control health care delivery at a cost of over $30 million a year. A government-run health care database that violates a patient's right to privacy . In Big Brother fashion, sensitive information on every visit to doctors and hospitals is entered without a patient's consent. Ironically, Marylanders can protect the confidentiality of their driving records, but not that of their medical records, in the state's computerized data banks. More mandates on the health insurance market than are imposed by any other state . As a result, many Marylanders are unable to purchase a benefits package tailored to their own specific needs but are forced to pay for access to treatments and procedures that legislators target for politically favored body parts. According to a recent U.S. General Accounting Office report, Maryland's mandates add 22 percent to the cost of a typical health benefits package. This puts Maryland-based insurance plans at a competitive disadvantage when trying to attract the business of federal workers and retirees in the popular, consumer-driven Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Policies that frustrate the federal medical savings account (MSA) program enacted by Congress in 1996. An agency that sets all rates hospitals may charge for medical services , regardless of supply and demand. Prices bear little or no relation to market forces. Under this rate-setting system, a hospital in Prince George's County charged $13,434 for an angioplasty in 1994 while one in Baltimore charged only $4,492. HEALTH CARE SPENDING Maryland ranks 1st among the states in Medicaid payment per child and adult beneficiary, 7th in spending on physicians' services, and 11th in spending on miscellaneous medical services. Yet its health care initiatives have done little to expand the availability of health insurance. The number of uninsured persons has climbed from approximately 570,000 in 1992 to over 700,000 today. The cost of uncompensated care reached $408.1 million in 1996 and is climbing still. And contrary to the claims of supporters of the health care regulatory system, recent figures indicate the system is not controlling hospital costs effectively. In 1996, the cost of a hospital stay increased by 4.5 percent, compared with a national average of 2.3 percent. During the second half of 1997, under the state's complicated price-fixing system, Maryland's hospitals saw their profits cut in half; 15 of the state's 52 hospitals lost money. A BETTER SYSTEM Excellent medical care, increased access, and a return in value for investment can be achieved only by sound policies that rely less on bureaucratic regulation and more on consumer choice and price competition. Legislators across the United States can learn what not to do by examining Maryland's efforts to micromanage health care through a burgeoning bureaucracy. Instead of adding more mandates and rules to an already top-heavy regulatory structure, state legislators should focus on policies that improve health care opportunities for workers and their families. Specifically, they should: 1. Promote personal ownership and portability of health insurance by giving tax credits to middle-income workers and vouchers to low-income workers. 2. Protect the confidentiality of patient records to ensure that no personal information is transmitted to any public or private entity without a patient's consent. 3. Reduce costs and replace benefit mandates with solid catastrophic coverage. 4. Eliminate outdated regulations and dismantle unnecessary bureaucratic programs. If health care access and affordability are genuine goals, a far better approach would be to empower individuals and families to make health care choices that suit their own needs, restore the independence and integrity of the medical profession, and force insurance companies to compete for consumers' dollars. The health care delivery system at all levels should be accountable directly to the individuals and families being served. -Dale Snyder is a Severna Park, Maryland, consultant specializing in issues related to health care and labor and employment.

Title: Where There Is No Doctor : Providing Health Care Education to All

For more than 50 years, Hesperian Health Guides has provided health care education to remote communities, aiming to address and reduce the global health disparity. The Scarcity of Health Care With advances in technology and medicine contributing to the increase of global life expectancy, there remains a persistent disparity in access to quality health care between higher and lower-income countries. According to a 2020 study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is only one doctor for every 3,324 people in Africa. In contrast, in Europe, there is one doctor for every 293 people. The varied distribution of people versus health care workers highlights the scarcity of adequate health care in some regions of the world. To achieve universal health coverage, organizations like Hesperian Health Guides are providing health care education to rural areas where there is little to no access to doctors. Where There Is No Doctor Following his experience of working at Project Piaxtla, a primary health care program operated by disabled village health workers in western Mexico, David Werner wrote and published “ Where There Is No Doctor (Donde No Hay Doctor)” alongside his colleague Jane Maxwell. It is the first health care manual to consider the people of low-income and rural settings. Originally published in Spanish, “Where There Is No Doctor” explained complex health topics in a comprehensible language. Since the 1973 publication of “Where There Is No Doctor,” Hesperian Health Guides has issued more than 40 titles to 221 countries. Its books, which have been translated into more than 85 languages, explain topics such as general health, women’s health, children’s health, environmental health, disabilities, health rights and advocacy and more. With each book taking about four to 10 years to complete, the nonprofit continuously updates and revises its handbooks. Making a Global Impact Pivotal stakeholders in global public health commend the accuracy, accessibility and clarity of Hesperian Health Guides. For example, since the ’80s, every Peace Corps volunteer has been supplied with copies of Hesperian handbooks. Through donations, the Hesperian distributes its books to various community health workers, including missionaries, midwives, teachers, community organizers, nonprofit organizations, health educators and government agencies. Each stakeholder utilizes the Hesperian Health Guides to address the health concerns of their community while actively reducing the global health disparity. According to its 2023 annual report, Hesperian Health Guides has helped about 2,700,000 people . For those with access to the internet, the organization’s free HealthWiki has been providing health care education to more than 36 million people since the website’s launch in 2011. Conclusion With the recent decrease in access to essential health services, global health inequalities persist. Vulnerable populations with low levels of access to health care suffer the most as they are exposed to more health risks. Efforts to increase equitable access to health care are crucial to reducing the global health disparity. By providing health care education to rural communities, Hesperian Health Guides addresses global public health inequities in an effort to better the personal, community and environmental health of all. – Naima Rasheed Naima is based in New York, NY, USA and focuses on Good News, Global Health for The Borgen Project.

Small Business Leveraging AI In Healthcare Operations By Brian Fugere , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 13, 2024, 07:45am EDT Share Save By Brian Fugere, Chief Product Officer at symplr . getty The role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in healthcare has garnered considerable attention in recent years. From clinical documentation to remote patient monitoring, AI/ML technology is finding a foothold in nearly every part of healthcare’s digital transformation. Originally focused in clinical areas, healthcare’s digital transformation has expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic to include addressing growing operational and workforce challenges. That expansion shows no signs of slowing down, and the global healthcare AI market is expected to be valued at $427.5 billion by 2032 as innovations such as personalized medicine, predictive analytics, and the demand for more efficient, convenient patient care continue to evolve and shape market dynamics. I find there is exciting near-term potential for an AI/ML-fueled transformation in healthcare operations and, by extension, patient safety and experience. I believe those in healthcare can learn from how other industries have integrated AI/ML and, through strategic implementation, streamline and automate operations to address some of the most pressing pain points they face today. Pressing Healthcare Challenges Primed For AI/ML Solutions Today, healthcare organizations and frontline caregivers have become increasingly burdened with managing complex workflows and administrative tasks. From staff schedule creation and conflict resolution to administrative duties like charting, clinicians and nurses often find themselves bogged down by manual, repetitive tasks that consume valuable time and resources. A study conducted by the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) found 60% to 80% of nurse managers’ time is spent on recruitment, staffing and scheduling. I see caregivers spending too much time on non-value-added tasks contribute to crippling levels of clinician burnout and an ongoing clinician shortage. In fact, a survey of healthcare IT leaders by my company revealed that workforce challenges are the number one threat faced by healthcare organizations in 2024. While it’s important to continue to invest in solutions to address clinician burnout and bring more trained caregivers into the field, I believe the fastest way to start addressing workforce challenges is by making their day-to-day easier. McKinsey & Company recently published a report showing that 10% to 20% of nurses’ time during a 12-hour shift is spent on "activities that could be optimized through tech enablement." The report estimates that by simply reducing the burden of mundane tasks, investments in technology and workflow design could potentially reduce the nursing workforce shortage by as many as 300,000 inpatient nurses. Learning From Other Industries Improving Workflows With AI/ML One of the ways in which I'm seeing AI/ML pick up steam in healthcare is by drawing inspiration from other industries that have benefitted from AI/ML technology. For example, the manufacturing industry is using AI/ML capabilities to create more efficient workflows for production and assembly to cut costs. In addition, companies are using AI/ML to automate and streamline operational IT workflows to both improve their current business processes and create more sustainable IT systems. The healthcare industry can apply these learnings from other industries to similarly optimize workflows. For instance, AI/ML-powered technology can be used to augment supply chain sourcing and inventory management. It can also help health systems manage contracts by detecting auto-renewals for services that may no longer be needed and reducing redundancies, especially following a merger or acquisition when it’s common to end up with duplicate services. Another specific AI/ML technology from manufacturing that can be adapted for healthcare workflows is predictive maintenance. Similar to how manufacturing plants use AI algorithms to predict equipment failures before they occur, healthcare facilities can leverage predictive analytics to forecast equipment maintenance needs in advance. By implementing predictive maintenance solutions, healthcare organizations can reduce unplanned downtime, minimize disruptions to patient care and extend the lifespan of expensive medical equipment. However, healthcare leaders must consider several unique challenges when adopting solutions from other industries. Unlike manufacturing, healthcare environments are highly regulated with stringent data privacy and security requirements. Additionally, healthcare workflows often involve complex decision-making processes and interdependencies among various stakeholders, which may not always align with off-the-shelf solutions designed for other sectors. Strategically Harnessing AI/ML As we continue navigating the complexities of the modern healthcare environment, we can expect to see AI’s influence expand as more healthcare organizations look for opportunities to innovate and improve operations. Yet, as organizations embrace the potential of AI-driven solutions, they must remain vigilant in ensuring ethical use, data security and regulatory compliance. By harnessing the power of AI responsibly and strategically, we can unlock new possibilities for improved healthcare delivery and, ultimately, improve outcomes for patients worldwide. Whether it's automating appointment scheduling, optimizing staff scheduling or streamlining billing processes, the right AI/ML-powered tools can help drive efficiency and productivity to pave the way for a more efficient and patient-centered healthcare ecosystem.

Across the street from St. Elizabeth's in Brighton, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., introduced legislation Tuesday, June 11, 2024 aimed at warding off future cases of "corporate greed" in the health care landscape (State House News Service photo). State House News Service By John L. Micek | jmicek@masslive.com (*This story was updated at 3:57 p.m. on Tuesday, June 11, 2024 with additional reporting.) With Steward Health Care plunged into bankruptcy, one Massachusetts lawmaker says she has a plan to make sure it doesn’t happen again. With a Steward-owned facility in Brighton as her backdrop, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday pitched legislation, dubbed the " Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act ,” that would hit violators with jail time, and give state attorneys general and the U.S Justice Department more tools to fight the improper corporate exploitation of health care. “When private equity gets hold of health care systems, it is literally a matter of life and death, so if you drive a hospital like Steward into bankruptcy, putting patients and communities at risk, you should face real consequences,” Warren said in a statement. Dallas-based Steward, which owns eight facilities in Massachusetts, filed for bankruptcy in early May . The company has since said it plans to sell its hospitals, as it looks to pay off tens of millions of dollars in debt . Warren, joined by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, her fellow Bay State Democrat, has been sharply critical of Steward’s operations under its CEO, Dr. Ralph de la Torre . Read More: Steward CEO tells employees bankruptcy filing will not have ‘negative impact’ “What Dr. de la Torre, Cerberus Capital Management, and Medical Properties Trust did to Steward-owned hospitals in Massachusetts and across the country is unforgivable. They promised to improve health care, but instead traded lives and livelihoods for profit,” Markey said. “Private equity firms and their enablers will continue to steal from America’s health care system to feed their corporate greed unless we stop them. We need guardrails now to guarantee CEO wealth doesn’t come before the public’s health.” As it’s currently written, the legislation would: “Create a new criminal penalty of up to 6 years in prison for executives who “loot health care entities” such as nursing homes and hospitals , if that looting results in a patient’s death;” “Provide state attorneys general and the DOJ with the power to claw back—and return to the health care company—all compensation, including salaries, issued to private equity and portfolio company executives within 10 years before or after an acquired health care firm experiences serious, avoidable financial difficulties due to that looting;” ● “Authorize an associated civil penalty of up to 5 times the clawback amount,” ● “Prohibit payments from federal health programs to entities that sell assets or use assets for a loan collateral made to a real estate investment trust (REIT); repeal a rule in the Tax Code that allows taxable REIT subsidiaries to invest in the operation of health care entities; and remove the 20 percent pass-through deduction, passed in the 2017 Trump tax cuts, for all REIT investors,” ● “Require health care providers receiving federal funding to publicly report mergers, acquisitions, changes in ownership and control, and financial data, including debt and debt-to-earnings ratios,” and ● “Mandate a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report to Congress on moral injury in health care,” Warren’s office said in its statement. “The crisis at Steward health care illustrates the risks of allowing private equity and corporate America to play financial games with our public health care dollars. Hospitals become real-estate investments, clinicians become financial assets, and patients suffer the consequences when a risky investment scheme goes south,” Hayden Rooke-Ley, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington D.C-based think tank, said in the joint statement. In a statement, a spokesperson for an industry group accused Warren and Markey of “political opportunism” with their proposal. “America’s health care system faces incredible challenges – no matter how local facilities are funded. Private equity in Massachusetts helps develop cures, supports urgent care facilities, and improves access for patients,” Drew Maloney, the president and CEO of the American Investment Council, said, noting that Warren’s bill “is a purely political attack – not a real solution that will help patients, providers, and hospitals.” Did LaMar Cook have a political patron for gov.’s aide job?

June 11, 2024 Paging Healthcare Workers! California Legislature Passes Bill Raising Minimum Wages (UPDATED) Jonathan Brophy , Parnian Vafaeenia Seyfarth Shaw LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Update: On May 31, 2024, Governor Newsom passed S.B. 828, which delays implementation of S.B. 525, the health care minimum wage law signed by Governor Newsom on October 13, 2023. S.B. 828 delays all of the minimum wage adjustments in S.B. 525 by one month. This means that S.B. 525, which was set to take effect on June 1, 2024, will instead take effect on July 1, 2024. It further means that the minimum wage increases scheduled to take place after 2024 will take place on July 1, rather than June 1, of each year. Seyfarth Synopsis: On September 14, 2023, the California legislature passed S.B. 525 , which will raise minimum wages for health care workers across the state. The bill includes five separate minimum wage schedules for covered health care employees depending on the nature, size, and structure of the employer’s business. Unless Governor Newsom vetoes the bill (which is not expected), the bill will take effect on June 1, 2024. Grey’s Anatomy might be set in Seattle, but now it’s all eyes on California’s health care workers. Starting June 1, 2024, S.B. 525 will raise minimum wages for health care workers across the state to a minimum of $18 per hour, or up to $23 per hour, depending on the applicable wage schedule, and based on the nature, size, and structure of an employer’s operations. From Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital To The Denny Duquette Clinic – Most Health Care Employers Are Covered The bill’s provisions will apply to “Covered Health Care Employers,” as that term is defined under the soon-to-be newly added Labor Code sections 1182.14 and 1182.15, including: Hospitals: licensed general acute care hospitals, licensed acute psychiatric hospitals, and other special hospitals. Clinics: specialty care clinics, dialysis clinics, community clinics, psychology clinics, government run clinics, rural health clinics, and urgent care clinics. Psychiatric and Mental Health Facilities: mental health rehabilitation centers, county mental health facilities, and psychiatric health facilities. Licensed Skilled Nursing Facilities: including those that are owned, operated, or controlled by a hospital or integrated health care delivery system or health care system. Home Health Care: including licensed home health agencies and a patient’s home when health care services are delivered by an entity owned or operated by a general acute care hospital or acute psychiatric hospital. Licensed Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly Integrated Health Care Delivery System Work Sites Ambulatory Surgical Centers Certified for Medicare Participation Physician Groups County Correctional Facilities Providing Health Care Services The term “Covered Health Care Employers” expressly excludes: (1) hospitals owned, controlled, or operated by the State Department of State Hospitals; (2) tribal clinics exempt from licensure; and (3) outpatient settings conducted, maintained, or operated by a federally recognized Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization. The Scrub Nurse, The Chief, And More Are Included The term “covered health care employee” is also defined broadly under both the new Labor Code section 1182.14 and section 1182.15 to include employees who provide patient care, health care services, or services supporting the provision of health care. Examples span from nurses and physicians to clerical workers, gift shop workers, janitors, schedulers, and billing personnel. Contracted and subcontracted employees are also included if they: Perform contracted or subcontracted work primarily on the premises of a health care facility to provide health care services or services supporting the provision of health care; Are employed by an employer that contracts with the health care facility employer, or with a contractor or subcontractor to the health care facility employer, to provide health care services, or services supporting the provision of health care; or Perform work for a health care facility employer that directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, exercises control over the employee’s wages, hours or working conditions. Covered Health Care Employees will be able to enforce their rights under this new law through civil action, in the same manner they can currently enforce other minimum wage requirements. The Anatomy Of Employers’ Minimum Wage Obligations The bill includes five separate minimum wage schedules, but the minimum wage rates set forth under two of these schedules are identical. Thus, Covered Health Care Employers will fall within one of the four following groups: 1. Group 1: Covered health care facilities with 10,000 or more full-time equivalent employees, covered health care facility employers that are part of an integrated health care delivery system or health care system with 10,000 or more full-time equivalent employees, covered dialysis clinics, and covered health facilities that are owned, affiliated, or operated by a county with a population of more than 5,000,000 as of January 1, 2023. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025: $23 per hour. June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026: $24 per hour. June 1, 2026 to August 1, 2027: $25 per hour. 2. Group 2: Covered hospitals with high populations of Medicare/Medicaid patients, covered rural independent health care facilities, and covered health care facilities that are owned, affiliated or operated by a county with a population of less than 250,000 as of January 1, 2023. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2033: $18 per hour with 3.5 percent increases annually. June 1, 2033 to August 1, 2034: $25 per hour. 3. Group 3: Covered primary care community or free clinics that are open for limited services of no more than 40 hours a week and that are not conducted or maintained by a government entity, covered community clinics along with any associated intermittent clinics exempt from licensure, covered rural health clinics, and covered urgent care clinics that are owned by or affiliated with a community clinic. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026: $21 per hour. June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2027: $22 per hour. June 1, 2027 to August 1, 2028: $25 per hour. 4. Group 4: all other covered health care facilities June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026: $21 per hour. June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028: $23 per hour. June 1, 2028 to August 1, 2029: $25 per hour. Following these minimum wage increases, the Director of Finance will calculate an adjusted minimum wage on or before August 1 of the following year, and on or before each August 1 thereafter – seemingly in perpetuity. The calculation will increase the minimum wage by 3.5% or the rate of change in the averages for the U.S. Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers , whichever is lower. Even The New Residents Might Be Entitled To A Salary Increase Notably, the minimum wage requirements summarized above will impact a Covered Health Care Employer’s exempt California employees as well, to the extent those employees qualify as Covered Health Care Employees. These employees will have to earn a monthly salary equivalent to no less than: (1) 150% of the applicable health care worker minimum wage or (2) 200% of the State’s generally-applicable minimum wage—whichever is greater—for full-time employment in order to qualify as exempt under California’s laws. Any Other Changes Next Season? In one small piece of consolation to employers, the new legislation provides that no city, county, city and county, including charter cities, charter counties, or charter cities and counties can enact any ordinance, regulation, or administrative action relating to wages or compensation for Covered Health Care Employees before January 1, 2034. So, at least local ordinances won’t be weighing Covered Health Care Employers down and requiring complicated and varied compliance. Workplace Solutions Health care employers should reach out to the authors or your favorite Seyfarth attorney for solutions and recommendations on addressing compliance with the new Labor Code sections 1182.14 and 1182.15 before June 1, 2024.

Support WBUR St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, a Steward Health Care family hospital in Brighton, Mass. (Robin Lubbock/WBUR) U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced legislation Tuesday morning aimed at warding off future cases of "corporate greed" in the health care landscape, like the kind that her office says led to Steward Health Care filing for bankruptcy. Standing across the street from Steward's St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Warren outlined her "Corporate Crimes Against Health Care" bill that would establish new penalties and guardrails for health care executives who endanger patient safety and access to care — including a new criminal penalty that could send executives to prison for up to six years. That punishment would be for those who "loot health care entities like nursing homes and hospitals, if that looting results in a patient’s death," according to Warren's office. Legislators, patients and health care workers are wrestling with the results of financial management of Steward under the helm of CEO Ralph de la Torre . Steward sold the land its Massachusetts hospitals sat on in 2016, a transaction that has since saddled the system with massive debt as executives struggled to keep up with payments to the landlord, Medical Properties Trust, and to vendors. Warren's proposal would authorize state attorneys general to claw back all compensation to private equity executives within a 10-year period, spanning before or after an acquired health care provider "experiences serious, avoidable financial difficulties due to that looting," according to her office. The bill also lays out more reporting requirements for health care providers that receive federal funding. This is a developing story and will be updated.

GOLD/FOREX DUBAI 23°C PRAYER TIMES UAE UAE PEOPLE SCIENCE GOVERNMENT EDUCATION COURT AND CRIME EMERGENCIES ENVIRONMENT HEALTH TRANSPORT WEATHER ASK THE LAW UAE / Health 615 health inspections held in Dubai so far this year DHA conducted the checks mostly remotely via ‘Rased’ smart system for health facilities Last updated: June 11, 2024 | 10:02 Gulf News Report 2 MIN READ Dubai's Rased system, which covers over 5,000 healthcare facilities in Dubai and approximately 60,000 healthcare professionals, actively contributes to streamlining data management through visual smart solutions. Supplied Dubai: Dubai Health Authority conducted 615 inspections during the first quarter of this year. Of these inspections, 70 per cent were conducted remotely via the ‘Rased’ smart system for licensing and smart inspection of health facilities. The Rased system, linked to the Sheryan system, enables health inspectors to instantly assess the status, type, classification, licensing, tasks, and compliance of healthcare facilities in line with Dubai Health Authority’s approved licensing conditions. Faris Al Mazmi, Director of the Clinical Audit and Control Department at DHA’s Health Regulation Sector emphasised the Authority’s support for the private medical sector, positioning it as a strategic partner to uphold exceptional services, adhere to health requirements, and enhance competitiveness regionally and globally as a vital sector attracting medical tourism. Smart licensing Al Mazmi explained that the Rased system for smart licensing and inspection of healthcare facilities in Dubai is based on cutting-edge technologies and smart solutions employed by the Authority to accelerate stakeholder service, enhance operational efficiency and performance. It follows a methodology that upholds the best standards and quality practices in alignment with the Authority’s commitment to values of accountability, transparency, flexibility, innovation, and a focus on human-centric healthcare services. 5,000 healthcare facilities He pointed out that the Rased system, which covers over 5,000 healthcare facilities in Dubai and approximately 60,000 healthcare professionals, actively contributes to streamlining data management through visual smart solutions. These solutions enable the Authority’s staff to communicate with relevant individuals in healthcare facilities to provide the required service or conduct inspections. He emphasised the system’s importance in documenting and saving time and effort by expediting work processes, where transactions are completed within one day instead of five working days as previously seen in field inspections. Private medical sector Al Mazmi praised the cooperation of the private medical sector in the emirate, their adherence to Authority-approved licensing standards and conditions, and their alignment with global developments in the healthcare sector. This enhances the strength and resilience of Dubai’s healthcare system, solidifying the emirate’s position as an ideal destination for seekers of medical treatment, recovery and well-being.

66% of Healthcare SMBs Sent Real-Time Payments Last Year By PYMNTS | June 10, 2024 | More small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) operating in the healthcare sector issued payments via real-time methodologies last year than via traditional methods like credit cards and checks.

Δ The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Small Business Real-Time Payments Barometer: Healthcare Edition ” found that 38% of healthcare provider SMBs said real-time rails are their preferred payment methodology. Another 28% also issued real-time payments last year but noted the process was not their preferred way to send money. The report, which was based on surveys with 646 healthcare providers generating less than $10 million in annual revenue, found that SMBs in the healthcare-provider segment now use real-time payment rails more widely than other forms of payment. In the last year, 83% of the businesses surveyed either sent or received real-time payments, while 57% used real-time rails for payments moving in both directions. In the last 12 months, around two-thirds of healthcare provider SMBs used real-time methodologies ( which can include debit cards, instant PayPal and pay-by-bank), making real-time options collectively more popular than other leading payment methods. Credit cards were the second-most popular, used by 55% of healthcare provider SMBs to send money, followed by checks, which were used by 42% of the organizations surveyed. Meanwhile, legacy methods such as ACH transfers (34%) and wire transfers (8%) retain traction in the market. Four in 10 healthcare provider SMBs identified a real-time payment rail as their most used form of payment — more than twice the shares that said credit cards or checks — highlighting a preference for instant settlement in the healthcare space. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue A variety of real-time payment options have become healthcare-industry SMBs’ go-to. In the lead is pay-by-bank, which 15% of healthcare provider SMBs said is their most used payment method. PayPal comes in second at 13%. Just 6.3% of healthcare providers use debit cards the most; last year, debit cards were used 41% of the time . The shift suggests that debit cards may be losing their appeal to healthcare provider SMBs, perhaps now serving more as a backup payment rail and alternative to credit cards. Going forward , real-time payments are expected to continue to gain traction with healthcare provider SMBs. Eighty-three percent of businesses surveyed said they have at least moderate interest in receiving real-time payments in the next year, while 68% said they are very or extremely interested. When it comes to sending money, 82% have moderate interest, while 64% are very or extremely interested.

Title: Unveiling the unseen : the hidden costs of health care - associated infections

Article Content:
Share Tweet Share Many aspects of health care-associated infections are unseen. The bacteria that cause infections like C. difficile or catheter-associated urinary tract infections are invisible to the naked eye. Beyond the financial burdens of additional treatment and longer hospital stays, less obvious costs often fall below the radar in the form of suffering, distress, and shattered trust in the health care system when patients fall victim to preventable infections. And, often low profile and behind the scenes, health care epidemiologists and infection preventionists lead the prevention efforts against health care-associated infections. Health care epidemiologists are crucial to the safe functioning of every hospital and health system and should be considered valuable allies to the C-suite. These professionals investigate pathogens and the workflow processes of health care personnel to uncover hidden reservoirs of bacteria and paths of transmission. They work with a multidisciplinary team to identify threats before they spread. This includes working with engineers and plumbers to prevent outbreaks from microbes hiding in sink traps. They also support operations and staff at all levels to ensure hand hygiene supplies are accessible and health care personnel follow the policies and processes for hand hygiene. They work closely with housekeeping and environmental services to ensure microbes do not spread from high-touch surfaces such as bedrails and doorknobs to patients, visitors, and staff. Health care-associated infections cost the U.S. health care system billions of dollars every year. In our rapidly evolving health care landscape, with fast-paced technological innovations, the prevention of health care-associated infections remains one of the most pressing and overlooked challenges. Infections acquired within a health care setting pose a significant threat to patient well-being and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial burdens impacting not only individual patients but their families and communities. While the costs of health care-associated infections are well-documented, prevention yields undeniable financial savings as well as patient and societal benefits. For example, urinary tract infections linked to catheter use are one of the most common and costly preventable infections in health care. Patients grappling with catheter-associated urinary tract infections may experience prolonged physical suffering and emotional distress. They require additional treatments and longer hospital stays, and their trust in the health care system can be shattered, influencing future health care-seeking behavior. Multidrug-resistant organisms introduce another layer of complexity. For a patient who contracts an antibiotic-resistant strain while hospitalized, the limited treatment options due to drug resistance extend the duration of illness and increase the likelihood of complications, compounding the full financial toll on the health care system and the physical and emotional toll on patients. Preventing health care-associated infections requires special training in infectious diseases, an understanding of microbes’ interactions with the host, and an understanding of how people—patients, visitors, and staff—intermingle within a health care facility’s built environment. Investing in a knowledgeable health care workforce that can bring prevention to every aspect of the health care operation is crucial. Health care professionals well-versed in principles and practices of infection control establish processes to remove or prevent the use of unnecessary medical devices, such as urinary catheters, that can cause infection; track down multidrug-resistant organisms, and teach everyone from nursing staff to cafeteria aides how to avoid spreading the bacteria that cause deadly infections. The time to invest in prevention isn’t when we are deep in a pandemic or reacting to a local outbreak, but instead when we are in our regular health care business status quo. Investing in outbreak prevention through health care epidemiology isn’t just about saving money; it’s about saving lives. When health care professionals are armed with the knowledge and expertise to prevent infections, they become a formidable barrier against the unseen costs of HAIs.

ARTICLE 7 June 2024 AHRQ Outlines Principles And Recommendations To Advance Digital Healthcare Equity CM Crowell & Moring LLP More Contributor Our founders aspired to create a different kind of law firm when they launched Crowell & Moring in 1979. From those bold beginnings, our mission has been to provide our clients with the best services of any law firm in the world through a spirit of trust, respect, cooperation, collaboration, and a commitment to giving back to the communities around us. Explore Firm Details On April 18, 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality issued the Digital Healthcare Equity Framework to guide users and stakeholders ... United States Food, Drugs, Healthcare, Life Sciences Jodi G. Daniel, Allison Kwon, and Eunice LaLanne To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Article Insights Crowell & Moring LLP are most popular: within Insurance, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Accounting and Audit topic(s) On April 18, 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS') Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) issued the Digital Healthcare Equity Framework (the Framework) to guide users and stakeholders to consider equity throughout the entire lifecycle when implementing digital healthcare solutions. AHRQ also released a separate implementation guide (the Guide) to outline best practices and examples to implement the Framework. The Framework's guiding principles provide a clear purpose for the Framework and development of its domains while the separate Guide provides actionable steps on how to implement the Framework. Digital healthcare developers and vendors, health systems, health plans, and clinical providers should review the Framework and Guide to assess equity during each phase of the digital healthcare lifecycle for digital health technologies. Specifically, the Framework recommends that these stakeholders should consider the Framework's principles and recommendations to address the accessibility, purpose, security, privacy features, usability, and safety concerns applying to digital solutions. The Framework According to AHRQ, although there are considerable opportunities for digital healthcare technologies, substantial disparities due to race, ethnicity, geographic location and socioeconomic status still exist in access to and utilization of healthcare services. To advance digital health equity and ensure that disadvantaged communities are not left behind, the Framework has been designed to specify the aspects that need to be considered in this systematic and intentional approach to digital healthcare equity. This consensus-based Framework was prepared by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University for AHRQ based on review of existing literature and interviews with technical experts. The Framework is designed as a tool to help users and other stakeholders intentionally consider equity during each phase of the digital healthcare lifecycle: 1) the planning and development phases (e.g., for digital healthcare developers and vendors); 2) the acquisition phase (e.g., for a health plan); and 3) the implementation/maintenance and monitoring/improvement/equity assessment phases (e.g., for health systems or provider practices). Additionally, the Framework addresses three domains, including Patient and Community Characteristics, Health System Characteristics, and Health Information Technology Characteristics, with eight subdomains. The Framework outlines six principles: Ensure digital healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies ameliorate, not exacerbate, inequities; Represent equity through person-centeredness; Encourage inclusivity and participatory creation of digital healthcare solutions; Support effective implementation in diverse settings; Ensure specific attention to policy/regulatory relevance or impact of the proposed solutions; and Focus on impact and outcomes for patients, health systems, and communities. The Guide Published separately from the Framework, the Guide provides a step-by-step path for users, including digital healthcare developers and vendors, health systems, health plans, and clinical providers, who want to implement the Framework. The Guide includes general recommendations that organizations should adopt to start on the path toward equity in digital healthcare solutions, including focusing on organizational readiness (e.g., by performing an organization self-assessment); identifying an equity champion to help develop a business model and assess the economic sustainability and impact of the equity intentionality approach; developing a diverse workforce; ensuring that equity assessments and feedback loops are built in to processes related to healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies; and tracking equity as part of organizational metrics. We have outlined specific recommendations in the below table. Stakeholders (Digital Healthcare Lifecycle Stage) Recommendations Digital Healthcare Developers and Vendors (Planning and Development Phases) Identify and engage potential users of the digital healthcare solution, particularly those in historically marginalized demographic groups, to ensure it will meet the needs of the intended audience. Understand the cultural characteristics and beliefs of the communities for which a digital healthcare solution is proposed to identify potential barriers to using the proposed solution. Consider the impact of the proposed solution on digital equity in access, quality, and continuity of care in distinct healthcare settings. Assess whether the proposed solution serves as a facilitator (versus a barrier) to accessing and receiving high-quality care. Assess the technical characteristics of the proposed solution and whether those meet the current needs of potential users. Ensure that data are used equitably and transparently during the creation of a proposed solution and when a solution is capturing, generating, or transmitting data. Health Systems, Health Plans, and Clinical Providers (Acquisition and Implementation/Maintenance Phases) Adopt a digital inclusion-informed strategy regarding the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies to reduce and eliminate barriers. Consider a participatory and multisectoral collaboration for proper acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies. Consider the impact of the implemented solution on digital equity (access to and quality of care, and care continuity) across different types of health systems. Adopt strategies that guarantee a new healthcare solution involving digital technologies serves as a facilitator and not as a barrier to accessing and receiving high-quality care. Assess the technical characteristics of the solution and how those match the current needs of potential users. Before acquiring a healthcare solution, consider how it was developed, where and how it will be implemented and maintained, and how it will use, produce, or transmit data. Health Systems, Health Plans, and Clinical Providers (Monitoring/Improvement/Equity Assessment Phase) Identify the characteristics of the populations that are using a healthcare solution that involves digital technologies, and identify populations presently excluded, not benefiting, or not participating at the desired or same rates as others. Use a participatory approach to collect input from affected community members about the healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies. Consider the impact of the healthcare solution on digital equity (access to and quality of care, and care continuity) across different types of health systems. Adopt strategies that guarantee a new healthcare solution that involves digital technologies serves as a facilitator, not a barrier, to accessing and receiving high-quality care. Identify information sources and gaps in available data for a comprehensive monitoring, improvement, and equity assessment of digital technologies. Takeaways The AHRQ Framework and Guide provide helpful resources to support various stakeholders when developing and implementing digital health technologies. The Framework demonstrates HHS' action to further encourage adoption of digital health technologies as well as the Administration's government-wide goal to integrate health equity by design. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Jodi G.

Economy World Bank approves $900m financing for Bangladesh resilience The funding aims to bolster Bangladesh's economic resilience and enhance urban infrastructure to foster sustainable growth amid climate challenges News Desk bdnews24.com Published : 22 Jun 2024, 10:15 PM Updated : 22 Jun 2024, 10:15 PM The World Bank has approved financing for two projects totaling $900 million to bolster Bangladesh's economic resilience and enhance urban infrastructure to foster sustainable growth amid climate challenges. The first project – Second Recovery and Resilience Development Policy – with a credit worth $500 million, focuses on advancing fiscal and financial sector reforms crucial for sustained growth and resilience against future shocks, including climate change, the World Bank said in a statement. This initiative supports the transition from trade to consumption and income taxes, enhances banking sector oversight, and improves management of National Savings Certificates. Additionally, it aims to streamline public procurement through the e-GP system, reducing procurement lead times and strengthening social protection programmes. Citing Bernard Haven, World Bank senior economist, the statement said: “A well-functioning financial sector is critical for Bangladesh to increase investment and improve access to finance for those left out of formal banking systems.” The second project – Resilient Urban and Territorial Development Project – allocates $400 million to enhance climate-resilient urban infrastructure and management capacities in seven city clusters along Bangladesh's economic corridor. Spanning over 950 kilometers from Cox’s Bazar to Panchagarh, this initiative addresses urbanisation challenges exacerbated by rapid population growth and industrial expansion in Dhaka. Kwabena Amankwah-Ayeh, World Bank senior urban development specialist, said in the statement: "This project marks the beginning of a series focused on climate resilience and economic opportunities in secondary cities, crucial for Bangladesh's sustainable development." The two projects aim to create jobs, improve rural-urban linkages, strengthen food supply chains, and enhance connectivity and economic opportunities in targeted areas. They also prioritise gender-responsive infrastructure and green building features to support sustainable urban development. “Decisive reforms will help Bangladesh sustain growth and strengthen resilience to climate change and other shocks,” said Abdoulaye Seck, World Bank country director for Bangladesh and Bhutan. “These new financing operations will help Bangladesh in two critical areas – the financial sector and urban management — to achieve its vision of upper middle-income status.” Follow bdnews24.com on Google News Related Stories Gold, stocks upbeat as US shutdown deal clears Senate Read More US House returns to Washington for vote to end shutdown Devotion lights up Rakher Upobash London councillors’ Bangladesh run leaves UK minister ‘appalled’ CMP chief orders ‘burst fire’ on armed criminals Read More Opinion Julian Francis Remembering the great Bhola cyclone Anatul Fateh The Defection Biswadip Das 19 and counting: The price of independence in Bangladesh’s media Syed Badrul Ahsan The media are keepers of public conscience Read More

Half of UK consumers are already using Open Banking without realising it Robert Prendergast June 20, 2024 2 min read There is strong market potential for merchants who prioritise the adoption of Open Banking payments early in their payment strategies. That is according to research released by emerchantpay. The survey of UK consumers found that one in two people are unknowingly using Open Banking during checkout, 51% of the UK population being unfamiliar with the term Open Banking. Once consumers were informed about what Open Banking is, 45% of respondents that had not heard of the term claimed they had in fact used Open Banking for purchases. This suggests that the term is not widely recognised, but Open Banking payments are actively being used by consumers. Of those who had heard of it, usage increased significantly to 58%, indicating that, once understood, consumers are eager to use Open Banking solutions. The outlook for Open Banking is also positive, 19% of respondents saying that they will use Open Banking more frequently in 5 years’ time. This compares to 14% saying the same for Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and 7% for crypto. Merchants in many sectors can leverage the opportunities of Open Banking, with 44% of respondents saying they would use it for online retail, 36% for utility bills, 34% for hotels, 30% for airline tickets, and 25% for online subscriptions. "It's evident that there's a lack of awareness of Open Banking as a term" Younger consumers demonstrated more awareness of Open Banking, with 25–34-year-olds most likely to have heard of it at 45%. There is also an anticipated 32% surge in the use of Open Banking payments among 25–34-year-olds over the next five years. Jon Horddal, Chief Product Officer at emerchantpay said: “The opportunities Open Banking offers to merchants are boundless, with it providing many features that consumers are currently seeking and demanding at the checkout. However, it's evident that there's a lack of awareness of Open Banking as a term. “To create a win-win situation for consumers and merchants, there needs to be more education as to what it means and what its benefits are, from both the merchants themselves, but also from banks. Many of the key features consumers want are available via Open Banking, but merchants need to be better equipped to demonstrate these benefits to consumers. “To reap the rewards that Open banking has to offer, merchants need to start including Open Banking payments at the checkout, alongside an explanation, to see the sort of consumer adoption we’ve experienced in the past with new payment methods, such as BNPL and eWallets.” "Half of UK consumers are already using Open Banking without realising it" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International , a GlobalData owned brand.

18 June, 2024 Share this: facebook twitter email print Johannesburg, South Africa, 18 June 2024 (ECA) - Countries in Southern Africa performed well on their financial inclusion, between 2011 and 2021, thanks to their rapid adoption of digital financial services including mobile money. This is according to financial experts at a webinar on the African Financial Sector in Southern Africa. Organized by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in partnership with the Making Finance Work for Africa/AfDB, the webinar is part of a series themed, Regional Dialogues on the African Financial Sector - regional profiles. The aim of the regional profiles is to provide detailed information on the countries' financial sectors, documenting recent trends, progress, challenges, and opportunities for a deeper financial sector. In her opening remarks Eunice Kamwendo, ECA’s Director of the Subregional Office for Southern Africa noted the potential for growth, innovation and sustainable investments in the financial sector in Southern Africa. “Southern African region’s financial sector faces financial challenges that include liquidity issues, debt distress, limited access to financial services, high levels of informality and regulatory constraints; Despite these challenges, it is important to prioritize the development of the financial sector to create stability, mobilize domestic resources and foster a stable environment for investment,” said Ms. Kamwendo. Presenting a report on the demographic economic landscape of the Southern African region, Alain Kpassokro, consultant in development finance said the banking sector in Southern Africa has remained solvent with adequate capital; banking liquidity remained sufficient, with most banks seeing profitability between 2021 and 2023. “The challenge in the banking industry in the region is the strong interconnection between the banking system and non – banking financial institutions and foreign markets, which leads to the risk of contagion,” said Mr. Kpassokro. He proposed that governments should increase fiscal space by expanding government revenues through diversification of the tax base and simplification of tax systems to reduce the exposure of banks to sovereign risks. Punki Modise, Chief strategy and sustainability officer, ABSA Bank highlighted the varying levels of debt to GDP ratios across African countries and noted that some countries such as Kenya, Ghana, Kenya and Egypt have adopted unsustainable debt strategies. She also emphasized the importance of project preparation and bankability in the private sector. “Authorities should enhance competition in the banking systems through the promotion of new players especially those that help to improve financial inclusion,” she said. In addition, she said banks operating in Africa need to have a more end-to-end approach to risk management, considering bankability at all stages. On capital markets most countries in the Southern African region have a low market capitalization. The Johannesburg stock exchange, which is the leading stock exchange in Africa has a market capitalization of $1022.8 trillion representing 133% of GDP in 2023, against 51.9% of Mauritius and 18.6% of Namibia. A lack of liquidity characterizes the bulk of the South African stock market and the breadth of the stock market in the region remains limited. Furthermore, a small, listed number of companies and corporate bonds tend to dominate the fixed income market while the proportion of government bonds in the normal value is much higher. “A deeper pool of insurers is required for the acceleration of green bonds growth in the region especially among corporate borrowers,” said Mr. Kpassokro. According to the experts attending the meeting, the pension fund penetration remains low in most Southern African countries. However, the high pension penetration rate in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana were the result of good investment returns on the funds, based on a diversified investment strategy coupled with a strong asset allocation process, Bernard Yen, Actuary and managing director Aon Solutions Ltd, Mauritius highlighted the challenge of encouraging people in the formal sector to save and discussed the importance of structural changes to increase participation in pension funds. He suggested that structural changes such as tax incentives and simplified registration processes could drive participation. He also emphasized the need for a multi-faceted approach to increase pension fund participation in the region. “Countries should explore ways to increase participation of informal sector workers in multi-employer pension funds,” he added. On the question of tapping into southern African SMEs, participants noted that the majority are financially constrained and face a lack of skills in corporate governance, financial management and often contend with high collateral requirements. Mr. Bamugye noted the need to help SMEs develop bankable business plans and called for streamlining government support programs towards them. He emphasized the importance of blended finance structures to address the challenges faced by SMEs in the region including the need for risk capital and conditionality and use of unfunded guarantees to unlock local liquidity. He acknowledged the obstacle of bank credit access in the region particularly for SMEs and encouraged innovative and creative solutions to promote financial inclusion advising that countries should continue to explore innovative instruments and blended approaches to solve SME credit access problems.

India's non-banking financial sector grew by 10%; declined globally by 3 % ANI | Updated: Jun 17, 2024 13:27 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi[India], June 17 (ANI): India's non-banking financial sector registered a growth of 10 per cent however globally the sector declined by 3 per cent, highlights a report by SBI . The non-banking financial institutions are typically those that do not possess a full banking license and thus, cannot accept public deposits. These entities usually focus on lending and financing activities. "Globally, the size of the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector declined by 3 per cent in 2022, which is the first notable decrease since. However, Economic Function 2 (EF2) entities i.e., entities undertaking lending activities, which are akin to NBFC s in India, exhibited a growth of around 10 per cent which is the highest among all five economic categories of the NBFI sector" said the report. The report highlighted India as the third-largest entities in the non-banking financial sector, following the United States and the United Kingdom. Over the past decade, the Indian banking system has demonstrated remarkable resilience, overcoming numerous challenges posed by both domestic and international economic environments. The report said that the improvement in asset quality and the strong macroeconomic fundamentals have played a crucial role in improving the Indian banking sector. It highlighted that the Indian government and regulatory bodies have focused on creating a level playing field for financial institutions. This has involved initiatives such as the creation of strong banks through mergers and capital infusion, improving governance practices, expanding the reach and quality of financial services, and enhancing the adoption of digital banking. During the pandemic, the government maintained the financial sector's stability through substantial capital and liquidity buffers. This resilience is credited to the proactive measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The report also highlighted RBI's efforts in strengthening the financial system included enforcing the regulatory measures that ensured the sector remained well-cushioned against economic shocks. These measures have not only helped in maintaining stability but also in fostering growth and innovation within the sector. Recently India's digital banking landscape has also seen significant advancements. The push towards digital banking has been a major contributor to the sector's growth. This transition to digital platforms has expanded access to financial services, making them more inclusive and efficient. Moreover, the report said that the government and regulatory bodies have prioritized customer protection, ensuring that the interests of the public are safeguarded amidst the digital transformation.

Article Content:
The Qatar Central Bank (QCB)'s environment, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability strategy could pave way for ESG bonds and sukuk and the inclusion of sukuk within the strategy is a notable development, according to Fitch, a global credit rating agency. "The strategy's emphasis on sustainable finance aligns with the increasing focus on ESG factors within the banking sector, reflecting a trend where stakeholders demand that banks integrate ESG into their corporate strategy and financing instruments, such as bonds and sukuk," Fitch said. The second pillar 'Capital mobilisation towards sustainable finance', aims to enhance the financial sector's role in supporting national sustainability objectives and in mobilising capital for sustainable finance. The strategy is broadly based on three main pillars with the first pillar focusing on managing climate, environmental, and social risks in the financial sector; the second encouraging capital investments in sustainable finance and the third pillar aiming at incorporating ESG and sustainability practices into the QCB's internal operations. "The inclusion of sukuk within the strategy is indeed a noteworthy development. Sukuk financing for environmentally friendly projects introduces a vital element to the sustainable finance sector in the region, appealing to investors who are looking for Shariah-compliant options that also fulfil ecological goals," Fitch said. This could support Qatar's aspiration to become a leading hub for sustainable finance innovation and capital mobilisation, in line with Qatar's National Vision 2030 and the Third Financial Sector Strategic Plan, according to the rating agency. "Through these targeted initiatives, the QCB aims to position Qatar at the forefront of sustainable finance, making it an attractive destination for investors seeking opportunities that align with ESG,’’ Fitch said. "We recognise the importance of integrating sustainability into our financial activities and we believe that sustainable development can only be achieved through effective partnerships between financial institutions and the society," QCB Governor HE Sheikh Bandar bin Mohamed bin Saud al-Thani had said in the strategy report. Calling for heightened transparency on the financial sector's contribution to national sustainability objectives, the QCB said to achieve this, the strategy includes the development of taxonomy of sustainable economic activities and guidelines for the issuance of sustainable products like loans, bonds, and sukuks. Outstanding ESG sukuk grew significantly reaching $40bn at the end of first quarter (Q1) of 2024 (all currencies). Fitch expects the ESG sukuk market to cross 7.5% of global outstanding sukuk in the coming years (at end of Q1-24: 4.6%), with growth likely to be supported by issuers’ funding diversification plans, to satisfy international ESG investors’ mandates, and by government sustainability initiatives.

How Canadians bank: Canadian Bankers Association highlights that digital banking has become the norm Douglas Blakey June 12, 2024 4 min read The introduction and rapid adoption of digital banking alternatives has transformed the way that Canadians conduct their banking. Digital banking has become the norm in terms of how people do most of their banking. More than 4 in 10 Canadians say their use of apps and online banking has been increasing in recent years. 87% have banked online in the last year, but online banking behaviours appear to be migrating towards more app-based banking over time. 70% have used an app to do their banking, up from 65% in 2021. On average, the number of reported uses of mobile app per month is 7.4 times. Young adults (age 18-29) are more likely to be app-centric while older adults (age 70+) do more online banking. Phone banking has been declining. Roughly a quarter of consumers use in-person services according to the Canadian Bankers Association report. The average number of reported bank branch visits per month dropped from 1.8 in 2021 to 1.3 in 2024. ATMs are still in use, but frequency of use may be declining. Reported withdrawals from ATMs are, on average, 2.7 times per month in 2023. This is up from the pre-pandemic level of 2.4 times per month in 2018. Canadians are highly satisfied with banking services Exceptionally large numbers of Canadians are satisfied with the banking services they access from banks in Canada. 97% say that they are satisfied with online banking. 96% say that they are happy with app-based banking. Meantime, 95% are satisfied with ABM banking. Satisfaction with these types of banking have all improved in recent years. The use of e-transfer has almost doubled in 6 years, to an average of 4 times per month in 2023. Other key findings 40% said they will increase the use of e-transfer over the next 5 years; Almost everyone expects to be using credit and debit cards 5 years from now; Close to a third expect to be using some form of digital or crypto currency, down 4% from 2021, and 70% believe they will no longer be using cheques, up from 62% in 2018. Canadian channel preferences Banking app use has seen the biggest increase, from 9% in 2014 to 30% in 2023. Only 41% of consumers say their use of online banking has increased in recent years, compared with 46% in 2021. 48% of consumers say they have increased their use of an app in the last few years. This compares to 37% in 2021. The reported frequency of use of tap and pay with credit and debit cards remains strong, with apparent rise in the use of debit cards from 2021. The average Canadian reports using Tap & Pay 10 times a month. Credit card and debit cards are used 8.7 times and 9.6 times a month, respectively. The use of e-transfer has increased to 4 times a month from 2.9 times in 2021. Story Continues Online banking continues its leading position as the most common form of banking for most Canadians. But some consumers are shifting towards primarily using an app. Online banking is the go-to channel for Canadians aged 60 and older (59% for consumers aged 60-69 and 66% for those over 70). For those over 70, only 9% said they use an app to conduct their banking transactions. For the age group of 18-29, 39% use an app to conduct the majority of their banking transactions. This is followed by 37% for people aged between 30 and 44. In 2024, 70% said that they have used an app to conduct banking. Some 30% say they use an app for the majority of their banking, up from 23% in 2018. The branch remains an important banking channel 61% of Canadians used in-branch banking in 2024, up from 57% in 2021. However, the level has not gone back to pre-pandemic levels of 67% in 2018. It is likely that it will not go back to that level. Only 12% of customers do most of their banking at the branch. 27% plan to decrease their bank branch visits over the next five years. Use and interest in digital currencies is down The use of digital currencies has not advanced much in the last few years. 9% say they use cryptocurrency now, compared to 13% in 2021. 32% say that they will use alternative currency five years from now, down from 36% in 2021. 10% say they will use cryptocurrency in the future, compared to 14% in 2021. Half say they will never use cryptocurrency, up from 43% in 2021.

Title: Rapid AI development poses supervisory challenges in the Netherlands

Shuo - stock.adobe.com By Kim Loohuis Published: 07 Jun 2024 14:26 The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and the monetary authority, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), are in the midst of a profound supervisory transformation fuelled by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) . While technological advances are driving a wave of innovation in the financial and security industries, these supervisory bodies face significant challenges in keeping up with the complexity and pace of these changes. To shape the monitoring of AI, the two organisations have jointly released a report with starting points and concerns. The report aims to engage the bodies in dialogue with the industry, demonstrating their commitment to transparency and collaboration. AI in finance The growing influence of AI in the Dutch financial world is not just a matter of technological advancement, but also raises profound questions about the risks involved . Banks and insurers increasingly make decisions on lending and policy premiums using AI. This development has not gone unnoticed by the citizens, who are increasingly concerned about how this could affect their financial well-being. Research shows that only a quarter of Dutch respondents are optimistic about the use of AI by financial institutions, but more than six in 10 believe strict supervisory measures could help. These concerns are not to be taken lightly. In response, De Nederlandsche Bank sees a vital role for itself as a strict watchdog, looking out for both the risks and opportunities of AI use in the financial sector. DNB board member Steven Maijoor said in an interview with Dutch news site AD: “AI is here to stay. It is happening now and will become more and more important. Then we’d better regulate it properly.” This statement underscores the gravity of the situation and the need for responsible regulation. Ensuring individuals’ privacy and preventing data misuse are essential aspects of adequate supervision in the age of AI Pursuing a balanced approach to AI in the financial sector aligns with the insights of the report by De Nederlandsche Bank and the Financial Markets Authority. The report, The impact of AI on the financial sector and supervision , provides an in-depth insight into this shift and highlights the crucial role of AI in modernising financial services. The supervisory bodies have closely analysed the impact of AI on the financial sector, and they stress the importance of supervising the responsible use of AI by financial institutions. With the emergence of AI in the decision-making process of banks and insurers, it becomes crucial to adequately supervise and ensure that AI systems are transparent and respect consumers’ fundamental rights. DNB and AFM will, therefore, work to assess the risks of AI in the financial sector and take appropriate measures to protect consumers from potential dangers, reinforcing the audience’s sense of security. “When it comes to digitisation, [financial] entrepreneurs and organisations look mainly at the security risks to their own business and much less at the societal consequences. This is worrying,” said Jan Matto, partner for IT audit and advisory at Mazars Nederland . “As an entrepreneur, you must report on the systemic risks you may face with digital personal data, for example. Think of discrimination, exclusion, illegal arms trade, the undermining of democratic processes, the spread of fake news – which, for example, is harmful to the health or well-being of individuals – and the failure to respect the rights of children in particular,” he added. “It is strange that we require every company to be responsible but demand so few guarantees when it comes to digitisation.” One of the primary challenges arising from the accretion of AI is the complexity of algorithms used in financial processes and security operations. Traditional oversight mechanisms may not be adequately equipped to understand and evaluate the deep workings of these complex algorithms. Therefore, the AFM and the BND need to invest in advanced analytical capabilities and specialist expertise to monitor and control these algorithms effectively. Another crucial aspect highlighted in the report is the need for transparency and accountability in the use of AI in the financial and security sectors. This requires the AFM and the BND to ensure an adequate data protection and privacy framework, as AI systems often rely on large amounts of sensitive data. Ensuring individuals’ privacy and preventing data misuse are essential aspects of adequate supervision in the age of AI. Ethical AI governance Moreover, the rise of AI brings new risks, such as the possibility of unintentional discrimination or bias in automated decision-making systems. AFM and BND acknowledge that these risks call for proactive measures to ensure that AI applications are fair and equitable and meet the highest ethical standards. Developing guidelines and standards for the ethical use of AI will play a crucial role in ensuring integrity and trust in financial and security processes. It is strange that we require every company to be responsible but demand so few guarantees when it comes to digitisation Jan Matto, Mazars Nederland Another key challenge is strengthening staff capabilities and training them in AI-related skills. The AFM and the BND need continuous training and professional development to ensure that their teams remain up to date with the latest developments in AI technologies and methodologies. In addition, collaboration with academic institutions and private sector partners is essential to access specialised knowledge and expertise in AI. Finally, the report stated that the AFM and the BND need to be aware of the geopolitical implications of AI, especially in the areas of cyber security and information security. The increasing use of AI in cyber attacks and espionage operations requires a more resilient and coherent approach to cyber security, where international cooperation and information sharing are crucial. The report concludes that the rise of artificial intelligence represents a paradigm shift for regulatory bodies such as the AFM and the BND. To remain effective in an ever-changing environment, the Dutch regulatory bodies must adapt to the complexity and speed of technological change while integrating AI’s ethical, legal and societal implications into their supervisory practices. Therefore, the AFM and BND will intensify their efforts to monitor and control financial institutions’ complex algorithms and decision-making systems. They will also invest in advanced analytical capabilities and specialist expertise to ensure the transparency and accountability of AI systems. Through close cooperation with international partners and continuous evaluation of best practices, the AFM and BND will strive for a robust and adaptive supervisory regime that promotes the integrity and stability of the financial sector while fostering innovation and competition within an ethical framework.

Treasury is seeking a broad range of perspectives on this topic and is particularly interested in understanding how AI innovations can help promote a financial system that delivers inclusive and equitable access to financial services.

World Bank approves $250million loan to bolster Ghana's financial sector World Bank approves $250million loan to bolster Ghana's financial sector Graphic Online Business News May - 31 - 2024 , 15:21 The World Bank has pledged $250 million to support Ghana's financial sector stability through a five-year project. In a statement, the World Bank said the loan, approved on May 30, 2024, will be provided by the International Development Association (IDA), a World Bank arm dedicated to assisting low-income countries. This project aligns with Ghana's Financial Sector Strengthening Strategy (FSSS) and aims to address the impact of the country's Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) on banks and financial institutions. The project will support the FSSS by contributing to financial stability through the recapitalization of viable Banks and Specialized Deposit-taking Institutions (SDIs) impacted by the DDEP. "The financial system is the lifeblood of Ghana's economy," said Robert R. Taliercio, World Bank Country Director for Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. "This project will strengthen financial stability by providing solvency support to banks and institutions affected by the DDEP, ensuring continued access to essential financial services for Ghanaians." The funds will be channelled through the Ghana Financial Sector Stability Fund (GFSF), established by the government to support struggling institutions. This project prioritizes immediate assistance to eligible undercapitalized banks and financial institutions, with provisions for future support if needed. "The World Bank's support aims to mitigate short-term shocks and promote long-term resilience in Ghana's financial sector," explained Carlos Leonardo Vicente, Senior Financial Specialist and Team Lead for the project. "Financial stability is crucial for protecting Ghanaians and preserving jobs." This initiative complements other World Bank programs in Ghana, including the Development Policy Financing series and the IMF's Extended Credit Facility. These programmes focus on broader economic reforms and enabling financial institutions to operate profitably. The World Bank also supports projects focused on economic recovery and job creation, such as the Ghana Development Financing Project. The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) has a long history of assisting low-income countries. Since its inception in 1960, IDA has provided financial assistance to 114 countries, with a particular focus on Africa. Read the entire World Bank statement below; World Bank Supports Ghana to Strengthen its Financial Sector WASHINGTON, May 30th, 2024 – The World Bank today approved a $250 million International Development Association (IDA)* credit for a five-year Ghana Financial Stability Project. The project will support Ghana’s Financial Sector Strengthening Strategy (FSSS) by contributing to financial stability through the recapitalization of viable Banks and Specialized Deposit-taking Institutions (SDIs) impacted by Ghana’s Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP). The financial system is critical to the functioning of the Ghanaian economy, providing critical services to households, firms, government, and supporting economic growth. To address the severe impact of the DDEP on financial institutions, the Government established the Ghana Financial Sector Stability Fund (GFSF) to provide solvency support to banks, pension funds, insurance companies fund managers and collective investment schemes. “This project will contribute to Ghana’s financial stability, by providing solvency support to banks and SDIs impacted by the DDEP through the GFSF.” said Robert R. Taliercio, World Bank Country Director for Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. “Through direct support to banks and SDIs, the project will benefit Ghana’s financial sector and the economy by supporting the access of depositors and other financial consumers to savings, payments, and other core financial services provided by adequately capitalized banks and SDIs.“ The Ghana Financial Stability project is expected to immediately benefit eligible undercapitalized but viable banks and SDIs and become accessible to other banks and SDIs that may need support in the future due to potential new losses and providing a backstop against unexpected losses. “The World Bank Group’s support aims to help address short-term shocks to improve prospects for long-term sustainable development and long-term resilience against future shocks. The project promotes financial stability, a key requirement to protect people and preserve jobs,” said Carlos Leonardo Vicente, Senior Financial Specialist and Team Lead. The project complements the World Bank’s Development Program Financing series and the IMF-Extended Credit Facility, which support reforms to improve the macroeconomic environment and enable financial institutions to operate profitably and generate internal capital. It also complements other World Bank funded projects aimed at economic recovery and job creation in Ghana, such as the Ghana Development Financing Project which supported the establishment of the Development Bank of Ghana and provides long-term financing to small and medium enterprises and small corporates. *The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world’s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest credits for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people’s lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 74 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.3 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has provided $458 billion to 114 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $29 billion over the last three years (FY19-FY21), with about 70 percent going to Africa. Learn more online: IDA.worldbank.org. #IDAworks.

City of London Seeks to Boost Competitiveness, Foreign Investment By PYMNTS | May 22, 2024 | The City of London , the administrator of the financial district of the United Kingdom, is reportedly grappling with concerns about the district’s competitiveness and the need for foreign investment.

Δ The city’s policy leader, Chris Hayward , emphasized the importance of attracting foreign investment to boost growth and enhance the financial sector’s global competitiveness while addressing the House of Lords ’ financial services regulation committee Wednesday (May 22), Reuters reported Wednesday. However, Hayward argued that the current regulatory mindset lacks the characteristics necessary to achieve these goals , according to the report . The financial sector has faced challenges since the U.K. departed from the European Union and has seen U.K. companies considering listing in New York instead , the report said . Hayward said the current regulatory mindset is hindering growth and the financial sector’s international competitiveness , per the report . He said regulators, particularly the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), have not fully embraced risk-taking and growth promotion. To address this issue, Hayward suggested the establishment of a new public-private body that can actively attract foreign investment. Recognizing the need for change , the FCA and the Bank of England ’s Prudential Regulation Authority have been given a secondary objective of aiding growth and the financial sector’s international competitiveness when formulating rules, according to the report. However, skepticism remains about the effectiveness of this approach. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Hayward emphasized that the new remit alone is insufficient to boost inward investment and growth. He advocated for the creation of a dedicated promotional body to enhance the U.K.’s competitiveness compared to countries like Ireland, the report said. Hayward asserted that parliamentary backing is essential to support regulators in accepting more risk, arguing that the fear of retribution when things go wrong often hinders regulators from taking necessary risks, per the report. The debate surrounding the FCA’s “naming and shaming” plans — under which the financial watchdog would publicly disclose companies under investigation — highlights the importance of clarity in regulators’ statutory duties, according to the report. Committee member Jonathan Hill suggested that regulators should distinguish between their obligations and discretionary actions that may impede growth and competitiveness , per the report .

Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Don't overlook the financial sector as the stock market trends higher, according to Oakmark Funds portfolio manager and noted value investor Bill Nygren. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 40,000 for the first time on Friday, while both the Nasdaq Composite and S & P 500 entered Monday after four-week-long rallies. After a dreary April, all three indexes are now higher in the second quarter. Despite the financial sector outperforming the broader market, banking and consumer finance stocks are cheaper compared to all S & P 500 companies, according to Nygren. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) , which tracks the S & P 500 financials index, has returned 12.6% in 2024, including reinvested dividends, while the S & P 500 has returned less than 11.8%. "[W]e have just under 20% of our portfolio in banks and consumer finance companies, and they average about eight and a half times estimated earnings next year, relative to 20 something for the S & P," Nygren told CNBC's " Squawk on the Street " on Friday. "I still think that's really, really cheap." His portfolio's top holdings include some of the country's largest banks, such as Citigroup and Wells Fargo , as well as regional banks including First Citizens . Here is a list of Nygren's top holdings by portfolio weight. "[I]n the regulatory environment they're in now, [banks] are holding significantly more capital that brings down [returns on equity] a little bit and investors have severely punished them for that," Nygren said. "But we think what they haven't done is offset that by saying these banks aren't as risky as they used to be because they have so much capital." AI stocks have been hit recently.

Editorial Editorial A perplexing decision by Bangladesh Bank Sun Apr 28, 2024 03:30 PM Last update on: Sun Apr 28, 2024 03:30 PM Who will gain from its restrictions on media access? Sun Apr 28, 2024 03:30 PM Last update on: Sun Apr 28, 2024 03:30 PM VISUAL: STAR The recent restrictions placed on journalists' access to the Bangladesh Bank (BB) have evoked understandable criticism from the journalist community as well as from Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB). It is quite a perplexing decision coming from a public institution which, by definition, is supposed to serve public interests. The media, too, is morally mandated to serve public interests. This it does by disclosing finance and banking related information, including any irregularities allegedly taking place in the sector. Access into Bangladesh Bank is thus crucial for any journalist covering the sector. We are, therefore, quite alarmed that the BB could take such a restrictive measure. The central bank has reportedly instructed its security management and other departments not to allow journalists to enter its offices. The unprecedented restriction means that journalists covering the economy and finance will not be able to properly cover issues related to the economy. This is a disservice to the public but also to the government, which needs an honest appraisal of what is happening at the BB to make proper and timely interventions. Such reporting is all the more necessary at a time when the financial sector is facing severe challenges, including various irregularities, high inflation, and a dollar crisis that has affected many businesses and consumers. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Read more How tough can Bangladesh Bank be with wilful defaulters? Thus, journalists covering the economy and financial sector need full and unrestricted access to the Bangladesh Bank in order to get correct and verified information. Bangladesh Bank itself should also want to be accessible so that there is minimal risk of misinformation or rumours being circulated. All this makes its aforementioned decision rather difficult to understand. The message emanating from such restrictions is not the kind that a democratic government would want to send to the people. It gives off the impression that this is being done to protect the interests of certain powerful quarters that have been playing a major role in the irregularities of the financial sector. We, therefore, urge Bangladesh Bank authorities to remove these restrictions so that journalists can have free access to the central bank as they did before. By exposing anomalies in the financial sector, journalists are upholding the people's right to know and helping the government by providing insights into this crucial sector so that problems are identified and solutions can be developed and applied. Surely this is a win-win system for all parties.

The bank’s president director Hery Gunardi said the bank’s services had resumed after a series of cyberattacks from May 8 to May 11. (Antara/Syifa Yulinnas) C ybersecurity has become a major concern for the global financial sector, especially for the banking and payment system industries. Based on data from Checkpoint Research in 2022, there were 1,131 cyberattacks targeting the banking and financial sector globally, with estimated losses amounting to around US$100 billion. According to the National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN), in 2023 there were 361 million cyberattacks in Indonesia, with Rp 14.5 trillion ($906 million) recorded as financial losses from such activities. Financial loss is not the only consequence of those cyberattacks; data leaks and disruption of key business services also have a major impact. Indonesia is currently laying the groundwork for the digital economy transformation and needs to foster collaboration between the government and the private sector to support the acceleration in building cybersecurity infrastructure capability. The government, through the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 38/2015, has introduced the public-private partnership (PPP) legal framework, to provide high quality, effective and efficient infrastructure and also create a better investment environment that will be a win-win solution for the government, private sector and people. Based on the regulation, information technology (IT) infrastructure is one of the types of infrastructure that could be part of a PPP scheme. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) has also issued two regulations regarding cybersecurity in the financial sector. The first is OJK Circular Letter No. 29/2022, and the second is OJK Regulation No. 22/2023, which regulates that all banks and non-bank institutions should maintain and enhance their cybersecurity capabilities to ensure the implementation of cybersecurity principles.

Title: Cyberattacks Have More Than Doubled Since Start Of COVID - 19 Outbreak - Research Report

Article Content:
Cyberattacks have more than doubled since the pandemic, according to a recent update shared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . While companies have historically suffered relatively modest direct losses from cyberattacks, some have “experienced a much heavier toll,” the IMF report notes. US credit reporting agency Equifax, for example, paid “more than $1 billion in penalties after a major data breach in 2017 that affected about 150 million consumers.” As the IMF shows in a chapter of the April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report, the risk of extreme losses “from cyber incidents is increasing.” According to IMF’s blog post, such losses could potentially “cause funding problems for companies and even jeopardize their solvency.” The size of these extreme losses “has more than quadrupled since 2017 to $2.5 billion. And indirect losses like reputational damage or security upgrades are substantially higher.” The IMF report also mentioned that the financial sector “is uniquely exposed to cyber risk.” Financial firms—given the large amounts of sensitive data and transactions they handle—are often “targeted by criminals seeking to steal money or disrupt economic activity.” Attacks on financial firms “account for nearly one-fifth of the total, of which banks are the most exposed.” Incidents in the financial sector “could threaten financial and economic stability if they erode confidence in the financial system, disrupt critical services, or cause spillovers to other institutions.” For example, a severe incident “at a financial institution could undermine trust and, in extreme cases, lead to market selloffs or runs on banks.” Although no significant “cyber runs” have occurred thus far, IMF’s analysis “suggests modest and somewhat persistent deposit outflows have occurred at smaller US banks after a cyberattack.” Cyber incidents that disrupt critical services “like payment networks could also severely affect economic activity. For example, a December attack at the Central Bank of Lesotho disrupted the national payment system, preventing transactions by domestic banks.” Another consideration is that financial firms “increasingly rely on third-party IT service providers, and may do so even more with the emerging role of artificial intelligence.” Such external providers can “improve operational resilience, but also expose the financial industry to systemwide shocks.” For example, a 2023 ransomware attack on a cloud IT service provider “caused simultaneous outages at 60 US credit unions.” With the global financial system facing significant and growing cyber risks from increasing digitalization and geopolitical tensions, “as shown in the chapter, policies and governance frameworks at firms must keep pace.” Because private incentives may be insufficient “to address cyber risks—for example, firms may not fully account for the systemwide effects of incidents—public intervention may be necessary.” However, according to an IMF survey of central banks and supervisory authorities, cybersecurity policy frameworks, “especially in emerging market and developing economies, often remain insufficient.” For example, only about half of countries surveyed had “a national, financial sector-focused cybersecurity strategy or dedicated cybersecurity regulations.” To strengthen resilience in the financial sector, authorities “should develop an adequate national cybersecurity strategy accompanied by effective regulation and supervisory capacity that should encompass: Periodically assessing the cybersecurity landscape and identifying potential systemic risks from interconnectedness and concentrations, “including from third-party service providers.” Encouraging cyber “maturity” among financial sector firms, including board-level access to cybersecurity expertise, as “supported by the chapter’s analysis which suggests that better cyber-related governance may reduce cyber risk.” Improving cyber hygiene of firms—that is, “their online security and system health (such as antimalware and multifactor authentication)—and training and awareness.” Prioritizing data reporting and collection of cyber incidents, and “sharing information among financial sector participants to enhance their collective preparedness.” As attacks often emanate from outside “a financial firm’s home country and proceeds can be routed across borders, international cooperation is imperative to address cyber risk successfully.” While cyber incidents will occur, the financial sector “needs the capacity to deliver critical business services during these disruptions.” To this end, financial firms should “develop, and test, response and recovery procedures and national authorities should have effective response protocols and crisis management frameworks in place.” The IMF actively helps member countries “strengthen their cybersecurity frameworks through policy advice, for example as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, and through capacity-building activities.” Sponsored Links by DQ Promote X Facebook LinkedIn Truth Pinterest Reddit HackerNews Telegram Weibo Email Print Subscribe Like OpenAI icon ChatGPT Copy Link

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) report titled “Cyber Risk: A Growing Concern for Macrofinancial Stability” paints a concerning picture of the increasing threats posed by cyber incidents to the financial sector. The report highlights how the rise of digitisation, evolving technologies, and growing geopolitical tensions are creating a breeding ground for cyberattacks, potentially jeopardising global financial stability. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The report emphasises a surge in cyber incidents, particularly those with malicious intent, over the past two decades. This surge is significantly linked to the financial sector’s growing dependence on digital technologies.

Read “Cyber Risk: A Growing Concern for Macrofinancial Stability:” https://t.co/JRcZRDQ0Pg pic.twitter.com/L23jsfeRtF — IMF (@IMFNews) April 13, 2024 According to Major Vineet Kumar, Founder of CyberPeace, a Delhi-based think tank focused on policy-making around cybersecurity, the rise of financial technology (fintech) and digital banking services has significantly increased the attack surface for cybercriminals. While speaking to Firstpost , Kumar points to a recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report indicating a surge in card and internet fraud cases in the first quarter of FY24, with total damages reaching a staggering Rs. 630 crore. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD These digital vulnerabilities are being exploited by cybercriminals to steal sensitive financial information, leading to substantial financial losses. The report warns that severe incidents at major financial institutions could pose a systemic threat, causing a loss of confidence, disruption of critical services, and even spillovers to other institutions due to interconnectedness. The report finds that while cyber incidents have not yet been systemic, the risk of extreme losses for firms – estimated to be at least $2.5 billion – has grown considerably. Moreover, indirect losses tend to be substantially larger than reported direct losses, further amplifying the financial impact. The report also highlights that digitalisation and geopolitical tensions significantly heighten the risk of cyber incidents. Conversely, the analysis suggests that more developed cyber legislation and better cyber governance at firms can help mitigate such risks. International threats demand international cooperation The report underscores the importance of international cooperation in combating cyber threats in the financial sector. Financial crimes like cyberattacks often transcend national borders, making coordinated efforts crucial. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD A global risk management survey focused on India by financial services firm Aon found that the threat of cyber attacks and data breach were the top risks in the global financial market as well as in India (accounting for 18.3% of the losses incurred). They also found out that this was unlikely to change in the future. Industry experts like Advocate Siddharth Chandrashekhar, who is Standing Counsel for Income Tax at the Central Board of Direct Taxes at the Ministry of Finance, emphasise the need for information sharing, best practices, and resource collaboration to strengthen global cybersecurity defenses. “Coordinated responses to cyber incidents involving multiple countries enhance the effectiveness of mitigation efforts and contribute to the development of international norms and regulations governing cybersecurity,” Chandrashekhar told Firstpost . International cooperation can be particularly effective in responding to cyber incidents involving multiple countries. Collaborative efforts can enhance mitigation strategies and contribute to the development of international norms and regulations governing cybersecurity. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD India, for instance, participates in various forums like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to foster such collaboration. Countries remain largely unprepared Despite the growing threat, the report finds that many countries, especially emerging economies, are inadequately prepared to tackle cyber risks. The IMF survey of 51 countries revealed that many financial supervisors still lack robust cybersecurity regulations or resources for enforcement. A significant portion of these central banks and supervisory authorities lack: A national cyber strategy for the financial sector. Dedicated cybersecurity or technology risk management regulations. Specialised risk units within their supervision departments. Mandates for testing and exercising cybersecurity measures. Dedicated cyber incident reporting regimes. Cybercrime regulations. The report avers that many financial supervisors still need cyber security regulations or resources for enforcement. The report finds that of these central banks or supervisory authorities, 56% do not have a national cyber strategy for the financial sector, 42% do not have dedicated cyber security or technology risk management regulations, 68% lack a specialized risk unit as part of their supervision department, 64% do not mandate testing and exercising cyber security measures or provide further guidance, 54% lack a dedicated cyber incident reporting regime, and 48% do not have cybercrime regulations. These findings paint a concerning picture of the global financial sector’s overall preparedness for cyberattacks. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD India’s financial sector: A work in progress India’s financial sector, while experiencing rapid growth, faces significant challenges in dealing with cyber threats. Kumar acknowledges this, pointing out that smaller financial entities may lack the resources and expertise to effectively combat sophisticated cyberattacks. A December 2023 report by the RBI revealed that the Indian financial sector was confronted with more than 13 lakh cyber-attacks between January and October last year. “It is imperative that developing nations like India must establish a more robust mechanism for cyber security than is currently in place,” Kumar told Firstpost . The government, along with relevant agencies like the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), and the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), have taken several measures, including: A meeting in November 2023 by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) under the Ministry of Finance to examine the rising threat of digital financial fraud, attended by representatives from public and private banking institutions. Bringing all financial institutions under the ambit of the Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System (CFCFRMS). Renewed focus on facilitating seamless coordination between law enforcement agencies and financial institutions for real-time tracking and blocking of defrauded money. Considering new legislation like the Banning of Unregulated Lending Activities (BULA) Act. India’s policy landscape: Emerging but evolving India’s policy framework to address cybersecurity challenges in the financial sector is gradually taking shape. Experts highlight initiatives like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and the RBI’s cybersecurity framework, which outlines requirements for banks and other financial institutions to establish robust cybersecurity practices. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD These practices include risk assessment, incident response, and information sharing mechanisms. Additionally, the RBI has introduced initiatives such as the Cyber Security Operations Center (C-SOC) and the Cyber Crisis Management Plan (CCMP) to enhance the resilience of the financial sector against cyber threats. While speaking to Firstpost , Chandrashekhar highlights the importance of the C-SOC as a centralised hub for monitoring and responding to cyber incidents. The CCMP provides a structured approach for managing cybersecurity crises and coordinating response efforts among stakeholders. “India’s financial sector, is still considered to be in its nascent stage as compared to its international counterparts,” added Chandrashekhar. However, the report also cautions that continual adaptation and enforcement of these policies are necessary to effectively mitigate cyber risks and ensure the security and stability of the country’s financial sector. Third-party IT service providers: Strengthening the chain The report emphasises the growing reliance of financial institutions on third-party IT service providers. These dependencies introduce additional vulnerabilities, as a cyberattack on a s... [truncated]

View Market Dashboard Your Questions Answered: Should I invest in single stocks or index funds? Please elaborate Financial sector stocks have outperformed the market in the past year. Options for investing include picking individual stocks or investing in an index fund tracking a financial sector index. Pros and cons depend on goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Kuvera Published 9 Apr 2024, 08:46 AM IST single stocks vs index funds Q. I am a senior jewellery designer working with a jewellery house in Jaipur. I have observed that the financial sector has been outperforming the broader market since the past one year. I am currently confused between investing in financial sector stocks individually or investing in an index mutual fund tracking a financial sector index. Can you please elaborate on the pros and cons of investing in an index fund tracking the financial sector? Krishna Trilokcand Vasvani, Jaipur, Rajasthan. Picking stocks individually vs. Index fund Financial sectors stocks have outperformed the broader market in the past one year. There are multiple ways to invest in the financial sector chief among them is either picking financial sector stocks individually or investing in an index fund tracking a financial sector index. In India there are multiple indices tracking the financial sector such as nifty PSU banking index, nifty private bank index, S&P BSE BANKEX, etc. Amongst, index mutual funds, nifty financial services index is one of the most tracked index. For the purposes of your question we will be restricting the scope of our answer to analysing investment in financial sector stocks individually vs. investing in an index mutual fund tracking nifty financial services index. Both options have their merits and demerits, and the right answer depends on the investor's goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Picking financial stock individually Picking financial stocks individually means you are placing your bet on the performance of a few finance sector companies selected by you. Most investors will be able to research on less than 10 financial sector stocks and invest in two or three of them. This approach can be highly rewarding if the companies selected by you perform well, potentially offering higher returns than the market average. However, it also comes with much higher risks. The banking sector is sensitive to economic changes, regulatory policies, and interest rate fluctuations. The stocks selected by you will not only be susceptible to these factors, but to other factors such as their own operational performance and governance. Before picking financial stocks, investors should conduct thorough research, which includes analysing the companies’ financial statements, understanding their business model, assessing the quality of their management, and keeping abreast of industry trends and regulatory changes. This requires time, expertise, and a willingness to monitor the investment closely. Index mutual fund tracking nifty financial services index On the other hand, an index mutual fund tracking the nifty financial services Index offers a more diversified investment. Such a fund mirrors the composition and performance of the nifty financial services index, which includes a basket of stocks from the Indian financial services sector, not just banking but also other financial entities like insurance companies, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and housing finance firms. The nifty financial services index serves as a barometer for the industry's performance. This index, which is a subset of the Nifty 50 and comprises 20 companies, encompasses a broad range of companies, including banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, and other financial services providers. The top 10 constituents of the nifty financial services index are: HDFC Bank Ltd. ICICI Bank Ltd. State Bank of India Limited. Axis Bank Ltd. Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Bajaj Finance Ltd. Bajaj Finserv Ltd. Shriram Finance Ltd. SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd. The diversification inherent in an index mutual fund helps spread the risk across different companies and sub-sectors, reducing the impact of any single stock's poor performance. Moreover, index funds are passively managed, which typically results in lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. This makes them a cost-effective option for investors who are looking for exposure to the financial services sector without the need to select individual stocks. Nifty financial services index - How does it select stocks? To be considered for inclusion in this index, there are specific eligibility criteria that companies must meet: The company should be listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It should form a part of the Nifty 500 universe, which represents the top 500 companies by market capitalization on the NSE. The company should belong to the financial services sector. It is preferable, though not mandatory, for the company to be traded on NSE’s Futures & Options (F&O) segment. The index is calculated using the free float market capitalization method, where the level of the index reflects the total market value of all the stocks in the index relative to a particular base market capitalization value. The nifty financial services index is rebalanced semi-annually, and it comprises 20 stocks that are selected based on their free float market capitalization within their respective sub-sectors. Choosing between individual stock picking vs. Index fund When deciding between picking a financial sector stock individually and an index mutual fund, investors should consider the following factors: Risk tolerance: Are you comfortable with the volatility associated with 2-3 stocks, or do you prefer the relative stability of a well-diversified portfolio? Investment horizon: Is your investment for the short term or long term? A small portfolio of 2-3 stocks may be suitable for those with a shorter horizon Research and monitoring: Do you have the time and expertise to research and monitor individual stocks, or would you prefer a hands-off approach? Costs: Are you mindful of the costs associated with managing your investments? Index funds often have lower fees than the costs incurred when trading individual stocks. If you are hiring a registered investment advisor for investing in stock individually it may cost you much more than investing in an index fund. Advantages of investing in a mutual fund tracking nifty financials services index Diversification within the financial sector: The nifty financial services index encompasses a wide range of companies within the financial sector, including banks, insurance companies, non-banking financial companies, and other financial services entities. By investing in a mutual fund that tracks this index, you gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of financial stocks, which can help mitigate risk while still capitalising on the growth potential of the sector. Cost-effectiveness : Index funds are known for their lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. This cost-efficiency is a significant advantage, as lower costs can lead to higher net returns over time. By tracking an index, these funds avoid the higher fees associated with active management, making them an economical choice for investors. Alignment with economic growth: The financial services sector is often closely aligned with the broader economic growth of a country. As the economy expands, so does the demand for financial services, from loans and credit facilities to insurance and investment products. A mutual fund tracking the nifty financial services index allows investors to potentially benefit from this economic progression. Professional management and passive strategy: Despite being a passive investment, a mutual fund tracking the nifty financial services index is still managed by professional fund managers. These experts ensure that the fund's portfolio mirrors the index as closely as possible, thereby aiming to minimise tracking error and maintain the fund's performance in line with the index. Liquidity : Mutual funds offer the advantage of liquidity, allowing investors to buy or sell their fund units with relative ease. This liquidity, combined with the typically lower volatility of index funds, makes them an attractive option for investors who value flexibility and stability. In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether one should invest in the financial sector by picking stocks individually or an index mutual fund tracking the nifty financial services index. However, if you are an individual engaged in full-time employment investing in an index mutual fund tracking the nifty financial services Index can help you in saving time which you will require for market research in case of investing in stock on your own. Furthermore, investing in an index fund also frees you from: (a) Day to day tracking of the stock market. (b) Increasing or decreasing your allocation according to market conditions. (c) Doing research in relation to stock selection, etc. One should take into account his/her bandwidth and expertise before choosing either of the two options and then decide accordingly. Disclaimer: Investing in mutual funds involves risks, including potential loss of principal. Please consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

View Market Dashboard Financial sector cybersecurity at the helm of investor protection The aggregation of personal and financial data through fintech platforms presents an attractive target for hackers, leading to concerns over data privacy and security. C.S. Mohapatra Published 6 Apr 2024, 05:08 PM IST Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities to access or corrupt sensitive data, posing significant risks to consumer trust and financial stability. The digitalized payment landscape, while making transactions more efficient and cost-effective, has unintendedly heightened the risk of cyber frauds and personal data misuse. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in the system, engaging in phishing attacks, exploiting software flaws, or deceiving users into revealing sensitive information. The aggregation of personal and financial data through fintech platforms presents an attractive target for hackers, leading to concerns over data privacy and security. Hacktivism, that combines "hacking" and "activism" to use hacking skills for promoting specified objectives, presents multifaceted challenges to India's financial sector, notably through operational disruptions from denial-of-service attacks and website defacement, exposing data security vulnerabilities that could be exploited for cybercrime. These activities pose regulatory and compliance risks besides inflicting reputational damage, undermining customer trust and potentially leading to financial losses.

These enables different software applications to communicate with each other, playing a crucial role in the functionality of the digital experiences of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, eCommerce platforms, YouTube, ChatGPT, etc. The increasing reliance on APIs, however, has escalated the risk of cyber threats, highlighting the critical need for advanced security measures, including the financial sector. APIs are the unsung heroes of the digital age, enabling the rapid exchange of data and functionality across diverse platforms. In the financial sector, APIs have been instrumental in driving mobile commerce and the Internet of Things (IoT), with Akamai estimating that APIs drive roughly 83% of internet traffic. The financial sector, a vital component of national infrastructure, has witnessed a surge in API-related cyberattacks. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities to access or corrupt sensitive data, posing significant risks to consumer trust and financial stability. This widespread adoption underscores the urgency for robust API security mechanisms to safeguard sensitive financial data and consumer privacy. A proactive and well-coordinated cybersecurity posture, with an emphasis on resilience and collaboration with national cybersecurity bodies like CERT-In and specific financial sector organization, i.e., CSIRT-FIN to safeguard against the evolving threat landscape posed by hacktivism is thus essential. CSIRT-Fin and CERT-In have been instrumental in protecting India's financial sector through vigilant monitoring, advisories, and collaboration, yet the dynamic nature of cyber threats demands ongoing enhancements to their efforts. Besides, financial service providers and regulators have to allocate significant resources towards enhancing cybersecurity defences, including adopting advanced threat detection technologies, comprehensive employee training, and developing robust incident response strategies. AI: A Game-Changer in API Security Conventional security measures, while necessary, are increasingly insufficient against sophisticated cyber threats that target the business logic of APIs. AI-based security systems are a game-changer, as they are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and detect anomalies that deviate from normal behavior and allows for the early detection of potential threats, including those that traditional security measures are likely to overlook. Government, regulatory authorities, and financial service providers, including fintech companies alike are collectively seized with a significant shift towards prioritizing cybersecurity initiatives for investor protection, marking a departure from conventional challenges to embrace a new paradigm where digital security is at the forefront of strategic planning. With cybersecurity steering the course of investor protection, these initiatives will underscore the commitment to shield investors' interests and assets in an increasingly digital financial realm. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 is all set to bolster consumer protection in the financial sector against malicious threats by enforcing strict data privacy regulations, including explicit consent for data collection, data minimization, and stringent security measures to safeguard personal data. It mandates timely breach notifications, ensuring consumers can act swiftly to secure their information. Also Read: Mint Explainer: Concerns around Digital Personal Data Protection law The DPDP Act aims to create a more secure and privacy-conscious digital financial ecosystem, significantly reducing the risk of cyberattacks and data misuse. In addition, the adoption of AI and ML technologies offers a promising path forward as these technologies provide dynamic, intelligent systems capable of real-time monitoring and threat detection, ensuring that API security evolves in tandem with emerging threats. Way Forward It's crucial for organizations to integrate advanced technologies like AI for real-time critical threat detection, foster stronger public-private partnerships to leverage private sector expertise, and conduct more frequent cybersecurity drills to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Secondly, expanding awareness and training programmes can empower both organizations and consumers to navigate the digital landscape safely. Thirdly, modernizing the regulatory framework by financial sector regulators to reflect the latest cyber threats and ensuring compliance across the sector is the need of the hour. Additionally, strengthening domestic as also international collaboration for sharing threat intelligence and best practices can provide a preemptive edge against globally coordinated attacks. By adopting these strategies, we can significantly improve the resilience of India's financial sector against evolving cyber risks. Thus, the future of financial security lies in leveraging AI to develop adaptive, intelligent systems that can anticipate and neutralize cyber threats. Updating the curriculum, more digital literacy awareness programmes, case-study based learning, addressing different target groups by class-oriented module structure can help address cybersecurity issues. The National Strategy for Financial Education (NSFE) needs to be revamped to orient towards handling the modern issues and complexities of financial world. As digital financial services continue to underpin the fabric of financial sector today, ensuring their security against cyber threats has never been more important. Hence, there is an urgency of adopting AI-driven security measures by which the financial sector can navigate the complex cyber threat landscape with confidence, ensuring the integrity and resilience of its digital ecosystems, while simultaneously facilitating a robust and stable growth of the financial sector.

ANI Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday called upon financial entities like the NBFCs, banks to be mindful of the fact that they are dealing with public money. "Let me emphasise that banks, NBFCs and other financial entities must continue to give the highest priority to quality of governance and adherence to regulatory guidelines," Das said. "Financial sector players, by and large, operate with public money – be it of depositors in banks and select NBFCs or investors in bonds and other financial instruments. They should always be mindful of this," Das added. The RBI has kept a keen eye on evolving risks in the financial sector to mitigate few risks. Recently, the RBI acted stringently against fintech icon Paytm's banking arm Paytm Payments Bank for due to non-compliance and supervisory concerns. Reports say certain accounts were created without proper identification, potentially for money laundering. RBI also acted against IIFL Finance Ltd and JM Financial Products Ltd , asking them to cease and desist from disbursing gold loans and loans against shares, respectively. Live Events In December 2020, the RBI suspended HDFC Bank from sourcing new credit card customers after repeated technological outages. Rating agency S&P Global Ratings said in a report that the central bank is showing serious commitment to improving governance and transparency in the sector. These actions by the RBI, it said, will curtail lenders' over-exuberance, enhance compliance culture, and safeguard customers. However, these measures will lead to higher capital costs for institutions. "India's regulator has underscored its commitment to strengthening the financial sector," said S&P Global credit analyst Geeta Chugh. "But the increased regulatory risk could impede growth and raise the cost of capital for financial institutions." According to S&P, the RBI has diminishing tolerance for non-compliance, customer complaints, data privacy, governance, know-your-customer (KYC), and anti-money laundering issues.

He said coordinating RBI’s monetary policy with govt’s fiscal policy has helped the economy. The governor’s comments come as the central bank has taken a series of measures to curb lending in digital and unsecured loans, and barred some finance companies from certain lending activity — a change from its earlier practice of merely imposing a penalty. In his speech at an event to commemorate RBI’s 90th anniversary, Das highlighted the central bank’s evolution from a resource allocator during the planning era to a full-service central bank in a market economy. He said that the “well-calibrated and coordinated monetary and fiscal policies between RBI and central govt have shielded the economy from the twin shocks of the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical hostilities”. “It is a matter of satisfaction that today our GDP growth is robust, inflation is moderating, financial sector is stable, the external sector remains resilient, and the forex reserves are at an all-time high,” Das added. “It has been our endeavour to promote a financial sector that is robust, resilient and future-ready. The path-breaking structural reforms, such as the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the adoption of flexible inflation targeting in recent years, have helped us deal more effectively with the challenges in the banking system...,” said Das.
