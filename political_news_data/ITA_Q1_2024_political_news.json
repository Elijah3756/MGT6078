    "article_text": "Leg armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 typically gives a good balance of stats, including all three Defense stats, Knockdown resist, Magick Defense, and both Elemental and Debilitation resist. Leg armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 is often transferable between Vocations, but because of the unique resistances and effects of the best early Leg armor DD2 players can get, some are more useful than others for specific Vocations .

Posts By Nahda Nabiilah Mar 28, 2024 This guide to the best Dragon's Dogma 2 Leg armor early-game players can get does not include recommendations for the Mystic Spearhand , Magick Archer, Trickster, or Warfarer Vocations. These Vocations are unlocked later in the game and don't have much early-game Leg armor to take advantage of. The Thief, Archer, Mage, and Fighter Vocations are all available from the start, while Warrior and Sorcerer can be unlocked soon after reaching Vermund. Best Early Fighter Leg Armor: Lionel Hosen Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 47 N / A N / A 15 11 +5% Lightning +2% Sleep 1.81 Fighters benefit a lot from having gear that gives good balanced stats, and the Lionel Hosen gives resistance to Lightning, Sleep, and decent Magickal and normal defenses. It doesn't have the most in any one stat, but its not bad across the board and will easily carry you into the mid and later game (as long as you remember to upgrade it). To get the Lionel Hosen , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must complete the Nameless Village quests , then purchase it from the Nameless Apothecary for 7,200g. To get to the Nameless Village, either take an Oxcart to Melve and head far to the southeast to the edge of the map, or travel east from Vernmouth on foot. Best Early Mage Leg Armor: Savant's Boots Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 24 N / A N / A 32 8 N / A +2% Sleep, +5% Silenced 1.16 The Savant's boots are very useful for Mages because they are an early source of Silence resist gear. It can be acquired as soon as you get to the capital city of Vermund, Vernworth, and is a very light piece of equipment. It has decent defenses, and very good Magick Defense, though it's not going to do much to prevent a Mage from being knocked down.

Posts By Waseem Muhammad Mar 26, 2024 To get the Savant's Boots , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Bjorn's Armory, in Vernworth, for 6,770g. Bjorn's Armory is located in the central square of Vernworth, just to the right of the stairs that lead to the Pawn Guild. Best Early Archer Leg Armor: Hillfolk Breeches Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 50 N / A N / A 20 15 +2% Fire, +1% Ice +4% Fire, +2% Frostbite, +4% Sleep 2.21 Archers benefit from gear that provides resistances to effects typically applied at a range, but of all the best starting Leg armor pieces in Dragon's Dogma 2 , the Hillfolk Breeches offer the Vocation the most benefit. It has a base 50 Defense, 20 Magick Defense, and a not-too-shabby 15 Knockdown resistance. It also offers a huge suite of resistances, but its 2.21 Weight quite literally weighs down its usefulness in the later game for Archers . To get the Hillfolk Breeches , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Celeste's Smithy, in the Checkpoint Rest Town, for 9,200g. To get here, take the Oxcart on the western side of Vernworth, or follow the main road leading west from the city. Best Early Thief Leg Armor: Thief's Gaiters Defense Slash Defense Strike Defense Magick Defense Knockdown Resist Elemental Resist Debilitation Resist Weight 50 N / A N / A 10 8 N / A +8% Blighted, +2% Silenced, +2% Sleep 1.3 The Thief's Gaiters are the best Thief Leg armor piece for one important reason. Not very many pieces of armor in Dragon's Dogma 2 offer a unique, piece-specific bonus. But the Thief's Gaiters do – while equipped, the wearer's movements are completely silenced. Though the game's Stealth missions are far from difficult, this almost completely negates the need to sneak behind Guards. It can make these missions much faster, and it offers decent defensive stats, too.

This extremely high-Defense and high-Knockdown Resist leg equipment will set a Warrior up for success while leveling the Vocation , and are decent enough to not warrant a replacement until much later in the game. To get the Dauntless Greaves , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Celeste's Smithy, in the Checkpoint Rest Town, for 16,800g. To get here, take the Oxcart on the western side of Vernworth, or follow the main road leading west from the city.

Though the Nightfall Greaves make it easier for the Arisen to be lulled to sleep, it grants a huge bonus to Silence and Fire resistances. It also offers a huge 70 base Defense, a rarity among typical Sorcerer gear, and its 10% Silenced resistance is really just the icing on top. To get the Nightfall Greaves , Dragon's Dogma 2 players must purchase it from Grisha's Armory, in the Sacred Arbor, for 15,800g. To get here, head north from Vernmouth via the western exit until you reach Trevo Mine. Continue to head north through the woodlands until you reach the Sacred Arbor.

(WJBF) – Fort Eisenhower helped military spouses find jobs on Thursday. “I’ve been a military spouse for about fifteen years,” said Jessica Zieran. “As you know, there’s a lot of relocation, a lot of instability, and things that are unpredictable. One of the things I think that’s so great about having an event like this, is that there’s an opportunity to not just find out about positions, but also to network.” Hiring Our Heroes is a U.S Chamber of Commerce Foundation program that connects the military community with American businesses. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Program and Fort Eisenhower leaders held a hiring event at the installation Thursday for military spouses, and anyone else who was looking to find a job. “It’s fantastic,” said Col. Reginald Evans, the Garrison Commander at Fort Eisenhower. “We had thirty employers and we had well over one-hundred registered job seekers here today. We exceeded what we did last year by over twenty-five.” There were local and national employers there – like the Columbia County School District, Wells Fargo, Boeing, Penske, Goodwill, and more. Military spouses are an important workforce that they’re hoping to tap into. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The HOH said more than half a million veterans and military spouses have found careers through its programs. “Military spouses are some of the most talented candidates that we’ve seen,” said Alayna Robbins, the Senior Program Manager at the event for Hiring Our Heroes. “Not only that, but they are so resilient.” It’s hard for a military spouse to plant roots in their careers. Those at the hiring event said this makes it easier. “What’s super beautiful is its the military’s way of acknowledging the hard work of military spouses,” said Nomi Stanton. “How they are valued, and cherished, and loved, and legitimately part of their soldier’s success story.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WJBF.

    "article_text": "At a time when threats to the U.S. from around the world are growing by the day, the biggest one may be from within. The U.S. military continues to face recruitment struggles, plunging public confidence , and a loss of morale by those currently serving. The latest survey of military families paints a stark picture, revealing only 32% of military families say they would now recommend military service. That number is down from 55% in 2016. The biggest issues listed among active duty military members are pay, poor housing options, and lack of childcare or education options for children. The reasons behind this decline in military morale are varied, but experts agree it is a serious issue that threatens our national security every day it is allowed to get worse. \"This is a multi-generational, bipartisan problem,\" says Johnny \"Joey\" Jones, retired Marine bomb tech, in a recent military roundtable discussion on Fox News . \"If you ask me, it goes back to a country that is so spoiled, that it has rested on its laurels.\" Jones also notes that there's a reason the Marines were the only major service branch to still hit their recruiting goals last year. \"(The head of the Marine Corps) told Congress the Marine Corps exists to fight and win our nation's battles, with the same fierce, competitive spirit to win no matter the challenge...that is the mentality that will bring men and women to the military,\" he says. \"They need to feel challenged.\" Others agree that our military and civilian leadership has lost sight of what the military is supposed to be about. \"Instead of focusing on lethality, and making sure that we have the mightiest military on the face of the planet, we have an administration that is entirely focused on ideology,\" says Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), who is also a military veteran. Former Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland believes our current leaders would be wise to follow the strategy used by her one-time boss, President Ronald Reagan, who rebuilt the military after a decade of plunging morale following the Vietnam War. \"He increased their pay, he increased defense spending in all the major areas, he had technology advancements,\" she says. \"But most of all, he made people really proud to wear the uniform again.\""

Kyle Jia/U.S. Marine Corps photo) Military.com | By Joanna Guldin Published March 26, 2024 It's a huge understatement to say that military life is a unique experience. From complicated acronyms to on-base living, dealing with Tricare to transitioning out, many facets of military life can be completely baffling to outsiders. It's not that civilians don't try to understand. It's just that for many folks, military life is something that happens \"elsewhere\" -- and that \"elsewhere\" is usually on their TV, through the news, movies or series. Often, those representations of military families, service members and military life aren't accurate and can even verge on reductive. Military families want their civilian neighbors to have an authentic picture of their experiences. Research shows that community connectedness across service and civilian lines makes life better for everyone and improves mission readiness. That's why we want to set the record straight.

    "article_text": "Business Aerospace & Defense The Big Disconnect: Defense R&D And Warfighter Capabilities By Michael Brown , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Michael Brown is a Partner at venture capital firm Shield Capital. Follow Author Mar 26, 2024, 11:53am EDT Share Save Comment ARLINGTON, VA - JANUARY 22: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel answers questions during a press briefing at the Pentagon January 22, 2015 in Arlington, Virginia. The press briefing was believed to be one of Hagel's last before he departs his role as Secretary of Defense. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Getty Images A decade ago, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel launched the Defense Innovation Initiative declaring we must “sustain and advance our military superiority for the 21st Century…American dominance…is eroding, and we must…sustain and…expand our advantages even…with more limited resources.” Those words ring even truer today, yet as the Defense Department spends a record level on R&D, these efforts are not formally connected to the requirements or acquisition processes at the Pentagon. These two worlds of R&D and acquisition operate separately. In the language of the Defense Department, technology development or R&D needs to transfer to acquisition or production to get to our warfighters. Innovation Initiatives Proliferate Defense innovation has a strong tradition most visibly from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (created in 1958 as a response to Sputnik). Notably, according to the General Accounting Office, technology transfer is not a primary objective of DARPA. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter created four new innovation entities with the objective of increasing technology transfer: the Defense Innovation Unit (which I led 2018-2022) to accelerate the adoption of commercial solutions, the Strategic Capabilities Office to use military systems in ways the world has never seen and doesn't know how to counter, the Defense Digital Service, and the Defense Innovation Board. In 2018, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis created Army Futures Command and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. Along the way, AFWERX, NavalX, and Army Applications Lab began to leverage the $1 billion spent each year through Small Business Innovation Research grants. Also in that year, the Pentagon reorganized to increase R&D focus led by a new Undersecretary and another innovation program followed a few years later, the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve . Defense R&D Spending Reaches Record MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Unfortunately, with each new innovation organization and increase in R&D spending, there is no accompanying architecture of how these technologies, commercial solutions or research projects transition to ongoing production or what the military calls programs of record. Programs of record have a management structure, usually a program executive office, which houses the engineers, acquisition staff, test plan, sustainment strategy and budget to field a new capability. The current R&D budget is a record $130 billion (15% of total defense spending) but the research is not explicitly mapped to programs of record which means a high degree of uncertainty as to whether the successful efforts get into warfighters’ hands. The Big Disconnect While many research efforts need time to mature, a closer connection from the many R&D programs to capabilities the Defense Department wants to acquire would be a lot more efficient. In fact, with renewed great power competition, speed in the transition or transfer of R&D to new capabilities is a critical competitive dimension. While traditional defense primes are adept at navigating the Department to channel R&D efforts to programs of record they will likely be awarded, companies outside this ecosystem have difficulty in understanding how warfighters in the field, those that write requirements for new defense systems, contracting staff, and acquisition budgets can be in four separate organizations. This is one reason why just six defense primes are awarded 2/3 of all Pentagon procurement spend. Further, many new capabilities find their way into the budget from outside the Defense Department through Congress. As I saw first-hand, lobbyists and companies influence members of Congress to add defense appropriations targeted at specific capabilities and vendors. While this may serve individual Congressional districts, earmarking appropriations in this way does not optimize for defense priorities or warfighter needs. Acquisition Driven By Requirements and Budget—Not R&D ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - JULY 21: U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a news briefing at the Pentagon July 21, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley held a news briefing to discuss various topics including the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Getty Images Inexplicably, the defense acquisition system is driven by a separate requirements process to specify what the military needs—which may be informed by research but is without a mechanism to do so. A defined and agreed upon requirement is the starting point for any defense acquisition program—not research in the labs nor a commercial capability already available like small drones or satellite imagery despite Congress requiring the Defense Department to assess commercial capability first. Regardless, the disconnect between research programs and the acquisition system is one of the reasons for the valley of death for non-traditional suppliers: vendors successfully performing on R&D or prototype contracts may be waiting years before there is a requirement written, appropriation request made to Congress and acquisition resources assigned to write a production contract. What private investors see is aspiring suppliers who successfully competed for R&D dollars, like SBIR grants, often with no idea how to transition research wins to ongoing production contracts. From an investor perspective, a research award is interesting but means little without a transition to ongoing revenue. Only when the research informs a requirement and Congress appropriates budget to an acquisition organization—like Army Materiel Command—is a path set for production revenue to a vendor that scales capability for warfighters. The Way Forward: Planned Transitions to Military Customer and Budget Given the proliferated number of defense organizations spending an all-time high level of R&D dollars, mapping the most promising, highest impact and most mature research capabilities to the acquisition system is a long overdue reform. Either the Defense Department or Congress should require transition plans for successful research. Since research without a transition plan to production confines the research to a lab, research projects of any size should be explicitly mapped to a military need and a customer willing to identify budget dollars to acquire the capability. Since research outcomes are uncertain there will not be a one-to-one correlation of research to acquisition, but a system that does not even prioritize this connection is doomed to both waste money and frustrate vendors. We must ensure our record investment in research is connected explicitly to an acquisition system that fields capabilities for our warfighters. American military superiority is eroding fast and speeding research to new capabilities depends on successful transitions to acquisition programs.

    "article_text": "Report Missile Defense Keeping Missile Defense at the Heart of Defense Transformation May 7, 2003 3 min read Download Report Baker Spring Former Kirby Research Fellow in National Security Policy Baker is a former Kirby Research Fellow in National Security Policy Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Congress should accept the Bush Administration's proposals for changing the way that the Missile Defense Agency budgets for ballistic missile defense programs. Congress can best advance these proposals by incorporating them into the annual defense authorization legislation, which the House and Senate Armed Services Committees will begin drafting this week. On April 10, the Bush Administration, anticipating the pending legislative action, sent Congress a comprehensive legislative proposal to transform management of the Department of Defense. Entitled the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act, it incorporates the Administration's proposals for reforming management of the missile defense program. Fielding an effective global missile defense system is a pressing need because ballistic missile defense programs are lagging behind the emerging missile threat. In the past, U.S. participation in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty severely restricted ballistic missile defense programs. Last year, however, President Bush took the bold step of withdrawing the U.S. from the ABM Treaty. In order to capitalize on this important step, however, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) needs a flexible system for managing what in reality is a complex set of systems and not an individual weapon. The missile defense provisions that the Bush Administration has included in the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act are a critical step in putting such a flexible management system in place. The Problems with the Current Funding System The current system funds largely research and development programs in the field of ballistic missile defense and breaks these programs into individual line items or Program Elements. This balkanization of the missile defense budget both defies logic and impedes progress. The current budgeting system for missile defense treats each individual Program Element as an independent item, as if it were unrelated to the other Program Elements in the budget. The Bush Administration's missile defense program, for good reason, is not a series of stand-alone systems. It is an intricate constellation of systems in which each element is integrated with its companion elements. If the MDA decides to make a change to one element of the overall system, it almost certainly affects the design of other elements. Given the complex requirements for integrating the various Program Elements, the Missile Defense Agency needs the flexibility to shift funds between the existing accounts. The current budgeting system for missile defense, however, precludes efficiently shifting funds among accounts. To move funds, the MDA must obtain congressional approval for a \"reprogramming request\" or in some instances even request legislative changes. Reprogramming is a cumbersome process that can take two or more months. With more time lost, the U.S. missile defense program runs the risk of falling further behind the threat. For example, the Sea-Based Midcourse element moved forward as a result of two successful intercept tests. Therefore, the Missile Defense Agency wanted to accelerate the program by funding long-lead development efforts, explore new technologies, and ultimately provide an initial defense capability. Ultimately, the Missile Defense Agency decided not to take these steps because the time required for obtaining a reprogramming request from Congress convinced MDA that the request was not worth submitting. The process of obtaining legislative changes is even more cumbersome. Yet, constructing ballistic missile defense testing facilities in Alaska required such a legislative change. Two Solutions to the Current Funding Problem The Bush Administration is proposing two solutions to the problem of the balkanized missile defense budget. The first solution is to consolidate all the existing Program Elements in the missile defense budget into a single Program Element. The new consolidated Program Element would be called the Ballistic Missile Defense System. This step would significantly reduce the time required to reallocate funds within the missile defense program and improve the ability of the Missile Defense Agency to field an initial missile defense program for the protection of the U.S., its allies, and U.S. forces deployed abroad against ballistic missile attack. The second solution is to allow the Department of Defense to expend funds for the missile defense program through a single appropriation for the Missile Defense Agency. This will serve to reduce the need for the MDA to request legislative changes, as well as submit reprogramming requests. Conclusion The growing threat to the United States, its allies, and U.S. forces deployed abroad will not wait for the Department of Defense to navigate its existing inefficient budget practices and eventually field a missile defense system. Today, the territory of the United States is completely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. Every day of delay that results from this inefficient and slow budgeting process is another day the American people remain vulnerable. There is a better way. The Bush Administration has presented a solid proposal to reform the budgeting system for missile defense. Congress, as a result, can take a major step forward in accelerating the ballistic missile defense program by incorporating the Bush Administration's proposals into the annual defense authorization bill.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America . While final figures for 2023 are still awaited, global military expenditure reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). $961 billion of the total amount was incurred in the Americas, 94% of which was contributed by the United States and Canada. In Latin America – the region comprising parts of North, South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean Islands where Romance languages are predominantly spoken – defense expenditure was measured at $57.2 billion in 2022, at a modest increase of 0.8% compared to 2021. Brazil had the largest share of this expenditure, with over $20 billion spent on military expenses in 2022. The country has been leveraging its economic strength for quite some time now to upgrade its military. In 2014, Brasilia placed an order for 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden to enhance its aerial capabilities, for a deal valued at $5.04 billion. Four more jets were added to the contract in 2022. Six of these fighters have been received so far from Sweden, with the remaining set for delivery by 2027. A year earlier, the Brazilian Air Force provided a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT )’s subsidiary, Sikorsky, to provide logistics support for Brazil’s 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters for a period of four years. Argentina has also been investing heavily to strengthen its military. In June last year, the country ordered six Bell 407GXi helicopters from Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT ) to perform in critical search and rescue operations in the country’s mountainous terrains. Later in October, the United States approved the transfer of 24 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets from Denmark to Argentina. According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, these jets will be equipped with air-to-air missiles and paid for with a $40 million financing package. The approval by Washington to provide Argentina with the F-16s is being seen by analysts as a move to counter Chinese influence in South America. Buenos Aires has been restricted from procuring western military hardware since the Falklands War with the UK in 1982. The Argentines had initially been considering replacing their Dassault Mirage III fighters, which retired back in 2015, with the JF-17 – a joint production of China and Pakistan. Story Continues In a similar manner, Colombia has been offered by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to upgrade and modernize its fleet of fighter jets with the F-16s to counter competing offers made by France’s Dassault Aviation and Swedish company Saab AB. The offer is reportedly backed by officials in Washington. Colombia is the fourth largest spender on defense in Latin America, having incurred over $9.9 billion on defense expenditure in 2022. The South American nation, in separate proposals, has also been offered to buy AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons from RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) for $225 million, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) for $177 million. 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America Methodology We have considered various metrics to rank the most powerful militaries in Latin America . These include the size of their economy measured in terms of nominal GDP, countries’ defense spending, technological capabilities, number of active military personnel, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, military aircraft fleet, and total naval assets.

Argentina has also been investing heavily to strengthen its military. In June last year, the country ordered six Bell 407GXi helicopters from Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT ) to perform in critical search and rescue operations in the country’s mountainous terrains. Later in October, the United States approved the transfer of 24 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighter jets from Denmark to Argentina. According to Argentine newspaper La Nacion, these jets will be equipped with air-to-air missiles and paid for with a $40 million financing package. The approval by Washington to provide Argentina with the F-16s is being seen by analysts as a move to counter Chinese influence in South America. Buenos Aires has been restricted from procuring western military hardware since the Falklands War with the UK in 1982. The Argentines had initially been considering replacing their Dassault Mirage III fighters, which retired back in 2015, with the JF-17 – a joint production of China and Pakistan. Story Continues In a similar manner, Colombia has been offered by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to upgrade and modernize its fleet of fighter jets with the F-16s to counter competing offers made by France’s Dassault Aviation and Swedish company Saab AB. The offer is reportedly backed by officials in Washington. Colombia is the fourth largest spender on defense in Latin America, having incurred over $9.9 billion on defense expenditure in 2022. The South American nation, in separate proposals, has also been offered to buy AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons from RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) for $225 million, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) for $177 million. 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Latin America Methodology We have considered various metrics to rank the most powerful militaries in Latin America .

Image Courtesy: Reuters What facet of the military’s participation in the nation’s political apparatus contributes to its operational dysfunction? Alternatively, what constituent of the military’s involvement propels society towards the precipice of civil conflict? From a subjective standpoint, the military’s influence on decision-making processes, notably in formulating foreign and internal security policies, does not inherently manifest as problematic. Given its precarious geopolitical surroundings, the contextualisation of Pakistan as a security state from its inception underscores the historical roots of such a paradigm. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The 1990s witnessed the ascendancy of a military-oriented perspective, accentuating assumed internal threats to the nation’s survival. This perspective gained further traction in the aftermath of the post-9/11 security paradigm. More from Opinion Sergio Gor’s senate hearing signals the future of Indo-American ties How Trump’s ‘War on Drugs’ buildup against Venezuela has a hidden agenda The substantial role assumed by the military in shaping foreign and security policies finds its justification in these historical antecedents. Critics of the military’s pervasive role in these processes must proffer pragmatic alternatives, implying the establishment of alternative institutional frameworks to curtail the involvement of military bureaucracy. However, complications arise when the military bureaucracy exploits international linkages forged during policy formulation to consolidate its influence within the country’s power structures. In the post-Musharraf epoch, military leadership assumed the mantle of de facto diplomats for Pakistan. The internal security landscape emerged as the preeminent foreign policy concern for successive governments in Islamabad, prompting foreign leaders, including foreign ministers and heads of state from Western and Muslim nations, to seek consultations primarily with the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Impact Shorts More Shorts How army remains Pakistan’s biggest business house 60 years on, why 1965 India–Pakistan war still matters The high-profile international visits undertaken by the Army chief were extensively publicised in domestic and international media during this time. This heightened visibility finds rationale in the geopolitical reality that Pakistan and its adjacent Afghanistan were focal points in global terrorist networks, hosting the headquarters of major international terror organisations. A historical context is pertinent, wherein the nexus between the Pak-Afghan border areas and mainland Afghanistan was implicated in major terrorist incidents worldwide. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In such scenarios, the discernment of a foreign leader is of manageable complexity; the point of contact for addressing such difficulties is perceived to be the Army chief rather than the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The irony is underscored by the conspicuous absence of institutional capacity within the prime minister or the civilian government to formulate policies germane to these concerns. Despite the technical attribution of military capacity within the ambit of the prime minister’s executive powers, the unequivocal proclamations of the military’s media wing regarding its intent to support civil governments on diverse policy matters substantiate the de facto institutional autonomy exercised by the army. This nuanced interplay unfolds within Islamabad’s structured and disciplined bureaucratic milieu, characterised by an absence of tumult or disorder. The constitutional powers of the prime minister are willingly ceded, facilitating the encroachment of the Chief of Army Staff and the military bureaucracy, particularly in scenarios where civilian governments lack the independent capacity for policy formulation and execution. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD However, it is essential to note that this singular dynamic does not make Pakistan’s political system dysfunctional. Comparable instances of military leadership involvement in the formulation and execution of foreign and security policies are observable in other nations. The difficulty associated with the military’s engagement in Pakistan lies primarily in its role as a partisan actor in the nation’s internal political contentions. This predicament is further underscored by the extensive historical record depicting the Pakistani military’s involvement as a participant in ideological, religious, sectarian, and political conflicts. The epoch of General Zia-ul-Haq’s military regime stands out as a significant period wherein the military was ostensibly positioned as the guardian of the state’s ideological frontiers. During this tenure, the military administration actively contributed to the cultivation and reinforcement of profound religious and sectarian divisions within society through legislative measures, persisting as unresolved issues within the broader Pakistani political landscape. Since its inception, Pakistan has manifested itself as an ideologically diverse society, accommodating various political, religious, sectarian, and ideological factions, a characteristic dating back to British colonial rule. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD However, the Zia-led military sought to impose an ideological homogeneity on Pakistani society, endeavouring to enforce a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam at both the social and political strata. Consequently, the military, under Zia’s leadership, assumed a partisan role in ideological, sectarian, and religious conflicts, aligning itself with advocates promoting specific interpretations of Islam, distinct ideological perspectives, and particular sectarian worldviews. This multifaceted involvement raises intricate questions surrounding the military’s role and its impact on the socio-political fabric of Pakistan. In the post-Zia period, a specific cadre of politicians, sectarian leaders, and ideologues emerged within Pakistani society, leveraging the military’s partisan engagement in political, sectarian, and ideological spheres. Following General Zia-ul-Haq’s demise in an air crash, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) under Benazir Bhutto ascended to power after parliamentary elections. The PPP, subjected to the military’s repressive measures during Zia’s era, was perceived as a potential threat by the incumbent military leadership. Consequently, the military aligned itself with the right-leaning coalition led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, participating in a political conflict against the left-leaning PPP. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD This trajectory was characterised by non-linearity; as the PPP normalised its relations with the military leadership, the latter shifted its focus towards the sitting leader, Nawaz Sharif. Subsequently, the military’s entrenched partisan role became customary, transforming into an autonomous actor within the political landscape. By the conclusion of General Musharraf’s military government, the military had assumed a permanent partisan role in the political arena, intermittently aligning with various political players—a trend facilitated by the emergence of figures such as Imran Khan openly advocating for the military’s partisan involvement in politics. Imran Khan actively implored military leaders to support his anti-corruption initiatives against political adversaries, particularly during the concluding phases of his governance. Some journalists in Pakistan asserted that the military possessed files detailing the corruption of the Sharif family, with military intelligence officials reportedly confirming and sharing these files. Imran Khan overtly appealed to the military to relinquish their proclaimed neutrality in the no-confidence motion against his government, emphasising the imperative for collaborative efforts against his political opponents. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Imran Khan’s public proclamations elucidated his intention to instrumentalise the military in his anti-corruption campaign against political rivals. Conversely, Nawaz Sharif, while not overtly advocating for the military’s partisan role, strategically appears to derive benefits from its involvement in the country’s political milieu. The imperative for the Pakistani military lies in its transformation into an institution characterised by unwavering non-partisanship. This principle should be theoretical and rigorously practiced across political, social, ideological, and religious spheres. It is paramount for military leaders to comprehend the intricate societal tapestry they are mandated to safeguard, acknowledging its diversity in political affiliations, social structures, ideological orientations, sectarian diversities, and religious beliefs. Persistent partisanship directed against specific segments of society would undermine the fundamental rationale and legitimacy underlying the military’s existence and operational integrity. In such a milieu, confrontations with influential political leaders and groups could be imprudent and detrimental to the institution’s objectives. The post-Musharraf era witnessed an initial manifestation of military leaders adopting a partisan stance against Nawaz Sharif, thereby precipitating a state of confrontation between the military leadership and prevalent political entities. Presently, the military finds itself entangled in a subsequent confrontation with Imran Khan, the favourite of the masses. This recurring pattern presents a pronounced peril, with the potential to escalate into a substantial catastrophe, ultimately leading to turmoil within the military and the potential for civil conflict. So far, Pakistan has undergone a transformation wherein various facets of the state are under military control, making it challenging to maintain the essence of democracy. Unfortunately, those very people who had the onerous responsibility to safeguard it and make it people-centric have sabotaged democracy. Surprisingly, the world leaders have maintained silence, though the media has not. The author is the chairman of Law and Society Alliance, a New Delhi-based think tank.

    "article_text": "15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World Rabeeta Abbas February 10, 2024 9 min read ^GSPC GD LMT BA In this article, we list and discuss the 15 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Reserve Military Manpower in the World . According to the World Bank ’s report, a total amount of $2.21 trillion was spent on military expenses worldwide in 2022. However, this comes as no surprise as countries tend to spend a significant portion of their GDP on their military to strengthen defenses and stay competitive in the world, every year. At the same time, there are also some countries with no army, navy, or air force (See: 15 Countries that have no Army, Navy, or Air Force ) but continue to thrive, thanks to the agreements they have with strong countries like the US, France, and Australia to protect them against attacks of any sort. Note that the US, France, and Australia are considered “strong countries” because they have strong economies and powerful militaries (See: 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023 ) to serve and protect the citizens. As of 2024 , the United States is the strongest military in the world, followed by China, Russia and India. But are they also the strongest when it comes to reserve military manpower? Reserve military are soldiers who have serve some years in the military and then join the Army Reserves or National Guard. Reservists get military perks as they are part of the military without devoting themselves full-time to the military. Military benefits from reserve manpower in times of emergencies as they can call reservists anytime to duty when the country is in need. Some countries are facing a decline in their active and reserve manpower despite having a high-end military. For instance, according to Pew Research , 18% of the US population was serving in the military in 1980, but the percentage dropped to 6% in 2022. They've also forecasted that although around 18.3 million veterans in the US, the numbers will decline to 12.1 million in the next 25 years — by 2048. The gradual fall in military manpower is an area of concern for the United States. But still, for now, it is the number one miliary in the world. Military Spending and the Arms and Ammunition Industry In 2022, the US spent $877 billion on its military, which was 3.5% of its total GDP. Military spending by governments surges during wars and conflicts, and companies that manufacture and supply arms and ammunition achieve the most profitable outcomes. During the Ukraine-Russia war, the US’s big five defense contractors made huge profits in 2022 from selling weapons to Ukraine. According to Reuters , the big five MIC companies in defense industry, Boeing (NYSE: BA ), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), and RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX ) earned $157.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, an increase from $153.6 billion in fiscal year 2022. Story Continues Moreover, in 2023, the sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose by 16% to a record $238 billion. As the Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing, the defense industry will continue to rise, and the MIC of the United States will continue to make profits. As reported by Global Times , War is \"good for business,\" a recruiter for BlackRock Inc (NYSE: BLK ) told the O'Keefe Media Group. As of February 9, 2024, Australia pledged an additional AUD 400 million to Boeing (NYSE: BA)'s indigenous Ghost Bat autonomous drone program. The government previously signed an AUD 600 million contract with Boeing (NYSE: BA) to sustain and upgrade F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets for the Royal Australian Air Force. Similarly, in December 2023, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, a business unit of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), was awarded a $654.5 million contract by the Army Contracting Command of Newark, NJ for the metal parts program for M1128. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) was selected alongside IMT Defense for this contract, and both companies will be competing for each order of the contract. On the other hand, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), a US weapons manufacturer, signed contracts with some leading Saudi companies at the World Defense Show in Riyadh on 5 February 2024. The company awarded Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) subcontracts to a pair of Saudi Arabian firms, Middle East Propulsion Company (MEPC) and Arabian International Company (AIC), for locally manufacturing parts of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) missile system. As geopolitical changes and conflicts are occurring more often than before, countries heavily depend on their military, including the army, navy, and air force, to defend the country in crucial times.

The new infrastructure coupled with technical support will supercharge Aotearoa's fast-growing aerospace sector and help meet international demand. Domestic and international companies are already testing and trialling leading-edge technologies at Kaitorete, a short 50-minute drive from Otautahi Christchurch CBD and now more crafts and companies can take flight. US-based Wisk Aero recently conducted its world-first airspace integration test flights for an uncrewed aircraft from Kaitorete and Dawn Aerospace and Kea Aerospace will now be able to conduct horizontal space launches and stratospheric flights from the site. The new 1-kilometre runway and planned hangar facilities were funded by a $5.4 million grant from the New Zealand Government's Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, administered by Kanoa. This joins a sealed taxiway and fuel pad, grass runway, vertiport, office facilities and data connections. Tawhaki Board Member David Perenara-O'Connell said mana whenua (indigenous people) of Kaitorete were proud to be at the forefront of supporting the country's aerospace sector and acknowledged their partnership with the New Zealand Government in the Tawhaki Joint Venture. \"To fully enable the sector, supply chains and realise the economic benefits for all New Zealanders, takes a collaborative approach.

The new infrastructure coupled with technical support will super charge Aotearoa's fast-growing aerospace sector and help meet international demand. Domestic and international companies are already testing and trialling leading-edge technologies at Kaitorete, a short 50-minute drive from Otautahi Christchurch CBD and now more crafts and companies can take flight. US-based Wisk Aero recently conducted its world-first airspace integration test flights for an uncrewed aircraft from Kaitorete and Dawn Aerospace and Kea Aerospace will now be able to conduct horizontal space launches and stratospheric flights from the site. The new 1-kilometre runway and planned hangar facilities were funded by a $5.4 million grant from the New Zealand Government's Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, administered by Kanoa. This joins a sealed taxiway and fuel pad, grass runway, vertiport, office facilities and data connections. Tawhaki Board Member David Perenara-O'Connell said mana whenua (indigenous people) of Kaitorete were proud to be at the forefront of supporting the country's aerospace sector and acknowledged their partnership with the New Zealand Government in the Tawhaki Joint Venture. \"To fully enable the sector, supply chains and realise the economic benefits for all New Zealanders, takes a collaborative approach. We're grateful for the support of our government, local authorities, regulators, aerospace partners, research and science communities, and suppliers who share our vision of a world-leading hub for innovation and exploration. \"We believe that this mission is truly unique. The way in which we weave together matauranga Maori (indigenous knowledge) with cutting-edge innovation in aerospace and environmental rejuvenation, marks a new era in sustainable land use.\" Aotearoa is one of the top countries for space launches and aerospace testing and trialling, with an advanced and responsive regulatory environment, sparse population and low air and sea traffic. Kaitorete offers clear skies and access to a wide range of orbits from an expansive, unpopulated, flat strip of land 25km long, nestled between Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere) and the Pacific Ocean. Its proximity to world-class universities, international air and seaports and advanced manufacturing capabilities in nearby Otautahi Christchurch is globally unique. Tawhaki Chief Executive Linda Falwasser said the Joint Venture was taking a staged approach to its developments, with the potential to support vertical space launch in future. \"We have one of the world's best locations for aerospace and space launch and we're prioritising critical infrastructure alongside rejuvenation of this special whenua (land). This includes exploring solar power and green hydrogen production and storage on site. \"We have received strong global demand for a site that delivers technically while holding steadfastly to its values of protecting and preserving our people and planet.\" \"Having this key infrastructure so accessible is hugely enabling for the whole sector,\" said Dawn Aerospace Co-Founder James Powell. \"It will be transformative to the development of our rocket-powered aircraft, the Mk-II Aurora.\" Kea Aerospace CEO Mark Rocket said Tawhaki is enabling an exciting future for the region and the country. \"Kaitorete is situated in an ideal location for aerospace research and development and offers Kea Aerospace unique opportunities for flight testing and operations of our solar-powered stratospheric aircraft.\" Video - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2337824/T_whaki_Runway_Video.mp4 Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2337825/Tawhaki_National_Aerospace_Centre_Runway_01.jpg View original content:https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/twhaki-national-aerospace-centre-provides-mission-critical-boost-for-aerospace-sector-302058409.html © 2024 PR Newswire Sie erhalten auf FinanzNachrichten.de kostenlose Realtime-Aktienkurse von und .

An increasing number of \"space fans\" are coming to Wenchang, Hainan Province, the site of China's youngest spaceport, to see the rockets, and the city's space-themed tourism is becoming more and more popular. The 2,100-year-old town in the northeastern part of Hainan Island is becoming \"China's version of Cape Canaveral\". Tourists watch a rocket launch at Qishui Bay, Longlou Town, Wenchang. In recent years, Wenchang has been actively exploring the \"aerospace +\" model to develop tourism. Facilities such as seaside B&Bs and local featured farmhouses have been built in response to the trend, and an aerospace tourism town is now taking shape. When rocket launches and tropical island scenery perfectly combine, the former hometown of overseas Chinese has undergone tremendous changes- transforming into a well-known destination of aerospace coastal tourism in China. Wenchang has attracted many young photographers to \"chase rockets\" whenever there is a launch. In their opinion, this is the closest that ordinary people can get to space. \"No matter how many times I watch a rocket launch, I'm always deeply moved to tears\" said space photographer and sophomore at Northwest Minzu University Tang Muzhi. He added that he hoped his photos would attract more people's attention and love to space. Zhang Zuoxing, also a photography enthusiast, wanted to share this mind-blowing experience to more people and set up \"Walking at 20\", a youth travel organization, after graduating from university in 2020 with his friends. They aim at providing immersive trips and social opportunities for young people. The \"Wenchang Rocket Chasing Tour\" has become the company's best product. Watching rockets in the gentle sea breeze has become a must experience for many tourists in Wenchang. According to Ye Sheng, in charge of Longlou Town, Wencheng, which has a population of only 27,000, it transpires that they have received more than 1.5 million tourists in the past two years because of the aerospace industry. Over 9,000 jobs have been created, and the aerospace tourism industry has achieved an increase in annual income of 15 percent. Local people have benefited greatly as more and more aerospace-themed cultural and tourism activities are being held there. Their door to the outside world has been truly opened, bringing in new knowledge and understandings. \"During important holidays and launches, we are always fully booked.\" said You Zhuo, who runs the Wenchang Ruoyuan Yuanshe B&B. Take an example of the launch of the \"Wentian\" laboratory cabin module in July 2022, this single event brought more than 200,000 tourists to Longlou Town, creating a boom in demand for hotels, B&Bs, restaurants, and other related services. Some hotels even achieved record revenues of more than one million yuan in a single day. B&Bs along the coast of Qishui Bay, Longlou Town, Wenchang, where people can watch a rocket launch on the balcony of their accommodation or on the beach. Photo credit: Guo Cheng, Xinhua News Agency Thanks to the aerospace industry, a very distinctive tourism sector has been developing in full swing, supporting the businesses of local B&Bs, farmhouse stays, leisure fisheries, sightseeing industries, science tours, and other touristic offers. At the same time, aerospace communities, aerospace schools, aerospace markets, and other supporting facilities have been gradually improved as well. Rocket launches have not only brought a \"tourism craze\" to Wenchang and improved the living standards of local residents, but also driven the transformation of the city's industrial system. As China's only commercial space launch site, Hainan commercial launch site is the major infrastructure project of Wenchang International Aerospace City, which will be able to launch regularly in 2024. So far, public platforms for aerospace science and innovation, such as the satellite assembly and testing plant, rocket assembly plant, and aerospace supercomputing center, have been completed and gradually put into use. Liu Chong, Mayor of Wenchang, said that Wenchang will gradually form its industrial advantage based on the commercial aerospace industry, accelerate the construction of the industrial system of \"three chains\" (rocket chain, satellite chain, and data chain) and the \"aerospace +\", while continuing to drive the transformation and upgrading of the traditional advantageous industries such as Wenchang chicken, coconuts, and fishery. It is foreseeable that the \"aerospace craze\" based on the \"aerospace effect\" will drive more industries to gather and grow in Wenchang, and China's commercial aerospace industry will usher in a brilliant new chapter in the future.

Courtesy of the Ministry of National Defense Published Feb 7, 2024 11:44 am KST Updated Feb 7, 2024 3:32 pm KST Korea and Qatar have signed an initial agreement to strengthen bilateral defense cooperation during talks between their defense chiefs, officials said Wednesday, amid Seoul's push to boost arms exports to the Middle East. Defense Minister Shin Won-sik signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) as he met Qatar's Deputy Prime Minister Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah, who doubles as minister of state for defense, in Doha on Tuesday (local time). Under the MOU, the two countries will hold regular defense ministerial talks and make efforts to establish an institutional foundation for defense cooperation, according to Shin's ministry. The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in various defense sectors, such as increasing exchange between their defense-related institutes and expanding combined drills, it said. Earlier in the day, Shin paid a courtesy call on Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and vowed to further develop their defense ties, citing the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations this year. The minister's visit came after President Yoon Suk Yeol made a state visit to Qatar last October, when the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership.\" Shin also attended Korea's football match against Jordan on Tuesday in the semifinals of the Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup in Qatar at the invitation of the emir. Korea lost 2-0. It marked Shin's last trip of a three-nation Middle East swing, which also took him to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. (Yonhap) Go to Top"

(Photo | AFP) The Conversation Updated on : 06 Feb 2024, 5:15 pm 3 min read Copied Pakistan’s former prime minister, Imran Khan, has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Pakistani court ruled his marriage un-Islamic and illegal. Khan had already been sentenced to 14 years in jail for corruption and barred from holding public office for ten years a week earlier and, a day before that, ten years in prison for leaking official state secrets. Khan claims that the cases against him are politically motivated. Since being deposed in 2022, Khan has taken aim at the country’s powerful military, which has a long history of interfering in politics. He has accused the army chief, the military establishment, and the US government of conspiring against him. Now he argues that military leadership have orchestrated his imprisonment so he cannot run in the upcoming general election on February 8. Members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have also been imprisoned or pressured into leaving their positions, and workers have been prevented from holding political rallies in the run-up to the election. The relentless harassment and intimidation of the PTI and its supporters, and the favour shown to Nawaz Sharif of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party, has led to a muted election campaign . Sharif has been prime minister three times but was ousted in 2017. Khan will appeal his convictions and is likely to get some relief from the courts. But one thing is clear: the military has no intention of allowing a free and fair election on February 8. Military dominance The military’s organisation, structures, and practices were developed under the British (who ruled what is now Pakistan until independence in 1947). But its expansion into politics is rooted in the persistent fear of war with India, its desire to control foreign policy, and its wish to protect its budgetary allocations and fiscal interests. In 2022, military expenditure accounted for nearly 18% of government spending in Pakistan, making the military the best-resourced institution in the country. It is also a business conglomerate and owns millions of acres of public land. And it has received considerable military assistance as a frontline ally of the US during its engagements in Afghanistan. The military has long looked to prevent the election of anyone who might try to influence policies that diverge from its entrenched interests. In 2017, Sharif, who was then prime minister, fell out of favour with the military following disagreements about normalising relations with India. Sharif was arrested on charges of corruption and sentenced to ten years in jail less than two weeks before the 2018 general election. Khan won that election with the backing of the military . But, despite starting his time in office by being on “one page” with the military and ceding alarming amounts of political space to them, Khan’s relationship with the military soon turned sour. Tensions exploded when Khan tried to retain Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed as the military spy chief, rejecting the nominee of army chief General Qamar Bajwa. In April 2022, Khan was ousted from power in a vote of no confidence. He accused the US of engineering his removal and made numerous claims that challenged the military directly. He alleged that the then army chief held a grudge against him, that the military had arrested and tried to assassinate him, and that the military was “above the law.” Khan’s accusations culminated in his arrest on corruption charges on May 9 2023. His imprisonment has resulted in an unprecedented public backlash against the military. Khan’s supporters attacked state institutions and military installations, even breaching the army’s headquarters. Hundreds of PTI supporters were arrested and the military vowed to “punish” them, handing many over to military courts in violation of international law. Three military officials were sacked for their role in the unrest. Since then, the military has by all accounts tightened its grip over Pakistan’s politics, even publicly admitting to meddling in politics. Overdue polls Pakistan’s national elections were supposed to be held in November 2023. But they were delayed due to the need to redraw constituency boundaries following a census. Many are sceptical of this claim and have questioned the ability of Pakistan’s electoral commission to conduct fair polls. The lead-up to the delayed polls has been marred by violence . And, though the polls are expected to go ahead, the electoral commission has asked for security support from the military. Meanwhile, the PTI has faced persistent harassment. Its website is blocked in Pakistan and the party has faced legal setbacks such as losing its electoral symbol, the cricket bat, for not holding intra-party elections. The continuing harassment and intimidation of PTI supporters may also have a chilling effect on voters. No election in Pakistan can be called free and fair for as long as the military establishment continues to play kingmaker. The election on February 8 is no different. The military’s political engineering has ensured that it is impossible for there to be a level playing field for the parties on election day. It only remains to be seen if citizens will turn out to exercise their right to vote.

The new round brings the total financing raised by Heart Aerospace since its inception to $145 million. Among new investors is Sagitta Ventures, a Danish investor focused on early-stage companies. Other investors include Air Canada, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, European Innovation Council Fund, EQT Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Norrsken VC, United Airlines, and Y Combinator. 'We couldn't be more excited about this round,\" said Anders Forslund, co-founder, and CEO of Heart Aerospace. \"This investment furthers our mission to decarbonize and democratize air travel. Air travel is globally its infancy. Billions of people around the world are looking to be connected to this amazing infrastructure over the next decade. Meanwhile, the industry has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. The only way forward is to decouple the tremendous growth in aviation from its emissions, and we believe ES-30 is the first stepping stone. Moreover, because of the superior economics of electric aircraft over their fossil-fuel counterparts, the ES-30 will bring back service to communities that have lost connectivity and open many new markets. This upcoming year is an exciting one for Heart Aerospace as we prepare to unveil our full-scale aircraft demonstrator.\" In addition to announcing new funding, Heart Aerospace said EQT Ventures partner Ted Persson will be joining the company's Board of Directors. \"As someone said, the stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones and the fossil fuel age won't end because we run out of fossil fuels. Heart Aerospace is taking decarbonization to the skies and we're proud to be funding technology that will fundamentally change the aviation industry,\" said Ted Persson. \"We believe that sustainable industrial and electrification solutions are not just the future; they are the present, and our investment strategy reflects our unwavering commitment to driving positive change in these critical sectors.\" \"Ted brings to Heart Aerospace's Board a wealth of expertise in product design, user experience, storytelling and branding,\" said John Slattery, Chairman of Heart Aerospace's Board of Directors. \"We are delighted to have him on our team.\" Heart Aerospace intends to use the funds to further build its business and make progress toward type certification of the company's first hybrid-electric airplane, the ES-30. The ES-30 is a regional airplane with a seating capacity of 30 passengers that offers lower emissions, lower noise pollution and lower operating costs on short haul routes than current conventionally fueled airplanes. The ES-30 is currently the only clean sheet hybrid-electric airplane of its size with an active type certification application with European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA. The focus in the upcoming year will be on the development of Heart Aerospace's hybrid- electric powertrain. \"United's goal of net zero emissions requires bold solutions and that's why we've invested in a broad portfolio of low-carbon technologies including hybrid-electric aircraft,\" said United Airlines Ventures Managing Director Andrew Chang. \"Once operational, we believe Heart's ES-30 aircraft have the potential to reduce our carbon footprint, while serving regional markets across the country.\" \"Air Canada has adopted a multi-pronged approach to addressing its ambitious net zero emissions by 2050 climate change goal, from advocating for commercial scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to active investment in a range of revolutionary new technologies. Further to our initial equity position in Heart Aerospace to support the development of the ES-30 hybrid-electric regional aircraft which could be deployed in Air Canada's regional markets, we recently strengthened our financial investment in Heart Aerospace with an additional US$5 million to advance the ES-30 aircraft towards type certification,\" said Michael Rousseau, President & Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada. Heart Aerospace has 250 orders for the ES-30, with options and purchase rights for an additional 120 planes. The company also has letters of intent for a further 191 airplanes.

    "article_text": "Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis GuruFocus Research January 1, 2024 3 min read Understanding the Sustainability of Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Park Aerospace Corp ( NYSE:PKE ) recently announced a dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on 2024-02-02, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-01-02. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Park Aerospace Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability. What Does Park Aerospace Corp Do? Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with PKE. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? Park Aerospace Corp designs, develops, and manufactures advanced composite materials, structures, and assemblies for the aerospace markets, including low-volume and prototype tooling. Its primary business segment is Aerospace, with the majority of its revenue stemming from North America, though it also operates in Asia and Europe. Park Aerospace Corp offers products such as Advanced Composite Prepregs for Aircraft Structures and Interiors, Sigma Strut, and Alpha Strut. Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis A Glimpse at Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend History Park Aerospace Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1985, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis. It has increased its dividend each year since 1998, earning the status of a dividend aristocrata title awarded to companies with at least 26 consecutive years of dividend increases. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share to track historical trends. Breaking Down Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Yield and Growth As of today, Park Aerospace Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.23% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.40%, indicating an expected increase in dividend payments over the next year. The 5-year yield on cost for Park Aerospace Corp stock is approximately 3.24%. Park Aerospace Corp's Dividend Analysis The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2023-08-31, Park Aerospace Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.88, which may suggest a potential concern for dividend sustainability. Conversely, Park Aerospace Corp's profitability rank is 8 out of 10 as of 2023-08-31, indicating good profitability prospects and a history of net profit in 9 out of the past 10 years. Story Continues Growth Metrics: The Future Outlook For dividend sustainability, robust growth metrics are crucial. Park Aerospace Corp's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests a positive growth trajectory relative to competitors. However, the company's revenue has seen an average annual decrease of -3.30%, underperforming approximately 67.68% of global competitors. The 3-year EPS growth rate has increased by an average of 1.30% per year, yet this underperforms about 55% of global competitors. Additionally, the 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -8.70% underperforms 80.31% of global competitors. Next Steps In conclusion, while Park Aerospace Corp has a strong history of dividend payments and is recognized as a dividend aristocrat, the current payout ratio and mixed growth metrics present a nuanced picture. The robust profitability rank provides some reassurance, yet the underperformance in revenue and EBITDA growth rates warrant careful consideration for the future. Investors should weigh these factors when assessing the long-term sustainability of Park Aerospace Corp's dividends.
