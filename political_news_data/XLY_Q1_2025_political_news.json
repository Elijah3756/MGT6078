    "article_text": "David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty Images Close Key Takeaways U.S. consumers are showing signs of preparing to cut back on spending as they brace to absorb price increases from President Donald Trump's tariff campaign. Surveys show people are growing more worried about inflation and unemployment and are planning to cut back on essentials and discretionary purchases if tariffs push inflation. Consumer spending is the backbone of U.S. economic growth and slowing spending could make a recession more likely. President Donald Trump's tariffs are already shifting how people spend their money, in an ominous sign for the future of the economy. Evidence is mounting that consumers are tightening their belts as they brace for tariffs to push up prices on all kinds of imports. In February, U.S. households cut back their spending on services while ramping up purchases of goods, which is a possible sign that people are rushing to buy things before tariffs hit, according to a report on spending and inflation from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday. In a separate survey by the University of Michigan Friday, expectations of future inflation rose to their highest since 2022, and expectations for unemployment rose to their highest since the Great Recession, flashing a warning sign that households might be preparing to cut back on shopping. The latest data highlights the seismic impact that Trump's continually shifting tariff policies have had on the economy in recent weeks . Economists have become more concerned that consumers, facing price increases on many products, will cut back on spending, undercutting an important pillar of the economy's health: consumer spending is the main engine of economic growth, making up 68% of the Gross Domestic Product. Consumers Could Stop Buying... Households plan to cut back their spending significantly on both essentials and discretionary items if there is tariff-driven inflation, according to a survey this week by Morning Consult, a research firm. Among households with income of less than $50,000, 35% plan to cut back on groceries, and 19% making more than $100,000 said the same. More than 20% of all income groups in the survey said they would cut back on dining out and clothing. \"U.S. consumers are increasingly inflation-weary, their finances are more fragile, and they face higher risks in the labor market,\" Deni Koenhemsi, head of economic analysis at Morning Consult, wrote in a commentary. \"These dynamics place U.S. consumer spending on a different trajectory compared to the previous shock—the pandemic—or the last time President Trump introduced tariffs.\" Behind the trend are expectations that Trump's import taxes will push up the cost of living. Not only are merchants likely to pass on the cost of tariffs to consumers, but decreased competition from imports will allow U.S.-based companies to raise their own prices, multiple economists have predicted. ...And Are Worried About Their Jobs At the same time, fears of a slowdown in the job market are growing. While the unemployment rate has stayed near record lows in recent months, employers have cut back on hiring, and a tariff-driven slowdown of the economy could drag down job growth even further. Most economists predict the job market to stay on steady footing, at least in the short term, but consumers aren't so sure: two-thirds of people surveyed by Michigan this month anticipated unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest percentage since 2009. \"This trend reveals a key vulnerability for consumers, given that strong labor markets and incomes have been the primary source of strength supporting consumer spending in recent years,\" Joanne Hsu, Surveys of Consumers director at the University of Michigan, wrote in a commentary. Those Concerns Are Bad For the Economy In recent years, consumer spending has kept the economy afloat despite powerful forces dragging it down. The economy has avoided a recession despite high inflation in 2022, and after that, high borrowing costs imposed by the Federal Reserve in an effort to push inflation down to pre-pandemic levels. But the tariffs could be the last straw for household finances already strained by steep cost-of-living increases. The U.S. economy is on track to shrink 2.8% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDP Now tool. \"So far, consumers are not coming to rescue economic growth as they have so many times in recent years,\" Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a commentary.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — The usual festive mood of Eid al-Fitr holiday to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan has been subdued in Indonesia this year as people grapple with soaring prices for food, clothing and essential goods. Consumer spending ahead of the biggest religious holiday for Muslims, which was celebrated on Sunday in Indonesia, has declined compared to the previous year, with a predicted slowdown in cash circulation due to fewer travelers. Each year in Indonesia, nearly three-quarters of the population of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country travel for the annual homecoming known locally as “mudik” that is always welcomed with excitement. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement People pour out of major cities to return to villages to celebrate the holiday with prayers, feasts and family gatherings. Flights are overbooked and anxious relatives weighed down with boxes of gifts form long lines at bus and train stations for the journey But this year the Transportation Ministry said Eid travelers reached 146 million people, a 24% drop from last year’s 194 million travelers. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry projects that money circulation during Eid will reach 137.97 trillion rupiah ($8.33 billion), down from 157.3 trillion last year. The weakening purchasing power is also reflected in Bank Indonesia’s Consumer Confidence Index which dipped to 126.4 in February from 127.2 in January. Bhima Yudistira, executive director of the Center for Economic and Law Studies, or Celios, said those trends indicate the economy is under strain, driven by economic hardship, coupled with currency depreciation and mass layoffs in manufacturing. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “These have weakened both corporate earnings and workers’ incomes that suppress consumer spending,” Yudistira said, adding he “expects a less vibrant festive season.” He said the festive spirit has been stifled by harsh economic realities, as soaring prices and dwindling incomes force residents to prioritize survival over celebration. Traditionally household consumption is a key driver of Indonesia’s GDP. It contributed over 50% to the economy last year, helping push annual growth to 5.11%. However, consumer spending in 2025 is expected to be more subdued, Yudistira said. Despite the downturn, the government remains optimistic that the Ramadan and Eid momentum will support economic growth in the first quarter of 2025. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Eid usually boosts the economy through increased spending,” Chief Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said ahead of the Islamic holiday. The government recently introduced incentives to stimulate economic activity, including airfare and toll road fee discounts, nationwide online shopping events, direct cash assistance for 16 million households, electricity bill reductions for low-consumption customers, and tax exemptions for labor-intensive sectors. “With these programs in place, the government hopes to sustain consumer spending and support economic stability,” Hartarto said. The situation has also affected Endang Trisilowati, a mother of four, who said her family had to scale down their festivities budget. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Honestly, the economic hardship is affecting us,” Trisilowati said. She described how she used to cook different dishes every Eid and invite neighbors, but now she can only afford a simple meal for her family. “Many have resorted to just finding a way to eat on that festivity, but the spirit is low,” she said. Muslims in India grapple with discrimination In India, Muslims are marking the celebration of Eid with special prayers, family gatherings and festive meals. The holiday comes as the minority community faces vilification by hardline Hindu nationalists. Muslim groups are also protesting against a proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to change laws governing Muslim land endowments. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The government says it wants to weed out corruption and mismanagement in hundreds of thousands of Muslim land endowments. But Muslim groups say the proposal pending approval in India’s parliament is discriminatory. Muslims, who comprise 14% of India’s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party launched a nationwide initiative called “Saugat-e-Modi,” or “Modi’s gift,” during Ramadan that is expected to provide food and clothes to over 3 million underprivileged Muslims to celebrate Eid. In New Delhi, thousands assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of the country’s largest mosques, to offer Eid prayers. Families came together early Monday morning and many people shared hugs and wishes.

Δ A connecting of the dots indicates that consumer spending was anemic, in real terms, as inflation continues to run hot. Sentiment’s at an ebb not seen in years, and households boosted their savings where they could, likely as a buffer against the uncertainties of what comes next. Data indicated that inflation accelerated at a pace not seen in more than a year. Consumer spending gained some ground on a month-over-month basis , but it must be noted that that increase comes off a lower base in January, which declined from December — and the latest results missed expectations. In terms of headline numbers, consumer spending was up 0.4% in February on the back of a downwardly revised 0.3% dip in January, per a Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) report. Consensus expectations had been for a 0.5% gain last month. Regarding inflation, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased by 0.3% from the previous month. Not Much Momentum But real PCE, which is adjusted for inflation, barely recovered from January’s 0.6% decline, rising just 0.1% in February. The increase in spending was primarily driven by goods, which rose by 0.7% after falling 2.1% in the prior month. Categories such as motor vehicle parts (1.6%), furnishings and household equipment (0.7%), and food and beverages (0.7%) contributed to this growth. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Meanwhile, disposable personal income (DPI), which accounts for personal income after taxes, increased by $191.6 billion, or 0.9%. Consumers seem to be saving what they can: Despite rising consumer spending, the personal saving rate, measured as a share of disposable personal income increased to 4.6% in February, reaching $1.02 trillion. We’re well above the 3.3% saving rate that had been notched in December. As for what lies ahead: The University of Michigan released the final readings for their consumer sentiment index, which shows low spirit among consumers, as sentiment slid another 12% this month, on the back of 10% and 3% decreases in the two months prior. The accumulated drop in the first three months of 2025 amounts to 23%. As reported by PYMNTS, this drop constitutes the steepest cumulative decline in sentiment for the first quarter following a presidential election in the 21st century . Once again, declines were consistent across all demographic and political affiliations. Within the index, it is the subindex of expectations for the future that most deteriorated (18%) with uncertainty around policy continuing to be a decisive element. Two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009. Assessment on current economic conditions decreased somewhat (3%) and stand 15% below December’s readings. Year-ahead inflation expectations jumped up from 4.3% last month to 5% this month, the highest reading since November 2022 and marking three consecutive months of “unusually large” increases (0.5 percentage points or more, as defined by the same report). The recent turmoil is also taking a toll on long-run inflation expectations, which surged from 3.5% in February to 4.1% in March. This is the largest month-over-month increase seen since 1993, and indicates that that the high inflation span has extended to a long enough period to generate long-term changes in consumer expectations, and likely, behaviors. The data points reported above should be sobering for merchants, as they’re faced with their own increased input costs due to tariffs, and passing along price increases will be a dicey proposition at best. This week’s (final) GDP data for the fourth quarter may represent a harbinger of continued slowing economic growth. The BEA said that real GDP showed a revised 2.4% annual increase for the last quarter of the year, which means economic activity throughout the whole of 2024 grew 2.8% compared to 2023 (unchanged from the second estimate). Q4 increases came on the back of overall jumps of 3% and 3.1% in Q2 and Q3, respectively, which shows just how things are slowing. 2024 was sustained by resilient consumer spending, which scored a 4% increase in Q4 and averaged a 2.8% growth rate over the full year. The engine of economic growth — namely, household spending — seems to be sputtering.

    "article_text": "Moderate US consumer spending, increasing prices raise specter of stagflation Published on 03/28/2025 at 01:03 pm EDT Reuters Share Euro / US Dollar (EUR/USD) -0.07% WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded less than expected in February while a measure of underlying prices increased by the most in 13 months, stoking fears the economy was facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation amid an escalation in trade tensions. Those concerns were reinforced by a survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showing consumers' 12-month inflation expectations soared to the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in March. Even more worrisome, consumers anticipated inflation would remain elevated in the years beyond. Economists say President Donald Trump's protectionist trade agenda, marked by a rush of tariff action announcements since taking office in January, will boost prices of imported goods and drive inflation higher in the coming months. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that inflation had started to rise \"partly in response to tariffs,\" adding that \"there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.\" While Powell downplayed the deteriorating inflation expectations, economists said hot underlying price pressures could deter the U.S. central bank from resuming cutting interest rates in June as anticipated by financial markets. \"Today's data is only inflaming stagflation fears,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. \"We are moving in the wrong direction and the concern is that tariffs threaten higher prices, which mean the inflation prints are going to remain hot. This will constrain the Fed's ability to deliver further interest rate cuts.\" Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, climbed 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% decline in January, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.5% after a previously reported 0.2% fall in January. Spending was lifted by a 1.4% surge in outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods like motor vehicles and parts, recreational goods and vehicles as well as furniture and other durable household equipment. Spending on nondurable goods such as food and beverages also rose. But consumers are pulling back on discretionary spending. Outlays on services edged up 0.2%, with receipts at restaurants, hotels and motels dropping 15.0%. \"Consumers are clearly becoming more tactical and cautious in their spending as they try to navigate this uncertain economic and inflationary environment,\" said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. Spending at nonprofit institutions plunged 15.8% amid federal funding cuts as the Trump administration embarks on an unprecedented campaign to sharply downsize the government. Trump this week unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the size and manner in which the tariffs are being handled were detrimental to economic growth. They have also criticized the often disorderly firings of thousands of federal workers by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Many workers have been ordered reinstated by courts. U.S. stocks traded lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. TRADE WAR With the United States' trade partners expected to retaliate through duties of their own, the risks of stagflation or worse, a recession, have increased. The well-telegraphed tariffs have sharply widened the trade deficit as businesses rushed to secure imports. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base, is planning to unveil a wave of reciprocal tariffs next week. Economists, however, argue that the duties will be inflationary, a sentiment shared by consumers. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.0% in March, the highest level since November 2022, the University of Michigan survey showed. That compared to 4.3% last month. Over the next five years, they saw inflation running at 4.1%, the highest reading since February 1993 and up from 3.5% in February. \"Inflation expectations are the transmission mechanism in which a one-time hit to the price level from tariffs turn into a general increase across the price level or inflation,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. \"A rational fiscal policymaker would look at the tone and tenor of the hard and soft data and conclude it's time to start cutting trade deals to limit the damage to the real economy.\" The BEA report showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in February after advancing by the same unrevised margin in January and in line with economists' expectations. There were increases in the prices of recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods as well as clothing and footwear. Services prices rose solidly, driven by higher costs for housing, recreation and finance. In the 12 months through February, PCE prices increased 2.5%, matching January's rise. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.4% in February. That was the biggest gain in the so-called core inflation since January 2024 and followed an unrevised 0.3% advance in January. In the 12 months through February, core inflation increased 2.8% after rising 2.7% in January. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. It last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Following the auto tariffs, J.P. Morgan raised its core PCE inflation estimate this year to 3.1% from 2.8%. \"We see much of this increase concentrated in the second quarter,\" said Michael Feroli, J.P. Morgan's chief U.S. economist. \"The resulting squeeze on consumer real purchasing power will further weigh on real consumer spending.\" Consumer spending adjusted for inflation edged up 0.1% after declining 0.6% in January. That suggested consumer spending and economic growth could stall this quarter. Goldman Sachs cut its gross domestic product estimate to a 0.6% annualized rate from a 1.0% pace. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP contracting at a 2.8% rate. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter. \"This report increases the chances that first-quarter real GDP growth will print with a negative sign,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

This rebound in spending, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity, was largely driven by higher prices. However, inflation continues to exceed the Federal Reserve's target , posing ongoing economic challenges. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose by 0.3% in February, matching January's increase. On an annual basis, prices climbed by 2.5% , while core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose by 0.4% in February and 2.8% over the past 12 months. Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.50% range, although financial markets are anticipating a potential rate cut in June. The rise in consumer spending comes amid concerns about slow economic growth and escalating trade tensions. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, set to take effect next week. Economists warn that these tariffs could harm economic growth, as trade partners retaliate with their own duties. Businesses and consumers have been rushing to secure imports and make purchases before the tariffs take effect, contributing to the recent spending surge. As inflationary pressures continue, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to maintain its 2% inflation target. The central bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects its cautious approach in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Economists remain concerned about the risk of a slowdown, with first-quarter GDP estimates hovering around a 1.0% annualized growth rate."

    "article_text": "U.S. personal income and consumer spending both rose in February, the Commerce Department said Friday, suggesting that the economy remains resilient despite surveys showing gloomy consumer confidence. Total personal income increased by 0.8 percent, or $194.7 billion, driven largely by wage gains and transfer payments. Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent, or $87.8 billion, last month. The gain was driven by a $56.3 billion increase in goods spending and a $31.5 billion rise in services spending. Adjusted for inflation, real consumer spending increased by 0.1 percent, indicating that demand remains steady even as inflation continues to weigh on purchasing power. Manufacturing wages rose one percent percent and wages in the services sector climbed 0.4 percent growth. The robust growth in manufacturing wages comes as President Trump continues his efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, a central component of his economic policy agenda aimed at boosting middle-class incomes and strengthening the industrial base. They may indicate rising demand for manufacturing workers as businesses ramp up domestic production in hopes of avoiding tariffs on imports. Disposable personal income, which measures income after taxes, rose 0.9 percent in February, while inflation-adjusted disposable income increased by 0.5 percent. The steady rise in incomes and spending is expected to support broader economic growth even as inflationary pressures continue to challenge household budgets. The latest data highlights a broader trend of economic resilience, with income and spending growth outpacing consumer sentiment. Economists have noted that wage and income growth are more reliable indicators of economic health than consumer confidence surveys, which have been pessimistic since mid-2021. Hard data continues to point to economic resilience, even as sentiment remains subdued."

    "article_text": "Updated / Friday, 28 Mar 2025 13:27 US consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity US consumer spending rebounded in February, likely lifted by higher prices, which could amplify fears that the economy was facing a period of tepid growth and high inflation amid an escalation in trade tensions. US consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, climbed 0.4% after a revised 0.3% decline in January, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said today. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.5% after a previously reported 0.2% fall in January. US President Donald Trump has announced a slew of tariff actions since taking office in January. Trump this week unveiled a 25% levy on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. Economists say the size and manner in which the tariffs are being handled were detrimental to economic growth. US business and consumer sentiment have deteriorated considerably, raising the risks of a recession, with the United States' trade partners expected to retaliate through duties of their own. The well telegraphed tariffs have sharply widened the trade deficit as businesses rushed to secure imports. US consumers, also eager to avoid higher prices, front-loaded their spending, much of which took place in December. The ebb in pre-emptive buying as well as unseasonably cold temperatures and snowstorms cooled spending at the start of the year. Before the data, gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter were mostly around a 1% annualised rate and the odds of a contraction have risen. The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the October-December quarter. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining US industrial base, is planning to unveil a wave of reciprocal tariffs next week. Economists, however, argue that the duties will be inflationary in the short-run. Consumers' inflation expectations have sky-rocketed. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that inflation had started to rise \"partly in response to tariffs,\" adding that \"there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.\" The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in February after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in January. Economists had forecast the PCE price index gaining 0.3%. In the 12 months to February, prices increased 2.5%, matching January's rise. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.4% after an unrevised 0.3% advance in January. In the 12 months to December, core inflation increased 2.8% after rising 2.7% in January. The US Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. The Fed last week left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.5% range. Financial markets expect it to resume its easing cycle in June.

Consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%. watch now VIDEO 2:54 02:54 Core inflation in February hits 2.8%, hotter than expected; spending increases 0.4% Squawk Box The Federal Reserve's key inflation measure rose more than expected in February while consumer spending also posted a smaller-than-projected increase, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The core personal consumption expenditures price index showed a 0.4% increase for the month, the biggest monthly gain since January 2024, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective numbers of 0.3% and and 2.7%. Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is generally considered a better indicator of long-term inflation trends. In the all-items measure, the price index rose 0.3% on the month and 2.5% from a year ago, both in line with forecasts. At the same time, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%. Stock market futures briefly moved lower following the release, as did Treasury yields. Federal Reserve officials focus on the PCE inflation reading as they consider it a broader measure that also adjusts for changes in consumer behavior and places less of an emphasis on housing than the Labor Department's consumer price index. Shelter costs have been one of the stickier elements of inflation and rose 0.3% in the PCE measure. \"It looks like a 'wait-and-see' Fed still has more waiting to do,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs.\" Good prices increased 0.2%, led by recreational goods and vehicles, which increased 0.5%. Gasoline offset some of the increase, with the category falling 0.8%. Services prices were up 0.4%. Households also grew more cautious with their money, as the personal saving rate increased to 4.6%, the highest since June 2024. The report comes with markets on edge that President Donald Trump's tariff intentions will aggravate inflation at a time when the data was making slow but steady progress back to the Fed's 2% goal. After cutting rates a full percentage point in 2024, the central bank has been on hold this year, with officials of late expressing concern over the effect the import duties will have on prices. Economists tend to consider tariffs as one-off events that do not feed through to longer-lasting inflation pressures, but the encompassing scope of Trump's tariffs and the potential for an aggressive global trade war are changing the stakes. Correction: Consumer spending increased 0.4% in February. An earlier headline misstated the number. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Reuters Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Linkedin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy annual 2.4% pace the final three months of 2024, supported by a year-end surge in consumer spending, the government said Thursday in a slight upgrade of its previous estimate of fourth-quarter growth. But it's unclear whether the United States can sustain that growth as President Donald Trump wages trade wars, purges the federal workforce and promises mass deportations of immigrants working in the country illegally. Growth in gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — decelerated from a 3.1% pace in July-September 2024, the Commerce Department said. For all of 2024, the economy — the world's biggest — grew 2.8%, down a tick from 2.9% in 2023. Consumer spending rose at a 4% pace, up from 3.7% in third-quarter 2023. But business investment fell, led by an 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.84 percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth. Recommended for you A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, slipping from the government's previous estimate of 3.2% and from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Wednesday's report showed continued inflationary pressure at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index — rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PC inflation registered 2.6%, compared to 2.2% in the third quarter. Thursday's report was the government's third and final look at fourth-quarter GDP. The outlook is cloudier. Trump's decision to slap taxes on a range of imports — including a 25% tax on foreign autos announced Wednesday — could push up inflation and disrupt investment, hurting growth. The fourth-quarter showed the U.S. economy \"before the enormous surge in policy uncertainty, particularly trade, took hold and the Trump administration imposed additional tariffs,\" wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year.'' U.S. consumer confidence is sliding sharpy over anxiety about both tariffs and inflation, and major retailers are lowering their expectations for the year, saying that customers are already pulling back on spending.

The Detroit automaker could be among the hardest hit of its peers under broad tariffs, as it sources about 40% of vehicles sold in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Ford, which slipped 3.9%, is less exposed with under 10% of vehicles sourced outside of the U.S., JPMorgan said. Stellantis, which is based in the Netherlands but has significant manufacturing operations in North America, fell 1.3%.

However, business investment and inventories saw a decline. Inflationary pressures increased, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to tariffs and trade policies under President Donald Trump. Consumer confidence has dropped, potentially impacting future growth. US economy (Photo-AP) The US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024, according to a slight upgrade in the government’s growth estimate released on Thursday. The growth was driven by a strong year-end surge in consumer spending , despite challenges posed by a slowdown in business investment and declining inventories. The increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was down from a 3.1% pace in the third quarter, signalling a deceleration in growth. The overall 2024 economy grew by 2.8%, slightly down from 2.9% in 2023, news agency AP reported. Consumer spending was a key driver, growing at a 4% pace in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the third quarter. However, business investment fell, with a notable 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A decline in business inventories contributed to a 0.84 percentage point reduction in GDP growth for the quarter. A key measure of the economy's underlying strength, which excludes volatile components such as exports, inventories, and government spending, showed a healthy 2.9% annual growth rate in Q4, slightly revised down from the previous estimate of 3.2%. This was also lower than the 3.4% pace recorded in Q3. While consumer spending provided a boost, inflationary pressures continued to rise toward the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and exceeding the Fed's 2% target. Core PCE inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered 2.6%, up from 2.2% in the prior quarter. Despite the strong finish to 2024, the outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, particularly with the trade policies of President Donald Trump . His decision to impose new tariffs — including a 25% tax on imported cars — could lead to higher inflation and disrupt business investment, threatening future growth. The fourth-quarter GDP data reflects the economy before the surge in policy uncertainty and trade tensions escalated, particularly under Trump’s administration. As Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, noted, \"The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year.\" In addition to trade concerns, US consumer confidence has dropped sharply, driven by fears of inflation and the impact of tariffs. Major retailers have adjusted their expectations for 2025, with some warning that consumers are already curbing their spending. As the year progresses, the economic landscape could face additional challenges from both domestic and international pressures.

Tom Galvin Bray People Thu 27 Mar 2025 at 09:23 US investment giant Realty Income Reit has acquired a portfolio of eight retail parks in Ireland, including Bray Retail Park – located on the Southern Cross Road, just off the N11. Oaktree Capital Management, a US investment group, was believed to be considering the sale of its huge portfolio of retail parks in Ireland last October, and that sale was formally announced today. The company owned eight retail parks around the country through its subsidiary Targeted Investment Opportunities (TIO) and Sigma Retail Partners, which manages the retail parks on behalf of TIO, was handling the sale. While the price has not been revealed, it is understood some €220m was paid out for all of the retail parks which are distributed across the country.

TIO first purchased Navan retail park for €11.5m in 2015 and followed up that deal by buying the other retail parks in separate transactions over the next year, including Bray, in February 2016. Sigma had also been involved in focusing on improving the various parks’ tenant mix to drive customer growth and boost profits. The Bray venue is popular with shoppers given its location and ample parking space, and is home to retailers such as Woodies, DID Electrical, Flanagan Kerins, Maxi Zoo, Harry Corry as well as Costa Coffee.

Aryaman Gupta March 27, 2025 / 10:11 IST With 280 mn online shoppers, India pips US to become 2nd largest e-retail market globally: Flipkart-Bain report With almost 28 crore online shoppers, India has overtaken the US to become the world’s second largest e-retail market in terms of online buyers, behind China, a 2024 report by Flipkart and Bain and Company has said. China had 92 crore e-retail shoppers while the US had 27 crore. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent between 2019 to 2024, the e-retail market in India scaled to $60 billion last year, and is projected to reach $170–190 billion by 2030, the report said. This comes even as growth in domestic e-retail has slowed down to 10-12 percent during the year compared to over 20 percent seen historically, due to macroeconomic factors and a consumption slump. Regardless, nearly one in 10 retail dollars is projected to be spent on e-retail by 2030, fuelled by an uptick in discretionary spending, as India’s GDP per capita looks to cross the crucial $3,500–4,000 threshold, a key tipping point in e-retail spend globally.

While the e-retail market in India is largely dominated by players like Amazon and Flipkart, newer entrants like Meesho - with its tier II and beyond focus - have expanded the market. Meanwhile, emerging quick commerce challengers like Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart have helped increase the overall e-commerce pie. As per the report, growth in India’s e-retail market will be driven by further expansion into remote markets, rising discretionary spending, and the growing contribution of high-frequency categories. Emerging sectors like quick commerce are also expected to have a disruptive impact on the market. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad India’s e-retail penetration has already expanded from tier II cities to tier III and smaller cities, with almost 60 percent of new customers since 2020 hailing from tier III towns and smaller cities. Additionally, over 60 percent of the new sellers onboarded on e-retail platforms since 2021 were from tier II and smaller cities. “E-retail spending of shoppers in Tier-2 and smaller cities is broadly at par with that of Metro/Tier-I cities, with similar or only slightly lower average selling prices across categories,” the Flipkart-Bain report stated. This growth is driven by faster delivery options, cash-on-delivery availability, and e-retail ads serving as indicators of quality. As such, the long-term prospects of India’s e-retail market remain strong, despite near-term macroeconomic headwinds, the report concluded.

    "article_text": "This report is more useful when it's released before Canadian retail sales but RBC is out today with its latest data on Canadian cardholder spending. Canada's largest bank said card transactions fell 0.2% in February, which is largely consistent with the -0.4% decline in the advance retail sales report. Sales were influenced by poor February weather and the HST holiday through Feb 15. Overall though, there is tremendous angst in Canada but few indications of changed consumer behaviour. \"Spending on discretionary goods declined in February, but spending on discretionary services and essentials were little changed from January. Sales at restaurants edged higher—broadly consistent with data from OpenTable showing restaurant bookings still running 20% above year-ago levels into late March\" They also note that Ontario has recently doled out $200 stimulus cheques to every person in the province and that province leads the annual rise in spending. Overall, it's all a puzzle with Canadian consumer confidence at generational lows but consumer spending just fine. It's a similar dynamic in the US and elsewhere."

This decline indicates that Americans are increasingly worried about economic conditions, job security, and personal finances. According to The Conference Board, which tracks consumer sentiment, this drop in confidence is linked to various economic challenges. These include rising inflation, fluctuating job markets , and concerns over financial stability. The index serves as a key indicator of consumer spending, which is a significant driver of the U.S. economy. The report found that consumers are very pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, with the Expectations Index falling to a 12-year low of 65.2. That is well below a score of 80, which usually indicates a recession is on the horizon. \"Consumers’ expectations were especially gloomy, with pessimism about future business conditions deepening and confidence about future employment prospects falling to a 12-year low. Meanwhile, consumers’ optimism about future income—which had held up quite strongly in the past few months—largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers’ assessments of their personal situations,\" said Stephanie Guichard , Senior Economist, Global Indicators at The Conference Board . The Conference Board provides insights into how consumer confidence affects economic activities. When confidence is low, consumers tend to reduce spending, which can lead to slower economic growth.

    "article_text": "Photo : cyano66 / iStock / Getty Images The Consumer Confidence Index has dropped to its lowest level since January 2021 , reflecting growing concerns among U.S. consumers about the state of the economy. This decline indicates that Americans are increasingly worried about economic conditions, job security, and personal finances. According to The Conference Board, which tracks consumer sentiment, this drop in confidence is linked to various economic challenges. These include rising inflation, fluctuating job markets , and concerns over financial stability. The index serves as a key indicator of consumer spending, which is a significant driver of the U.S. economy. The report found that consumers are very pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, with the Expectations Index falling to a 12-year low of 65.2. That is well below a score of 80, which usually indicates a recession is on the horizon. \"Consumers’ expectations were especially gloomy, with pessimism about future business conditions deepening and confidence about future employment prospects falling to a 12-year low. Meanwhile, consumers’ optimism about future income—which had held up quite strongly in the past few months—largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers’ assessments of their personal situations,\" said Stephanie Guichard , Senior Economist, Global Indicators at The Conference Board . The Conference Board provides insights into how consumer confidence affects economic activities. When confidence is low, consumers tend to reduce spending, which can lead to slower economic growth. This trend is concerning for businesses and policymakers who rely on consumer spending to fuel economic expansion."

    "article_text": "Trump holds Cabinet meeting with Elon Musk to talk DOGE and tariffs 01:43 Get more news Live on March 25, 2025, 12:01 AM EDT By Jasmine Cui As the Department of Government Efficiency upends federal agencies , a new report released Tuesday by the job listing website Indeed shows the number of workers looking for new jobs has spiked. Job applications from workers at agencies targeted by DOGE are up 75% compared with 2022, according to the report’s data. And while job applications among all workers increased after the Trump transition, the spike in applications from DOGE-targeted workers is especially pronounced. Applications from federal workers in DOGE-targeted agencies, which include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, surged 60 percentage points from January to February, according to Indeed’s data. “We’ve never seen something like this after a presidential administration and inauguration,” said Cory Stahle, an Indeed economist. While there were increases in job applications among federal workers after the 2016 and 2020 elections, those increases were an order of magnitude lower, Stahle said. The 2025 surge coincides with the aggressive downsizing initiated early in Donald Trump’s presidency, and it comes at a time when white-collar work is stagnating . “It’s not a good time to be looking for a job,” Stahle said. The affected workers are spread out across the country. While nearly 500,000 federal workers live in Washington, D.C., Maryland or Virginia , Indeed’s data shows that 80% of active federal worker profiles are tied to locations elsewhere. Nearly a third of those workers are in the South, excluding D.C., Maryland and Virginia. They also tend to be more educated, potentially increasing competition in an already tough job market. “What we see is that 70% of them have a bachelor’s degree or above,” Stahle said. “This is a really educated group of job seekers.” Stahle noted that the influx is happening amid a historically weak market for such sectors, saying: “It’s going to increase the competitiveness of the labor market.” In addition, jobs affected by cuts are often highly specialized. “If you are a displaced USDA worker with a background in horticulture, you know, what do your prospects look like right now?” Stahle said. Job searchers, who Stahle said tended to be mid- to senior level, also were in their current jobs for longer, with an average tenure of 11 years, according to federal data. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Monday that fired workers will get the chance to look for jobs in the private sector , but the shocks could extend beyond job-seeking. Unemployment, among other data points, is an early indicator of recessions . Thus far, it — along with other relevant data points, such as the yield curve and consumer spending — have held relatively steady. But plunging consumer sentiment could be a signal of what’s to come. Economist Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve and White House economist who created a widely used indicator, the “Sahm Rule,” to identify oncoming downturns through unemployment, cautioned that cuts could damage consumer spending. That’s even among those who are not directly affected. “Many of them won’t lose their job, because we do need a certain number of federal workers to make everything go,” Sahm told NBC News. “But at this point there are a lot of people who are very uncertain from day to day what their employment is.” “Are they going to go out and buy a house? Are they going to go buy a car?” Sahm asked, sharing a gray outlook for consumer spending: “The very rational response would be don’t go out and buy stuff.” The overall risk to the economy is small, Sahm said, because federal workers made up less than 2% of the overall U.S. labor force. But she warns that while DOGE alone might not cause a recession, it could lead to one. “The fast-moving process of DOGE is adding unnecessarily to the risks,” Sahm said on her blog . “Once they take hold, recessionary dynamics are difficult to avoid and costly to ‘fix.’” Jasmine Cui Jasmine Cui is a reporter for NBC News."

Analysts at Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs said buy Live Nation after its recent decline, as shares are trading at a discount after the market's latest tailspin. Live Nation is off by nearly 19% over the past month, about three times more than the 6.5% decline in the S & P 500. Wall Street posits that live entertainment is less cyclical and specialized compared to other forms of discretionary consumer spending, which could be a catalyst for the stock moving forward. \"Concerts are a discretionary purchase and we're not dismissive of the risks, but as we've written previously and cover again here, we believe there are secular and bespoke … factors to consider which give us confidence in our forecasts,\" JPMorgan analysts led by David Karnovsky wrote Thursday. The bank's $170 per share price target, alongside an overweight investment rating, implies more than 37% upside over the next 12 months. LYV YTD mountain Live Nation stock in 2025. Consumer sentiment has weakened in 2025 as inflation stays above the Fed's 2% target and the White House trumpets new tariffs on imports from China, Canada and Mexico. Last week, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers for March showed its lowest reading since 2022. Deutsche Bank also forecasts strong demand for concerts and shows, saying Live Nation is a top pick in its coverage of entertainment companies. \"Live Nation continues to observe healthy demand, and we believe consumer spending on live events should hold up relatively well in the event of a macroeconomic downturn (compared to other forms of discretionary spending),\" analyst Benjamin Soff wrote in a March 11 note. Soff also has a $170 per share price target and a buy rating. Further protecting Live Nation from any weakness in consumer spending is ticket sales on the secondary market, according to Goldman Sachs. A large secondary market helps protect the live music industry from cyclical risks, analyst Stephen Laszczyk wrote in a note earlier this week. \"We believe that the difference in ticket prices between the 'fair market value' and the price that the ticket is sold for on the primary market has insulated the Live Music industry from weaker consumer spending,\" Goldman said. Laszczyk also has a $170 per share price target on Live Nation stock. Paramount Skydance reported its first earnings as a combined company.

(Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images In 2020, there were five U.S. entries among the cities with the biggest consumer spending in the world. By 2040, this will have risen to six with the addition of Dallas, a release by World Data Lab shows . At the same time, the other regions in the top 10 have been diversifying, with Japan losing ground and China gaining some, the numbers show. Beyond the top 10, the U.S. has seen another city rising in the ranking. Houston is projected to climb to rank 12 in 2040, up from rank 14 in 2000. Washington D.C., Phoenix and Seattle are also among the top 20. While America’s major metropolises are keeping their top spots, the ranking exemplifies the growing power of U.S. Sun Belt cities which have been attracting residents with favorable climate and lower cost of living. This chart shows the cities with the highest consumer spending in the world, by year. Statista Based on a relatively strong economy, consumer spending in the United States has persisted even through recent crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and strong inflation. Americans tend to save less and are among the biggest users of credit worldwide , which might not be sustainable but still ups spending. Additionally, richer Americans can still benefit from their pandemic savings and locked-in ultra-low mortgage rates. U.S. consumer spending is relying more and more on these rich or very rich individuals, the Wall Street Journal reports , which the U.S. has a lot of . The report analyzes more than 6,000 cities on all continents. It found that 83% of new consumer spending until 2040 will be urban in nature. While the top 100 highest-spending cities are expected to grow in consumer class population by 2.4% annually until that date, consumer spending in them will grow by 4.5% every year, outperforming other urban populations around the globe as large cities continue to attract wealthy individuals and function as spending hubs. MORE FOR YOU Major Growth In Asia-Pacific Region The Asia-Pacific region is expected to add the most cities above 300,000 in population to the ranking until 2040—361, or two thirds of the total worldwide growth. The makers of the report estimate that Guangzhou in China’s South will be the city home to the biggest number of APAC consumers by 2040, 45 million. Guangzhou was listed as the city with the 10th highest spending power in 2020, increasing to rank 4 by 2040 at $793 billion in annual consumer spend. This is still far behind the projected 2040 figures for U.S. cities New York ($2.1 trillion) and Los Angeles ($1.8 trillion). Beijing and Shanghai are in ranks 15 and 16 in 2040, up from ranks 19 and 20 in 2020. Jakarta in Indonesia is expected to enter at a global rank 18 in 2040, having grown by that time to the second-biggest city in APAC by consumer class residents at 37 million. Meanwhile, Japan will reduce the number of cities in the top 10 of the biggest spenders from three to one. The country has been struggling with low growth and investment as well as periods of deflation that have been a constant since the deep economic crisis of its asset bubble burst in 1992. Only Tokio is expected to remain, albeit in rank 3, while Osaka/Kyoto is expected to fall as far as rank 13 by 2040, down from formerly rank 3.

    "article_text": "Customers shop at a Marusan supermarket in Koshigaya, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on Sunday, March 16, 2025. - Bloomberg TOKYO: Japan’s households reduced their collective stash of cash at the fastest pace on record last quarter as they sought to cope with rising costs of living, according to the latest data by the Bank of Japan. Citizens’ holdings of cash slipped to ¥105.3 trillion (US$707 billion) in the three months ended in December, down 3.4 per cent from a year earlier in the biggest drop in the data going back to 1998, according to a quarterly flow of funds report published Friday by the central bank. The decline mostly likely reflects the wider adoption of cashless consumption as well as a rise in nominal consumer spending due to inflation, a reversal after the pile of cash grew during the Covid pandemic, the BOJ said at a briefing. The decline in cash comes as economists have been watching to see if households change their behaviour regarding so-called mattress money, or funds stashed at home. As the economy appears poised to emerge from deflation, money would lose value in real terms if it’s not earning income in investments or in a bank account. The flow of funds data showed that household assets in investment trusts rose to a record high as more individual investors flocked to the asset. Holdings of Japanese government bonds also jumped at the fastest pace since 2007. Earlier Friday, a government report showed that Japan’s inflation rose at a faster pace than expected, staying well above BOJ’s two per cent target.

    "article_text": "Close Key Takeaways Falling stocks over the past few weeks could undermine consumer spending by reducing the \"wealth effect.\" Richer households have been propping up the main pillar of the U.S. economy, consumer spending, partly because they have felt flush after years of rising stock prices. The \"wealth effect\" is about four times as big as it usually is, so falling stocks could prompt more belt-tightening than normal, according to one analysis. President Donald Trump and his advisors have dismissed falling stock prices, saying they're more focused on the \"real economy\"—but falling stocks could undermine one of the main forces supporting job growth, economists say. After financial markets plunged last week, sending the S&P 500 stock index into correction territory , Trump and his top economic advisors dismissed concerns about the economy's future. After all, as the saying goes, the stock market is not the economy , even if it reflects business leaders' expectations about where the economy is headed. \"Doesn't concern me,\" Trump said last week when a reporter asked him about the plunging stock market. \"I think some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they're buying. I think we're going to have an economy that's a real economy, not a fake economy.\" However, there's at least one way the stock market can impact the real economy, to the extent that the \"real economy\" consists of people's ability to go to work, get paid, and buy goods and services. Consumer spending is the main engine of U.S. economic growth as measured by the Gross Domestic Product, and falling stocks could throw some sand in that engine's gears. That's because over the past few years, as inflation has eroded the buying power of U.S. households, wealthier consumers have been increasing their share of the shopping, propped up by a formerly booming stock market. The top 10% of earners were responsible for almost half of all consumer spending, the highest share recorded in data going back to 1989, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics for The Wall Street Journal . The Wealth Effect People tend to spend more when they feel wealthier, in an economic phenomenon known as the \" wealth effect .\" Because higher-income households tend to hold more stocks, the big spenders could start to tighten their belts as a result of the recent sell-off. That could set off a domino effect leading to a recession: less spending means less need for businesses to hire, fewer people get paychecks, and the \"real economy\" takes a nosedive. The steep rise in stock prices over the past four years has made the \"wealth effect\" more powerful than it usually is. One model by Oxford Economics showed that the wealth effect currently has four times its normal impact on consumer spending. That leaves the economy especially vulnerable if the effect goes away. Consumer spending has been faltering in recent months, with retail sales plunging in January and recovering only modestly the following month. \"If the drop in equities persists, then it would negatively affect consumer spending,\" Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a commentary last week. \"Household net wealth matters more for the consumer spending outlook than before. A stronger wealth effect has proven to be a tailwind for overall consumer spending, but it could just as easily turn into an outsize drag in the event of a bear market .\" Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

China is seeking the next ‘big items’ to encourage consumers to open their wallets. Technology looks to be a key Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP 2 Zhou Xin Published: 7:00am, 18 Mar 2025 Updated: 7:01am, 18 Mar 2025 China published a new action plan last Sunday aimed at boosting consumer spending, and the immediate question for many observers was whether this “spend, spend, spend” initiative will be effective this time around. Advertisement Historically, China has pursued strategies to stimulate domestic spending since the late 1990s, when the country began producing more goods than it could consume or export. Two primary schools of thought have emerged on how to encourage increased spending. The first focuses on the demand side, which asserts that as people’s incomes rise, their spending tends to increase accordingly. Proponents of this approach advocate for steady growth in household incomes and national income distribution. During China’s annual parliamentary gathering in March, there were plenty of proposals for cutting personal income tax. The second perspective emphasises the supply side of consumer spending. This suggests that the average disposable income of Chinese residents has been rising in tandem with economic growth. According to official data, the per capita disposable income in China grew by 5.3 per cent in 2024, aligning with a gross-domestic-product growth of 5 per cent. That viewpoint posits that Chinese households have already accumulated sufficient spending power, and the key to boosting consumption lies in providing attractive products and services that would encourage consumers to open their wallets. A family walks past a shopping centre in Beijing. Photo: AFP Beijing has attempted to address both perspectives in its consumption strategies. But in practice, it often leans toward supply-side initiatives, which do not involve difficult structural reforms.

    "article_text": "Shares of the China-based technology conglomerate Alibaba Group ( BABA 3.07% ) were gaining ground on Monday after the Chinese government said yesterday that it would implement a plan to boost consumer spending in the country. A significant part of Alibaba's business is focused on e-commerce , so the Chinese government's move could help boost the company's growth. Investors were optimistic about the opportunity and pushed Alibaba's stock up 4.8% as of 11:56 a.m. ET today A new plan for economic growth China's government released its Special Action Plan to Boost Consumption on Sunday, highlighting a few areas that could help fuel economic growth. Specifically, the government wants to boost consumer spending, increase domestic demand, and even stabilize its stock market. Expand NYSE : BABA Alibaba Group Today's Change ( -3.07 %) $ -5.09 Current Price $ 160.80 Key Data Points Market Cap $372B Day's Range $ 160.16 - $ 165.58 52wk Range $ 79.43 - $ 192.67 Volume 11M Avg Vol 19M Gross Margin 40.65 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % The move comes on the heels of data showing China's economy is slowing down. The country's consumer price index fell last month by its sharpest decline in more than a year. Its economy could suffer additional shocks if a trade war escalates with the U.S. Alibaba investors are hoping that the government working to improve consumer demand will help the company's e-commerce businesses. Its financials are in good shape right now, with net income reaching $6.7 billion in the most recent quarter, ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimates. But with China being the world's second-largest economy, a consumer spending slowdown has had investors on high alert, wondering how much people might cut back in the future. Uncertainty still ahead There's a lot investors are trying to decipher right now. The Trump administration appears very focused on ratcheting up tariffs , even while temporarily pulling back on them at times. Any escalation of a trade war between China and the U.S. could put pressure on Alibaba's stock. And while the Chinese government's announcement sparked optimism among some investors, there's no guarantee its plans will indeed boost consumer demand. All of this means that Alibaba investors should keep a close eye on any new developments with China's economy."

Investors’ enthusiasm has soured as concerns mount over his administration’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff policies Advertisement Subscribe Join Us Add as a preferred source on Google Prefer Firstpost On Google US President Donald Trump's economic policies have bred unease among retail consumers and wealthy investors alike. Reuters The US economy, which had been running at full throttle when President Donald Trump took office, is showing signs of strain just weeks into his term. Consumer confidence has faltered, the stock market is in turmoil, and layoffs are on the rise. Middle-class Americans and wealthy investors alike are feeling the squeeze. Shoppers are cutting back on spending, rattled by market volatility and Trump’s escalating trade wars, raising concerns about the strength of the world’s largest economy. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump has refused to rule out the possibility of a recession , while recent stock market losses have eroded the wealth of higher-income Americans– key drivers of US consumer spending. More from United States Of America ‘There will be flexibility:’ Trump tones down his reciprocal tariff threat in major shift Trump calls judge who halted deportations 'lunatic, crooked', demands his impeachment Market turmoil: A self-fulfilling prophecy? The stock market’s sharp downturn in recent weeks is not just a reflection of economic unease– it could become a cause of it. Investors initially welcomed Trump’s return to the White House, but enthusiasm has soured as concerns mount over his administration’s aggressive and unpredictable tariff policies . The S&P 500, which soared 53 per cent across 2023 and 2024, has fallen 4.1 per cent so far this year. Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, a Harvard economist, estimates that a 20 per cent drop in stocks in 2025 could shave as much as a percentage point off economic growth. And the effects could ripple far beyond Wall Street. “In a hyper-financialised economy like America’s, asset prices can lead the economy, not just the other way around,” Wall Street Journal quoted Alex Chartres, a fund manager at Ruffer, as saying. “A decline in asset markets creates the risk of weakening conditions in the real economy.” Impact Shorts More Shorts As Trump weaponises tariff, Fed sees a bigger worry: Not jobs, but rising prices in America Despite a backdown deal, Trump deploys hundreds more National Guard troops in Washington DC For years, rising stock prices have fuelled consumer spending, particularly among the wealthiest Americans. The top 10 per cent of earners, who now account for nearly half of all US consumption, have benefited the most. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that as of 2022, families in the top 10 per cent held an average of $2.1 million in stocks, making up 32 per cent of their net worth– up from 26 per cent in 2010. Their spending surged by 58 per cent over the past four years, partly powered by stock market gains. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD But it is not just the ultra-rich who are exposed. The rise of retail investing means that a record 43 per cent of American households’ financial assets were in stocks at the end of last year, according to Fed data. That makes the US economy particularly vulnerable to a downturn in asset prices. A sustained market rout could trigger a significant pullback in spending– what economists call the “wealth effect.” Deutsche Bank estimates that if stocks had remained flat last year instead of rallying, consumer spending growth would have been closer to 2 per cent instead of 3 per cent. Many Americans have a mental benchmark for their retirement savings. If falling stock prices push them further from their goals, they may rein in spending, said Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank’s chief US economist. A downturn in the markets could also reshape corporate decision-making. Business leaders often fixate on their company’s share price when planning hiring and investment strategies. After the Nasdaq lost a third of its value in 2022, the tech sector responded with sweeping job cuts and spending reductions. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Retail sales take a hit Retailers, many of whom reported strong sales late last year, are now warning of a slowdown. Footfall at US stores fell 4.3 per cent year-on-year in early March, according to consultancy RetailNext, continuing a decline that began in January. Mobile data tracked by Placer.ai suggests that major retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, are seeing fewer visitors, Financial Times reported. On Friday (March 14), the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index recorded its third consecutive monthly decline, hitting its lowest level since November 2022. Inflation expectations are also climbing, adding to household anxieties. Some corporate executives are already sensing a shift in consumer behaviour. Delta Air Lines, Foot Locker, and Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel’s whiskey, have all warned that customers are becoming more cautious. Retail sales dropped 0.9 per cent in January– the biggest monthly decline since 2023– though some economists attributed it to unusually cold weather. February’s figures, due to be released Monday, will provide further clues about whether consumer spending is beginning to falter.

Image: canva Home » How a 0.5 percent point VAT increase will squeeze South Africans How a 0.5 percent point VAT increase will squeeze South Africans A 0.5 percent point VAT increase may seem like a small adjustment, but even the tiniest hike puts pressure on an already unstable SA economy. By Sundeeka Mungroo 13-03-25 11:07 in Finance 0 What does the 0.5 percent point VAT hike mean for South Africans? Image: canva How bad could it be? While a 0.5 percent point increase in South Africa’s Value Added Tax (VAT) might seem insignificant on paper, for millions of citizens already struggling with rising costs , it’s yet another financial burden South Africans now have to deal with. The government justifies tax hikes as a way to boost revenue, but the reality is that this increase will hit ordinary consumers, small businesses, and economic growth in ways that simply can’t be ignored. Take a look… VAT hike: A direct hit to consumers VAT is a tax on spending, which means that every South African – rich or poor – will feel the pinch whenever they buy goods and services. The wealthier segments of society may absorb the increase without much trouble, but for lower- and middle-income households, it’s a different story. Many South Africans already battle impossibly high food prices, rising fuel costs, and stagnant wages. Although certain essential food items remain VAT-exempt, many everyday necessities – including electricity, hygiene products, and public transport – will now cost more. A family already struggling to cover monthly expenses will find their budget stretched even thinner. ADVERTISEMENT Less money, less spending, slower growth South Africa’s economy heavily depends on consumer spending. When people have less disposable income, they cut back on non-essential purchases. This affects industries like retail, tourism , and hospitality, which rely on consumer activity. For businesses, the VAT increase presents a dilemma: absorb the additional cost and risk lower profits, or pass it on to consumers and risk losing customers. Small businesses, which often have tighter profit margins, are particularly vulnerable. If consumers spend less and businesses earn less, economic growth slows down – a scenario South Africa simply can’t afford. Government revenue vs. economic reality The South African government argues that raising VAT helps fund essential services and reduce debt. While this is true to some extent, there’s a fine line between increasing tax revenue and stifling economic activity. If the VAT hike results in reduced consumer spending and struggling businesses, it could offset the intended revenue gains. Lower business profits mean less corporate tax collected, and lower consumer spending means fewer transactions subject to VAT. In the worst-case scenario, this ‘necessary’ increase could do more harm than good. What are your thoughts on the VAT increase?

    "article_text": "(Image credit: Pixabay) LONDON —A new study highlights opportunities for shoppable TV and the massive impact online consumer spending is having on the economy, with Omdia predicting that global online consumer spending is set to reach $4.4 trillion in 2025 and grow to $6.6 trillion by 2029. The U.S. alone will see $1.4 trillion in consumer online spending in 2025, growing to $2 trillion of total online expenditure by 2029. An important opportunity in that growth will occur on the TV, the study also reported. “Shoppable TV presents a massive opportunity for retailers, advertisers, and content creators,” said Omdia senior research director, Maria Rua Aguete. She cautioned however that “challenges remain such as seamless checkout, consumer trust, and platform integration which must be addressed before its full potential is realized.” The study found that the projected growth in online consumer spending outpaces even the expansion of the media and entertainment sector, which is expected to grow from $1.07 trillion in 2025 to $1.3 trillion by 2029, Omdia reported. Video content continues to lead this charge, driving 70% of global revenues, with online video (up 13%), cinema (12%), and gaming (7%) seeing the most significant growth in 2025.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors While media and entertainment remain a key growth area, the acceleration of online consumer spending presents the most significant opportunity. The study found that retail media and shoppable TV are driving a transformation in how content, commerce, and advertising intersect, creating new avenues for businesses to capitalize on. With digital commerce continuing to expand rapidly, leading retailers are pivoting to adapt. Amazon has surpassed Walmart as the world’s largest retailer, highlighting the e-commerce shift. In response, Walmart has positioned itself as a digital-first powerhouse, making strategic moves like its recent acquisition of Vizio to enhance its digital advertising capabilities and integrate shoppable TV into its offerings. Currently, 20% of Walmart’s revenue comes from digital channels, and this figure is expected to grow significantly as the company invests more in retail media and connected TV (CTV). As CTV adoption accelerates, TV operating systems (TV OS) are becoming essential in shaping the future of advertising and commerce. The integration of CTV, TV OS, and retail media is creating seamless pathways from content consumption to purchase, unlocking new revenue streams for broadcasters, advertisers, and retailers alike. As shoppable TV and retail media continue to mature, the industry will see new partnerships and innovations emerge, the study found. The convergence of entertainment and commerce is reshaping the digital media landscape. Companies that successfully integrate CTV, TV OS, and retail media into their strategies will be well-positioned to capture significant market share and drive growth in the next era of digital commerce, the researchers argued.

    "article_text": "Historically, February in a post-election year has been the worst month for the U.S. stock market, according to Carson Group. Indeed, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.21% ) declined 1.4% last month as disappointing economic data and concerns about potential tariffs weighed on the stock market. Is the February dip a buying opportunity? Or is the stock market too risky right now? Here's what investors should know. Expand SNPINDEX : ^GSPC S&P 500 Index Today's Change ( 0.21 %) $ 14.18 Current Price $ 6846.61 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 6806.87 - $ 6855.13 52wk Range $ 4835.04 - $ 6920.34 Volume 2.8B Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A The S&P 500 has historically moved higher in March through August The S&P 500 in the last decade has typically generated a positive return in March, and that momentum has generally carried the index higher through August. The chart below shows the S&P 500's average return in each month over the last decade. Chart by Author. Shown above is the S&P 500's average return in each month over the last decade. As shown above, March has historically been a good time to enter the stock market. Spring often brings a wave of optimism that builds into solid returns through the summer. Add to that the average bull market has lasted for five-and-a-half years, more than twice as long as the current bull market, and the present situation seems like a buying opportunity. But history says tariffs could throw a wrench in the gears. The economy is on shaky ground as consumers and businesses contemplate inflation and tariffs Consumer spending in January unexpectedly dropped 0.2% compared to December. That was the first month-on-month decline in two years and the largest decline since the early days of the pandemic about five years ago. Also, consumer sentiment fell in February to its lowest level in over a year amid concerns about the recent resurgence in inflation. That data matters because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). Put differently, consumer spending is the primary engine that drives the economy. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 slowed markedly, and the latest data concerning consumer spending and sentiment hints at a continued deceleration in the first quarter of 2025. In fact, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests first-quarter GDP is on pace to drop at an annual rate of 2.8%. That would be the sharpest decline since the second quarter of 2020, and weak consumer spending is one of the driving forces behind that early estimate. However, the record trade deficit in January (meaning imports vastly exceeded exports) also contributed. President Donald Trump recently imposed a 10% tariff on China. He plans to double down in March with an additional 10% tariff on China, and a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico. Trump has also mentioned a 25% tariff on the European Union. Manufacturers have scrambled to reduce the impact by stockpiling inventory, but that is a short-term solution. Tariffs will eventually be a headwind to corporate earnings because businesses have only two options: They can either absorb the cost increases, which would lower profit margins . Or they can pass the cost increases along to buyers, which would likely reduce sales. In either scenario, earnings would suffer, and that could certainly cause the stock market to decline. Image source: Getty Images. History says a higher average tariff rate could cause the stock market to decline in 2025 President Trump in his first term imposed several tariffs in 2018 and 2019 that ultimately raised the average tariff rate on all U.S. imports to 2.7%, according to the Tax Foundation. As investors processed those tariffs, the S&P 500 declined 19.8% during a three-month period between September and December in 2018. Importantly, President Trump has outlined a more aggressive tax on imports this time. If all proposed tariffs are implemented, the Tax Foundation estimates the average tariff rate on all U.S. imports will reach 13.8%, the highest level since 1939. If pushing the average rate to nearly 3% caused a 19.8% drawdown in 2018, then pushing the average rate to nearly 14% could cause a much worse decline in 2025. Here is the bottom line: March has traditionally been a springboard leading to strong stock market returns in the summer months. Additionally, the current bull market started less than two-and-a-half years ago, meaning it has lasted less than half as long as the average bull market. But questions about President Trump's trade policies have added a great deal of volatility and uncertainty to the stock market in recent weeks. That does not mean investors should avoid stocks, but they should limit purchases to their best ideas. More importantly, now is a good time to build a cash position to capitalize on the next drawdown. I say that because the S&P 500 recovered quickly from the market correction that began in late 2018. In fact, the index had recouped its losses and reached a new high by May 2019. A similar pattern could play out this time around, so investors should be ready to buy on the dip."

    "article_text": "Target Q4 2025 Earnings: Strong Profit Amid Consumer Spending Warnings and Tariff Pressures—What It Means for the US Economy Target Corporation released its fourth-quarter earnings for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, exceeding market expectations despite ongoing economic pressures. The company posted solid revenue numbers while acknowledging challenges such as tariffs, consumer spending trends, and inventory management. Target’s Q4 2025 earnings surpass estimates Target reported a net income of $1.1 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) at $2.41, surpassing analyst forecasts. However, this marks a decrease from $1.38 billion in the same period last year, primarily due to the absence of an extra sales week this quarter. Revenue declines slightly amid market pressures Despite strong earnings, Target’s total revenue fell by 3.1%, reaching $30.9 billion, down from $31.92 billion in Q4 2024. This decline was attributed to shifts in consumer spending and increased economic uncertainty. Comparable sales show resilience While total revenue declined, comparable sales increased by 1.5%, driven by solid performance in beauty products, apparel, and holiday shopping categories. The company noted higher foot traffic in stores and continued momentum in online sales. Impact of tariffs on target’s profitability Target expressed concerns over rising tariffs affecting trade with Canada, Mexico, and China, which could pressure margins in upcoming quarters.

    "article_text": "[ Economy ] Nanjing Road Joy City Minhang Malls reinvent themselves amid fickle shoppers and a consumer spending slowdown by Tan Weiyun March 3, 2025 [ Economy ] Nanjing Road Joy City Minhang Share Article: In the late evening at luxury mall Plaza 66, a lone shopper walks past the shopfronts of luxury brands. The sharp clack of her high heels on the marble floor echoes in the stillness, an eerie reminder of the subdued undercurrents in Shanghai's high-end retail scene. The plaza, once a popular destination for shoppers, often feels more like a polished showroom than a bustling shopping hub nowadays. Shanghai's innumerable sleek malls – once the signature of the city's reputation as a shopping haven – are in the throes of change as developers and retailers rethink ways of bringing life – and shoppers – back to these opulent spaces. Credit: Imaginechina Caption: Shopping malls are reinventing themselves in a variety of ways to meet consumers' changing demands. Numbers tell the story. In 2024, Plaza 66 suffered a 6 percent drop in revenue and a 22 percent slump in tenant sales, according to the annual report of operator Hang Lung Properties (stock market ticker 0101.HK). The decline was attributed to \"lower-tier customers exercising greater caution in high-end spending and searching for bargains internationally,\" claims the report. Price-conscious shoppers may go to glitzy malls to view merchandise, but they often go home to order it online at cheaper prices. Even the loyalties of the mall's wealthier customers who still buy in-store haven't offset the broader slowdown. The trend isn't isolated to Plaza 66. Its flagship sister Grand Gateway 66, a more lifestyle-focused mall, reported a 3 percent decline in revenue and a 12 percent drop in tenant sales. Credit: Yi Chuan / Ti Gong Caption: A cozy corner at Hong Shou Fang, where visitors can relax and enjoy a variety of food options from different stalls. HKRI Taikoo Hui, another high-end retail landmark, reported retail sales plummeted 14 percent in 2024, with a 93 percent occupancy rate – the lowest in the Chinese mainland portfolio of Swire Properties (1972.HK). The company attributed the decline to ongoing renovation and repositioning efforts, but the figures underscore the wider challenge of addressing shifting consumer buying habits. \"People aren't buying to impress anymore,\" said a long-time Plaza 66 shopper, who asked to remain anonymous. \"It's more about 'quiet luxury' now – understated goods that don't scream logos. But even then, I'd rather buy them in Japan or Europe, where the prices are better.\" Adriel Chan, chairman of Hang Lung Properties, wrote a letter to shareholders last July that outlined the challenges facing the company. \"The decline in tenant sales, particularly in our Shanghai malls, was due to increased outbound luxury shopping (driven by the weaker Japanese yen) and reduced consumer confidence,\" he noted. But the question remains: How can the sector turn itself around? As the market for luxury goods sags, other commercial models are rising to take its place, each trying to carve out a niche in Shanghai's evolving retail landscape. As a sign of changing times, Hong Shou Fang shopping center hums with energy. The aroma of sizzling qiangbing (deep-fried cakes), a Shanghai snack, fills the air as grandmothers haggle with vendors, while young parents sip artisan coffee and watch their kids dart between stalls, clutching sticky tang hulu (sugar-coated fruit). Credit: Yi Chuan / Ti Gong Caption: Vibrant red lanterns hang from trees at Hong Shou Fang, adding a festive touch to the shopping center's ambiance. This new shopping center in the Changshou Road area thrives as the heart of its surrounding neighborhoods. It was developed by Shui On Land (0272.HK), operator of the popular Shanghai Xintiandi project, and is focused on serving a unique local community. With a modest commercial area of 15,000 square meters, Hong Shou Fang managed to attract over 10 million visitors in the first year after opening in September 2023. The foot traffic is a mark of the mall's successful marketing strategy. Its open architecture, with multiple entry points, encourages residents to stroll in, whether they intend to shop or simply enjoy the ambiance. \"This approach has fostered a sense of belonging, making it a daily destination for locals,\" said Erin Wang, general manager of Hong Shou Fang. \"The inclusion of nostalgic elements, such as preserved shikumen -style architecture, also appeals to residents who have a deep emotional connection to the area.\" Credit: Yi Chuan / Ti Gong Caption: A couple enjoys a quiet moment at a restaurant, with Chinese New Year decorations on display. Hong Shou Fang's focus on food and dining has been a key driver of its popularity. With a mix of traditional Shanghai cuisine eateries, modern cafes and trendy food stalls, the mall has become a culinary go-to spot. The emphasis on food is strategic, ensuring a steady flow of customers from morning to midnight. \"We didn't want to create just another shopping center,\" Wang said. \"We wanted to build space where people visit regularly, where they meet up with their neighbors and where they can enjoy a meal or snack without feeling like they're stepping into a grand shopping experience. It's about accessibility in an engaging environment.\" Credit: Yi Chuan / Ti Gong Caption: A shopper examines handmade accessories at a market stall, showcasing the blend of local craftsmanship and creativity at Hong Shou Fang. That philosophy permeates the mall's design and operations. From hosting community events to offering discounts to elderly residents who prefer paying in cash, Hong Shou Fang has gone the extra mile to ensure that people feel at home. It offers a sense of connection and belonging that online shopping cannot replace. \"We want to see how this community-first retail model will expand, not just in Shanghai, but probably across China,\" Wang added. \"It's about understanding the local culture and needs, and adapting our commercial spaces to fit them. We live in a time when people are looking for more than just products. They want experiences and connections.\" The community-first approach isn't the only one capturing the hearts and wallets of often fickle consumers. Diversity is becoming the hallmark of Shanghai's retail landscape. Joy City on Xizang Road N., developed by Joy City Property Ltd (0207.HK), and Bailian ZX on Nanjing Road E., developed by Bailian Group (600827.SH), are two downtown malls that have distinguished themselves by adopting themes of fantasy to cater to younger shoppers. Step into these spaces, and you're instantly transported into a neon-lit wonderland of anime and pop culture. Teens in pastel wigs and elaborate cosplay outfits crowd around capsule-toy vending machines, their laughter mingling with the upbeat soundtrack of a Pokémon-themed café. Shelves are lined with limited-edition figurines, manga and related merchandise, with ardent fans willing to queue for hours and spend hundreds, or even thousands, of yuan. \"It's not just about buying,\" said Li Aixuan, a sixth-grader from Minhang District. \"It's about seeing the cosplayers and feeling like you're a part of the world you're a fan of.\" She and her classmates regularly travel at least once a month for about an hour by Metro to visit the malls. The appeal of these spaces is obvious. There's always something new and exciting to greet consumers – from commemorative ticket stubs from Jujutsu Kaisen and Neon Genesis Evangelion exhibitions to pop-up shops featuring Blue Lock and virtual idol events like Luo Tianyi's birthday party. Credit: Li Aixuan / Ti Gong Caption: Anime-themed pop-up displays at Joy City feature vibrant and larger-than-life illustrations of beloved characters. Bailian ZX opened in January 2023 from a makeover of the former Hualian Mall. It quickly earned a reputation as the \"mecca of anime culture,\" the first of its kind in China. The mall houses over 40 brands, including global first stores such as Tamashii Nations, MegaHouse, and Aniplex, alongside flagship stores from brands like Animate and GoodSmile Store. Ye Xiaojing, project leader behind Bailian ZX, said the key to capturing the attention of Gen-Z lies in catering to their rapidly changing tastes. \"For the post-1995 generation, trends last three months or less,\" Ye said in an earlier interview. \"The core of the business is 'content differentiation.' We need to continuously deliver strong content.\" From pop-up stores to major events, Bailian ZX keeps energy levels high. In its first year, the mall hosted over 450 events, achieving sales of 300 million yuan (US$41.4 million) and attracting nearly 10 million visitors. By November 2024, the mall's sales had increased 76 percent, with foot traffic up by 40 percent and a membership base swelling to over 260,000. What was once a mall with daily foot traffic of around 6,000 people now sees an average of 20,000-30,000 visitors per day, with peak days reaching over 90,000. This surge in popularity was further amplified by the 2024 BW Anime Festival last summer, which helped the mall achieve a record-breaking 210,000 visitors and sales exceeding 10 million yuan over just three days. Indeed, the retail landscape is rapidly changing to adapt to new consumer trends and bolster limp balance sheets. Is it enough amid a general slowdown in consumer spending nationwide? Everyone in the industry is closely watching to find out what works and what is the best path forward.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. The Personal Income and Outlay data — the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of consumer spending and inflation — were released on Friday. There is some good news but also some that is disturbing. The central bank will take notice and probably reconsider how much more interest rates could be cut this year. They’ll have no choice, if this becomes a trend, it could set off a recession. Why The Fed Watches Consumer Spending The Fed pays close attention to consumer spending because, directly and indirectly, it touches on the organization’s dual mandate to maintain stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. About 70% of gross domestic product, the common measure of the economy, is consumer spending. When spending grows, so does the economy. The economy slows when consumers keep their money in their pockets. When spending increases, companies see more business and eventually need more help. As spending trails off, companies eventually postpone hiring. If markets get worse, executives eventually lay off workers. The central bank has to balance both concerns and the activities of consumers are a critical gauge, as are jobs and unemployment rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials at the organization have been clear that a single month’s data can be an aberration. Then again, they can be the start of a trend. Why PCE Is So Important When it comes to consumer spending and inflation, there are two measures the Fed and others can use. One is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is the compilation of research into how much a standard set of products and services cost in different places of the p There are two parts to the data. One is disposable personal income, called DPI, and personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. The latter shows how prices rise. In other words, it’s a measure of inflation, like the CPI. MORE FOR YOU Many experts and businesses focus on CPI but the Fed prefers CPI : “While the two are similar, the PCE index is constructed in a way that accounts for how Americans are spending their money at a given time and more quickly adapts to changes in spending patterns.” What The PCE Data Showed There was good news. The Core PCE index, similar to headline inflation with CPI, was up 0.3% month over month and up 2.6% year-over-year. That was down from 2.9% in December and was expected. And some data complicated things. DPI was up 0.9%, increasing $194.3 billion. And yet, personal spending was down 0.2% from December when projections were an increase of 0.1%. December had been up 0.7% over November. Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets Research, said in a note that real spending, which would be after inflation, was down 0.5%, reversing an increase in December. The pullback in buying was broadly based. “Even real services spending was on the light side, up just 0.1%,” he wrote. Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an emailed note called the report the “ultimate double-edged sword.” He also pointed out that the savings rate rose to 4.6%, “the highest since mid-2024 as consumers tempered their views on the economy.” Trying To Understand The Consumer Spending Drop A cold January and wildfires in Southern California might have been factors, as a desire to pay down credit card bills after holiday shopping. Data from Moody’s Analytics the other day said almost half of consumer spending comes from the economic top 10% of households, which alone presents a risk. But if the rest of consumers also pull back purchasing, because they’re stretching themselves financially, there could still be an economic cooldown. It’s too soon to claim a trend, but not too soon to pay attention and be vigilant. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER... FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

    "article_text": "By Lucia Mutikani February 28, 2025 – 7:30 AM PST REUTERS/Andrew Kelly WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly fell in January while the annual increase in inflation slowed, supporting financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve would resume cutting interest rates in June. But the moderation in annual inflation, which partly reflected last year’s high readings dropping out of the calculation, is unlikely to be sustained as President Donald Trump’s administration ratchets up tariffs on imports, which economists warned would raise prices. Consumers’ one-year inflation expectations soared in February. “The good news is consumer inflation broke the curse of the January effect,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “The bad news is consumers are scrambling to process the winds of change coming out of Washington and have apparently decided to sit it out and wait.” Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.2% last month after an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in December, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday. Advertisement Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.1% after a previously reported 0.7% surge in December, when outlays were boosted by pre-emptive buying in anticipation of tariffs. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.5%, the biggest decline since February 2021. Some of the weakness in consumer spending last month likely reflected the fading lift from front-running as well as a drag from unseasonably cold temperatures and snowstorms that engulfed large parts of the country. Wildfires, which scorched areas of Los Angeles, also probably hurt spending. There was also weakness in spending at restaurants and bars, suggesting that consumers were tightening their purse strings. Winter storms disrupted homebuilding last month and helped to curb job growth. The data are consistent with expectations for a slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter, which was reinforced by other data on Friday showing the goods trade deficit surged to a record high last month as businesses front-loaded imports to avoid duties. Following the soft consumer spending data and deterioration in the goods trade deficit, economists are likely to slash their gross domestic product growth forecasts for the first quarter, which are currently below a 2.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the fourth quarter. In addition to the weather, economic activity is also seen hampered by the Trump administration’s policies, including sharp spending cuts, which have so far led to the firing of tens of thousands of federal government workers and contractors. Trump in his first month in office has issued a cascade of tariff orders, imposing an additional 10% levy on goods from China. On Thursday, Trump said a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods will take effect on March 4, after being delayed for a month, along with an extra 10% duty on Chinese imports. Other duties aimed at imported steel, aluminum and motor vehicles will either soon go into effect or are in fast-track development. Business and consumer confidence have deteriorated on concerns over tariffs. PRICES STILL ELEVATED The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in January, matching December’s unrevised gain. The rise was in line with economists’ expectations. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 2.5% after increasing 2.6% in December. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.3% last month after an unrevised 0.2% rise in December. In the 12 months through January, core prices increased 2.6% after climbing 2.9% in December. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. Financial markets expect the Fed will resume cutting rates in June. Stocks on Wall Street opened mixed. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were lower. The U.S. central bank paused rate cuts in January, leaving its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it started its easing cycle. Minutes of the U.S. central bank’s January 28-29 policy meeting published last week showed policymakers were worried about higher inflation from Trump’s initial policy proposals. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation. A separate report from the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau showed the goods trade deficit surged 25.6% to $153.3 billion last month, an all-time high and potentially putting trade on course to be a drag on GDP this quarter. Goods imports vaulted 11.9% to $325.4 billion. Export of goods rose 2.0% to $172.2 billion last month. Trade contributed to growth last quarter.

    "article_text": "US consumer spending posts first drop in almost two years US consumer spending posts first drop in almost two years · Reuters Lucia Mutikani February 28, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for the first time in nearly two years in January and the goods trade deficit widened to a record high as businesses front-loaded imports to avoid tariffs, setting up the economy for weak growth or even a contraction this quarter. While the data from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed a moderation in annual inflation last month, prices showed some stickiness, with fairly solid monthly gains. In addition, President Donald Trump's administration is ratcheting up tariffs, which economists said would raise prices as businesses pass on the higher costs of imported goods to consumers. Consumers' inflation expectations soared in February. The Atlanta Federal Reserve slashed its gross domestic product estimate for the first quarter to show the economy contracting at a 1.5% annualized rate from a 2.3% growth pace earlier. Financial markets now expect the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates in June following a pause in January to give policymakers time to assess the economic impact of the administration's policies. \"The combination of sticky inflation and a potential growth scare, which is evident in this report, will likely present a worrisome monetary policy conundrum for the Fed,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings. \"The outlook gets even murkier as the threat of tariffs permeates business and consumer confidence. We may be entering a deer in the headlights moment for the Fed.\" Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. That was the first decline since March 2023 and the biggest decrease in nearly four years. It followed an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in December, which previously was reported as a 0.7% advance. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.1%. Outlays in prior months were boosted by pre-emptive buying ahead of tariffs, which reversed in January. Unseasonably cold temperatures and snowstorms that engulfed large parts of the country were likely drags on spending as were wildfires, which scorched areas of Los Angeles. Spending on goods tumbled 1.2%, led by motor vehicles, recreational goods, household furniture, clothing and footwear as well as food and beverages. Services outlays rose 0.3%, lifted by spending on housing and utilities as well as food services and accommodation. They offset a decline in expenditures by nonprofit institutions, which economists attributed to deep spending cuts at the United States Agency for International Development. Story Continues The agency has been the biggest casualty in an unprecedented campaign by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, - an entity created by Trump - to slash spending and shrink the federal government. \"Even though it is called the Agency for International Development, it spent a lot domestically,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.5%, the biggest decline since February 2021, reversing December's 0.5% gain. The weak so-called real consumer spending followed on the heels of a decline in homebuilding last month. A separate report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed the goods trade deficit jumped 25.6% to $153.3 billion last month, an all-time high as imports vaulted 11.9%. Exports increased 2.0%. Though the surge in imports was likely precautionary, it nonetheless added to the stream of negative data for the January-March quarter. The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the fourth quarter, driven by consumer spending. STRONG INCOME GROWTH Still, spending remains underpinned by a resilient labor market, which is helping to keep household income elevated. Personal income shot up 0.9%, also boosted by cost of living adjustments for social security recipients. Wages rose 0.4%. With income outpacing spending, the saving rate increased to a seven-month high of 4.6% from 3.5% in December. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. Trump in his first month in office has issued a cascade of tariff orders, imposing an additional 10% levy on goods from China. On Thursday, Trump said a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods will take effect on March 4, after being delayed for a month, along with an extra 10% duty on Chinese imports. Other duties aimed at imported steel, aluminum and motor vehicles will either soon go into effect or are in fast-track development. The administration is also firing federal workers, with spillovers to contractors, actions that economists warned could impact spending. News on inflation was mixed. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% in January, matching December's unrevised gain and economists' expectations. Goods prices increased 0.5% amid higher costs of motor vehicles and gasoline. Services prices climbed 0.2%, with strong gains in the costs of recreation services partially offset by a decline in the prices of healthcare. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 2.5% after increasing 2.6% in December. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.3% last month after an unrevised 0.2% rise in December. In the 12 months through January, core inflation increased 2.6% after climbing 2.9% in December. Annual inflation is slowing as last year's big rises drop out of the calculation, which could persist for a few months. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. The U.S. central bank paused rate cuts in January, leaving its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it started its easing cycle. Minutes of the U.S. central bank's January 28-29 policy meeting published last week showed officials were worried about higher inflation from Trump's initial policy proposals. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation. \"Tariffs are the most obvious threat to the pricing environment and the last few tenths to the Fed's 2% target remain in the crosshairs,\" said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo.

According to the BEA, the increase in real GDP in Q4 reflected increases in consumer spending and government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Real GDP was revised up by less than 0.1 percentage point from the advance estimate released last month, primarily reflecting upward revisions to government spending and exports that were partly offset by downward revisions to consumer spending and investment. Compared to the third quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected downturns in investment and exports that were partly offset by an acceleration in consumer spending. Imports turned down. While the GDP numbers are meaningless - and stale - what traders paid a bit more attention to what the deflator, the price index and core PCE all of which were revised hotter than initially reported, to wit: The GDP price index increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter, revised up 0.1% from the previous estimate. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 2.4%, also revised up 0.1%. And excluding food and energy prices, the core PCE price index increased 2.7%, revised up 0.2%. But aside for the modest upward revision in core prices, don't expect anyone to focus much on this data which is not only stale but irrelevant (it reflects the last quarter of Biden's political regime) and now that Trump is president all that matters is i) tariffs and ii) whether they will be inflationary and boost growth, or deflationary and spark a recession.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (David Zalubowski, Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) WASHINGTON – The American economy grew at a solid 2.3% annual rate the last three months of 2024, supported by a burst of year-end consumer spending, the government said, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of fourth-quarter growth. The outlook for 2025 is cloudier as President Donald Trump pursues trade wars , cutbacks in the federal workforce and mass deportations . Recommended Videos The Commerce Department reported Thursday that growth in gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — decelerated from a 3.1% pace in July-September 2024. For all of last year, the economy grew 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023. Consumer spending advanced at a 4.2% pace from October through December. Business investment fell in the fourth quarter, pushed lower by a 9% drop in equipment spending. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.81 percentage points off October-December growth. But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 3% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter and down slightly from the government's initial estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Wednesday’s report also showed that inflationary pressure persists in the economy. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.4% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed’s 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.7%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter. Both those inflation numbers were slightly higher than they’d been in the Commerce Department's initial report. The report shows that Trump inherited a healthy economy when he took office last month. Growth has now topped a decent 2% for nine of the last 10 quarters. Unemployment is low at 4%, and inflation has come down from the highs it hit in mid-2022. After lowering its benchmark interest rate three times in the last four months of 2024, the Federal Reserve left it unchanged in January and appears to be in no hurry to start cutting again. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months. President Donald Trump's plans to impose tax imports at a scale not seen since the 1930s risks raising prices and intensifying inflationary pressure. Deporting millions of immigrants working in the country illegally, as Trump has promised, could also create labor shortages that push up wages and feed inflation. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week to the highest level in three months . Some economists expect those numbers to tick higher as layoffs of federal workers ordered Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency start to show up in the data. High Frequency Economics already expects January-March GDP growth to fall below 1%, lower if Trump goes ahead with plans to slap 25% taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico. On Thursday, Trump vowed to do just that early next week. Thursday's GDP report was the second of three Commerce Department looks at fourth-quarter economic growth.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Erik Sherman reports on business, economics, finance, tech, and law. Follow Author Feb 26, 2025, 11:58pm EST Feb 27, 2025, 10:50am EST Share Save Comment Man lighting up a cigar with US dollar bill, getty Companies want to keep their biggest customers happy, so they often provide accommodations to do so. And, as it turns out, the government — if it doesn’t already do so — probably wishes it did because the wealthiest households have become an utterly critical part of the economy through wealthy consumer spending. Wealthy Consumer Spending And GDP Gross domestic product — the total market value of all goods and services produced in a country — is, at least in the U.S., increasingly dependent on consumer spending. Data from the Bureau of Economic Advisors shows that personal consumption expenditures, another name for consumer spending, is currently 69.8% of GDP. It wasn’t always this way. Other parts of the economy were more prominent aspects of GDP in the past. Below is a graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis using data from the BEA to show the percentage of GDP that consumer spending represents. The percentage of GDP that is consumer spending, shown over time. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The numbers on the vertical axis are decimal representations of percentages. To understand the percentage, take the number on the left and shift the decimal point to places to the right: 0.690 means 69.0%. MORE FOR YOU However, numbers that seem statistical don’t necessarily mean much if you don’t know how the results are distributed. Here is where Moody’s Analytics comes in . The firm recently analyzed data from the Federal Reserve and found some interesting facts that The Wall Street Journal subsequently reported. Wealthy consumer spending is half of all consumer spending. First, the top 10% of earners are those households that make at least $250,000 a year and go up from there. They’ve been spending a lot, as in almost half (49.7%) of all consumer spending. Thirty years ago, the percentage was about 36%. The high earners increased their spending by 12% between September 2023 and September 2024 at a much faster rate than inflation. Over the last four years, prices were up by 21%. The top 10% of households upped their spending by 58%. The bottom 80% of households increased their spending by 25%, and they had far fewer resources to manage the change. Wealthy consumer spending has never been better. “The finances of the well-to-do have never been better, their spending never stronger and the economy never more dependent on that group,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the Journal . Those at the top tend to be older, better educated, and the owners of homes and stocks that have boosted their net worth. They can spend more than the 90% of people who are below them. Many in the country had some savings from government stimulus programs during the Covid-19 pandemic to keep things steady — the total was an estimated $2.6 trillion. Then inflation set in, prices jumped, and most people burned through that money. The value of assets for the bottom 80% grew a total of $14 trillion because government policies created a lot of money. The top 20%, already possessing strong incomes, put money into assets that grew in value. They collectively saw their net worth jump by $35 trillion, or 2.5 times as much as the big majority. The arrangement shows one major risk of income inequality. The status of the economy largely rests on a small sliver of the population. The World Economic Forum has calculated U.S. income distribution and found that 10% of households have incomes of $200,000 or more . In other words, 34.7% of GDP depends on less than 10% of households. If anything happens to that group’s, whether ill-fortune or whim, the entire economy could suffer a major blow. All this puts actions by government officials into a different light. Yes, the wealthy have an impact on political spending and get their interests well represented in Congress. But there is a new undercurrent. No politician wants to preside over a time when the economy falls. If they don’t keep the wealthy consumer spending flowing freely, it could negatively affect GDP and reelection chances. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions LOADING VIDEO PLAYER...

Retail vs. commercial banking​: What's the difference? While both offer similar services, there are some key differences, too. Yahoo Personal Finance · d3sign via Getty Images E Emily Batdorf February 25, 2025 4 min read As an individual or business owner, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the banking options out there. Understanding the differences between retail and commercial banking can help. Retail banking targets individual consumers, offering products like deposit accounts and loans. On the other hand, commercial banks serve businesses, governmental bodies, and institutions. Importantly, some banks offer retail and commercial banking, catering to both types of customers. Read on to learn more about retail and commercial banking, as well as key differences between the two. What is retail banking? Retail banking encompasses the banking products and services geared toward “retail” customers or individual consumers. You may also hear retail banking referred to as consumer banking or personal banking. If you have a personal checking or savings account, you’re a customer of a retail bank. Retail banking is available at several types of institutions, from small community banks and credit unions to large national banks. At these larger banks, retail banking may be one division of the larger bank’s offerings. You can also access retail banking through online banks. Read more: These are the 20 biggest banks in the U.S. Because retail banking serves individual customers rather than large corporations, it often involves smaller transactions and tends to be less profitable than commercial banking. Retail banking products and services Retail banking includes a range of products and services aimed at helping consumers manage their money. Common examples include: Deposit accounts: Retail banking customers can open checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). These accounts provide a secure place to save, earn interest, receive deposits, and more. Mortgages: Many retail banks provide mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to individuals purchasing homes or those wanting to borrow against their home equity. Loans and lines of credit: Retail banks may offer several types of loans, including personal loans, auto loans, and student loans. These loans help qualified customers finance a range of expenses. Credit cards: Many banks offer a variety of credit cards, which allow customers to borrow, earn rewards, and take advantage of purchase protection. Investments and insurance: You may be able to open investment accounts — such as IRAs and health savings accounts (HSAs) — and purchase investments from retail banks. And some offer insurance policies too. Branch access: Some retail banks have a network of branches to serve customers in person. On the other hand, some banks operate entirely online. Online and mobile banking: Many retail banks cater to online users with robust mobile and desktop banking platforms. These tools let you view your balances, make transfers, pay bills, deposit checks, and more. Read more: 10 best mobile banking apps of 2025 What is commercial banking? Commercial banking, sometimes referred to as corporate banking, refers to the banking products and services catered to corporations, businesses, and government organizations. Commercial banks may even serve a specific business type, model, or industry. Because commercial banking serves large corporate bodies, its products and services differ from those of retail banking. (However, commercial banks may have retail banking divisions catering to individuals and businesses.) Many large national banks — like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America — offer commercial banking services. But smaller regional banks and credit unions can offer these services too. Due to its customer base, commercial banking typically involves larger transactions, loans, and fees compared to retail banking. Read more: Community bank vs. credit union: Key differences Commercial banking products and services Common commercial banking products and services may include: Deposit accounts: Like individual consumers, businesses need checking and savings accounts to help them save, manage money, and pay bills. Credit and financing: Commercial banks offer business credit cards, loans, and other types of financing that allow businesses to grow and expand. International banking: International banking helps businesses and other entities transact across borders, including payment processing, asset management, and investment banking. Treasury management: These services help businesses manage their cash flow, receivables and payables, debt, merchant services, and more. Wealth management: Like retail banking, commercial banking can also include wealth management services, such as succession planning, retirement planning, and trust services.

Retail vs. commercial banking: Key differences Though retail and commercial banking have many similarities, they also differ in several ways. The following is a look at some key differences between them. Customers Retail banking caters to individual customers, while commercial banking caters to small and large businesses, corporations, and government entities. Products and services Retail banks typically offer deposit accounts, loans, credit cards, and investment accounts. Meanwhile, commercial banking offers all of this, plus international banking, Treasury management, and more. Transaction value Because retail banking caters to individuals, this type of banking typically deals in smaller transactions. Commercial banking, on the other hand, often facilitates much larger transactions at a larger scale. Purpose While retail banking assists individuals in borrowing, saving, and building wealth, commercial banks offer products and services aimed at facilitating business growth. Profitability Retail banks are generally less profitable than commercial banks for several reasons. First, as mentioned above, retail banks deal with smaller transactions compared to commercial banks. Second, many retail banks operate a wide network of brick-and-mortar branches, which can cut into profitability.

The 'Mumbai in Minutes' initiative will cut travel times and enhance connectivity through ring roads, expressways, and a 337-kilometre metro network, significantly benefiting retail and commercial sectors. ETRetail Desk ETRetail Updated On Feb 24, 2025 at 03:36 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook New Delhi: In a keynote session titled ‘Connectivity to Commerce: How MMRDA is Powering Mumbai’s Retail and Real Estate Boom’ at The Economic Times Great India Retail Summit 2025, Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, IAS, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, outlined an ambitious roadmap for Mumbai’s infrastructure transformation aimed at boosting retail and commercial growth. “The biggest thing that retail requires is accessibility and connectivity,” Mukherjee emphasized, introducing the Mumbai in Minutes initiative , which aims to cut travel times across the city to under an hour. He detailed how a network of seven ring roads, multiple expressways, and metro lines are being developed to ensure seamless movement across Mumbai, benefiting retail footfalls and consumer convenience. Advt MMRDA’s short-term agenda focuses on accelerating major infrastructure projects, including the completion of key road networks such as the Western Coastal Road and the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), both of which will enhance connectivity between Mumbai and its suburban and satellite towns. The organization is also integrating metro corridors with commercial spaces, offering retail opportunities at transit hubs. “Our metro network of 337 kilometres under development is set to revolutionize the way Mumbai commutes. This will open new avenues for retail and commercial hubs,” Mukherjee said, noting that the city’s retail landscape will evolve significantly in the next five years as these projects reach completion. MMRDA is also spearheading the development of Mumbai 3.0, a fourth-generation city near the Atal Setu, designed to accommodate retail and commercial growth. “This is an open invitation for suggestions on whether we can have a dedicated retail corridor,” Mukherjee stated, emphasizing the potential for a focused retail zone within the new city. On the role of small businesses, Mukherjee stressed, “Mumbai needs both large and small retailers. Through metro retail spaces, commercial zones, and logistics hubs, we are ensuring that businesses of all sizes thrive.” He also highlighted the integration of retail spaces within metro stations to create high-footfall commercial zones. Advt Mukherjee pointed to major upcoming developments such as the Vidar-Varasova Sea Link, the expansion of suburban rail networks, and the construction of multimodal corridors that will further enhance connectivity across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Additionally, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project is set to bring down travel time from Palghar to BKC to just 30 minutes, presenting new opportunities for retail expansion.

ETRetail Desk ETRetail Updated On Feb 22, 2025 at 11:11 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Mumbai: Following an electrifying Day 1, The Economic Times Great India Retail Summit (ETGIRS) 2025 continued its momentum into Day 2, featuring thought-provoking fireside chats, industry-shaping panel discussions, and partner-driven innovation sessions.

    "article_text": "Bank stocks struggled today as investors grew more concerned about the economy and the strength of consumers. Shares of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM 0.43% ) , the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, fell 4.5%. Shares of investment banks and asset managers Goldman Sachs ( GS +1.65% ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS +0.83% ) also fell 3.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Investors aren't ready for a recession The stock market and the consumer have proven extraordinarily resilient over the last few years, despite high inflation and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates over 530 basis points (5.3%) in a relatively short period. Although inflation is not at the Federal Reserve's 2% preferred target and some worry that it might revert higher, investors have largely shaken off these concerns this year. Expand NYSE : JPM JPMorgan Chase Today's Change ( -0.43 %) $ -1.37 Current Price $ 315.52 Key Data Points Market Cap $863B Day's Range $ 315.32 - $ 319.00 52wk Range $ 202.16 - $ 319.56 Volume 256K Avg Vol 7.9M Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield 0.02 % The threat of a slowdown in the economy or a recession has not been in focus with a strong labor market and economy that seems bulletproof, but signs of a potential recession have rattled the market on a few occasions over the last few years. That seems to be the culprit behind today's market's sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up 500 points. Consumer retail giant Walmart ( WMT +1.00% ) , often viewed as a proxy for how people feel about spending, reported earnings this morning along with timid guidance that left investors questioning whether consumer spending may be at or close to a peak. Consumer spending contributes over two-thirds of gross domestic product, so a slowdown can lead to a slowdown in the economy. Expand NYSE : GS Goldman Sachs Group Today's Change ( 1.65 %) $ 13.11 Current Price $ 810.31 Key Data Points Market Cap $239B Day's Range $ 795.61 - $ 812.00 52wk Range $ 439.38 - $ 825.25 Volume 1.5M Avg Vol 1.9M Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield 0.02 % \"If Walmart is giving bad guidance, you should be paying attention to it,\" Tom Fitzpatrick, a managing director at R.J. O'Brien and Associates, said, according to CNBC. \"Perhaps this is suggesting that the general consumer is tapped out.\" In other economic news, St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem said he expects interest rates to remain at current levels until there is further evidence that inflation is moving toward 2%, reiterating what his colleagues have been saying for weeks. President Donald Trump also discussed the possibility of more tariffs, which could prove inflationary if implemented. Expand NYSE : MS Morgan Stanley Today's Change ( 0.83 %) $ 1.37 Current Price $ 166.42 Key Data Points Market Cap $262B Day's Range $ 164.81 - $ 166.72 52wk Range $ 94.33 - $ 167.13 Volume 217K Avg Vol 5.3M Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield 0.02 % There didn't appear to be anything specific impacting bank stocks today other than economic news. Banks are cyclical, so it's not a surprise to see them selling off on concerns over weakened spending. A slower economy or recession can ultimately impact many different businesses at banks, from consumer and commercial lending to investment banking if companies decide to put off mergers and acquisitions or initial public offerings. Banks are generally well positioned Given the extent of interest rate hikes over the last three years and previous warning signs of a recession like the inverted yield curve , it's not a surprise to see investors jittery on signs of a drop in consumer spending. However, I still think it's too early to say with any certainty that a recession is coming. Banks are generally well positioned to benefit from better earnings this year, an improving regulatory environment, and more mergers and acquisitions. However, while I don't think they are bad stocks to buy, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley trade at historically high valuations right now. That doesn't mean they won't continue to move higher, but I think investors can likely find more attractive bank stocks in the small- to mid-cap space. These generally trade cheaper and will likely see more M&A activity."

By Michael Gouvalaris Market Overview Published 02/14/2025, 10:07 AM Retail Sales See Biggest Drop Since 2023: Are Interest Rates Squeezing Economy? View all comments (1) 1 Michael Gouvalaris Articles ( 269 ) | My Homepage Follow TTEF 2.41% Total retail sales for January came in at $723.9 billion, a decline of -0.9% for the month. The street was expecting a decline of only -0.2%. This was the biggest one-month decline since March 2023. Although December was revised higher, from +0.4% to +0.7% monthly gain. Total) retail sales are up 4.2% over the last 12 months. After the major spike during COVID, sales have settled within a 3-4% annualized pace. Retail sales minus autos (or core retail sales) also disappointed; coming in at $584.6 billion. A decline of -0.4% for the month, when the street was expecting a gain of 0.3%. Core sales are still up 3.7% over the last 12 months. Retail sales adjusted for inflation (or real retail sales) haven’t gone anywhere for 4 years and still remain below the January 2021 highs. Real sales declined 1.3% for the month, but are up 1.2% over the last 12 months. Breaking down the retail sales report by category, we can see the declines were broad-based among categories. With only 4 of 13 categories positive for the month. Even nonstore retailers (online) posted a decline in January. While over the last 12 months, all but 2 categories are still holding onto gains. Another disappointing retail sales report. After the better-than-expected manufacturing PMI, I was interested to see if it would have an effect on retail sales. Obviously, it hasn’t carried over yet. In response to COVID, consumers were stuck in their homes and stocked up on goods. This caused an initial surge in the sale of goods, but as the economy and world opened up again, we see this has normalized over the last few years. The only reason why total retail sales have moved higher is because of the increase in prices of the goods that are sold (as depicted in the real retail sales chart). The level of demand has not increased. While today's report is a disappointment, if we look at the bigger picture (annualized data): as follows: Total (EPA: TTEF ) retail sales: +4.2% y/y Core retail sales: +3.7% y/y Real retail sales: +1.2% y/y …we can see that sales are still growing at a pace that corresponds to 2-3% economic growth.

Key Characteristics of the Control Group in Retail Sales: Excludes certain categories: Items like autos, gasoline, and building materials are excluded because they are either highly volatile or not considered part of core retail activity. Focus on core consumer spending: It typically includes categories like food and beverage stores, clothing, general merchandise, and electronics. Purpose: Provides a more stable and reliable measure of underlying consumer demand and is closely watched as an input for economic growth analysis. The control group is used by economists and policymakers to understand broader trends in consumer spending without the noise of volatile components."

More recently, we’ve been seeing some easing in consumer sentiment though which might also lead to some softening in consumer spending .

This sparked interest among fund managers, but without clarity on the conditions, the tax regime remained incomplete Srushti Vaidya February 13, 2025 / 11:58 IST Currently, GIFT IFSC has 139 fund management entities (FMEs). Of these, 123 are registered as non-retail schemes with only eight as retail schemes, and the balance as authorised FME schemes The fund management business in GIFT City may appear thriving, with numerous PMS and AIFs being set up. However, a closer look at the mutual fund segment—or retail schemes—reveals a different story as growth in this space has been sluggish, to say the least. Currently, GIFT IFSC has 139 fund management entities (FMEs). Of these, 123 are registered as non-retail schemes with only eight as retail schemes, and the balance as authorised FME schemes. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Experts attribute this slow uptake to regulatory uncertainty, restrictions on marketing retail schemes to NRIs, and the absence of significant tax benefits for choosing a retail scheme in GIFT City. The IFSC fund management regulations allowed retail schemes in IFSC in 2022, but the absence of a tax regime aligning them with offshore funds created uncertainty. As a result, fund managers were hesitant to set up retail schemes. In January this year, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) came out with a circular outlining the conditions. \"The conditions prescribed in the circular, such as limits on investment in unlisted securities and associate entities, are quite onerous for retail schemes to satisfy,\" said Suresh Swamy, partner at Price Waterhouse & Co. He added that a result of this, retail schemes are yet to take off in IFSC. Related stories Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tech Mahindra, Aurobindo Pharma, Garden Reach, Bharat Forge, M... Trade setup for November 12: Top 15 things to know before the opening bells Corporates' new cost of capital: Climate stress testing earnings visibilitya An official noted that the CBDT circular still lacks clarity on certain aspects. Specifically, there is ambiguity regarding what qualifies as a passive breach and the timeline for rectifying such breaches. For instance, the official explained that a stock in a retail scheme can have a maximum weightage of 25 percent. However, if this limit is exceeded due to an increase in valuations, the circular does not specify how long fund managers have to bring it back within the permissible range. Also read GIFT City to soon see first set of direct listings as companies finalise IPO papers Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Similarly, another example of a passive breach is the requirement for a fund to have at least 20 clients. If one or two clients exit the fund, the circular does not provide a clear timeline for compliance. This lack of clarity discourages retail schemes from setting up operations in GIFT City, experts say. Vinod Joseph, partner at Economic Laws Practice said that it is more a matter of who can invest in mutual funds based out of GIFT City. \"If you set up a retail fund in GIFT City for the purpose of investing into India, such retail fund can't raise more than a small percentage of its corpus from Indian investors, because of FEMA restrictions,\" he added. While when it comes to foreign investors, he says that there are a lot of restrictions for marketing the funds to retail investors in foreign countries. \"Sending a marketing email or even a WhatsApp text to NRIs or foreign retail investors is subject to many restrictions imposed by regulators in those geographies. But in the case of institutional investors and HNIs, collecting money from them is relatively easier because of fewer restrictions on marketing,\" Joseph added. No real benefit There is no real benefit for a retail scheme investing in equities in GIFT City as compared to direct investments in Indian equities from overseas, said Swamy. The reason - the tax rates for both are same. However, in case of debt investments, retail schemes in GIFT City can be more attractive as the capital gain exemption on the same is prescribed in the law, he adds. \"In the case of direct investment from overseas investors, a capital gains tax of 12.5 percent for long-term here is a tax is levied while it is 30 percent for short-term, subject to treaty benefits, he adds.

    "article_text": "Maurie Backman February 11, 2025 at 10:20 AM 1 Copied Key Points Some retail jobs pay better than others. Retail can be a good stepping stone to a lucrative career. Working your way into management could lead to higher pay. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) There are certain jobs that tend to lend themselves to giant paychecks. Lawyers typically do quite well, as to people who work in the financial industry. But when we think of large salaries, retail jobs don't tend to come to mind. Although many retail jobs do pay above minimum wage, the industry on a whole isn't exactly known to pay well. But this Reddit poster does surprisingly well working as an associate manager at a retail store. They recently shared their W-2 tax form, which showed an annual wage of roughly $80,000. If that surprises you, you're probably not alone. But you may not want to write off a job in retail just yet given the earnings potential. You can do quite well for yourself in retail You're probably not going to earn more as a retail associate or even manager than someone who's a partner at a law or accounting firm. But that doesn't mean you can't bring home a very respectable paycheck. You should also know that working retail is a good way to get job experience when you're first starting out. A lot of people end up getting hired at better-paying jobs when the only experience they have on their resumes is retail. And the nice thing about retail is that you can often get hired without much work experience. You also don’t necessarily need a college degree to work retail, so if that’s an expense you’re not interested in taking on, it may not be an issue. Of course, working retail isn't easy, and it requires a number of important skills. You have to be good with people, good at juggling priorities, and good at time management. You also have to be a problem-solver who can think on their feet. These are skills that a retail position can help you develop so that eventually, you're able to work your way into a higher-paying job. And you might also decide that you're happy working your way up in retail. In the post above, an associate manager brought home an $80,000 annual paycheck. But as a manager -- just not associate -- you could be looking at six figures. Plus, some retail chains are known for their generous benefits. These could include paid time off, health insurance, and a 401(k) match. Some retailers might even offer tuition assistance so you can pursue a college degree without having to pay for it all on your own. So all told, it's smart to keep an open mind about working retail. Get help managing your retail paycheck If you work retail, you might assume that you don't earn enough money to work with a financial advisor. But you should know that a financial professional can help you make the most of whatever paycheck you're bringing home -- whether it's $40,000 a year, $80,000 a year, or $150,000 a year. In fact, it's smart to sit down with an advisor when you're first kicking off your career so they can help you manage your paycheck and start saving for long-term goals like retirement early on. And if you have debt, a financial advisor can help you map out a plan so you're paying off that debt while also putting money toward your long-term objectives."

It reflects sales performance only from stores that have been open for at least a year, providing a clearer view of underlying trends in consumer spending without distortions from changes in retail floorspace. This metric is widely used to assess how well retailers are performing in comparable, established locations, making it a reliable indicator of real growth or decline in sales."

    "article_text": "China's consumer inflation surged to a five-month high in January, while producer prices remained in deflation, highlighting mixed consumer spending and weak industrial activity. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.5% year-on-year, exceeding December’s 0.1% gain and surpassing market expectations. Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, accelerated to 0.6% from 0.4%. The Lunar New Year, which fell in January this year versus February in 2024, influenced price hikes, particularly in travel and entertainment. Airfare prices jumped 8.9%, tourism inflation hit 7.0%, and movie ticket costs soared 11.0%. However, consumer spending remained subdued, with per capita holiday expenditure rising just 1.2% compared to 9.4% in 2024, signaling concerns over wages and job security. Despite inflationary pressures, producer prices stayed in deflation, with the producer price index (PPI) falling 2.3% in January, marking 28 consecutive months of decline. Persistent overcapacity in industrial goods suggests factory-gate prices are unlikely to recover soon. Analysts warn deflationary trends may persist unless Beijing stimulates domestic demand. Economic challenges have intensified amid declining manufacturing and weaker services activity. While China is expected to maintain its 2025 growth target of around 5%, fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could further pressure exports, one of the economy’s few strong sectors last year. The Chinese government is unlikely to adjust monetary or fiscal policy before the annual parliament session in March, with external uncertainties currently ranking as a higher priority. Policymakers remain cautious as they navigate economic headwinds, aiming to stabilize growth amid ongoing global and domestic challenges."

    "article_text": "Is private investment expected to rise? | Explained Will the tax incentives and other measures announced in the Budget help spur consumer demand? Published - February 09, 2025 05:08 am IST Prashanth Perumal J. READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Image used for representation only. | Photo Credit: Getty Images The story so far: With the government providing a tax stimulus through income tax breaks to boost consumer spending and the RBI cutting interest rates for the first time in nearly five years, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said she was quite optimistic of the tide turning on private investments in the months to come. Addressing the media, she said, “anecdotal evidence suggests a pick-up in investment activity.” Ms. Sitharaman said that she had heard from different sources that orders for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) for the period April to June were already getting booked, and that “industry is clearly seeing the signs of a possible recovery of consumption.” Why was there a concern? Private investment in India, which has been on a downward trajectory for more than a decade, showed further signs of weakening in the latest quarter . Private investment plans dropped by 1.4% in the December 2024-2025 quarter even though investments overall increased by 9.9% due to a significant rise in public investments by the Centre and State governments, which grew by 11.8% and 34.6%, respectively. Private investment matters because it helps build physical, human, and other forms of capital that ultimately help increase the amount of goods and services produced in an economy. It should also be noted that private investment is generally considered to be more efficient than public investment, which is undertaken by the government. This is because private investors are subject to the discipline of profits and losses in the marketplace, which ensures that capital is allocated towards the most urgent needs of consumers. Public investments are not subject to the same degree of market discipline. But notably, public investment is viewed as a major reason behind the high growth numbers reported by India in recent years. Relax State, local laws to encourage private sector growth: Economic Survey What determines private investment? It is generally believed that money deposited as savings in banks by ordinary citizens is loaned out to fund large-scale investments. But in reality, private investment depends not on savings levels in the economy but on the pace at which loans are created by the banking system. This is because banks can create loans electronically through simple accounting entries that deposit money in borrowers’ accounts even without savings to back these loans. So, there is a strong positive relationship between bank credit growth and the level of private investment, with heathy bank credit growth driving private sector investment higher. In fact, bank credit growth averaged about 22% between 2005 and 2014 when economic growth was high, before dropping precipitously to just around 9% between 2014 and 2021 when the economy began to slow down. Why has private investment been sluggish? Many economists have blamed the lack of sufficient consumer demand for the lack of strong private investment in the country. They argue that unless the government does something to increase the amount of money that consumers have in their hands to spend, investors would be unwilling to take the risk of investing in business projects. Given this backdrop, making incomes up to ₹12 lakh tax-free is seen as an attempt to put more money in the hands of individuals to boost consumer spending and spur private investment. However, over the decades, there has been an inverse or negative relationship between private investment and consumer spending. Private final consumption expenditure stood at a high of 90% of GDP way back in 1950-51, from where it dropped gradually over the decades to hit a low of 54.7% of GDP in 2010-11. At the same time, private investment as a percentage of GDP rose from around 10% in the decades between independence and economic liberalisation to around 27% in 2007-08. Interestingly, from around the time when private investment hit a peak in 2011-12, private consumer spending has actually risen, not fallen. In other words, over the last decade or so, consumer spending has actually risen at the same time that private investment has dropped from its peak. This suggests that the negative relationship between private investment and consumer spending could simply be due to the fact that the money in an economy that is not invested is spent on consumption, and vice-versa. Given this, policy uncertainty and unfriendly government policies are cited as the major reasons behind the slowdown in private investment. Many analysts have pointed to the drop in the pace of economic reforms as discouraging private investors from undertaking long-term capital-intensive investment projects.

Amid rising interest rates over the past few years, one thing that has remained relatively strong is consumer spending. Last quarter, consumer spending increased by 4.2%, the fastest pace since Q1 2023. In December alone, spending rose by 0.7%, topping analysts' estimates. The Bureau of Economic Analysis report also shows that Americans were saving less to spend more. Income increased by just 0.4%, which was less than spending, meaning that people reduced their savings to make up the difference. This isn't a great sign for Americans' personal finances, but it helps companies like Visa and Mastercard. More spending drives higher payment volumes that go through these companies' networks. These companies mainly generate revenue by charging fees on the value of transactions. Below, I’ll discuss recent results from these two financial services stocks that are showing strong consumer spending translates to their business. I’ll also discuss the potential impact of tariffs on the business and why I am not overly concerned. Volume, Revenue, and Earnings Growth Are Strong Both companies saw strong increases in payment volume that went through their networks in the final quarter of 2024. The figure grew by 9% for Visa, an acceleration from 8% in Q3. For Mastercard, the figure increased by 12%, up from 10%. These are the most important drivers of revenue growth for both firms. They helped Visa's revenues increase by 11%, and Mastercard's revenues rise by 16% on a constant currency basis. This topline growth helped Visa and Mastercard increase their adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 14% and 22%, respectively. Analyzing the Effect of Tariffs With President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on major trading partners, it is pertinent to discuss the potential impact on Visa and Mastercard. Trump announced tariffs of 10% on China, 25% on Canada, and 25% on Mexico. Trump agreed to pause the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but they remain on the verge of implementation and would impact the economy significantly. Looking back at the first trade war Trump started with China can provide some insight. Trump began to put tariffs on China in Jul. 2018, before significantly reducing them in Jan. 2020. Through that period, Visa and Mastercard stock rose by 53% and 43%, respectively. Both companies' cross-border transaction volume increased substantially over that time. Theoretically, tariffs could negatively impact cross-border transaction volume as consumers don’t want to pay higher prices. However, this can lead to consumers simply switching to similar products from their home country, which Visa and Mastercard can still collect fees on. Ultimately, the big worry for Visa and Mastercard around tariffs is that they could substantially reduce economic growth, leading to a reduction in payment volume. This is a real possibility if tariffs are in place for an extended period. Forecasters at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) would lower their growth forecasts by 0.5% to 1% if tariffs on Mexico and Canada were in place for an extended period. However, they also forecast inflation to increase by the same amount. Inflation due to tariffs raises Visa and Mastercard's payment volume and corresponding fee revenue. Thus, tariffs may overall result in a neutral impact on Visa and Mastercard payment revenues as growth slows and prices rise. At this point, I don’t see tariffs as a big risk for Visa and Mastercard going forward. Outlook for Visa and Mastercard Visa and Mastercard allow much of the world economy to operate, and they can continue expanding. The payments industry is massive. It stretches from everything to cash, card, check, wire payments, invoicing, disbursements, and remittances. Mastercard believes there is a $154 trillion total serviceable payment volume market it can target. Just think of all the payments in emerging market countries that still use cash over cards. In 2024, Visa and Mastercard combined for approximately a total of $24 trillion in payment volume. This signals that there is substantial room for these companies to grow into their total market as digitization expands. Analysts on Wall Street broadly raised price targets on both firms after their latest results. The average of analysts' price targets after recent earnings suggests a 12% upside for Visa and a 14% upside for Mastercard versus their Feb. 3 closing prices. Overall, I remain bullish on Visa and Mastercard shares. Barring a global economic slowdown or recession, these stocks can continue to impress.

E-commerce to accelerate at 14% per year by 2027 CURITIBA, Brazil , Feb. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Consumer spending in Southeast Asia and India is projected to increase by 122% over the next decade, outpacing other major emerging regions such as Latin America and Africa , which are expected to see growths of 57% and 103%, respectively. This surge, based on projections by the World Data Lab (WDL), is featured in the new edition of Beyond Borders, EBANX’s annual comprehensive study on the digital market and payment trends in emerging economies. The study can be accessed in full and for free at http://bit.ly/EBANXBeyondBorders2025 . Driven by their youthful, tech-savvy populations and expanding digital ecosystems, Southeast Asia and India are experiencing an increase in e-commerce transactions, which is one of the main factors fueling the largest consumer spending growth among rising markets. According to Statista data in Beyond Borders, online sales are projected to grow by 14% annually across emerging Asian countries over the next two years, with India leading the charge. João Del Valle, CEO and Co-founder of EBANX “ The digital transformation and burgeoning middle-class consumer base in rising markets position them as pivotal players in the global e-commerce landscape ,” said João Del Valle , CEO and Co-founder of EBANX, a global payment service provider (PSP) specializing in payments in emerging markets. With exponential growth in e-commerce and booming consumer spending, Southeast Asia and India , along with Latin America and Africa , have been playing pioneering roles in the payments industry. “ There is ample potential for merchants, financial institutions, and other players to benefit from all the payment innovations emerging from rising economies ,” stated Del Valle . Payment innovations Consumer demand for real-time, seamless, and cost-effective transactions has made UPI, mobile money, and Pix the leading alternative payment methods for online purchases in India , Kenya , and Brazil , respectively. UPI leads the overall online sales in India , with 55% of the country’s market, followed by mobile money, which accounts for 48% of Kenya’s total e-commerce, and Pix, with 40% of Brazil’s online purchases , according to data from Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence (PCMI) in Beyond Borders. Features like Pix Automático, set to launch in mid-2025, will unlock new recurring payment use cases and accelerate adoption in Brazil’s e-commerce. Beyond Borders’ exclusive projections reveal that Pix Automático could generate over USD 30 billion in online recurring payments within two years of its launch , per PCMI. This is a substantial figure, considering this credit card-dominated market vertical currently handles USD 50 billion annually in Brazil . EBANX’s study also predicts that the new recurring feature will account for 12% of all Pix’s online transaction volume by 2027. Pix, UPI, and mobile money are also among the fastest-growing payment methods in online sales across emerging markets, expected to accelerate by 35%, 18%, and 16% per year by 2027, in that order. Debit cards are also one of the “game changer” payment methods, capturing 32% of the market across emerging economies, and still sustaining a 24% CAGR by 2027. “ Emerging markets are leading the global shift towards real-time payments, with innovations that match their populations’ demands for speed and convenience ,” said the CEO of EBANX. “ This results from an irreversible trend in the payments industry: the development of solutions completely adapted to local consumer behavior. And our report shows how this is taking place. “ To read EBANX’s Beyond Borders 2025 study, access http://bit.ly/EBANXBeyondBorders2025 .

    "article_text": "Opinion Can India’s tax reforms be a blueprint for Bangladesh’s middle-class prosperity? Freeing up disposable income and stimulating spending might help power growth in the economy, argues Tanvir A Mishuk Tanvir A Mishuk Published : 03 Feb 2025, 03:16 PM Updated : 03 Feb 2025, 03:16 PM India’s recent budget has introduced significant tax reforms aimed at alleviating the financial burden on the middle class. These measures are designed to increase disposable income, stimulate consumer spending, and foster economic growth. Bangladesh might find valuable lessons in adopting similar strategies to benefit its own middle-class population. Three years ago, I approached Bangladesh’s then finance minister with a similar model, advocating for tax relief to empower the middle class and drive economic expansion. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince him at the time. THE HIGHLIGHTS OF INDIA’S TAX REFORMS In the 2025 budget, the Indian government implemented several noteworthy changes: • Increased tax exemption limit: The income tax exemption threshold was raised from ₹700,000 to ₹1.2 million annually, ensuring that individuals earning up to ₹1.2 million (approximately $14,800) are not liable to pay any income tax. • Standard deduction enhancement: A standard deduction of ₹75,000 was introduced, further reducing taxable income for salaried individuals. • Revised tax slabs: The government restructured tax slabs to provide relief across various income brackets. For instance: • Incomes up to ₹400,000 are now tax-exempt. • ₹400,001 to ₹800,000 are taxed at 5 percent. • ₹800,001 to ₹1.2 million at 10 percent. • The highest slab of 30 percent applies to incomes above ₹2.4 million. These reforms are estimated to benefit approximately 25-30 million taxpayers, allowing them to save about ₹100,000 annually. This increase in disposable income is expected to boost consumption in key sectors such as consumer goods, automobiles, and real estate. POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR BANGLADESH Bangladesh has experienced commendable economic growth; however, its tax structure remains a challenge. The country’s tax-to-GDP ratio has stagnated below 8 percent, significantly lower than India’s 17.9 percent. This limited tax base restricts the government’s capacity to invest in public services and infrastructure. Adopting tax relief measures similar to India’s could yield several advantages for Bangladesh: 1. Enhanced disposable income: Reducing income tax rates or increasing exemption thresholds would leave more money in the hands of the middle class, boosting consumer spending. 2. Encouragement of savings and investments: Tax incentives for savings instruments and investments could promote financial security among citizens. 3. Broadening the tax base: Simplifying the tax system and reducing rates might encourage greater compliance, thereby expanding the tax base. 4. Economic stimulus: Increased consumer spending can drive demand in various sectors, leading to business growth and job creation. CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS While tax reforms can offer substantial benefits, Bangladesh must approach them cautiously: • Revenue implications: Tax cuts could lead to reduced government revenue in the short term. It’s essential to balance tax relief with fiscal responsibilities to ensure sustainable public spending. • Inflationary pressures: An increase in disposable income might lead to higher demand for goods and services, potentially causing inflation. Effective monetary policies would be necessary to manage this risk. • Administrative capacity: Implementing and managing new tax policies require a robust administrative framework. Investing in capacity building for tax authorities would be crucial. India’s recent tax reforms offer a compelling case study in leveraging fiscal policy to stimulate economic growth and support the middle class. Bangladesh, aiming to strengthen its economy and uplift its middle-income population, could consider similar tax relief strategies. However, these policies must be tailored to Bangladesh’s unique economic context and implemented in a balanced and sustainable manner. Three years ago, I attempted to introduce this vision to Bangladesh’s leadership, but it did not gain traction. Perhaps now, with India’s success as a model, there is a renewed opportunity.

    "article_text": "The stock market's climb over the last few years has driven dividend yields to multiyear lows. The S&P 500 average yield is just 1.24% -- the lowest yield since 2000. The bull market has driven valuations for growth stocks higher, while weak consumer spending trends have left top retail stocks trading at discounts and offering attractive yields. Here are two excellent retail stocks that can boost your passive income. 1. Nike Nike ( NKE +3.78% ) is the top footwear brand in the world with $49 billion in trailing 12-month revenue -- two thirds of that comes from footwear. Weak consumer spending has contributed to lower sales at Nike, which fell 8% year-over-year in the November-ending fiscal second quarter. The stock has tumbled 57% off its all-time high, while offering the highest dividend yield in 15 years. Expand NYSE : NKE Nike Today's Change ( 3.78 %) $ 2.30 Current Price $ 63.10 Key Data Points Market Cap $90B Day's Range $ 61.24 - $ 63.60 52wk Range $ 52.28 - $ 82.44 Volume 1.1M Avg Vol 14M Gross Margin 41.45 % Dividend Yield 0.03 % There's nothing wrong with Nike's brand or competitive position. Air Jordans are still highly sought after by sneaker collectors, and of course, the company's high annual sales indicate a lot of people are still buying Nike shoes. Nike will return to growth, and the share price will recover; it's just a matter of when. New CEO Elliott Hill, who is a longtime company veteran, is returning the brand to what it does best: sports innovation. Nike's running footwear outperformed sales in other categories last quarter, which indicates this is the right strategy. Importantly for dividend investors, Nike is still a profitable business that can continue distribute cash to shareholders. Analysts expect full-year earnings to be $2.06, according to Yahoo! Finance, down from $3.73 in fiscal 2024. But that should mark the low point before a return to growth. Analysts expect Nike's earnings to rebound in fiscal 2026 to $2.50. Management sees the company's struggles as temporary, as Nike raised the quarterly dividend by 8% in November to $0.40. This represents 78% of fiscal 2025 expected earnings and provides wiggle room to keep growing the dividend as management works to firm up the bottom line. The forward dividend yield is currently 2.06% at the current $77.50 share price. With the footwear industry expected to grow over the long term, this is a great opportunity to invest in the leading brand at a discount. 2. Target Target ( TGT +1.08% ) is one of the top dividend payers . It has paid a dividend every year since 1967, which covers a lot of economic cycles and periods of weak consumer spending. This long dividend record indicates a durable business that can potentially pay you dividends for a lifetime. Expand NYSE : TGT Target Today's Change ( 1.08 %) $ 0.98 Current Price $ 91.71 Key Data Points Market Cap $41B Day's Range $ 90.94 - $ 92.11 52wk Range $ 85.36 - $ 158.42 Volume 124K Avg Vol 8.2M Gross Margin 25.43 % Dividend Yield 0.05 % Target's focus on discretionary categories like apparel and toys means it is sensitive to consumer spending trends. The stock is down 47% from its previous peak. Comparable sales grew just 0.3% year-over-year in the third quarter. However, holiday sales during November and December showed a noticeable uptick, with total sales up 2.8% and comp sales up 2%. The company called out much better sales of apparel and toys, where discretionary times posted a sales acceleration over Q3. Target is in fine shape to continue paying dividends. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $8.67 in 2025, which is expected to be slightly down from last year. But analysts expect earnings to rebound to $9.27 in 2026. The current quarterly dividend is $1.12, or 52% of 2025 expected earnings, bringing the forward yield to 3.18% at the current $140.75 share price. The stock will likely move higher as sales improve, but investors are getting paid a generous yield to wait. Investors that hold the stock until the economy is firing on all cylinders again should see solid returns."

It’s smaller because of its narrow focus on the traditional fossil fuel energy industry—you won’t find any alternative energy stocks in this sector—and because its weight in the S&P 500 is only about 3.8% as of early 2024. The narrow focus of the GICS energy sector stands at odds with how many investors think about energy and the growing role of alternative and renewable energy. Those newer forms of power, such as solar , are often found in other GICS sectors (including materials , industrials , and utilities). Despite the narrow focus, the GICS energy sector offers investors a chance to own companies that pay high dividends and cyclical companies connected to the economy . As a value play, the energy sector can offer diversification compared with the growth-focused tech sector . Key Points The GICS energy sector is focused on traditional fossil fuel companies. It’s one of the smallest GICS sectors by market capitalization. Energy stocks often pay high dividends to attract investors. What is the energy sector? There are 22 companies in the GICS energy sector, which covers two traditional fossil fuel energy industries: Energy equipment services Oil , gas , and consumable fuels Under energy equipment services, you’ll find companies that drill for oil and gas and those that supply equipment and services to help companies extract fossil fuel energy. Energy stocks in this category include Schlumberger Limited (SLB) and Halliburton Company (HAL). The oil, gas, and consumable fuels sector is divided into several subsectors, including: Integrated oil and gas companies. These industry giants explore for energy and also either refine, market, and transport energy, or make chemicals. Among them, you’ll find the biggest and best-known fossil fuel companies, including top energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), Chevron Corporation (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP). These companies handle the entire production process, from exploration, production, transportation, and refining to distribution and retail sales. You may be familiar with their gas stations, which is how they sell directly to consumers. Oil and gas exploration and production-only companies. Included in this group are Diamondback Energy, Inc. (FANG), which is one of the largest producers of natural gas and unconventional crude ( shale oil ). Oil and gas refining and marketing. These are companies that aren’t included in the integrated subsector or may be independent power producers or energy traders. Phillips 66 (PSX) is a refiner that takes crude oil and creates usable products such as jet fuel or gasoline, but it also creates chemicals, transports natural gas, and operates gas stations. Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is also a crude oil refiner, but in addition, it makes renewable fuels such as ethanol and renewable diesel . Oil and gas storage and transportation. Companies in this subsector include midstream natural gas companies, oil and refined product pipelines, coal slurry pipelines, and oil and gas shipping. The biggest ones are Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI). Both firms operate pipelines to transport natural gas, among other enterprises. Coal and consumable fuels. This category includes companies that mine coal and related products and fuels for energy generation. Not included are gas-producing companies found within the industrial gas subindustry and companies that mine metallurgical coal used in steel production . The best known is Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU). How energy gets from field to gas tank Getting oil out of the ground and into your car takes several steps: Geologists and geophysicists identify potential oil reservoirs and use seismic imaging to find oil reserves. Wells are drilled into the ground , either using traditional drilling or hydraulic fracturing (also called fracking). When the oil is extracted, it’s refined using a distillation process where it is heated, vaporized, and separated. Refiners also use other processes such as cracking (to make gasoline) and blending to produce chemicals, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and home heating oil. Once refined, the products are stored in tanks or terminals until they can be transported, typically by tanker trucks and ships , railroads , or pipelines. Commodities markets and energy Energy is the biggest and most important commodity market . There are futures markets for crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline. Commodity prices also influence the energy companies’ stocks—they need to at least meet the cost of production. Refiners watch the energy product markets closely. In particular, “crack spreads” (the difference between the price paid for crude oil and the cost of products made from it) affect refiners’ margins . Valuing the value sector Energy, like some other stock market sectors , is often associated with value investing. Value stocks are considered the slow and steady way to grow an investment portfolio. Growth stocks tend to be much more volatile, but that volatility sometimes pays off with strong price appreciation. Learn more about the difference between value and growth stocks . Characteristics of the energy sector Like every GICS sector, energy has unique characteristics: Mostly large-cap companies. Given the significant capital required to explore, drill, and transport energy, it’s not surprising that many energy sector constituents are large-cap companies . Some shale oil companies are mid-cap companies, but those are being bought by the major crude oil producers. A concentrated sector. With only 22 companies, energy is one of the most concentrated GICS sectors. The top 10 stocks account for about three-quarters of the sector’s market capitalization, so if one or two of them report poor results , it can weigh heavily on the entire sector. Considered a value play. Because of its low growth, the energy sector leans toward the value factor. Looking at three common metrics to measure value , as of mid-2024, energy has a 2.1 price-to-book value, a 12.4 price-to-earnings ratio, and a 1.2 price-to-sales ratio. Those results compare with the broader S&P 500 , which has a 4.4 price-to-book value, a 21.1 P/E ratio, and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.6. Follows economic cycles . Because nearly all consumers and businesses still use some sort of fossil fuel energy, demand matters. During a recession , consumption falters and prices for energy stocks fall, while during boom periods, energy stocks rise as demand increases. High-dividend yield. To entice investors, many energy companies pay higher dividends to make up for low growth. The energy sector’s indicated annual dividend yield ( an estimate of dividend payments for the next 12 months) in mid-2024 was 3.46%, double the broader S&P 500’s 1.48%. Tips for investing in energy companies Energy stocks appeal to investors for different reasons, including these factors: Diversification . Energy stocks often are independent of other types of stocks because of their close ties to commodity prices. Hedge against inflation . Energy producers typically pass higher costs on to consumers, so earnings aren’t necessarily dented because of a jump in prices. Income. This sector is known for paying quarterly dividends and, more recently, variable dividends, which are based on company performance. What to watch for: Commodity prices. Supply and demand have an impact on energy companies, especially integrated oil and gas producers and independent oil and gas producers. Refiners, on the other hand, do better when energy prices are down because the raw material—also known as feedstock—is cheaper. Transportation companies are less impacted by commodity prices, but can still be influenced by them. Reserves. For integrated oil and gas producers and independent oil and gas producers, their levels of reserves are important (and are often discussed during earnings calls ). Oil is a depleting asset, so the need to find more is constant. Geopolitics. Energy is consumed worldwide, and geopolitical events such as conflicts among nations can cause commodity prices to spike. One example is the start of the Russia-Ukraine War , which traces its roots back to 2014 and continues to influence prices. The bottom line The energy market plays an important role in the global economy, although it makes up just a small part of the broader stock market. If you’re looking to include energy stocks in your portfolio, remember that the companies in this GICS sector don’t yet include pure-play renewable and alternative energy companies. The fossil-fuel energy market has been through a wild ride in the past decade, seeing competition from the growing alternative energy sector, a glut of supply as the U.S. started to elbow out Saudi Arabia as the top global energy producer, COVID-19 affecting demand, and more. Even as policymakers worldwide are embracing renewable energy, fossil fuel production and use is likely to be around for the foreseeable future. Specific companies and funds are mentioned for educational purposes only and not as an endorsement. The lists in this article are representative and not intended to be comprehensive."

    "article_text": "Updated / Friday, 31 Jan 2025 14:16 The US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month after an unrevised 0.1% gain in November, new figures show today US prices increased in December while consumer spending surged, suggesting that the Federal Reserve could delay cutting interest rates for some time this year. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month after an unrevised 0.1% gain in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said today. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index climbing 0.3%. In the 12 months to December, the PCE price index advanced 2.6% after rising 2.4% in November. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter published earlier this week, which showed price pressures picking up in the final three months of the year against the backdrop of robust consumer spending. The US Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. The Fed on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.5% range, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September when it started its policy easing cycle. The accompanying policy statement did not include the reference to inflation having \"made progress\" toward the Fed's 2% target. No rate cut is expected before June. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.1% increase in November. In the 12 months to December, the so-called core inflation advanced 2.8% after increasing 2.8% in November. The Fed has forecast only two rate cuts this year, down from the four it had projected in September. That reflected uncertainty on the economic impact of President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts, broad tariffs on imports and an immigration crackdown, which economists view as inflationary. Fears over tariffs have sent consumers rushing to stock up on goods to avoid higher prices. That has helped to power consumer spending, which notched its fastest growth pace in nearly two years in the fourth quarter, sustaining the economic expansion. Economists expect pre-emptive buying continued in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, jumped 0.7% in December after an upwardly revised 0.6% rise in November. Spending was previously reported to have gained 0.4% in November. The US economy grew at a 2.3% annualised rate in the fourth quarter as the surge in consumer spending offset drags from inventories almost being depleted and a strike at Boeing in the autumn weighing on business spending on equipment. Strong consumer spending last month sets the US economy on a higher growth trajectory heading into the first quarter.

    "article_text": "US inflation increases in December; consumer spending robust Shoppers cast shadows in Portland Maine · Reuters Lucia Mutikani Updated January 31, 2025 5 min read By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflation increased by the most in eight months in December amid robust consumer spending on goods and services, suggesting the Federal Reserve would probably be in no hurry to resume cutting interest rates soon. While the report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed a modest gain in prices excluding the volatile food and energy components on a monthly basis, the annual increase in the so-called core inflation has not slowed since October. The disinflation progress stalled in the fourth quarter. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since launching its policy easing cycle in September. The policy statement accompanying the decision did not include the reference to inflation having \"made progress\" toward the Fed's 2% target. The inflation outlook has been clouded by uncertainty about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's fiscal, trade and immigration policies. \"The Fed's prognosis is for a slower pace of monetary easing moving forward, as the economy is doing well and prices are only slowly returning to target in an environment of great uncertainty,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"These data support that strategy.\" The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 0.3% last month, the largest increase since last April, after an unrevised 0.1% gain in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. The increase was in line with economists' expectations. Goods prices rose 0.2%, the first gain in five months, lifted by higher costs for motor vehicles and parts as well as gasoline and other energy goods, which jumped 4.2%. Prices of furnishings and durable household equipment plunged as they did for recreational goods and vehicles. The cost of services increased 0.3% amid gains in transportation, recreation, and housing and utilities. In the 12 months through December, PCE inflation advanced 2.6%. That was the biggest gain in seven months and followed a 2.4% rise in November. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter published on Thursday. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. It has reduced its benchmark overnight interest rate by 100 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range since September. The central bank has forecast only two rate cuts this year, down from the four it had projected in September amid caution over the new Trump administration's plans for tax cuts, broad tariffs on imports and an immigration crackdown, which economists view as inflationary. Story Continues No rate cut is expected before June. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.1% increase in November. In the 12 months through December, the core inflation advanced 2.8%, rising by the same margin for three straight months. Some economists highlighted the slight monthly gain in core inflation and a separate report from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a marginal rise in labor costs on the fourth quarter as signs that the disinflationary trend remained intact. Core inflation rose at a 2.2% annualized rate in the three months to December. \"That will be welcome news at the Fed, though as conveyed in recent Fed speak the committee will be patient in considering further interest rate cuts, and we still see them on hold until mid-year,\" said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JPMorgan. Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week indicated policymakers were watching the 12-month inflation \"because that takes out the seasonality issues that may exist.\" Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar advanced against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose. LABOR COSTS RISE The employment cost index (ECI), the broadest measure of labor costs, gained 0.9% in the fourth quarter after rising 0.8% in the third quarter. Labor costs climbed 3.8% in the 12 months through December, the slowest since the third quarter of 2021, after increasing 3.9% in the year through September. The ECI is viewed by policymakers as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation because it adjusts for composition and job-quality changes. \"The ECI is still consistent with price stability as long as labor productivity continues to grow around 2% year-over-year,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \"However, deportations could add some pressure.\" Fears about tariffs have sent consumers rushing to stock up on goods to avoid higher prices, helping to power consumer spending, which notched its fastest growth pace in nearly two years in the fourth quarter, sustaining the economic expansion. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 0.7% in December after an upwardly revised 0.6% rise in November. Spending was previously reported to have gained 0.4% in November. Goods outlays increased 0.9%, driven by automobiles, food, as well as gasoline and other energy products. Spending on services rose 0.6% amid big gains in housing and utilities, transportation, healthcare and other services. Economists expect pre-emptive buying continued in January. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.4%, setting the economy on a higher growth trajectory heading into the first quarter. Personal income increased 0.4% after gaining 0.3% in November. With spending outpacing income, the saving rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% from 4.1% in November. Some economists argued that the low saving rate was not conducive to further gains in consumer spending post the tariff-related buying frenzy. Others were not worried. \"We expect consumer spending will continue to be bolstered by strong balance sheets overall, including record amounts of housing wealth,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

    "article_text": "US Economy Slows Slightly in Q4, but Consumer Remains Strong By Michael Gouvalaris Market Overview Published 01/30/2025, 11:56 PM US Economy Slows Slightly in Q4, but Consumer Remains Strong View all comments (0) 0 Michael Gouvalaris Articles ( 269 ) | My Homepage Follow We got our first estimate of Q4 GDP yesterday morning. Gross Domestic Product adjusted for inflation (or real GDP) came in at $23.5 trillion in Q4. Meanwhile, nominal GDP came in at $29.7 trillion. The economy is now 12.1% larger than the pre-COVID peak in inflation-adjusted dollars. This represents a 2.3% annualized growth rate in real GDP for Q4, down from 3.1% annualized growth in Q3. These results missed street expectations of around 2.7% annualized growth for Q4, and below the historical average of 3.2%. The year-over-year rate of growth in real GDP slowed from 2.7% to 2.5%. While nominal GDP stayed consistent at 5% growth. The GDP price index increased 2.2% on an annualized basis in Q4, which was below street expectations of 2.5% inflation . But an uptick from Q3’s 1.9% inflation rate. Prices are up at a 2.4% pace over the last 4 quarters. Breaking down the report by category shows the results were actually a little better than the headline would lead you to believe. The top part of the chart above represents each category's contribution to the final GDP calculation. Consumer spending was strong, adding 2.8% to GDP, which was the best contribution percentage since Q1 2023. The biggest drag was inventory investments and nonresidential business investments, subtracting a combined 1.2% from Q4 GDP. Government spending made up about 19% of Q4 GDP (bottom part of the chart), which was slightly below the 4 and 8 quarter average of 21% and 23% respectively. Not too shabby. We’ll get our first estimates for Q1 GDP tomorrow (Friday). Overall the economy is in decent shape, earnings are pretty solid, but valuations are no longer favorable. 2 out of the 3 pillars of fundamental analysis remain positive.

    "article_text": "Updated / Friday, 31 Jan 2025 10:18 Visa is benefitting from strong domestic and international travel demand, driven by improved pricing and the absence of severe weather-related disruptions Visa's first-quarter profit has beaten Wall Street estimates, as easing concerns about an economic slowdown and discounts encouraged customers to splurge during the Christmas shopping season. Retailers offered deep discounts on everything from clothes to toys and luxury products to lure cost-conscious consumers while online sales remained strong thanks to a boom in mobile shopping. Payments volume - a gauge of overall consumer and business spending on Visa's network - jumped 9%, while revenue rose 10% to $9.5 billion in the quarter. Shares of the world's largest payments processor were up 1.8% after the bell on Wall Street. Visa also benefited from strong domestic and international travel demand, driven by improved pricing and the absence of severe weather-related disruptions. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, a measure of international travel demand, jumped 16%. Processed transactions rose 11% in the quarter. The San Francisco, California-based company posted an adjusted profit of $2.75 per share in the three months ended December 31. Analysts, on average, had expected $2.66 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. Although higher-for-longer interest rates were expected to be a dampener, consumer spending continues to be underpinned by a solid labour market and continued wage growth. \"Consumer spending in the US and around the globe is quite resilient and strong,\" said Chief Financial Officer Chris Suh in an interview with Reuters. The trend bodes well for Visa and rival Mastercard as they pocket a small fee off each transaction on their networks. Mastercard earlier in the day reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates as consumers ramped up spending during the Christmas season. Shares of both companies had underperformed the broader markets in 2024 on worries that a slowdown in major global economies could hurt the sector.

    "article_text": "Jan 30, 2025 GDP shows spenders keep spending despite high interest rates Economic growth was healthy in 2024, coming in at 2.8% compared to 2.9% in 2023. The continuing expansion is driven by consumers. by Kristin Schwab Play Listen Now Save Share Download Many Americans have continued to spend at a healthy clip, fueled by wages, stocks and real estate. Scott Olson/Getty Images The latest gross domestic product report came in Thursday morning. It showed that last year ended with a moderating growth rate in the fourth quarter. But overall, GDP was strong in 2024, coming in at 2.8% compared to 2.9% in 2023. The report says the continued vigor is mostly thanks to you, the consumer. Because consumer spending rose 4.2% in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace since early 2023. When economist John Leer at Morning Consult looked at the GDP report, his eyes went straight to the breakdown of goods versus services. “It’s more about sort of the pie getting bigger and less about, you know, reallocating from goods to services or services to goods,” he said. Leer said both spending categories fueled GDP growth in the fourth quarter. “It underscores the strength of the consumer,” he said. Consumers are still doing all the things — shopping, vacationing, going out to eat, despite high interest rates. One take: Maybe rates should have peaked higher to really slow down spending. “The monetary policy hasn’t been as tight as people thought it was,” said Dartmouth College economist Andrew Levin. It’s not like high interest rates haven’t tempered spending at all. But many Americans are benefiting from gains in wages, stocks and home values. “Enough other things have happened that, in fact, the positives for growth have outweighed that important negative,” said Jim Wilcox, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. High borrowing costs haven’t soured consumers . In fact, Wilcox said, a certain segment of Americans are sitting really comfortable. “And not only that, another powerful effect on consumer spending is how wealthy people feel,” he said. In other words, if your 2.5% mortgage rate means you’re paying hundreds of dollars a month less than your new next-door neighbor, why not take the family out for ice cream tonight?

    "article_text": "... By Michael D. Carroll Breaking News Editor Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member The U.S. economy closed out 2024 with strong momentum at 2.8 percent growth, driven by robust consumer spending. Why It Matters With President Donald Trump 's return to the White House, the country could be poised for a major economic shift as his administration prepares to implement new policies that may redefine trade, taxation, and regulatory frameworks. What To Know The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the U.S. economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, driven by strong consumer spending. The steady expansion underscores economic resilience heading into 2025, even as a new Trump administration prepares to reshape fiscal and trade policies. For 2024, the U.S. economy posted a solid 2.8 percent growth, slightly below the 2.9 percent recorded in 2023. ... Will Growth Continue? Fourth-quarter expansion came in at 2.3 percent, just shy of the 2.4 percent forecast by economists in a FactSet survey. The data highlights steady economic momentum as the Trump administration prepares to implement its policy agenda. Consumer spending surged at a 4.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, the fastest since early 2023, up from 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. However, business investment declined sharply, with equipment spending plunging after two consecutive strong quarters. The contrast highlights a resilient consumer sector but signals potential headwinds for corporate growth as the Trump administration prepares to reshape economic policy. Is Inflation Still a Problem? The latest economic report also revealed lingering inflationary pressures at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5 percent in the previous quarter and exceeding the Fed's 2 percent target. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed to 2.5 percent, up from 2.2 percent in the third quarter. The uptick signals potential challenges for the Fed as it weighs future interest rate decisions amid a shifting economic landscape under the Trump administration. A decline in business inventories trimmed 0.93 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth. However, a key measure of the economy's underlying strength—which factors in consumer spending and private investment while excluding volatile components including exports, inventories, and government spending—grew at a solid 3.2 percent annual rate. While slightly down from 3.4 percent in the third quarter, the data suggests sustained economic momentum as the Trump administration prepares to implement its policy agenda. What People Are Saying Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics , said that figure \"suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters his present approach to interest rates, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. What Happens Next Thursday's GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department estimates of October-December growth.

The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% during the quarter. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP hide caption toggle caption Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP Consumer spending kept the U.S. economy humming in the final months of 2024. Business Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged Business There is one major gift Trump is inheriting from Biden: A good job market The nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in October, November and December, according to a report from the Commerce Department Thursday. That's down slightly from the previous quarter when GDP grew at a 3.1% annual pace. Consumers ramped up their spending in the final months of the year, opening their wallets for both goods and services. Spending on big-ticket items jumped at an annual rate of more than 12%, which may have been driven partly by a desire to buy before any of the new tariffs threatened by President Trump kick in. \"The consumer is driving the economic train,\" says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The economy is creating a boatload of jobs and unemployment is low,\" so shoppers have money to spend. By contrast, business investment was down during the quarter. The economy ended last year 2.5% larger than it was in the final months of 2023. That's stronger growth than most other countries enjoyed last year. GDP in Europe, for example, was flat. A booming stock market and record-high home values also boosted people's willingness to spend â€” especially among the wealthy. \"When they feel wealthy, they feel confident and they save a little bit less and spend a little bit more,\" Zandi said. \"The real juice here is coming from folks who are in good financial shape. Lower-income households, they're still struggling.\" Politics All the executive orders Trump has signed after 1 week in office Forecasters expressed some uncertainty about whether the solid economic growth would continue this year. \"The biggest risk to our 2025 forecast is an immediate imposition of across-the-board tariffs on key trading partners,\" wrote Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics in a research note. He projects that if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, it could shave more than 1% off GDP growth this year. Even though Americans are spending, many still feel anxious about the economy. A report from the Conference Board released this week shows consumer confidence fell to a four-month low in January.

    "article_text": "US economic growth slows despite consumers spending more 30 January 2025 Share Save Charlotte Edwards and Natalie Sherman Business reporters Share Save Getty Images Economic growth in the US slowed at the end of last year, as trade and investment declined and the country was hit by hurricanes and labour strikes. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.3% between October and December, down from 3.1% in the three months before, according to the US Commerce Department. The pace, fuelled by solid growth in consumer spending, was nevertheless weaker than economists had forecast. The figures come amid heightened uncertainty about the path for the world's largest economy, as US President Donald Trump calls for a policy shake-up. His plans include big cuts to government spending and implementing trade tariffs, which could be announced this week. The US economy had been forecast to expand at roughly 2.5% in the final three months of 2024 though analysts said details of the Commerce Department report suggested growth remained solid. \"The US consumer has been unstoppable, supported by wealth creation, a strong labour market, and lending,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, adding that overall growth last year was \"surprisingly strong\". Consumer spending - the biggest driver of the US economy - rose 4.2%. But analyst Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer spending was lifted primarily by a jump in purchases of goods, including cars. He said that could indicate a temporary burst of buying from people worried about the impact of potential tariffs on prices. \"We would caution against concluding that underlying domestic demand remains unassailably strong,\" he added. The report showed a decline in both exports and imports of goods - contractions in activity that nonetheless had a roughly neutral impact on the overall growth figure. Economists subtract imports from growth calculations because they are not made domestically. Private investment, which analysts said was likely hit by the strike at aerospace giant Boeing, also fell.

Despite inflation pressures and a slight dip in business investment, the overall economic outlook remains positive as President Donald Trump takes office in 2025. The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department. Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023. Consumer spending remains robust Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters. Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, \"Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,\" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages. Inflation pressures persist The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter. Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter. Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength. Global comparison The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns. Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.

    "article_text": "India's consumer market to become world's second largest by 2030: Report ANI | Updated: Jan 30, 2025 09:40 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi [India], January 30 (ANI): India's consumer market is on track to expand 46 per cent by 2030, making it the second-largest globally, according to the Edelweiss Mutual Fund report Rising incomes, a young workforce, and rapid urbanization are expected to drive consumption growth across the country. According to projections, consumer spending in India will rise to USD 4.3 trillion by 2030, up from USD 2.4 trillion in 2024. This growth is largely fuelled by India's expanding middle and upper-middle-income population, which is leading to higher purchasing power and increased discretionary spending. India's median age of 28 years is significantly lower than China's 39 years and the US's 38 years, positioning it as a major driver of global consumption. By 2030, India's working-age population (15-64 years) will reach 100 crore, making up one-fifth of the global workforce. The dependency ratio--which reflects the proportion of dependents to the working-age population--will decline from 47 per cent in 2023 to 31 per cent by 2031, allowing for higher disposable income and increased consumer spending. Women's participation in the labour force has also seen significant improvement, rising from 23 per cent in 2018 to 42 per cent in 2024. This increase in dual-income households is leading to higher spending on lifestyle and premium products, further strengthening India's consumer economy. Urbanization , digital transformation, and financial inclusion are rapidly reshaping India's consumption patterns. As aspirations converge across urban and rural areas, improved access to goods and services is turning intent into actual spending. Additionally, the country is witnessing two major shifts in consumption: a transition from unbranded to branded and from unorganized to organized retail. This shift is expected to unlock USD 600 billion in additional consumer spending in the coming years. Urbanization is pushing demand for convenience-driven consumption, while digitization and new-age consumption trends are transforming buying behaviours through the rise of e-commerce and digital payments. Additionally, easy credit availability is making it simpler for consumers to spend on aspirational goods, while premiumization--the growing demand for high-end and branded products--is shaping the next phase of consumption. These factors combined are creating a strong foundation for India's consumer market expansion. The quick commerce sector is poised for rapid growth, driven by urbanization, rising consumer expectations, and faster, localized deliveries. Meanwhile, rural demand for consumer durables remains an untapped opportunity due to low penetration. As rural incomes rise and digital access improves, this segment will become a key driver of consumption growth in India. Above all, India's per capita income has been growing at 8.7 per cent CAGR since 2015, fuelling increased discretionary spending. With a shift towards branded products and organized retail, India's consumer market is on a trajectory of historic expansion.The report is part of “Edelweiss Consumption Fund” which will open for subscription on Friday.(ANI)"

    "article_text": "Concierges and other AI tools will take recommendations and post-sales support to new levels of customization, with some consumers allowing AI shoppers to purchase for them. Credit: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock AI is poised to take over the customer journey for a wide range of products in the next five years. CIOs who ignore the trend risk losing major ground to competitors, AI and marketing experts suggest. AI-driven product recommendations are already a common component of customer buying journeys, but AI tools coming soon will act as personal concierges, providing hyper-customized recommendations, after-sale add-on suggestions, and post-purchase support, says Naveen Sharma, senior vice president and global head of AI and analytics at Cognizant, an IT consulting firm. These AI concierges will anticipate customer needs, recommend new purchases, and, where enabled, automatically buy products — kind of an Amazon subscribe-and-save service on steroids. AI concierges will follow the buyer, instead of being linked to a specific seller, enabling them to learn and develop a deep understanding of the customer’s preferences and lifestyle. Jason Hishmeh, cofounder and CTO at IT services provider Varyence, sees such AI innovations infiltrate every level of the customer journey in the next five years. “Imagine walking into a store where every shelf magically knows exactly what you need before you do,” he says. “That’s the charm of AI concierges transforming the sales landscape — turning every customer interaction into a bespoke experience, one personalized recommendation at a time.” Power to the customer New e-commerce AI shopping tools will turn the current opaque, data-broker-driven customer profile model on its head, Cognizant’s Sharma says. Customers will be able to decide how much of their data to share, based on the transaction. “If you’re buying a bag of potato chips, I don’t know if you want to open the curtain at all,” he says. “But to buy something fancy and expensive and hard to replace, you might be willing to pull back the curtain a little bit more, expose more about your data, your usage, your behavioral patterns, to help you make that decision.” A new generation of buyer, generally people now between ages 18 and 44, will be comfortable with using AI shopping assistants, according to “ New Minds, New Markets ,” a recent report from Cognizant. Sharma envisions AI concierges coming early to the retail, travel, and wellness sectors. Companies selling most types of products “can no longer afford to ignore AI,” Sharma says. “AI is going to be a part of the decisioning and evaluation criteria in their future.” AI-friendly buyers drive spending Buyers comfortable with AI could drive about half of all consumer spending in the US, Germany, and Australia by 2030, the reports claims, amounting to $4.4 trillion of purchases in the US alone. Customers in the UK will lag slightly behind, but nearly 40% of consumer spending in the country will be done by AI-friendly customers by 2030, the report projects. Nearly half of 8,400 consumers from the four countries say they are already comfortable using AI to choose products and services, according to a mid-2024 survey from Cognizant. More than a quarter would be comfortable with AI buying low-priced items, but three-quarters say they are unlikely to allow AI to automatically reorder or pay for expensive items without the customer in the loop. The shift to new AI concierges will be a major project for many companies, Sharma says. “You can’t just sprinkle AI over an existing process,” he says. “That’s going to require a fundamental amount of re-engineering, and companies that don’t do it right could get seriously left behind.” Sellers that fail to adopt AI concierges will “probably suffer, and bigly,” adds Lars Nyman, CMO of CUDO Compute, a cloud GPU platform. “I’d think of AI concierges as the Amazonification of everything, with the scale turned up to 11.” Major changes needed The new AI tools will help sellers better understand their buyers, Nyman says, a common challenge for companies. But integrating AI concierges and understanding their value will take time and effort from IT, sales, and marketing teams, he says, and adaptability will separate the survivors from the casualties. “Companies can’t just dust off their current sales playbook and slap ‘AI-enabled’ on it,” Nyman adds. “If you’re still forcing buyers through labyrinthine customer journeys with 10-click checkouts and uninspiring product descriptions, you’re toast. If you use AI in-depth, to improve on actual user journeys, you’ll do well.” Companies will have to rethink the way they market and sell products and services to clients, Nyman says. AI concierges will go far beyond the 2010s functionality of recommending products, he adds. “They help make decisions, execute purchases, and over time, build brand loyalty,” Nyman adds. “Your sales process needs to evolve from reactive to more preemptive. It’s no longer about answering questions; it’s about predicting them before they actually form.” Sellers will not only need to rethink their income strategies, but they will also need to be prepared for a major IT project, adds Varyence’s Hishmeh. “Integrating AI gear calls for a strategic overhaul, from leveraging records analytics to deeply apprehending patron conduct to making sure that AI structures can supply tailor-made answers seamlessly,” he says. However, AI concierges will also create challenges for companies, with building trust in the tools a major issue, Nyman says. “AI concierges are basically digital butlers with infallible memory, taste, and initiative,” he says. “Customers won’t just let them into their lives if they think brands will exploit that intimacy though. Transparency around how data is collected, stored, and used is beyond just a regulatory box to tick ­— it could well be table stakes for survival.” SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

    "article_text": "By Associated Press PUBLISHED: January 28, 2025 at 10:11 AM EST | UPDATED: January 28, 2025 at 12:37 PM EST By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence dipped for the second consecutive month in January, a business research group said Tuesday. The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index retreated this month to 104.1, from 109.5 in December. That is worse than the economist projections for a reading of 105.8. December’s reading was revised up by 4.8 points but still represented a decline from November. The consumer confidence index measures both Americans’ assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spending during the holiday season was resolute. In the face of higher borrowing costs, retail sales rose 0.4% in December and stores generally reported healthy sales during the winter holiday shopping season. The board said that consumers’ view of current conditions tumbled 9.7 points to a reading of 134.3 in January and views on current labor market conditions fell for the first time since September. The measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 2.6 points to 83.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future. However, the proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next 12 months remained stable at the low end of the series range. Though the board’s index has declined the past two months, consumers continue to spend, helping to prop up the U.S. economy since the sharp rebound from the COVID-19 recession in the spring of 2020. In December, the government said that the U.S. economy grew at a healthy 3.1% annual clip from July through September, propelled by vigorous consumer spending and an uptick in exports. GDP growth has topped 2% in eight of the last nine quarters. All of that spending could be catching up to consumers. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported last week that credit card balances and delinquencies are on the rise and that active cardholders making the minimum payment is at a 12-year high. The share of respondents to the Conference Board’s latest survey who said they plan to purchase “big-ticket” items in the next six months was down slightly from its December report. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs how the American consumer is feeling.

    "article_text": "Recovery in Australian Business Conditions Supported by Upbeat Consumers Published on 01/27/2025 at 07:59 pm EST - Modified on 01/27/2025 at 08:00 pm EST Dow Jones Share By James Glynn SYDNEY--Australian business conditions were stronger in December as confidence also improved, supporting the view that consumer spending will help growth gather momentum in the year ahead. Business conditions climbed 3 points to 6 index points in December from November, while business confidence rose 1 point to minus-2 index points, according to the National Australia Bank's monthly survey of firms. NAB's chief economist, Alan Oster, said conditions remained strongest in services sectors, but added that there was a noticeable improvement in retail conditions, which may reflect a pick-up in consumer spending at the end of 2024. \"We will have to wait and see whether this improvement is sustained over 2025,\" he added. The data comes ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's first policy meeting for 2025 in February, with money markets betting the central bank will start delivering interest-rate cuts, lending more support to business activity. Growing evidence of a recovery in consumer spending likely reflects the fact that unemployment is low by historical standards, while income-tax cuts in mid-2024 are supporting household budgets. Business conditions improved across all industries except transport and utilities, construction and wholesale, including a notable uplift in retail conditions which re-entered positive territory for the first time since November 2023, the data showed. \"Confidence rose in November but remains well below average,\" Oster said. \"Confidence has been below average since early 2023, with this trend holding at the end of last year,\" he added. Forward orders edged up 3 points to minus-2 index points in December, according to the survey. There were notable improvements in mining and retail orders over the month, but both remain the weakest of all industries in trend terms. Capacity utilization rose to 82.8% in December, still well above its long-run average of 81.3%. \"Capacity utilization rose in the month and is still notably above its long run average despite the slow growth we have seen in the economy,\" Oster said. Purchase cost growth was slightly higher in December, edging up to 1.5% in quarterly terms, but labor cost growth was slightly lower at 1.4% in quarterly-equivalent terms. Output price growth ticked up by 0.3 percentage points to 0.9% in quarterly terms, while retail prices edged up slightly to 0.7%, the data showed.

    "article_text": "An article from Dive Brief Consumer spend on generative AI apps hit nearly $1.1B in 2024 Higher spending growth rates propelled by apps like ChatGPT and Google Gemini could catapult the category into the top 10 within a year. Published Jan. 27, 2025 By Aaron Baar post share post print email license Consumer spending on in-app purchases and subscriptions for their smartphones is on the rise, according to Sensor Tower’s latest State of Mobile report. Getty Images First published on Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Consumer spending on in-app purchases and subscriptions for their smartphones grew to $150 billion globally in 2024, a 13% year-over-year increase, per Sensor Tower’s latest State of Mobile report. For the fourth consecutive year, growth in consumer spend on non-gaming apps outpaced spend on games. Spend on non-gaming apps increased by nearly $14 billion in 2024, up 25% YoY, compared with 4% YoY growth for gaming apps. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) apps had the most explosive growth in 2024, with consumer spending increasing 200% YoY to $1.1 billion on apps including ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Doubao. At that rate, the subcategory could reach the top 10 by consumer spending within a year. Dive Insight: Along with identifying an increase in in-app spending, Sensor Tower’s latest state of the industry report shows that consumers’ time spent on their mobile phones increased by 5.8% YoY in 2024 to a whopping 4.2 trillion total hours worldwide. Wider availability of generative AI platforms led to a massive increase in the category’s revenue take, though it remains behind established stalwarts. Social media and film and television streaming were the top in-app revenue-producing categories, accounting for $11.7 billion and $11.9 billion in spending, respectively. Interestingly, the two categories have taken different approaches to revenue generation. Social media relies heavily on in-app purchases and creator tipping. It’s also mainly dominated by two platforms, TikTok and YouTube, which alone make up more than 70% of category consumer spend . Meanwhile, film and television streaming apps monetize through subscriptions, which has led to more competition. Nine different apps account for at least 3% of the overall streaming revenue, and none account for more than 15%. Still, the ways consumers are choosing to use their mobile devices are beginning to shift. The report shows growth in app categories that connect users across devices or to in-person experiences. Food and drink app downloads, for instance, increased 8.5% YoY as more companies integrated their app into the overall customer experience. Similarly, finance apps, led by the popularity of digital wallets and mobile banking, saw 8% YoY download growth to 7.5 billion and a 21% increase in time spent. “As consumers spend more time on mobile, they are becoming far more comfortable making purchases on their devices,” said Oliver Yeh, CEO and co-founder of Sensor Tower, in a statement. “Apps have shifted their monetization strategies to capitalize on this increased attention, finding innovative ways to streamline and improve consumers' digital experience.” Recommended Reading ‘The year of implementation’: How marketers are leveraging AI on mobile Marketing Dive purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Technology, Consumer Trends"

    "article_text": "(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) By Bloomberg | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com | Bloomberg PUBLISHED: January 26, 2025 at 8:41 AM PST | UPDATED: January 27, 2025 at 10:03 AM PST The Federal Reserve’s first policy meeting of Donald Trump’s second presidency will likely not include a rate cut. Against a backdrop of healthy demand and stubborn inflation, officials are widely expected to say on wednesday that they’re holding borrowing costs steady. At their December confab, policymakers signaled just two interest-rate cuts this year. The US economy remained at a comfortable cruising speed in the final stretch of 2024, powered by healthy consumer spending and creating even more separation from its global counterparts. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the government’s initial estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product — the sum of goods and services produced — to show an annualized 2.7% increase. That would follow back-to-back quarters of about 3% growth. GDP stats are projected to show personal consumption of goods and services exceeded a 3% annualized pace for a second straight quarter, fueled by a strong labor market. That helps to explain how the US continues to outperform advanced economies in Europe and around the world. In contrast to the US, fresh figures are expected to reveal that the French economy stagnated in the closing months of 2024, as well as a slight contraction in Germany. Data on GDP in the broader euro area are seen showing scant growth — extending a multi-year trend of sluggishness. Monthly US household spending figures on Friday will likely point to momentum heading into 2025. Economists also expect the personal income and spending report to show a slight pickup in the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge from a month earlier. “While loan-delinquency rates have been rising — especially for lower-income households — wealthier households that account for about 40% of consumer spending have benefited from the equity-market rally and asset appreciation. We’ve taken that signal onboard in our 2025 consumption forecast, and now expect spending to slow more gradually than we previously did,” says Bloomberg Economics.

    "article_text": "Mumbai, Jan 25 : The Indian retail sector leased 8.1 million square feet of area in shopping malls and prominent high streets across top seven cities in 2024, overcoming limited new supply, according to a report on Saturday. The year witnessed new retail space additions of nearly 1.7 million square feet across seven retail developments in Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad, according to a JLL India report. Despite limited infusion of new spaces of superior quality, momentum in retail sector's gross leasing remained unaffected as retailers continued to expand footprint across retail formats throughout the year. Bengaluru accounted for 34 per cent share of the total leasing activity, followed by Delhi NCR (14 per cent) and Mumbai (14 per cent). The concentration of 62 per cent of total retail space take-up in these three Indian megalopolises underscores the strong consumption demand in prime retail centres and key high streets in these markets, said the report. \"Retailer appetite for prime retail locations remained firm throughout 2024 and categories such as fashion and apparel continued to amass the highest percentage share in the total retail leasing pie,\" said Dr Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research and REIS, India, JLL. With a significant 2.8 million sq ft share in leasing activity, Bengaluru surpassed the combined leasing volume of Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. In 2024, 27 new brands of international origin entered India, nearly doubling from 14 in 2023. In the past four years, 60 retailers of international origin have forayed in the country to cater to Indian consumers perpetual preference for global brands. \"The entry of these brands in 2024 represents a 45 per cent share of the total international brands that entered India since 2021,\" the report mentioned. Despite continued interest from international retailers, domestic retailers dominated the gross leasing with more than 80 per cent share, leasing approximately 6.5 million sq ft in 2024. \"Delhi NCR emerged as the preferred location for over half of these international retailers to open their inaugural stores, followed by Mumbai. The luxury retail sector maintained its strong momentum, with high-end brands leasing approximately 190,000 square feet of space in 2024,\" said Rahul Arora, head (office leasing and retail services), and senior managing director–Karnataka, Kerala, India, JLL. —IANS na/"

    "article_text": "The tech industry has chosen artificial intelligence as the basis of its developments to grow in the short, medium, and long term. This has led to dozens of new services and apps with incredible AI-powered capabilities. In the mobile segment, Google and Samsung have been pioneers in the heavy implementation of this technology. According to a new report, AI helped to greatly increase consumer spending on apps in 2024. App consumer spending reached $1 billion in 2024 thanks to AI People are apparently becoming more comfortable with using AI. AI-enabled features can be so useful and fun that many already consider them essential for their daily or occasional use. Image and video editors are often a good example of apps with AI features that are popular with the public. The technology allows complex changes to be applied in a few taps. They also can convert existing images or photos into different styles in a few seconds. That said, AI costs money, and most of these apps offer limited free trials of their most advanced options. If you want to increase your usage limit, you’ll have to pay a fee. Sensor Tower’s latest “State of Mobile” report says that users are becoming more willing to pay for apps if they have AI-powered features. The market research firm’s report found that AI features helped boost app spending to $150 billion by 2024. This represents a 13% year-on-year increase. The study says that interest in AI-powered apps rose sharply last year . AI apps like ChatGPT, Gemini, and ByteDance’s Doubao—among others—drove consumer spending on apps up 200% year-over-year. In total, these types of apps took $1.1 billion out of users’ wallets in 2024. AI apps were used for 7.7 billion hours last year; 17 billion downloads Last year, consumers used AI apps for nearly 7.7 billion hours and downloaded them about 17 billion times. Sensor Tower says that at this rate, AI apps will quickly move into the top 10 for annual consumer spending. So, all signs point to a growing demand for AI-powered apps. ChatGPT, a pioneer in the segment, reached 50 million monthly active users. Most impressively, it did so faster than services like Temu, Disney+, or YouTube Music."

    "article_text": "Shop workers report weekly attacks of bad language and violent behaviour A new campaign launched to combat physical contact and abuse about race, sexual orientation, and religion News Sean Murphy 05:00, 24 Jan 2025 View Image Supermarket worker (file photo) (Image: AFP via Getty Images) A proliferation of bullying and threatening abuse suffered by shop workers has been exposed in a shocking new survey. More than 20% of retail staff say they have been targeted by the public every week – and revealed inappropriate language and behaviour that was violent, aggressive, and intimidating. Workers reported physical contact and abuse about race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and religion. Employers have branded the conduct unacceptable and launched a new Kindness Week campaign that started on Monday past and runs until Sunday to encourage the public to be kind. It is led by Circle K, Maxol, and Mr Price Branded Bargains, and is supported by Retail Ireland. They carried out a survey and found 21% of retail employees in Ireland experience abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour from the public weekly. Their research shows that female retail staff report experiencing abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour from customers at a higher rate (75%) than male retail workers (60%). Some 74% of retail workers surveyed have seen or heard abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour directed towards a colleague at work. Some 86% feel they would be supported by their employers if they experience abusive behaviour. Some 83% stated that the vast majority of customers are kind and respectful – and this helps to form the basis for the new Kindness Week campaign. READ MORE: Supermarket staff in Dublin wearing bodycams due to rise in violence READ MORE: Staff defend themselves with kitchen utensils in vicious chip-shop brawl Retail Ireland director Arnold Dillon said “Any level of harassment toward retail staff is an enormous concern. The survey highlighted some very serious issues, including incidence of physical assault and verbal abuse. The consequences for staff are very real, including mental health issues, burnout and increased absence.” Other key findings include that over half (57%) of staff across the three retailers witnessed inappropriate or abusive language or behaviour directed towards a colleague. Some 35% of these outlined that it was violent, aggressive or threatening in nature and 28% reported discriminatory language. Some 64% experienced colleagues being subjected to foul language, discriminatory language (44%), violent, aggressive or threatening behaviour (43%), and physical contact (14%). Circle K Ireland managing director Ciara Foxton said: “Our people are at the heart of everything we do in Circle K. Their safety is our number one priority. In recent years we have seen an increase in unacceptable behaviour towards our teams.” Maxol chief Brian Donaldson said: “Our dedicated teams work tirelessly to serve communities across Ireland and they deserve to be treated with respect.” Mr Price Branded Bargains operations director Edel McSorley said: “We’re reminding everyone that even small acts of patience and courtesy make a big difference.” A survey spokesperson said: “We want people to consider the impact their behaviour can have on retail employees. We also want to thank customers who are kind and respectful. Over a fifth of Irish retail workers experience abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour from the public on a weekly basis. “The new research from Circle K, Maxol and Mr Price Branded Bargains, supported by Retail Ireland, highlights the issue of unacceptable behaviour towards employees in the Irish retail sector. The research into types of behaviour that retail employees experience in the workplace forms part of Kindness Week, a campaign designed to raise awareness of the issue of mistreatment of staff in retail but to also celebrate retail staff and say thank you to customers who are kind and respectful. “Two years ago, Circle K first launched a Kindness Day campaign to highlight the issue of unacceptable customer behaviour and to strongly encourage members of the public to always treat staff with kindness. This year, the initiative has been extended to a weeklong campaign with Mr Price Branded Bargains and Maxol coming on board alongside Retail Ireland who supported with the research.” The spokesperson added: “Over two-thirds (68%) of Irish retail workers report experiencing abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour from a customer at work. The research also revealed a higher rate of abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour directed towards female staff members. Of the 500 retail employees surveyed, 75% of female respondents experienced this behaviour, compared to 60% of male counterparts. “Of retail staff in Ireland that report experiencing abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour while at work, 35% outlined that it was violent, aggressive or threatening in nature. Some 22% reported that it took the form of discriminatory language. Additionally, almost three quarters (74%) of retail staff in Ireland have seen or heard abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour directed towards a colleague at work. “Younger staff working in Irish retail settings (18 to 24-year-olds) report experiences of abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour most (78%), compared to staff aged over 55 who reported the lowest rate (28%). Of Irish retail workers that have witnessed colleagues experiencing abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour over the past year, the most common types cited include foul language (76%), discriminatory language (38%), violent, aggressive or threatening behaviour (39%), and physical contact (12%).\" She continued: “For retail staff in Ireland that have seen or heard colleagues experiencing abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour over the past year, 31% report it was regarding race or ethnicity, 27% gender, 22% age, 15% sexual orientation and 15% religion. Article continues below \"While unacceptable customer behaviour is a significant issue that can impact people working in Ireland’s retail sector, an industry which employs over 370,000 people in Ireland, 86% of retail workers feel they would be supported by their employer if they experienced abusive or inappropriate language or behaviour from a member of the public.” Join the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

    "article_text": "Social network X has grown its in-app revenue over the past year, despite a decline in active users, new data shows. Global consumer spending in the X mobile app across both iOS and Android has climbed by 76.3% year-over-year, when comparing two similar periods in January, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures . However, other data indicates X’s daily active users have declined, as usage of rivals like Bluesky and Threads has increased. In an analysis performed by Appfigures, X’s global consumer spending on iOS and Android reached $7.6 million for the period of January 1-20, 2024. During the same time in January 2025, X saw $13.4 million in consumer spending, the firm said. This figure includes in-app purchases made through X’s mobile apps — not revenue from advertising or subscriptions bought on the web, where X users receive a discount on their purchases. Image Credits: Appfigures In other words, this is not a number that represents X’s total revenue. X continues to be a largely advertising-driven business, so this is only a window into consumer spending trends. The addition of xAI’s Grok AI chatbot to X’s app may be helping to fuel the increase in consumer spending, at least in part. There were obvious spikes in net revenue shortly after X began testing a free version of Grok in X in November. This was just ahead of X’s addition of a faster model and a new Grok button to the X app in mid-December 2024 and the launch of a new image generation model on December 9. X also added an NFL portal in late November to increase sports engagement on its app. This could have boosted X adoption given that sports is one of the most-discussed topics on X. In the U.S., X saw 61.4% growth in year-over-year consumer spending on iOS and Android, growing from $4.4 million from January 1-20, 2024, to $7.1 million during the same period in 2025. Image Credits: Appfigures While global mobile consumer spending is up year-over-year, the monthly totals haven’t always been on a steady climb. In some months, the spending dropped, and in other months it climbed. During 2025, the lowest month was February, with spending of $9.6 million across iOS and Android. December saw the highest total with $25.6 million, after increases that started in October leading up to the U.S. elections.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 W AITLIST NOW Screenshot Image Credits: Appfigures The top in-app purchases on the X iOS app in January 2025 are as follows: No. 1 is the X Premium Monthly subscription ($11/mo.), followed by the X Premium Plus Monthly subscription ($30/mo.), X Premium Basic Monthly ($4/mo.), a subscription to Elon Musk’s account directly ($4/mo.), and X Premium’s Annual Subscription ($114.99/yr.). Screenshot Image Credits: Appfigures Despite the jump in consumer spending toward year-end, further data suggests that X may be losing active users. Both X’s U.S. and worldwide daily active users decreased in January 2025, with each figure down by roughly 13% compared with the same time last year, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Sensor Tower , shared in response to a data request from TechCrunch. Year-over-year growth in monthly active users on X has also dipped slightly, Sensor Tower found. The firm’s principal market insights manager, Jonathan Briskman, told TechCrunch that X had more than 313 million worldwide mobile app MAUs (monthly active users) in the fourth quarter of 2024 and more than 300 million worldwide mobile app MAUs through January 2025 month-to-date. As X’s active usage dipped when comparing the same period in January 2024 with January 2025, daily active users on competing apps Instagram Threads and Bluesky jumped up more than 170% and 495%, respectively. This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including international expansions and the addition of several new features and functionality across both platforms. We asked X if it could share its own internal MAUs figure, but the company did not respond. While the data shared by Appfigures and Sensor Tower focuses on consumer spending, there are indications that X’s advertising business is on the upswing, too. According to ad spend data provider Guideline , X saw a 123% improvement in ad spend in December 2024, after declines of -32% in November, down from 60-80% declines it saw over the past two years.

    "article_text": "RHB Research expects consumer spending to remain anchored by a robust employment market and continuous government assistance for lower-income groups. PETALING JAYA: Consumer sentiment will likely stay subdued, despite the anticipated rise in disposable income. According to RHB Research, elevated inflationary pressures – with income levels taking time to catch up to the increase in living costs – are expected to weigh on consumer sentiment. “This would compel inflation-weary consumers to stretch their money by downtrading, being more price-sensitive and seeking better value, thereby capping overall discretionary spending,” the research house said in a report yesterday. RHB Research expects consumer spending to remain anchored by a robust employment market and continuous government assistance for lower-income groups, such as cash handouts and subsidies. It noted that disposable income will be supported by wage hikes in both the public and private sectors. The upsized cash handouts totalling RM13bil for 2025 will also help consumers manage the rising costs. “The positive momentum of tourist arrivals, too, is a boon for the sector – particularly for the consumer retail companies – whilst the jump in crude palm oil prices should boost consumer spending in rural areas. “Meanwhile, for the consumer companies, the relatively stronger ringgit as well as more favourable and stable commodity prices should help protect their profit margins,” RHB Research said. However, it cautioned against the inflationary impact that may arise from targeted petrol subsidy rationalisation. The research house kept its “neutral” call on the sector with top picks namely MR DIY Group (M) Bhd , Farm Fresh Bhd , Focus Point Holdings Bhd and Guan Chong Bhd . It has a “buy” call on these counters with target prices of RM2.35, RM2.11, RM1.20, and RM6.22 per share, respectively. “We prefer companies that benefit from solid demand, which grants them pricing power to mitigate rising operating costs brought about by the higher minimum wage,” it added.

    "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) helps drive consumer spending on apps to 150 billion U.S. dollars globally in 2024, up 13 percent from the prior year, according to an annual \"State of Mobile\" report newly released by app intelligence provider Sensor Tower. AI apps saw a surge of interest over the past year. This led to an over 200 percent year-over-year increase in consumer spending in AI apps like ChatGPT, Gemini, ByteDance's Doubao, and others, bringing the total spent in the category to nearly 1.1 billion dollars in 2024, the report said. As a result, consumers spent nearly 7.7 billion hours using AI apps in 2024, while apps mentioning \"AI\" were also downloaded 17 billion times in the year. ChatGPT alone reached 50 million monthly active users. Meanwhile, finance apps retained double-digit year-over-year growth for time spent in 2024 and neared 7.5 billion downloads, up 8 percent from 2023, the report said. E-commerce apps Temu and Shein ranked as the No. 1 and No. 2 apps, respectively, in the retail subgenre, thanks to their expansions in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The study includes the analysis of the iOS App Store and Google Play, but not any of the third-party app stores in other regions, according to Sensor Tower.

Pangilinan’s Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) to energize its properties in Metro Manila with clean power. Meralco’s MPower has entered into a long-term contract for 100 percent supply of renewable energy to SM Retail’s largest establishments in the metro, including the group’s main headquarters in Pasay. SM Retail operates the retail business of the SM Group that includes department stores, supermarkets and specialty outlets. “As a key player in the retail industry, SM remains vigilant of its environmental impact and social responsibility,” said SM Retail vice president for workplace and administration Luis Lava Jr. With this strategic collaboration with MPower, Lava said the company is on track to achieve its target of “powering our facilities with renewable energy under the competitive retail electricity market (CREM).” Regulated by the Energy Regulatory Commission, CREM enables power end-users with a monthly consumption of at least 500 kilowatts to choose their energy supplier based on their specific requirements. The program is designed to promote market competition and ensure affordable electricity for consumers. “SM Retail now stands among our valued customers to benefit from MPower’s competitively priced renewable energy portfolio,” Meralco first vice president and MPower head Redel Domingo said. “As a reflection of our commitment to sustainability, we will continue our efforts to meet the growing demand for renewable energy supply in the contestable market,” Domingo said. Previously, MPower renewed its partnership with ABS-CBN Corp. to power the media giant’s main buildings in Quezon City. MERALCO SM BrandSpace Articles 50 winners of P50,000?

    "article_text": "Martyn Landi, PA Technology Correspondent 22 January 2025 at 3:01 am 0 Copied Mobile app spending on generative AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT tripled globally in 2024, according to new data. The annual State of Mobile report from digital economy data firm Sensor Tower said consumer spending on in-app purchases and subscriptions to AI chatbot apps reached 1.1 billion dollars (£893 million). The report said AI chatbot apps saw the biggest surge in interest from consumers during last year, with time spent in those apps exceeding 7.7 billion hours, while apps mentioning “AI” were downloaded 17 billion times. In 2024, generative AI chatbots became increasingly more ubiquitous as models such as Google’s Gemini launched as a standalone app for the first time, while OpenAI expanded the availability of ChatGPT, and a number of other apps also became available on mobile devices. Away from AI, the report said consumer spending on in-app purchases and subscriptions reached 150 billion dollars globally, an 13% increase on the previous year. Smartphone users also clocked up 4.2 trillion hours of use, the report said, up 5.8% year-on year. However, the number of app downloads actually fell slightly to 136 billion in 2024, down 1% on the previous year. In the UK, in-app purchase revenue was 55.1 million dollars (£48 million), up from 24.5 million dollars (£20 million) in 2023, and downloads rose to 30.8 million from 22.5 million in 2023. Oliver Yeh, chief executive of Sensor Tower, said: “Apps continue to capture consumer attention, particularly in non-games. “And as consumers spend more time on mobile, they are becoming far more comfortable making purchases on their devices. “Apps have shifted their monetisation strategies to capitalise on this increased attention, finding innovative ways to streamline and improve consumers’ digital experience. “As we look ahead, we expect to see more apps experiment with AI, finding novel and creative ways of incorporating the technology.”"

    "article_text": "AAR sees ‘uncertainty’ for US railroads in 2025 Stuart Chirls January 13, 2025 5 min read The first word in the Association of American Railroad’s annual Rail Industry Outlook is “uncertainty,” as a slew of economic and policy issues weigh on the business in 2025. To further temper optimism, the report says that uncertainty is more pronounced amid cyclical factors and expectations for policy changes in the year ahead. “Potential shifts in fiscal policy, trade, immigration, taxation and regulatory frameworks — alongside evolving monetary policy from the Federal Reserve — are contributing to heightened economic uncertainty as we enter 2025,” wrote Rand Ghayad, AAR chief economist and senior vice president of policy and economics, in the report. “The interplay between these policies will be critical in determining whether the labor market remains resilient enough to sustain consumer spending and support continued rail intermodal growth, as seen in 2024. “Similarly, the trajectory of the manufacturing sector, which has faced two years of persistent weakness that has weighed heavily on rail carload volumes, will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve in response to both fiscal and monetary measures in the months ahead.” What the report doesn’t say explicitly is that much of that uncertainty is driven by expectations for business under a second Trump administration. Railroads posted a strong finish to 2024. Intermodal volume saw its third-highest year ever, capped by record December traffic on continued strong consumer spending and percolating port activity. Declining coal shipments continued to drag down carloads. However, excluding coal, carloads were narrowly up in December from the same month in 2023, and for 11 months in 2024 — the first time that had occurred since 2018, led by chemicals and grain. The AAR’s Freight Rail Index (FRI) measuring seasonally adjusted intermodal volumes plus carloads excluding coal and grain in December rose 2.2% from the previous month, to its highest point since January 2021. “This sustained upward trend indicates that, despite persistent manufacturing weakness and policy-related uncertainties, the broader U.S. economy remains on relatively firm footing as we begin 2025,” Ghayad wrote. Consumer spending, a “pivotal support” for intermodal, remains “robustly strong” on an equally solid labor market. Adjusted for inflation, spending was 2.9% higher than in November 2023 while spending on goods increased by 3.4% — its biggest gain in a year — following increases of 3% in September and October. Containers accounted for a record 96.3% of U.S. intermodal originations in 2024, on concurrent double-digit gains in port volumes, particularly on the West Coast. Story Continues Consumer spending was underpinned by an average of 186,000 new jobs per month in 2024, the report said, down from an economically unsustainable 251,000 in 2023 but on par with the 183,000 monthly average from 2010-2019. Inflation-adjusted average earnings were higher on a year-over-year basis for 20 straight months through December 2024 after 25 consecutive monthly declines. Unemployment dipped to 4.1% in December 2024, about where it has been for the past six months. The report called out some labor headwinds. The rate of workers who voluntarily quit their jobs for better opportunities fell from 2.1% in October to 1.9% in November, matching its lowest level since May 2020. Initial unemployment claims edged higher in December, while it took job seekers longer to find a job than a year or two ago. Even so, “the labor market continues to exceed expectations, offering optimism that consumer spending and rail intermodal activity will remain supported,” wrote Ghayad. “A sudden downturn in the labor market that becomes self-reinforcing, a decline in confidence prompting consumers and businesses to save more for uncertain times, and a return of rising inflation that could erode purchasing power are among the potential obstacles to continued spending growth.” The year-on-year rate of decline in key inflation indexes such as the Consumer Price Index and the Federal Reserve’s favored Personal Consumption Expenditures index moderated through the end of 2024, indicating inflationary risks remain. But that was enough to spur interest rate cuts in September, November and December as the Fed sought to stabilize the jobs market and find a “neutral” interest rate amenable to sustainable growth, moderate inflation and low unemployment. “In practical terms, the current policy environment places the economy — and industries such as railroads — in a holding pattern,” Ghayad wrote. “While the Fed’s rate cuts offer some relief, uncertainty remains elevated. Key questions around future inflation trends, interest rate adjustments, and the broader economic outlook will continue to shape business conditions in the months ahead.” The decline in U.S. manufacturing over the past two years has weighed on carload traffic, and while business confidence is higher ahead of 2025, uncertainties remain. In 2024, coal shipments fell 13.6% from a year ago to 2.94 million, lowest on record but still accounting for more than a quarter of all carloads. Excluding coal, U.S. carloads increased 1.9% in December, the 11th straight y/y gain, 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 1.4% for the year. Twelve of 20 carload categories tracked by the AAR were higher in 2024 than in 2023. Increased exports helped grain lead at 1.07 million carloads, up 8.5%, though it represented the fewest carloads since 2019. Chemicals totaled 1.69 million carloads in 2024, a record, up 4.1% y/y, and have grown each month since September 2023 due in part to low natural gas prices for producers that use gas as a feedstock or energy source. Carloads of petroleum products in 2024 were the most since 2019, the report said, on higher crude oil shipments, while the manufacturing slowdown pushed steel products to their lowest level since 2020. Motor vehicles rose 1.2% in 2024 y/y but declined in November and December. “Recent surveys from the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable suggest that business confidence rose in the fourth quarter of 2024 in anticipation of 2025,” Ghayad wrote. “How 2025 will play out is unknown, but railroads are prepared to help their customers and the economy continue to grow.” Find more articles by Stuart Chirls here .

Sign-up for email today! Get Updates Distributed power units of a westbound BNSF intermodal train pass the Fairview Avenue Metra station in Downers Grove, Ill., on May 31, 2024. U.S. intermodal volume in 2024 was the third highest ever. David Lassen The first word in the Association of American Railroad’s annual Rail Industry Outlook is “uncertainty,” as a slew of economic and policy issues weigh on the business in 2025. To further temper optimism, the report says that uncertainty is more pronounced amid cyclical factors and expectations for policy changes in the year ahead. “Potential shifts in fiscal policy, trade, immigration, taxation and regulatory frameworks — alongside evolving monetary policy from the Federal Reserve — are contributing to heightened economic uncertainty as we enter 2025,” wrote Rand Ghayad, AAR chief economist and senior vice president of policy and economics, in the report. “The interplay between these policies will be critical in determining whether the labor market remains resilient enough to sustain consumer spending and support continued rail intermodal growth, as seen in 2024. “Similarly, the trajectory of the manufacturing sector, which has faced two years of persistent weakness that has weighed heavily on rail carload volumes, will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve in response to both fiscal and monetary measures in the months ahead.” What the report doesn’t say explicitly is that much of that uncertainty is driven by expectations for business under a second Trump administration. Railroads posted a strong finish to 2024. Intermodal volume saw its third-highest year ever, capped by record December traffic on continued strong consumer spending and percolating port activity. Declining coal shipments continued to drag down carloads. However, excluding coal, carloads were narrowly up in December from the same month in 2023, and for 11 months in 2024 — the first time that had occurred since 2018, led by chemicals and grain. The AAR’s Freight Rail Index (FRI) measuring seasonally adjusted intermodal volumes plus carloads excluding coal and grain in December rose 2.2% from the previous month, to its highest point since January 2021. “This sustained upward trend indicates that, despite persistent manufacturing weakness and policy-related uncertainties, the broader U.S. economy remains on relatively firm footing as we begin 2025,” Ghayad wrote. Consumer spending, a “pivotal support” for intermodal, remains “robustly strong” on an equally solid labor market. Adjusted for inflation, spending was 2.9% higher than in November 2023 while spending on goods increased by 3.4% — its biggest gain in a year — following increases of 3% in September and October. Containers accounted for a record 96.3% of U.S. intermodal originations in 2024, on concurrent double-digit gains in port volumes, particularly on the West Coast.

    "article_text": "Leadership Leadership Strategies Consumer Spending Forecast 2025: Good Jobs And Savings Drive Growth By Bill Conerly , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Bill Conerly connect the dots between the economy ... and business! Follow Author Jan 14, 2025, 07:30am EST Share Save Comment People shop in the Glendale Galleria (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Getty Images Consumer spending will play a large role in the economy in 2025, as it always does. However, the impact has often been overstated. Nonetheless, the strong footing of households—in the aggregate—set the stage for solid economic gains this year, though with the potential for continued inflation. The key elements supporting the forecast of strong consumer spending include good employment with wages rising faster than prices now and accumulated savings and investments. Personal consumption expenditures amounted to 68% of total gross domestic product in the most recent quarter. However, much of that amount is very stable or not a cash expense. Thus, the total is more stable and less subject to economic fluctuations that other parts of GDP, such as construction and business equipment purchases. Healthcare is a good portion of total consumption, 11% of GDP. Much of that is covered by some form of insurance. And eight percent of GDP is “imputed rental of owner-occupied housing.” That is, a person owns a home. The statistician considers that the homeowner pays himself rent at a market rate. The rent is both income and an expenditure. But no money changes hands, unless the homeowner chooses to shift some cash from the left pocket to the right pocket. Still, some portions of consumer expenditures are quite sensitive to economic conditions, including durable goods (automobiles, furniture, sporting goods, etc.) and some services. Everyone has to eat food, but no one has to eat in a restaurant. The same number of calories can be bought expensively or cheaply. If consumers economize where they can, the aggregate total will come down sharply. Consumer Income As of January 2025, though, consumers are neither slowing down nor going overboard. Let’s begin with their income. Jobs have increased by 1.4% over the last 12 months, with the unemployment rate relatively low at 4.1%. News headlines have mentioned workers losing jobs, but the hard data on people filing initial claims for unemployment insurance suggests that the U.S. is in a layoff drought. The difference between news reports and aggregate statistics highlights the routine churn in the economy. New jobs are created while old jobs are lost. Some people will lose their jobs every month, even in months when hiring much exceeds dismissals. Average wages have increased by four percent while consumer prices are up 2.7%. Prices still seem high, at least to those of us who recall 2020. But relative to a year ago, wage-earners are making progress. MORE FOR YOU As a result of the wage gains, disposable (after-tax) income adjusted for inflation increased by 2.6% over the past 12 months, a solid gain. Consumer Assets Assets owned by households have increased more than liabilities have, generating a large 11% gain in net worth. In addition to investments, which have increased in value, people have been keeping more money on hand. Checkable deposits plus currency holdings have increased by 10% in the last year, while consumer credit rose less than inflation, just two percent. Certainly some people struggle to pay bills. For those concerned about the aggregate economy, though, the total statistics throw the most weight. On any given day, reporters will tell the story of some family in dire straits. Not making headlines, though, are the millions of people with jobs, buying things, paying their bills and saving something for the future. In fact, people have kept a large portion of the stimulus payments they received back in the pandemic. I calculated the trend growth of savings before the pandemic and projected that trend into the years 2020 through 2024. Then I pulled data on actual savings. At its peak, excess savings (actual savings minus the projected trend line) totaled $2.6 trillion. What’s left? About $1.4 trillion. Other economists did similar calculations with somewhat different results, but there’s no doubt that consumers are, in general, in good condition going into the new year. And this view of past stimulus payments appears conservative relative to household checking account balances. Risks to Consumer Spending What could throw consumers off track? The risks include tariffs and international calamities. Although we cannot be certain about President-elect Trump’s future policies, we can be pretty sure that he will increase tariffs. Congress has granted the president wide authority in this area, so he won’t need to get votes on Capitol Hill. At this point we don’t know the details of what he will do, but we do know the most likely pattern. First, he’ll bluster, as he’s been doing since his election. Then he will impose high tariffs. Then he will negotiate with foreign leaders, cut a deal, and lower tariffs somewhat. That was the pattern in his first administration and his likely strategy in his second term of office. And he really enjoys negotiating, which comes across clearly in his book, The Art of the Deal . But the initial impact of tariffs could be staggering to consumers. My fellow Forbes contributor Gene Marks quotes a study suggesting that laptop and tablet prices might rise by 46% after tariffs. Consumers don’t like price hikes. They will eventually accept the reality that they have to pay higher prices, but only after months of anger and refusal to spend. Another risk to consumer spending in 2025 is international conflict. Plenty of locations could explode: Ukraine-Russia, the Middle East and the Straits of Taiwan top the list. Most international conflicts don’t impact U.S. consumers, but a serious fighting war with U.S. troops, or a nuclear detonation, would probably lead consumers to sit tight and see what develops. The other usual risk for consumer spending—recession—appears quite unlikely. The latest Wall Street Journal poll of economists shows an average risk of recession of only 26%, and that will probably drop in the survey scheduled for mid-January. Interest Rates And Consumer Spending Interest rates can help or hurt consumer expenditures on cars, boats and other big-tickets items. My updated interest rate forecast shows level interest rates, as the Federal Reserve looks at solid job gains, stubborn inflation, continued deficit spending by the federal government, and reduced immigration that will limit growth of productive capacity. Most likely, interest rates will be neither a positive nor a negative for consumer spending in the year ahead. Consumer Spending Forecast 2025 Total consumer spending should rise at a moderate pace in 2025, fueled by jobs, wage increases exceeding inflation, and past asset growth. However, businesses should not expect overly-exuberant spending on discretionary items in a level-interest-rate environment. Companies selling to consumers should also expect strong resistance to the purchase of those goods whose prices have been pushed up by tariffs. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

Photo / Alex Burton New Zealand’s consumer spending growth was at its lowest level in five years in 2024, as Kiwis spent less in December despite a late holiday rush, payment provider Worldline has revealed. Spending through core retail merchants (excluding hospitality) reached $36.03 billion in the full year of 2024, which is up by 0.8% on 2023 after adjusting for merchants moving to or from the Worldline payments network. However, while the number of transactions increased, the average transaction size declined by 0.6% (adjusted) to $50.35. Worldline NZ’s chief sales officer Bruce Proffit said it was the lowest growth he had seen in the last five years. “While consumers may have made more transactions through retailers in Worldline NZ’s payments network than the previous year, the annual underlying spending growth — that is, the actual increase in dollars spent — was the lowest we’ve seen in the last five years,” Proffit said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. “If we look back at 2020, that was clearly a tough year both for consumers and retailers with the onset of Covid, which led to a drop in the number of transactions made through Worldline NZ’s network that year.” Proffit said that the key driver for the decrease was likely the ongoing adjustment of household budgets during the continued cost-of-living crisis. Hospitality merchants particularly faced declining spending, reaching only $11.39 billion for 2024, down by 2.7% compared to 2023. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The average transaction value for hospitality also fell across 2024, down by 1.2% compared to 2023 at $29.51. Steve Armitage, chief executive of Hospitality NZ, said the drop in spending was consistent with what members were experiencing. Photo / Michael Craig Hospitality NZ’s chief executive Steve Armitage said the drop in spending was consistent with what they heard from members over the year, particularly during the winter months. “As we know, households experienced reduced disposable income, so even when they were able to enjoy visiting a hospo establishment, it’s not surprising that average transaction value was also reduced,” Armitage said. “While that has had some impact on the number of venues, we also note there are plenty of new ventures opening, indicating an optimism and continued passion for hospitality. At Hospitality NZ, we are cautiously optimistic that 2025 will hold better fortunes for the industry.” Marisa Bidois, chief executive of the Restaurant Association. Photo / Supplied Likewise, Restaurant Association chief executive Marisa Bidois said that although the Christmas preiod is traditionally a high point for the industry, households are continuing to grapple with uncertain economic conditions. “Many of our members have reported quieter-than-usual trading during December, which aligns with the data,” Bidois said. “While these figures are concerning, they are not surprising given the current climate. Rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and changes in consumer spending habits have had a cumulative impact on the industry. “At the same time, the industry faces rising costs of doing business, including higher wages and high ingredient costs which further compound these pressures.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She echoed the sentiment throughout the industry that 2025 will hopefully be a better year thanks to increased consumer confidence, with Bidois encouraging Kiwis to get out and support local hospitality. December hampered early Consumer spending declined in December despite a late boost from holiday sales. When processed through all non-food core retail merchants in December, consumer spending reached $3.82b, down 0.7% compared to December 2023. Regionally, large declines occurred in the major centres of Auckland/Northland (-2.0%), Wellington (-2.0%) and Canterbury (-0.4%). The largest decline nationwide was reported in Marlborough, down by 2.2% compared to 2023. Annual spending growth was highest on the West Coast (+4.2%) and at Whanganui (+3.4%). Retail NZ chief executive Carolyn Young agreed that sales targets for the year were likely cause for concern. “Retailers have advised us that the Christmas rush was late arriving and that although Boxing Day sales were busy, they might not make up for the slow start to December,” Young said. “Profitability will continue to be a major challenge for retailers as they finish off what has been a difficult 2024.” Young said the economy needs to turn around before any recovery can happen, and although a number of levers have been pulled by the Government and the Reserve Bank, she expects the first six months of 2025 to remain challenging. “There are two main factors that are going to affect consumer confidence. Firstly job security. There’s been a lot of people who have been impacted by restructures in their business or with a friend or a member of their whānau now. If you’re not confident in your job, you’re not going to be thinking about going out for dinner or going and buying a little something for yourself in the shops. “Secondly, seeing the positive impact of the change of those interest rates into your wallet. If we can get those two factors aligned, we’re going to see an improvement in consumer confidence.” She had spoken to a number of retailers who had told her it was their “worst year ever” in terms of financial impact and the personal toll. “It’s been super difficult and businesses are hanging on by their fingernails, so we’re really hopeful that we can get through the next few months and start to see some changes.” Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business and retail.
