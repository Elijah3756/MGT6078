Baidu ( BIDU ): Baidu is a heavily discounted AI play that deserves closer inspection. Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ): Ulta Beauty could rise on the retail revenge concept. Kosmos Energy ( KOS ): Kosmos Energy could swing higher on a geopolitical pivot. Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock.com With the equities space continuing to enjoy its blistering recovery from the doldrums of the Covid-19 crisis, fewer and fewer ideas exist that are considered genuine discounts. Nowadays, several of the desirable market ideas just seem overpriced. However, if you look around, there are still some promising enterprises that make up the ranks of oversold stocks to buy on the dip. The ideas that comprise this category attract eyeballs for one main reason: humans love their discounts. Even those who are financially well off typically can’t resist the allure of getting more for their money. It’s like shopping in the grocery store and coming across a two-for-one deal of products you already buy anyways. Why wouldn’t you take the discount? It’s essentially a gift. That’s roughly the same principle here. Of course, red-stained securities are always liable for even more losses. However, some downtrodden names seem ready for a rebound, particularly because of their relevant businesses. With that in mind, below are oversold stocks to buy on the dip. Baidu (BIDU) Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) makes a great case for oversold stocks to buy on the dip thanks to its underlying innovations. To be sure, it’s understandable why the market doesn’t care for BIDU stock. Since the start of the year, shares have plunged more than 23%. The Chinese economy seems suspect, leading to an exit out of the arena. However, the company is also one of the world’s top internet technology firms. What should really attract contrarians is that the company has invested heavily into artificial intelligence and large language models. Still, few want to give the time of day to BIDU, which suits speculators just fine. Right now, shares trade at 1.69X trailing-year revenue. That’s below the 2X multiple that was seen just in the first quarter. And it’s significantly below the 2.95X posted in Q1 2023. Further, in the past four quarters, Baidu’s average earnings per share reached $2.94. In terms of earnings surprise, this performance translated to 26.23%. That’s impressive. For fiscal 2024, analysts are anticipate a slight dip in EPS to $11.21. On the top line, it sees modest growth of 2% to reach $19.34 billion. Still, with the way the company has been performing, Baidu can surprise. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com I know that the consumer economy is struggling under the weight of inflation and high borrowing costs. Therefore, demand for many enterprises under the discretionary category faces significant pressure. However, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA ) arguably deserves a rethink. As a beauty care specialist, it aligns with the experiential focus that has driven travel-sector-related demand. Fundamentally, the forced quarantines that occurred during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis sparked pent-up demand for vacations and other social events and gatherings. So, I anticipate that Ulta Beauty would benefit a bit more from the retail revenge phenomenon. After all, it was the social mobility aspect that was denied during Covid. Unfortunately, the market doesn’t quite see it that way. Since the year’s start, ULTA stock dipped more than 21%. Fine – but let’s also consider that in the past four quarters, the company’s EPS averaged $6.41. This translated to an earnings surprise of 4.08%. For the current fiscal year, analysts see 3.2% sales growth to $11.56 billion. In the following year, revenue may rise by 6% to hit $12.26 billion. Given the aforementioned fundamentals, ULTA ranks among the oversold stocks to buy on the dip. Kosmos Energy (KOS) Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com Specializing in the upstream oil segment of the hydrocarbon value chain, Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS ) has struggled for traction this year. Since the beginning of January, KOS stock fell almost 22%. That’s ugly and there’s more going on than just a broader focus on clean and renewable energy sources. Instead, geopolitics may be playing a huge role in the undervaluation of KOS. Essentially, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be having a detrimental impact on the part of the aggressor. Ukrainian forces have been attacking Russia’s oil refineries (downstream) in a bid to slow its invasion. As a result, Moscow is losing a key revenue stream. It’s got to make up for that loss by selling huge volumes of crude oil (upstream). Naturally, this dynamic has an impact on upstream specialists. Here’s the thing: this geopolitical crisis can pivot in any number of ways. Further, the cooled tensions in the Middle East could easily reignite. That would surely boost demand for upstream companies. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe Kosmos’ sales could hit $2.01 billion. If so, that would imply almost 50% growth. That seems quite reasonable given the circumstances. Thus, KOS is one of the oversold stocks to buy on the dip.

    "article_text": "Illegal migrants who are caught and bussed out of the country can use the “CBP One” cellphone app to get government permission to re-enter the United States, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas declared on June 26. “If an [caught] individual has agreed to and been returned voluntarily [to Mexico], are they eligible for a CBP One appointment? They are,” he told a reporter at his tightly managed Tucson press conference on June 26. “They don’t want to actually bar people from coming into the country,” responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “They just want the [illegal migrants] to be laundered through the CBP One process, and this enables them to do that,” he added. “CBP One” is a smartphone app that allows migrants to request entry into the United States via an official gate, dubbed a “Port of Entry.” Mayorkas’s deputies use the process to give a “parole” legal status to illegal economic migrants. That legal spin helps Mayorkas provide the migrants with the work permits they need to pay off their smuggling debts and bring up their family members. A migrant uses the CBP One application during an Al Otro Lado training session in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, Nov. 28 2023. President Biden has argued that he can bring order to the border, while preserving pathways for people to enter the country legally, by taking a more high-tech approach. CBP One is part of the pledge but advocates say the app has crucial flaws. Photographer: Sandy Huffaker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Mayorkas — who was recently impeached by the House — also suggested he has the legal authority to raise the inflow of parole migrants via CBP One, regardless of immigration numbers set by Congress in 1965 and 1990. “The number of appointments that are permitted through CBP One — approximately 1,400 to 1,500 a day — are based on the capacity of our ports of entry,” he told a reporter. “They are antiquated ports of entry that are also in need of funding to modernize them.” Mayorkas’s current inflow of 1,500 per day adds up to almost 550,000 a year, or one illegal migrant for every seven American births. “What he’s saying is, if Congress gives us more money [for improving the Ports of Entry], we will wave in illegal aliens even faster — which is the objection Republicans have been making all along,” Krikorian said. He added: This administration has created a parallel illegal method of letting people into the country. There are twice as many illegal aliens coming in as legal immigrants, so this ad hoc, bootstrapped immigration system that they’re creating is twice as large as the actual legal immigration system. The current legal immigration system allows roughly one million migrants, or roughly one extra migrant for every 3.5 American births. Mayorkas’s migration enables the annual inflow of at least three migrants — or almost one migrant for every American birth. Biden’s White House deputies support Mayorkas’s border inflow, Krikorian said: If they wanted to truly veto something that he was doing, they could do it. But I don’t think there’s enough energy in the executive [staff] in the White House to actually change Mayorkas’ behavior, and they don’t necessarily really want to anyway. Mayorkas is perhaps the most powerful member of Biden’s cabinet. He is strongly backed by Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us advocacy group, which represents the interests of West Coast investors. The investors gain wealth and power when the government pulls in consumers, renters, and workers from foreign countries. Mayorkas argues that more migration is an economic and moral necessity, regardless of the damage it does to ordinary Americans, the U.S. economy, and the countries that lose their migrants to the U.S. economy. For example, Mayorkas says he supports migrants and claims the “core founding principle” of the United States is “equity,” and that he is building an immigration system that ensures “equity” for migrants who wish to live and work in Americans’ homeland. Mayorkas is also using immigration as an economic strategy to inflate the overall size of the U.S. economy with extra consumers, renters, and workers. “Regrettably, our legal immigration system is not designed to meet the need of employers here in the United States,” Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkjas told the Senate’s judiciary committee in March 2023. He continued: Individuals from other countries want to come here to work, even seasonally, even temporarily, earn the money that they can bring back to their home countries and support their families there … To fulfill the need for labor here in the United States, we can screen and vet these individuals in their home countries, and they can travel safely to the United States by air, gain lawful employment, contribute to our economy, return to their home countries with the earnings that they’ve made and address fundamentally the root causes of why people travel irregularly in the first place … In December 2022, Mayorkas told ElPasoMatters.org : We look to our partner to the north that has a much more nimble immigration system that can be retooled to the needs at the moment. For example, Canada is in need of 1 million workers and they have agreed that in 2023, they will admit 1.4 million … immigrants to fill that labor need that Canadians themselves cannot. We are stuck in antiquated laws that do not meet our current needs. And they haven’t been working for many, many years. This Mayorkas plan echoes President George W. Bush’s planned “ Any Willing Worker ” plan of 2004. Bush’s plan would have tilted the labor market against families by allowing U.S. employers to freely hire people from around the world “ when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs .” Mayorkas’s migration policies unite the progressive and investor wings of the new Democratic Party into a “ We Coalition .” That coalition uses migration to shift wealth and political power from a broad swath of ordinary Americans towards CEOs, wealthy coastal investors, and government elites. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The rarely mentioned economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

    "article_text": "US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut Business Business US inflation cools in May, boosting hopes of Fed rate cut Close PCE price index flat in May, up 2.6pc on year-on-year basis Consumer spending gains 0.2pc Personal income up 0.5pc Follow on Updated On: Sat, 29 Jun 2024 08:56:04 PKT WASHINGTON (Reuters) – US monthly inflation was unchanged in May as a modest increase in the cost of services was offset by the largest drop in goods prices in six months, drawing the Federal Reserve closer to start cutting US interest rates later this year. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed US consumer spending rose marginally last month. Underlying prices advanced at the slowest pace in six months, raising optimism that the central bank could engineer a much-desired \"soft landing\" for the economy in which inflation cools without triggering a recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. Traders raised their bets for a Fed rate cut in September. \"This was a very Fed-friendly report that should keep the September rate cut in play, while at the same time increasing investor confidence that moderate economic growth can be maintained even as rates stay higher for longer,\" said Scott Anderson, chief US economist at BMO Capital Markets. \"The sharp slowdown in core inflation is just what the doctor needed to see to keep the economy on the soft-landing glide-path.\" The flat reading in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index last month followed an unrevised 0.3 per cent gain in April, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. It was the first time in six months that PCE inflation was unchanged. Goods prices fell 0.4pc, the biggest drop since November. There were big declines in prices of recreational goods and vehicles as well as furnishings and durable household equipment. The price of gasoline and other energy goods dropped 3.4pc, the biggest slide in six months. Clothing and footwear were also cheaper, while food prices rose marginally. The cost of services increased 0.2pc, lifted by higher prices for housing and utilities as well as healthcare. Financial services and insurance costs declined 0.3pc after rising for five straight months. These costs, together with housing, have been among the major drivers of services inflation. In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 2.6pc after advancing 2.7pc in April. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. US inflation is receding after spiking in the first quarter as 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the Fed since 2022 cool domestic demand. Inflation, however, continues to run above the central bank's 2pc target. Financial markets saw a roughly 68pc chance that the Fed's policy easing would start in September compared to about 64pc before the data, though policymakers recently adopted a more hawkish outlook. The US central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25pc-5.50pc range since last July. Economists were divided on whether the Fed would still reduce borrowing costs twice this year amid solid wage growth. The release of the US employment report for June next Friday could shed more light on the monetary policy outlook. Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were mixed. SPENDING RISES MODERATELY Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1pc last month, the smallest gain since November. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3pc rise in April. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have climbed 0.2pc in April. Core inflation increased 2.6pc on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8pc in April. It rose at a 2.7pc annualized rate over the past three months, slowing from a 3.5% pace in April. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2pc over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing also ticked up 0.1pc last month after advancing 0.3pc in April. This measure is being watched by policymakers to measure progress in lowering price pressures. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased 0.2pc last month after rising 0.1pc in April, the report also showed. Spending was supported by a 0.3pc gain in services, mostly outlays on hospital care, housing and utilities as well as air transportation. Services spending increased 0.4pc in April. Goods spending rebounded 0.2pc, lifted by outlays on prescription medication, recreational goods and vehicles, and clothing and footwear. Spending on goods fell 0.5pc in April. Inflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs as well as the exhaustion of excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are holding back spending. Nonetheless, consumer spending remains underpinned by a resilient labour market, which continues to generate strong wage gains. Personal income increased 0.5pc after climbing 0.3pc in April. Wages shot up 0.7pc, which some economists said could concern policymakers. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose a solid 0.5pc. Consumers saved more, lifting the US saving rate to 3.9pc from 3.7pc in April. Spending adjusted for inflation rebounded 0.3pc after slipping 0.1pc in April. The rise in the so-called real consumer spending left growth in consumption this quarter on track to match the first quarter's 1.5pc pace. The Atlanta Fed is currently estimating US gross domestic product to rise at a 2.2pc rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4pc pace in the first quarter. \"There was no inflation in May, but there was also no indication of the kind of soft demand – undermined by slower income growth – the Fed believes necessary to keep inflation on a low track,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial."

The U.S. central bank has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range since last July. Story Continues Economists were divided on whether the Fed would still reduce borrowing costs twice this year amid solid wage growth. The release of the U.S. employment report for June next Friday could shed more light on the monetary policy outlook. Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. SPENDING RISES MODERATELY Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since November. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in April. The so-called core PCE price index was previously reported to have climbed 0.2% in April. Core inflation increased 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since March 2021, after rising 2.8% in April. It rose at a 2.7% annualized rate over the past three months, slowing from a 3.5% pace in April. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing also ticked up 0.1% last month after advancing 0.3% in April. This measure is being watched by policymakers to measure progress in lowering price pressures. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in April, the report also showed. Spending was supported by a 0.3% gain in services, mostly outlays on hospital care, housing and utilities as well as air transportation. Services spending increased 0.4% in April. Goods spending rebounded 0.2%, lifted by outlays on prescription medication, recreational goods and vehicles, and clothing and footwear. Spending on goods fell 0.5% in April. Inflation fatigue, higher borrowing costs as well as the exhaustion of excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic are holding back spending. Nonetheless, consumer spending remains underpinned by a resilient labor market, which continues to generate strong wage gains. Personal income increased 0.5% after climbing 0.3% in April. Wages shot up 0.7%, which some economists said could concern policymakers. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose a solid 0.5%. Consumers saved more, lifting the saving rate to 3.9% from 3.7% in April. Spending adjusted for inflation rebounded 0.3% after slipping 0.1% in April. The rise in the so-called real consumer spending left growth in consumption this quarter on track to match the first quarter's 1.5% pace. The Atlanta Fed is currently estimating gross domestic product to rise at a 2.2% rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4% pace in the first quarter. \"There was no inflation in May, but there was also no indication of the kind of soft demand - undermined by slower income growth - the Fed believes necessary to keep inflation on a low track,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial.

    "article_text": "Retail media will account for more than a fifth of all digital ad spending in 2024 (Image credit: AlexSecret / Getty Images) By Justin Klawans, The Week US published 28 June 2024 There may be no bigger scramble in business right now than the race to dominate retail media. What was a relatively new concept just a few years ago has now been brought to the forefront of the digital advertising world , and looks primed to become one of the main sources of revenue for major brands. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than at Cannes Lions, a global advertising festival held in France just weeks after the prestigious Cannes Film Festival . Cannes Lions attracts advertisers from around the world, and this year, retail media dominated the event; this comes as major retailers' \"online businesses continue to intersect with the marketing world,\" said Marketing Brew . But how does retail media work, and why is it primed to dominate the advertising industry? What is retail media? At its most basic, retail media is \"when a retailer offers advertising capabilities and services, similar to what media outlets such as publishers and television networks have done for years,\" said Retail TouchPoints . These advertisements can play out in a variety of ways. The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Sign up This can include \"'on-site' advertising opportunities — such as ads and videos on [a retailer's] own website, app or even in its physical stores ,\" said Retail TouchPoints. The flipside of this is \"off-site\" advertising, when a retailer \"lets advertisers leverage its first party data to reach customers on third-party channels like social media.\" These two forms make up the majority of the retail media network, though \"off-site retail media is typically more complex than on-site.\" How big is the retail media industry? Massive — to a level the average consumer may not realize. Global retail media spend will reach $140 billion this year, according to eMarketer . This will account for more than a fifth of all digital ad spending in 2024 and marks a 21% increase year-to-year from retail media spending in 2023. When looking at individual companies, the scale of their retail media revenues is staggering; one notable example is Amazon , which earned $46.9 billion from retail ads. This figure \"exceeds the annual global revenue of Coca-Cola and makes Amazon the third-largest advertising platform in the United States, behind only Google and Facebook,\" said the Harvard Business Review (HBR) . What comes next for retail media? The industry isn't slowing down anytime soon: Another report from eMarketer found that U.S. retail media spend alone will reach $129 billion by 2028, up from $54 billion this year. Global retail media spend will likely balloon accordingly as well. The industry is \"becoming vital to ad channels outside of retail media networks as the first-party data it gathers from retailers allows for better targeting across social, search, and the open web,\" said eMarketer.

It is now shoppers themselves that are the \"new product being sold in-store and online,\" said Mark Boidman, the head of global media at Solomon Partners, to Axios. Competing within the retail media space \"might mean changing what you stand for as a business. It might mean I am no longer a retailer; I am instead a category owner,\" said Donna Sharp, a managing director at MediaLink. This marks a noted changed in the landscape over the past decade. Few brands \"anticipated 10 years ago that advertising would become a huge growth driver for them , but Amazon's success has goaded them into action,\" said HBR. Companies \"as varied as Dick's Sporting Goods, Home Depot, Instacart, Lowe's, Macy's, Ulta, and Walmart now all own and operate retail media platforms.\" Many of these companies are entering the space because they are \"recognizing that it's a growth opportunity not to be missed,\" and that it is a \"high-growth, high-margin advertising business, one that contrasts favorably with retailers' low-growth, low-margin core businesses.\" But there are still challenges surrounding retail media; this is especially true for brands \"within retail media networks where the retail media teams operate separately from their sales or merchandizing teams,\" said Adweek . And trying to compare trends across retail media networks is still \"apples and oranges,\" General Mills Head of Experience Sarah Leinberger said to Adweek. \"Sometimes they're not even fruit,\" added Clorox Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Eric Schwartz.

    "article_text": "SAUL LOEB / Contributor / Getty Images Close The third and final estimate of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed economic growth was a tick higher in Q1 than previously thought, but still considerably slower than the prior quarter. One thing dragging on GDP is slowed consumer spending, and this revision showed those levels are even lower than originally thought. Consumer spending has been the engine of the economy in the recovery from the pandemic and slower spending could indicate that the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation is taking a toll. The final word on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter is out, and it confirms that U.S. economic growth slowed considerably in the first quarter, but not quite as dramatically as an earlier estimate showed. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.4% in the first quarter, down from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. It was the third and final estimate of GDP growth, revising figures that first came out in April. The second estimate, in May, had shown a 1.3% growth rate. The latest reading on GDP, which measures the country’s entire economic output, incorporated new data showing that the U.S. imported fewer goods and services than previously thought. More imports take away from the country's economic output. GDP Revision Shows Slower Consumer Spending The lessened impact of imports outweighed declines in the estimates for several other areas, including consumer spending, the main engine of the economy. The 1.4% rate was in line with the expectations of forecasters, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal . The GDP reading indicates the economy has slowed as the Federal Reserve’s high interest rates have discouraged borrowing and spending, as intended, to subdue high inflation. The economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, meaning that those high rates have yet to cause a recession. That could change if consumer spending continues to drop. “The cycle that we’re in has been led by consumer spending and if that slows then it could be the beginning of a downturn in economic activity, which would have negative implications for corporate profits and the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina, wrote in a commentary. However, economists expect GDP won't signal an economic slump this year. According to the early estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, GDP is expected to nearly double in the second quarter, rising to 3.0%. \"The monthly data are beginning to flag some slowdown though we think the economy will hold up well in the back half of the year,\" wrote Nationwide's Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin.

    "article_text": "Retail prop trading continues to expand and ranks among the hottest trends, but most potential retail prop traders do not understand the business model. They only look at massively funded accounts, but how do prop firms make money? I will explain the business model of retail prop firms, the difference between retail prop firms and professional prop firms, and help interested traders make an informed decision before starting a paid-for challenge with a Forex prop firm. The first step is understating how retail prop firms make money. Top Forex Brokers 1 Get Started 74% of retail CFD accounts lose money Read Review Understanding the Business of Proprietary Trading Firms There is a stark difference between the revenue models of retail prop trading firms and those of licensed, professional financial firms, hedge funds, and firms that specialize in high-frequency trading . I will focus on the business model of retail forex prop trading firms and explain their approach. Before answering the question of how prop firms make money, retail prop traders must understand the following: They will never trade real money and always manage demo accounts Retail prop firms use copy trading software to copy trades from demo to live accounts they manage Here is the business model of retail prop trading firms: Managing partners have trading capital Retail prop firms seek profitable retail traders that lack capital A paid-for challenge model serves as an initial test and a massive monthly revenue stream Few retail traders pass the challenge. Retail prop traders pay a monthly fee for access to capital A profit-share model provides the prop firm with ongoing capital and rewards traders with income Strict risk management protocols leave little room for error, and retail prop firms kick out traders as soon as they breach a tight drawdown window Do Prop Firms Use Real Money? Most retail prop firms never use real money or live accounts when dealing with prop traders. All challenges or evaluations are in demo accounts, and no actual trading occurs at retail prop firms. So, the name is misleading as it suggests a professional trading firm, while retail prop firms fall into the category of financial games, which is why they remain unregulated. Prospective traders pay for an evaluation account, which retail prop firms provide as a demo account in partnership with their broker or brokers. The one-time evaluation fee is the primary revenue source for retail prop firms, which they may use in live accounts managed by professional prop traders. Funded accounts are also demo accounts, ensuring the retail prop firm has zero risk. Prop traders trade in demo accounts but receive real money payouts funded by the 90%+ of failed challenges. Only a few retail prop firms have a defined path for traders to manage live portfolios with an employment contract, a monthly salary, and performance bonuses. Some retail prop firms that offer no challenge accounts with monthly subscriptions may grant access to live portfolios with tight risk management rules, often limiting the loss to the monthly subscription fee. How Do Prop Firms Make Money? While most retail prop firms may claim that they earn when their prop traders earn, supported by the profit-share model, many retail prop firms earn most of their revenues from paid-for challenge fees and monthly subscriptions. Here is an example: Assume prop trading firm ABC has 10,000 funded prop traders who pay $150 per month for access to capital, generating $1,500,000 in monthly revenue without placing a trade For each funded account, assume 100 traders fail the challenge, which costs $100, or 10,000 (funded traders) x 100 (failed traders per funded account) = 1,000,000 x $100 for a total of $100,000,000 in one-off revenue Noteworthy: The more capital traders seek, the higher the one-off challenge fee and monthly subscription Prop firms have restrictive trading conditions and the retail trader will lose access to capital if they hit the tight daily and overall loss limits. This results in traders either blowing their account or generating relatively small profits, of which the prop trading firm takes between 10% and 50% The Challenge Model The challenge model presents the most substantial one-off revenue stream. Potential retail prop traders pay a fee to participate in the challenge. They must meet select criteria to pass the challenge and receive a funded account. The size of the participation fee depends on the amount of capital they seek. The Profit Split Model The few retail traders that pass the challenge receive a funded account with a profit-split model, where the prop firm makes between 10% and 50% of revenues. Prop traders must consider this against the monthly subscription fee to compute their break-even point. Where Do Prop Firms Get Their Money? Most retail prop firms get money from one-off challenge fees and monthly subscription fees paid by funded prop traders. Trading revenues, if any at all, rank third among their income streams. Managing partners usually provide the initial capital to fund operations. Profitable Traders Profitable traders form the backbone of professional prop trading firms. Regrettably, at retail prop firms, profitable traders fulfill a much less integral role. The best retail forex prop firms will maintain a group of profitable traders with a proven history as an income source. Monitoring of Revenue Streams Retail prop firms deploy sophisticated software to monitor traders, assess risks, and decide which trades to copy into their live accounts. Retail prop traders always manage demo accounts, and prop firms choose which strategies to execute. Bottom Line How do prop firms make money? Retail prop firms generate most of their income from one-off challenge fees and monthly subscriptions by funded traders. Trading revenues come in third, and some retail trading prop firms have no trading revenues. Retail traders should not consider prop trading, which is a challenging profession. In fact, most retail prop firms bank on traders failing their fee-based challenges or violating strict risk management rules."

    "article_text": "close video Biden administration gives Freddie Mac green light to guarantee second mortgages Structured Finance Association CEO Michael Bright weighs in as the U.S. approves Freddie Mac's second mortgage pilot program on 'The Bottom Line.' The Biden administration has approved a move that could essentially put taxpayers on the hook for risky borrowing practices and potential real estate losses — and a former mortgage insider is sounding off on the plan. \"The people who should be really mad, I think, are first-time homebuyers who are trying to get their foot in the housing market. They can't because housing is unaffordable,\" Structured Finance Association CEO Michael Bright, also a former president of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae sister company Ginnie May, said Tuesday on \" The Bottom Line .\" \"This is going to exacerbate that problem.\" Mortgage giant Freddie Mac received the green light from the White House to offer second-lien mortgages, aiming to help homeowners who are locked into lower rates access their home equity. REAL ESTATE EXPERT DEFINES HOUSING MARKET DOOMSDAY: SOMETHING WE ‘HAVEN’T SEEN IN OUR LIFETIME' The proposal allows homeowners to access their home equity while keeping their low interest rate on their current loan. The Urban Institute has reported that it could be a cost-effective alternative to cash-out refinances at today's higher rates, which sat at 6.87% for 30-year fixed rates and 6% for 15-year fixed rates as of Tuesday. The Biden administration approved Freddie Mac's plan to offer second-lien mortgages. (Getty Images) But Bright warned that there are consequences of the government stepping in and guaranteeing second mortgages. \"Freddie Mac is doing this, but Fannie Mae is going to have to follow. They always do,\" the CEO said. \"I really think we've jumped the shark on this one. Having the government subsidize and incentivize equity extraction through second mortgages, we're not solving any problems in our economy. Consumer spending is actually too high. The Fed is working on that through inflation.\" \"You can get mortgage loans through banks and everything, but if the government comes in and really amps this up, you're talking about additional inflationary pressures,\" he expanded. \"You're talking about additional rate-lock effect. People taking equity out of their home means they're not going to sell their home and move. We already have a supply crisis.\" close video Larry Kudlow: Take home pay and mortgage rates will be 'front and center' at the debate FOX Business host Larry Kudlow breaks down America's cost of living crisis on 'Kudlow.' Credible, which is majority owned by Fox Corporation, broke down one example given by the Urban Institute where a borrower with a 3% rate on a $300,000 mortgage would have a monthly payment of about $1,265, but their home is now worth $500,000 and they want to access $100,000 for home improvements. With refinancing at an assumed rate of 7.25%, new monthly payments would be about $2,729. With Freddie Mac’s new proposed plan, the borrower can keep their current monthly payment and take out a new 20-year mortgage for the additional $100,000, adding only $965 per month for a new monthly mortgage total of $2,130.

Bright called this a \"consumer loan.\" \"So while the Fed is fighting inflation and trying to manage consumer spending incomes, Fannie and Freddie uses the taxpayer balance sheet to try and juice consumer spending for reasons we don't really understand,\" he said. \"Taxpayers are going to bear the risk, more second liens.

But be warned: about half of Americans who plan to travel already have their vacation itineraries mapped out.

Δ In fact, according to PYMNTS Intelligence’s summer travel edition of our “ Consumer Credit Economy Monitor ” report, 48% of U.S. consumers who intend to travel this summer had their plans in place as of April. Why the impatience? PYMNTS Intelligence found several key factors are driving consumers to travel more this year. Forty-one percent of those consumers who are vacationing this summer say they simply have a greater interest in traveling, and that is the reason they want to get out of town (21% say it’s their top motivation). In other words, many Americans may be suffering from post-pandemic cabin fever. Optimism around money-related matters is also a major motivator. Twenty-nine percent say improved personal finances sparked their yearning to travel, while 19% credit having stable employment. Similarly, lower travel costs are inspiring 16% of tourists, while 12% say their faith in the economy is driving their vacation plans. But just because consumers are optimistic about their finances doesn’t mean they aren’t concerned about travel costs. According to our report, those with travel plans this summer anticipate spending about $2,400 on their getaways — and 78% say they plan to pay for at least a proportion of their trip with a credit card. The eagerness to travel isn’t limited only to tourists. As PYMNTS reported recently, business travel is on the rebound as well. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Merchants and agencies have taken note of this uptick in the urge to travel and are responding in kind. For instance, as PYMNTS recently reported , Starbucks is teaming up with Marriott’s marketplace Bonvoy to enable loyalty account holders for both brands a chance to earn points they can apply to free food and beverages, as well as rewards at select Marriott destinations. For those travelers seeking a more immersive experience, Sabre Hospitality — a travel software and technology provider — recently introduced a solution that enables select hoteliers to sell travelers unique experiences, services and goods that can be purchased through virtual storefronts. The company also launched an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered retailing platform that gives airlines the ability to offer travel solutions customized to meet the needs of individual travelers. Advanced technology is also being deployed to aid those travelers who are itching to go beyond U.S. borders. The U.S. State Department recently announced earlier this month that it is beta testing a platform that will allow consumers to renew their U.S. passports online. Although access to the platform is currently limited, the State Department said it will eventually be fully available to streamline the passport renewal process. Not to be outdone, the TSA , the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection have all announced they are developing digital functions to simplify meeting travel requirements going forward. Despite ongoing concerns about inflation, consumers and businesses alike are feeling optimistic enough about the economy to make travel plans in the months to come, and leaders in the hospitality industry — and even government agencies — are doing their part to make summer trips a little smoother.

    "article_text": "Economists raise China growth forecasts as exports improve Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Exports are expected to climb 4.3 per cent this year, a jump from the 2.8 per cent gain forecast in a May survey. PHOTO: AFP Follow topic: China Published Jun 26, 2024, 07:55 AM Updated Jun 26, 2024, 06:36 PM BEIJING - The outlook for China’s exports is set to improve, buttressing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy even as consumer spending slows, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Exports are expected to climb 4.3 per cent in 2024 from a year ago, according to the median forecast of 22 economists surveyed from June 17 to 24. That is a jump from the 2.8 per cent gain forecast in a May survey. China’s economy may expand 5 per cent, up from the 4.9 per cent projected in May, according to the median of 68 estimates. “We look for an improving trade outlook over the coming months, driven by a shift in global demand from services back to goods,” said Ms Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia. China’s exports beat expectations in April and May, reflecting strong demand from overseas and the increasing competitiveness of Chinese producers. While this supports Beijing’s strategy of relying on exports to spur growth and offset weak spending by Chinese households, risks are mounting as its companies start to face more trade barriers from the United States and Europe. The survey findings contrast with a recent report by Goldman Sachs Group, which said its clients in China are increasingly sceptical about the outlook for export growth in the coming quarters. Investors are worried about the sustainability of supply-side expansion, especially when domestic demand is weak, and the risks of trade friction, the bank said in the note dated June 23. Economists have pared back their expectations for retail sales growth – a key gauge of consumer spending – as well as consumer and factory-gate price inflation in 2024 , reflecting pessimism over demand as a sharp housing contraction continues, according to the Bloomberg survey. “Recent macro data confirms that drags from the property sector remain,” said Mr Arjen van Dijkhuizen, senior economist at ABN Amro Bank. “Growth is still supported by a stronger momentum in exports, but external risks are rising, as China’s overcapacity contributes to trade spats, with the US and Europe trying to protect strategic industries.” China is unlikely to shake off deflationary pressures in 2024, with economists becoming more downbeat about the prospects . They expect the consumer price index to rise only 0.6 per cent in 2024 , while the producer price index is forecast to drop 1 per cent, both weakening from the estimates in May. This reflects consumers’ reluctance to spend amid concerns about their job security, income prospects and falling property values. “Strains in the job market are still weighing on consumer spending,” said Ms Erica Tay, an economist at Maybank Investment Banking Group. “Even as the advanced manufacturing sectors are winning global market share, their gains can only go so far in offsetting the drag on GDP growth from sluggish consumption.” Economists pushed back their expectations for a cut to the reserve requirement ratio – the amount of cash banks must set aside in reserve – to the third quarter from the second quarter. The People’s Bank of China held off on easing in recent months to protect the yuan and as market liquidity was ample. They also projected a slower growth of money supply in 2024, compared to May, as the central bank signalled a shift in focus to the efficiency of funds rather than pure expansion. Economists maintained their projections for policy interest rates and the loan prime rate to be cut in the third quarter.

    "article_text": "Money The Wealthiest 10% Owns 71% Of US Household Money Market Funds By Ivan Illan , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Finance Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 25, 2024, 08:00am EDT Share Save Ivan Illan is Chief Investment Officer at AWAIM® and bestselling author of Success as a Financial Advisor For Dummies. getty You’ve probably heard that the level of assets in U.S. money market funds has breached an extraordinary threshold. As of Q4 2023, total money market fund assets totaled more than $6.357 trillion . For some perspective, in Q4 2018, it was $3.289 trillion—a 93% increase in just five years. In financial media, I keep reading about how special this $6 trillion-plus cash cushion is for the future prospects of the U.S. economy and its consumer-based economy. However, on closer inspection, any confidence one might have for this colossal heap of money market funds quickly abates. Even though some simple math reveals that the household sector represents 60% of all money market fund shares , it’s unfortunately highly concentrated within the top 10% of households (based on wealth percentiles). And the wealthiest (relatively) few Americans are unlikely to prop up aggregate consumer spending forever when downside volatility hits capital markets and real estate values. Based on data reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the top 1% (representing 99th to 100th wealth percentiles) holds more than $1.2 trillion in money market fund shares. This translates to a 32.4% share of the entire household sector. Compare this to the bottom 50% (representing 1st to 50th wealth percentiles), where only $36 billion of money market fund shares are held. That’s a mere 3% of the level that the top 1% holds. To appreciate the scale of this economic dispersion, the bottom 50% represents more than 66 million households compared to just over 1.185 million in the 99th to 99.9th percentile and 133,364 households in the top 0.1% . Between the 50th to 90th wealth percentiles, the count was close to 53 million households , which hold only $839 billion in money market funds (or 22% of all household money market fund shares). There are 11.9 million households in the 90th to 99th wealth percentiles. They hold $1.479 trillion in money market funds (or 39% of all household money market funds). It’s not difficult to deduce that with only a relatively small minority percentage of households having the liquid funds available to support their consumption should economic conditions deteriorate, overall aggregate demand is likely to continue to wane as high prices persist and real disposable incomes flatline across wealth percentiles. For financial professionals particularly, understanding this landscape is crucial in navigating whatever may come next for the U.S. economy. Consumers outside of the top 10% wealthiest are much more likely to implement spending cuts as their resources become more limited. This may impact the consumption of goods and services across industries, placing more pressure on profit margins as top-line revenue stagnates. Additionally, bottom-line net income may also feel the pressure as interest expense remains high. For businesses holding cash reserves at banks, be aware of FDIC insurance limits. Don’t presume that the depositor bailouts seen last year will become routine, as federal resources are limited in this area and moreover perpetuate a moral hazard already observed by those that have stayed within the stated limits of FDIC protection. A prudent next step would be to review your company’s corporate treasury operations to ensure you don’t have unknown risks in this area. There are a few ways to mitigate such risks in the marketplace through specialized service offerings, particularly from nonbank financial services firms.

The company acquired rival Mexican chain Chilango last year (Tortilla/PA) Anna Wise 25 June 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Burrito chain Tortilla has bought its biggest European competitor in a deal worth nearly £4 million, as it hopes to attract new consumers on the go, ahead of the Paris Olympics. Tortilla is buying 13 restaurants from rival Fresh Burritos, in prime locations in Paris and other cities in France . The acquisition also includes a network of 19 franchised locations and the rights to the brand. The London-based company, which has 89 stores, predominantly in the UK, said the purchase will give it a “launchpad” to expand further into Europe. “Tortilla’s international ambitions are no secret, and acquiring Fresh Burritos is our gateway to mainland Europe. “With Mexican cuisine surging in popularity, these prime French locations give us a solid launchpad.” He said the purchase comes “just in time for the Paris Olympics”, with businesses hoping to cash in on the millions of expected visitors to the French capital to watch the games. The 3.95 million euro (£3.3 million) acquisition has been funded through a combination of cash payment and existing debt facilities, Tortilla said. It is forecast to take a £500,000 hit to adjusted earnings this year, but will start to generate a profit for the business, estimated at £500,000 next year then about £2.5 million per year. Fresh Burritos was operating at a loss last year, reporting an annual loss before tax of 100,000 euros (£84,500) on revenues of nine million euros (£7.6 million). Tortilla has previously said that despite consumer spending on eating out still under pressure from the higher cost of living, it has seen long-term interest in Mexican-inspired burritos that are quick and affordable. It said its locations in busy city-centre locations, shopping centres and travel hubs were doing especially well, but it had found trading in quieter locations in regional towns and cities more challenging.

    "article_text": "Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu The risk of an economic slowdown now outweighs the risk of inflation, according to Morgan Stanley. At the midpoint of the year, stocks are near all-time highs, buoyed mostly by a handful of megacap technology stocks tied to the artificial intelligence trade. The S & P 500 has surged nearly 15% this year, having notched more than 30 record closes along the way. But Morgan Stanley worries that the poor breadth of the market , measuring the number of advancing stocks against those declining, is a sign that slowing economic growth is becoming a bigger risk than stubbornly high inflation. As evidence, the Wall Street investment bank is citing downside surprises in recent macroeconomic data. \"With macro data broadly coming in softer YTD, many lower quality and economically sensitive areas of the market have lagged, while a narrow list of higher quality mega caps have carried performance,\" wrote Mike Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. \"In our view, this is a sign the market is becoming more focused on growth softening and less focused on inflation and [interest] rates,\" Wilson said. While the relatively tech-heavy S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have surged nearly 15% and 17% this year, respectively, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is far less exposed to the AI theme, is up close to 5%. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 has also lagged. The small-cap index has gained just 0.5% in 2024. \"This backdrop syncs with our long-standing view that the current policy mix of heavy fiscal and higher front end rates is effectively crowding out many economic participants,\" Wilson wrote. To be sure, the Morgan Stanley strategist does not expect weak breadth to herald weak returns. But he does expect any market broadening will for now be restricted to high-quality, large-cap and defensive stocks, especially in the event of a slowdown that he expects is the most likely future scenario. \"A growth scare that is substantial enough to turn bad economic data into bad news for equity [price-to-earnings] multiples across the board,\" Wilson said. \"We think this is the most likely risk, and our conversations with clients echo this view.\" Here are some of the quality large-cap and defensive stocks with strong upward earnings revisions that can outperform, according to Morgan Stanley. These stocks are in the top 1,000 stocks by market cap and score in the top one-third of composite, high-quality composites readings. Burlington shares are higher by 25% this year, and the stock is overweight-rated by Morgan Stanley. On Monday, a Bernstein note said off-price retailers like Burlington will continue to outperform the retail sector. \"We expect BURL to steadily improve margins and ROIC on new stores, as well as margins in the existing business from better buying and supply chain processes — we model ROIC reaching 10% by 2026,\" the firm's Aneesha Sherman wrote. Monster Beverage emerged on Morgan Stanley's list. The overweight-rated stock is down by more than 14% this year. A Jefferies note this month called Monster Beverage one of the firm's top picks in a bifurcated consumer economy, saying the brand has the \"least exposure to trade-down & private label.\" Nvidia and HubSpot also surfaced on Morgan Stanley's screen.

In an interview with BT, he says that middle-class and rich households will drive nearly $2.9 trillion of incremental consumption spend by 2030. He, however, cautions that the lowest 20% of the income pyramid still faces challenges in returning to pre-pandemic financial status. Edited excerpts: Advertisement Q. There seems to be a consumption conundrum in the spending patterns of Indians. While high-end products see robust sales, the demand for more affordable goods remains muted. What are the reasons for this? The Indian economy is witnessing a significant shift towards premiumisation, driven primarily by the large middle class and affluent consumers who prefer high-end products like luxury cars, upscale houses, leisure holiday trips, apparel, and personal care. This growth in premium consumption is not confined to metropolitan elites, the aspirational households in boom towns, niche cities, and developed rural areas are also contributing significantly to this trend. Influenced by global trends and digital media, these consumers are demanding premium offerings, highlighting the need for innovation and quality in products and services. Advertisement The pandemic has significantly impacted the bottom 60% of India’s income pyramid, leading to depleted savings and increased debt as individuals struggled with the economic fallout. Despite some recovery in this segment post-Covid, the lowest 20% still faces challenges in returning to the pre-pandemic financial status. This group, primarily consumers of low-end products such as affordable two-wheelers and basic FMCG items, has shifted its focus towards essential spending, emergency savings, and debt repayment. The situation is exacerbated by high inflation and limited job opportunities, preventing many from regaining their financial stability. This shift towards necessary expenditures and the emphasis on saving has curtailed discretionary spending, significantly affecting broader consumer market dynamics. Q. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey results also showed a move towards premiumisation. Could you give your take on this please? Advertisement Indeed, it reflects how household spending priorities are evolving, particularly post-Covid, as there is a clear trend towards investing in lifestyle, well-being, and aspirational products over basic necessities. This shift towards quality and premium spending is indicative of a broader desire among consumers to enhance their quality of life and opt for products that not only provide convenience but also offer significant health benefits. The increased expenditure on health-related products and consumer durables further highlights this structural shift in the consumption patterns across households. Q. Could you share some data on how the household consumption pattern has changed? India has been evolving as one of the world’s most dynamic consumption environments and is expected to maintain steady economic growth. Indian consumers in 2030 will be richer and as young and as diverse as they are today. At the same time, innovation and technological development will elevate consumption models to the next level. Rising incomes and the expansion of the middle-class and high-income segments will reshape future consumption. Middle-class and rich households will drive nearly $2.9 trillion of incremental consumption spend by 2030, nearly all of the incremental spending will be led by consumers upgrading to premium offerings or adding new categories of consumption. Advertisement Specific categories will drive significant growth in spending. Households moving up an income level will spend two to three-and-a-half times more on essential categories such as food, housing, transport and communication and also on apparel and personal care. They will also spend four to six times more on well-being, entertainment and household services. Those entering the upper middle class will drive an increase of 15–30% in penetration of consumer durables. Affordable, mid-priced products and services will drive aggregate growth. By 2030, 53% of incremental spending will be led by middle-class consumers. Nearly half of the total incremental spend ($1.5 trillion) will be on “more of the same” products and services. Price points similar to those today will continue to be important. Premiumisation and new category adoption will primarily be led by middle-class and rich consumers. The remaining $1.6 trillion incremental spend will be led by consumers upgrading to packaged, branded or higher-priced offerings, or adding new products or services to their consumption routine. Consumers will especially upgrade or expand their choices in apparel, personal care and food and beverages. India’s income growth will drive a huge opportunity for packaged, branded offerings. Q. FMCG companies expect a good monsoon to help revive rural demand. What are your thoughts on this? Advertisement The expectation is grounded in several factors. A successful monsoon typically results in increased agricultural income and economic stimulus in rural areas, driving higher purchasing power and demand for essential FMCG products. With ongoing investments in distribution networks, FMCG companies are well-positioned to capitalise on this increased demand. However, potential challenges such as inflation, shifting consumer preferences, and pandemic-related disruptions could impact the extent of this revival, necessitating adaptability and responsiveness from FMCG companies to fully leverage the opportunities presented by favourable agricultural conditions.

    "article_text": "Rising cost of living leaving many Canberra small businesses in a precarious position By Ali El Zein M By Monte Bovill Topic: Small Businesses Thu 20 Jun 2024 Thursday 20 June 2024 Thu 20 Jun 2024 at 8:34pm Canberra cafe owner Sunil Bandi says the rising cost of living is taking its toll. ( ABC News: Mark Moore ) Sunil Bandi's motto is: when his customers are happy, he's happy. He's been serving up Indonesian cuisine and coffee at his north Canberra cafe for four years, but the rising cost of living is taking a toll. \"I am just struggling because costs are going very high,\" he said. Mr Bandi said raw materials are getting harder and harder to buy, some having doubled in price. Sunil Bandi says he's had to reduce both his staff and trading hours as the cost of materials rises. ( ABC News: Mark Moore ) In the past year, he's seen a significant drop in the number of people coming into his cafe, and those who do are spending less. \"The cost of what I'm spending, so what I have to charge for the customers, they are not ready for it. You know why? Because they're struggling too,\" Mr Bandi said. \"I'm reducing staff … and I even changed our trading hours.\" It's a sentiment shared in other parts of the city, with increasing operational costs combined with customers spending less putting many small businesses in a precarious position. Customers 'coming in with a budget' Homeware and gift shop owner Thea Bollington says this has been the store's hardest year ever. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) It's not just the hospitality industry that's feeling the pinch. Thea Bollington opened her homeware and gift shop in Aranda eight years ago, but has never felt so much pressure as right now. \"I reckon this is probably our hardest year yet, even with COVID,\" she said. \"We have seen a drop in customers over the last 12 to 18 months.\" Ms Bollington said she's had to adapt to changing customer habits like spending less. \"We are having to find a little bit more variety in products with different price points,\" she said \"Customers are really coming in with a budget and they are really thinking about what they are spending. Thea Bollington says if Canberrans want to have local businesses they must support them where possible. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) \"There's no longer consistency in when people come in. \"[In the past] we could really guarantee weekends would always be busy, and more of a flow during the week. \"These days you can't pick it, from week to week it is really different.\" Ms Bollington said it was worrying to see businesses struggling across the board. \"We have had a lot of makers in the last 12 months that have closed and it's scary,\" she said. \"If you can support small businesses, do it where you can. \"If you want them to be here and stay in your local area, spend when you can.\" 'We have had to pass on quite a few costs' Coffee roaster Al Evans says cafes are buying less beans directly. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Al Evans and Paul Reed made the decision in 2014 to sell their cafe to become coffee bean roasters and suppliers. Mr Evans said the number of beans they sell direct to cafes was down, while sales through supermarkets and online were increasing. \"Cafes are suffering a lot — rents are high, wages are high, and everyone is drinking coffee from home,\" he said. \"They might have their first coffee at home and maybe only have one out, where as before they would have like three coffees [out]. \"A lot of people are staying home, they are working from home, so that is where we have seen an increase in online sales.\" Al Evans says the cost of coffee beans has risen significantly. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Mr Evans said bean costs have also increased \"massively\". \"We have had to pass on quite a few costs,\" he said. \"We tried to hold tight for about a year-and-a-half, but then everything became too much. \"There's not much you can do about it. If your base product is going up, you can only take so much.\" Their business had between 40 and 50 staff when it was first established, but that has reduced to about 10. Paul Reed says the number of home machines he's repaired has risen as more people opt to make coffee at home. ( ABC News: Nick Haggarty ) Coffee machine repairer Paul Reed, who services Canberra and parts of regional New South Wales, said it's clear more people are opting to go without a cafe-made coffee. He's been repairing machines for 16 years, and said he's been doing an increasing amount of home repairs. \"I got a lot of phone calls about people wanting them repaired or serviced because they're using them a lot more,\" he said. He said cafes he services have been particularly quiet in the \"last year or two\". Biggest challenge are high interest rates Canberra Business Chamber CEO Greg Harford says the biggest challenge for small businesses is high interest rates. ( ABC News: Matt Roberts ) Canberra Business Chamber CEO Greg Harford said business sentiment was currently \"pretty gloomy\". \"There's a couple of reasons behind that. First, it's costing people more to run their businesses. Second, customers aren't out spending,\" he said. \"Businesses are looking very hard at their costs and obviously looking at what they can do to get customers to get back in the door.\" Mr Harford said stubbornly high interest rates were the biggest challenge facing small businesses. \"What we really need to see is the Reserve Bank start to bring interest rates down to inject a bit of confidence back into the consumer economy and to take the edge off the cost of doing business,\" he said. \"Customers just don't have as much money in their pockets to get out and spend as much as they normally would be.\" Mr Harford said nearly two thirds of businesses had told the Business Chamber that they did not hit their sales targets for the last quarter, while he said only 29 per cent felt confident about the future."

Despite this, April-May real retail sales were down 1.2 per cent annualised from Q1, indicating weak consumer spending in Q2. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2024. The US’ nominal retail sales saw a slight increase of 0.1 per cent in May, following a 0.2 per cent decline in April, according to The Conference Board (TCB). Real retail sales, adjusted for inflation, also rose by 0.1 per cent in May after a significant 0.5 per cent decline in April. Despite this modest uptick, real retail sales over the April-May period were down 1.2 per cent annualised from the first quarter (Q1), indicating continued weakness in consumer spending, particularly on goods, in Q2. US nominal retail sales rose by 0.1 per cent in May after a 0.2 per cent decline in April, while real retail sales, adjusted for inflation, also increased by 0.1 per cent. Despite this, April-May real retail sales were down 1.2 per cent annualised from Q1, indicating weak consumer spending in Q2. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2024. Retail control, which excludes volatile sectors such as gasoline, motor vehicles, building material store sales, and food and drinking places, rose by 0.4 per cent in May after a 0.5 per cent decline in the previous month. Sales increased in clothing, sporting goods, general merchandise, non-store retailers, and miscellaneous stores. The May retail sales data support expectations that real GDP growth continued to slow in Q2 2024, following a modest 1.3 per cent annualised rise in Q1 2024. The Federal Reserve is likely to view these figures as indicative of the economy cooling down, a necessary step to bring inflation back to its 2-per cent target, as per TCB. Economic indicators suggest that two interest rate cuts are anticipated towards the end of 2024, likely during the November and December meetings. Despite the slight rise in real sales in May, the annualised decline of 1.2 per cent from Q1 highlights a reduction in consumer demand. This trend reflects a broader shift away from spending on goods, driven by slower real wage growth, depleted excess savings, and rising credit card debt. High interest rates, elevated prices, and increasing insurance premiums, particularly for autos, are further dampening goods purchases. Weaker consumer spending aligns with the Fed’s strategy to cool economic activity and curb inflation without triggering a recession. Projections suggest that Q2 and Q3 real GDP growth will be anaemic, ranging between 0 per cent and 1 per cent quarter-over-quarter annualised. However, a recession remains unlikely as businesses are generally retaining their top talent. Given the backdrop of slower real GDP growth and inflation, coupled with a relatively healthy labour market, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates twice this year. The cuts are anticipated at the November and December meetings. Although only a slight majority of FOMC participants supported one cut at the June meeting, most are anticipating two cuts by the end of the year.

    "article_text": "Germany's Ifo institute slightly raises 2024 GDP forecast Published on 06/20/2024 at 04:30 am EDT Reuters Share BERLIN, June 20 (Reuters) - Germany's Ifo institute slightly raised its 2024 forecast for economic growth in Europe's top economy on Thursday, citing stronger consumer purchasing power and recovery in global trade in goods and industrial production in the second half. Ifo raised its growth forecast to 0.4%, from 0.2% in March, which roughly is in line with the German government's spring projection of 0.3% growth. \"New hope is now emerging,\" said Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser. \"The German economy is slowly working its way out of the crisis. The second half of 2024 should be significantly better than the first.\" The German economy, which was the weakest performer among big euro zone countries last year, is expected to gain some momentum in its recovery over the course of this year, with inflation expected to fall and nominal wages forecast to rise. \"As the year progresses, the purchasing power of private households should continue to gain strength and the overall economic recovery should pick up speed as the consumer economy normalizes,\" said Wollmershaeuser. Global trade in goods and global industrial production should continue to recover, particularly from the second half, helped by a gradual upturn in investment as monetary policy in industrialized countries is set to ease, added Ifo. Ifo maintained its forecast for economic growth of 1.5% in 2025, while inflation is expected to fall to 2.2% this year from 5.9% last year, and drop to 1.7% next year.

    "article_text": "America's 'cardboard-box recession' is finally over, BofA says Filip De Mott June 19, 2024 2 min read The cardboard box recession is ending, as packaging prices climb, Bank of America says. This recession indicator flashed last year when demand for packaging fell to 2009 lows. Now, the industry expects 3% growth outlooks for the coming quarters. Packaging prices are poised for a rebound, spelling the end for America's cardboard box recession, Bank of America said. While industry data has been negative since the second half of 2022, new surveys from the bank reveal a surging growth outlook for the quarters ahead. That's good news for the broader economy, as it puts to rest at least one recessionary indicator. When last year's demand for cardboard packaging dropped to 2009 lows , analysts feared it meant a major consumer spending pullback. Charles Schwab declared a \"cardboard-box recession \" last June, warning that it would impact everything from labor markets to equities. Since then, both the economy and markets have broadly surprised to the upside. Until recent months , consumer spending has been resilient , which has helped keep stocks pushing on to record highs. Now, things are also looking up for the packaging industry. \"Out of the independent box makers that we survey, we went from a 0.6% growth outlook to over 3%, which, in my world, that's significant,\" research analyst George Staphos told Yahoo Finance . \"Additionally, what we're hearing from the respondents is an overwhelming sense that prices would continue to move higher.\" Bank of America Global Research While he acknowledged that a good part of the uptick comes from inflation, BofA's survey shows that demand expectations are also playing a role. Over the next six to twelve months, 62% respondents see demand either \"better\" or \"much better,\" the note said. That's compared to 39% who thought this in April.

    "article_text": "With moderation in inflation India will see higher consumer spending: Fitch Ratings ANI | Updated: Jun 19, 2024 15:48 IST ANI News Join our Whatsapp channel New Delhi[India], June 19 (ANI): Putting an end to the debate on India's growth based on the government's capex push, global rating agency Fitch Ratings said that consumer spending will increase with elevated consumer confidence, a sign of enhanced income for people. The credit rating agency in its June report of Global Economic Outlook (GEO) said that India will see higher Consumer spending with elevated consumer confidence. Expectations of better than expected monsoon will support growth and make inflation less volatile. The rating agency has elevated India's growth forecast by 20 basis point to 7.2 per cent for fiscal year 2024-25. Earlier in March Fitch has forecasted India's growth at 7 per cent. Backing its anticipation for consumer spending in coming quarters, the rating agency said, that average rainfall during June-September is likely to limit the inflationary risks from a food price spike, incentivising spending. According to official forecasts in the country, the rainfall during June-September is likely to be above average. The report forecasts headline inflation declines to 4.5 per cent by calendar year-end, and average inflation rests at 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026, staying slightly above the midpoint of RBI's target of 4 per cent with a variation of 2 per cent. Headline inflation is a measure of the total inflation within an economy, including the prices of commodities like food and energy. India's retail inflation rate softened marginally in May to 4.75 per cent, continuing its moderation trend, though food prices continue to remain a pain point. In May, the annual retail inflation stood at a 12-month low of 4.75 per cent, marginally down from 4.83 per cent in April. Core inflation shows a trend in the cost of goods and services, excluding food and energy has also fallen to 3.0 per cent in May but the country faced high food price inflation of an average of 7.8 per cent in the first five months of 2024. In the final quarter of the financial year ending March 2024, real GDP increased by 7.8 per cent year on year. The real GDP of India grew at 8.2 per cent in FY2023-24. (ANI)"

Related Income tax relief for those in lowest slab may need to be considered in Budget: CII CII pitches for marginal tax relief for individuals, higher wages under MNREGA in Budget India’s industry lobby groups have asked officials of the Finance Ministry consider personal tax benefits for the country’s middle-class and a simplification in direct tax regime in the upcoming Union Budget announcement. In a meeting with Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, CII President Sanjiv Puri advocated for marginal tax relief for incomes up to Rs 20 lakh and called for reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel. He noted that while Brent crude prices have dropped by 40 per cent, pump prices in Delhi have only fallen by Rs 1.8 per litre. Certain sectors in India have been impacted due to skewed consumer spending, as highlighted in the country’s latest GDP readings. This gulf between India's enviable GDP growth rate figures and the slowing consumer demand seem to be a spot of bother for certain businesses. Sops aimed at reducing tax burden are likely to have a positive impact on consumer spending in the country.

He argued that these measures would boost disposable income and stimulate consumer spending. \"The middle class is currently taxed at a rate of 30%, leaving them with little disposable income for savings and other needs. We suggested that the 30% tax slab should apply only to incomes above Rs 40 lakh,\" news agency ANI quoted Mukul Bagla, chair of the direct taxes committee at PHDCCI as saying. FICCI has proposed simplifying the capital gains tax system by streamlining it into two or three broad categories based on asset types, holding periods for long-term status, and eligibility for indexation benefits. They suggest categorizing assets into three groups: equity instruments, debt, and other assets, with specific rates set for both long-term and short-term gains. FICCI also recommends uniform tax rates for residents and non-residents, eliminating the current distinctions. \"Our suggestions have focused on maintaining the growth momentum, while seeking simplification for ease of doing business and reducing litigation. Where litigation has started, the idea should be to find a workable solution for everyone,\" said Subhrakant Panda, the chamber's immediate past president.

For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively.( DC File Photo) Mumbai: Global rating agency Fitch Ratings upped India’s growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.2 per cent, up from 7 per cent projected in March due to a recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. The rating agency’s growth and inflation forecast are in line with the central bank’s estimates. For the fiscal years 2025-26 and 2026-27, Fitch projected growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively. In its global economic outlook report, Fitch said, “We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2 per cent in FY24/25, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage points from the March Global Economic Outlook (GEO).” It noted that high frequency indicators of domestic activity were showing resilience. The South-West monsoon is expected to be above normal, which augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in manufacturing and services activity, this should enable a revival in private consumption. RBI earlier this month projected a 7.2 per cent growth for the current fiscal year, supported by improving rural demand and moderating inflation. In its latest biannual Global Economic Prospects it said India will remain the fastest-growing of the world’s largest economies, although its pace of expansion is expected to moderate. After a high growth rate in FY 2023/24, steady growth of 6.7 per cent per year, on average, is projected for the three fiscal years beginning in FY 2024/25. The rating agency said that the investment will continue to rise, albeit more slowly than in recent quarters. Consumer spending is expected to recover, supported by high consumer confidence. “We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,” Fitch added, indicating that growth will be driven by consumer spending and investment. An ‘above normal’ monsoon forecast for June-September is expected to mitigate risks of food price spikes. Fitch projects that headline inflation in India will decrease to 4.5 per cent by the end of 2024, averaging 4.3 per cent in 2025 and 2026.

The Census Bureau said Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.1% from the month prior, coming in slightly below economists’ expectations. Sales were 2% higher from a year ago. April’s figures were also revised lower to a slight decline of 0.2% from being flat compared to March. Sales at clothing and accessory stores rose 0.9%, while electronics and appliance stores saw a 0.4% gain. Online sales were up 0.8%. Gas station sales were down 2.2%, powered by a drop in prices at the pump. Consumer spending is an important metric to watch for economic health and growth, as it makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. Economists said Tuesday’s report showed consumers being more cautious in the face of inflation and tougher credit conditions. FILE - Shoppers consider appliances on display in a Costco warehouse March 6, 2024, in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The release comes after the latest consumer price index showed inflation falling for the second consecutive month, though progress in getting inflation back to 2% is going slower than the Federal Reserve would like. Fed officials said at their June meeting that they are only anticipating one cut to its benchmark interest rate this year as they would like to see more progress in cooling inflation before lowering rates. Higher rates help cool economic activity by moderating consumer spending, but the Fed is also trying to find the right balance of getting inflation back to 2% without the economy tipping into recession. “What we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a good level and with a strong labor market,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said after the June meeting. “Ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far they haven’t had to.” Consumer spending has remained resilient throughout most of the Fed’s inflation crackdown despite higher prices and interest rates but has gotten bumpier in 2024 as shoppers try to make their budgets stretch. A handful of major retail chains like Target and Walmart have rolled out discounts to entice shoppers to keep up the spending. “May’s retail sales give us a snapshot of a reasonably healthy consumer even though spending growth is fluctuating somewhat,” NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. “These numbers indicate that the economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, generally supporting consumers’ ability and willingness to spend. Inflation pressure has fallen, especially for retail goods, but higher prices for services continue to weigh on the minds of households.” Some economists have predicted consumer spending would slow some this year as the labor market — while still strong by historical standards — cools from the highs observed over the last two years. A report earlier this month showed businesses added 272,000 jobs in May, a significant increase from April that helps boost wages and give shoppers confidence to keep spending.

Huh) “Looking ahead, positive labor market gains should continue to carry the consumer forward and prevent a spending retrenchment. But we continue to expect softer consumer spending trends as cost fatigue and cooling labor market conditions curb income growth and lead households to exercise more spending restraint,” EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said. Consumer sentiment has been down in the first half of the year as Americans are expecting higher prices to linger and are frustrated with inflation, a key issue in the looming November election. A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index released on Friday showed attitudes were continuing to sour, dropping to 65.6 in June from 69.1 in May. “Assessments of personal finances dipped, due to modestly rising concerns over high prices as well as weakening incomes. Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May,” survey director Joanne Hsu wrote in the preliminary release. Americans have had a negative outlook on the economy for months, often holding contradicting views with positive interpretations of their own finances while also saying the U.S. economy is struggling as a whole. Many of the beliefs consumers hold about the economy are in direct contrast with the data federal agencies are releasing every month, which have shown continued growth, low unemployment and moderating inflation. A poll from last month found more than half of Americans believe the economy is in recession and shrinking, nearly 50% believe unemployment is at a 50-year high and that the S&P index is down for the year, all of which are opposite from the data.

Inflation pressure has fallen, especially for retail goods, but higher prices for services continue to weigh on the minds of households.” Some economists have predicted consumer spending would slow some this year as the labor market — while still strong by historical standards — cools from the highs observed over the last two years. A report earlier this month showed businesses added 272,000 jobs in May, a significant increase from April that helps boost wages and give shoppers confidence to keep spending.

Huh) “Looking ahead, positive labor market gains should continue to carry the consumer forward and prevent a spending retrenchment. But we continue to expect softer consumer spending trends as cost fatigue and cooling labor market conditions curb income growth and lead households to exercise more spending restraint,” EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said. Consumer sentiment has been down in the first half of the year as Americans are expecting higher prices to linger and are frustrated with inflation, a key issue in the looming November election. A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index released on Friday showed attitudes were continuing to sour, dropping to 65.6 in June from 69.1 in May. “Assessments of personal finances dipped, due to modestly rising concerns over high prices as well as weakening incomes. Overall, consumers perceive few changes in the economy from May,” survey director Joanne Hsu wrote in the preliminary release. Americans have had a negative outlook on the economy for months, often holding contradicting views with positive interpretations of their own finances while also saying the U.S. economy is struggling as a whole. Many of the beliefs consumers hold about the economy are in direct contrast with the data federal agencies are releasing every month, which have shown continued growth, low unemployment and moderating inflation. A poll from last month found more than half of Americans believe the economy is in recession and shrinking, nearly 50% believe unemployment is at a 50-year high and that the S&P index is down for the year, all of which are opposite from the data.

The Census Bureau said Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.1% from the month prior, coming in slightly below economists’ expectations. Sales were 2% higher from a year ago. April’s figures were also revised lower to a slight decline of 0.2% from being flat compared to March. Sales at clothing and accessory stores rose 0.9%, while electronics and appliance stores saw a 0.4% gain. Online sales were up 0.8%. Gas station sales were down 2.2%, powered by a drop in prices at the pump. Consumer spending is an important metric to watch for economic health and growth, as it makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. Economists said Tuesday’s report showed consumers being more cautious in the face of inflation and tougher credit conditions. FILE - Shoppers consider appliances on display in a Costco warehouse March 6, 2024, in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) The release comes after the latest consumer price index showed inflation falling for the second consecutive month, though progress in getting inflation back to 2% is going slower than the Federal Reserve would like. Fed officials said at their June meeting that they are only anticipating one cut to its benchmark interest rate this year as they would like to see more progress in cooling inflation before lowering rates. Higher rates help cool economic activity by moderating consumer spending, but the Fed is also trying to find the right balance of getting inflation back to 2% without the economy tipping into recession. “What we’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at a good level and with a strong labor market,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said after the June meeting. “Ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far they haven’t had to.” Consumer spending has remained resilient throughout most of the Fed’s inflation crackdown despite higher prices and interest rates but has gotten bumpier in 2024 as shoppers try to make their budgets stretch.

    "article_text": "Updated / Tuesday, 18 Jun 2024 14:09 The pace of spending is likely sufficient to sustain the economic expansion. US retail sales increased less than expected in May as lower prices for gasoline weighed on receipts at service stations. Retail sales rose 0.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.2% drop in April, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Retail sales were previously reported to have been unchanged in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, gaining 0.3% in May. Retail sales have in recent months been distorted by an early Easter. Nonetheless, the trend in sales growth has been slowing as higher prices and interest rates force households to prioritize essentials and cut back on discretionary spending. Banks are also tightening access to credit as lower income borrowers increasingly struggle to keep up with their loan payments. Though the labor market remains on a solid footing, it is becoming a bit difficult for people who lose their jobs to quickly find new work and wage increases are moderating. Savings have also been whittled down. Still, the pace of spending is likely sufficient to sustain the economic expansion. The Federal Reserve last week kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since last July. US central bank officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year. They, however, maintained their gross domestic product growth estimates. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.5% drop in April. These so-called core retail sales were previously reported to have declined 0.3% in April. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. Consumer spending increased at a 2.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, helping to restrain the economy to a 1.3% growth pace. Growth estimates for the second quarter are as high as a 3.1% rate.

Fitch raises India’s GDP forecast marginally to 7.2% in FY25 Investment expected to rise, but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending would recover, the rating agency said By Shishir Sinha Updated - June 18, 2024 at 02:05 PM. | New Delhi, June 18 × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/fitch-raises-indias-gdp-forecast-marginally-to-72-in-fy25/article68303109.ece Copy Taking a cue from a rise in consumer spending, Fitch Ratings has upped India’s growth forecast, measured in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Products) to 7.2 per cent during fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25), from the earlier print of 7 per cent. The economy grew by 8.2 per cent during FY24 . “Investment will continue to rise, but more slowly than in recent quarters, while consumer spending will recover with elevated consumer confidence. Purchasing managers’ survey data points to continued growth at the start of the current financial year,” the agency said in its annual publication ‘Global Economic Outlook.’ The publication has raised its forecast for world growth in 2024 to 2.6 per cent from the previous forecast of 2.4 per cent. Fitch’s forecast is on a par with RBI’s latest estimate. Earlier this month the central bank, too, had revised upwards the forecast by 20bps to 7.2 per cent. It noted that high frequency indicators of domestic activity were showing resilience. The South-West monsoon is expected to be above normal, which augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in manufacturing and services activity, this should enable a revival in private consumption. However, Fitch’s revision is higher than that of the IMF and ADB . In April, the IMF revised its projection to 7 per cent from 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal. In the same month, ADB revised its projection to 7 per cent from 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal. S&P has projected a growth rate of 6.8 per cent Also read: Fitch affirms India’s rating at ‘BBB-’ Meanwhile, Fitch said signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heat-wave poses a risk. It expects growth in later years to slow and approach its medium-term trend estimate. “We forecast real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in FY25/26 (unchanged from March), and 6.2% in FY26/27, driven by consumer spending and investment,” it said. Further, it noted that at its latest meeting, the RBI maintained the policy rate at 6.5 per cent and confirmed its hawkish stance of “withdrawal of monetary accommodation” and the need to bring down inflation towards target. “We still expect the RBI to cut its policy rate this year, but only once, to 6.25 per cent. In the March GEO, we expected 50bps of cuts this year. We then expect 25bps of cuts in both 2025 and 2026,” it said. As confidence in European recovery prospects improve, the world growth forecast has been revised upward. China’s export sector revives and domestic demand in emerging markets, excluding China (EM excl. China), shows stronger momentum. The US is slowing, but only gradually and our 2024 growth forecast is unchanged at 2.1 per cent. ”The expected pivot to global monetary policy easing is now taking shape, with the ECB recently cutting rates and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BoE) both expected to follow suit in 3Q24. But inflation is surprisingly persistent and we now expect global rates to decline at a shallower pace over the next 12-18 months,” Fitch said.

The ratings agency has also raised its world growth forecast for 2024 to 2.6% from 2.4% earlier as confidence in European recovery prospects improve, China's export sector revives and domestic demand in emerging markets excluding China shows stronger momentum. \"We still expect the RBI to cut its policy rate this year, but only once, to 6.25%.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Desk Updated Jun 18, 2024 10:17 AM IST Fitch revises India's growth projection to 7.2% (PC: Reuters) Fitch Ratings raised India’s growth forecast on Tuesday, citing recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. The agency has increased India’s growth forecast from 7 per cent projected in March to 7.2 per cent. It has projected a growth rate of 6.5 for fiscal year 2025-26 and 6.2 per cent for 2026-27. Advertisement Related Articles India's GDP to grow at 8% in 2024, says CII Prez Sanjiv Puri RBI MPC announcements: GDP growth for 2024-25 projected to be 7.2%, says Gov Shaktikanta Das In its global economic outlook report, Fitch said, \"We expect the Indian economy to expand by a strong 7.2 per cent in FY24/25 (an upward revision of 0.2 pp from the March GEO).” It predicted investment to continue to rise but more slowly than in recent quarters. Consumer spending, it said, will recover with elevated consumer confidence. Purchasing managers survey data point to continued growth at the start of the current financial year, it said. The coming monsoon season being normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, it added. Fitch, however, voiced concerns about the recent heatwave that could pose a risk. It also expects RBI to cut policy interest rates by 25 basis points this year to 6.25 per cent. Advertisement \"We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,\" it said, adding that consumer spending and investment would drive growth. Fitch’s projection is in line with the Reserve Bank of India's estimated GDP growth for 2024-25 at 7.2 per cent. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das projected real GDP for 2024-25 Q1 at 7.3 per cent, Q2 at 7.2 per cent, Q3 at 7.3 per cent, and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. The Indian economy grew at 8.2 per cent in the last fiscal 2023-24, with an expansion of 7.8 per cent in March quarter. Fitch also raised its forecast for world growth in 2024 to 2.6 per cent from 2.4 per cent, as mentioned in the March 2024 Global Economic Outlook. China’s growth outlook has also been raised to 4.8 per cent from 4.5 per cent. Advertisement “However, for 2025, we forecast world growth to edge down to 2.4 per cent as US growth slows to a below-trend rate of 1.5 per cent and growth in the eurozone picks up to 1.5 per cent. We also expect growth in China to fall to 4.5 per cent next year as exports and government spending decelerate,” it said.

Updated - June 19, 2024 12:14 am IST - New Delhi The Hindu Bureau READ LATER SEE ALL Remove The latest Fitch Ratings has cited a recovery in consumer spending and increased investment. File photo | Photo Credit: The Hindu Fitch Ratings on Tuesday raised its GDP growth forecast for India to 7.2% for 2024-25 from 7% estimated earlier, citing higher consumer confidence despite an anticipated slowdown in new investments, but has pared its interest rate cut hopes from the Reserve Bank of India to just one round of 25 basis points (bps) from two such cuts anticipated earlier. One bp equals 0.01%. What is next for the Indian economy? | Explained Noting that India’s rapid growth , reflected in a faster-than-expected 8.2% uptick in 2023-24, is underpinned by a fast expansion in investment, Fitch added a caveat to say that the economy’s Gross Value-Added (GVA) at basic prices “is currently a better guide to underlying momentum and has been growing at just over 7%”. Fitch reckoned that fixed Investments will rise 7.2% this year , slowing from a 9% growth in 2023-24, before rebounding to a 7.8% uptick in 2025-26. GDP growth is expected to moderate to 6.5% next year and 6.2% in 2026-27, with consumer spending and investment remaining the key growth drivers. “Signs of the coming monsoon season being more normal should support growth and make inflation less volatile, though a recent heatwave poses a risk. We expect growth in later years to slow and approach our medium-term trend estimate,” it said. Stating that above average rainfall during June to September should limit the inflationary risks from food price spikes, the rating firm projected retail inflation to average 4.5% this year, in line with the RBI’s estimates, before dropping to 4.3% and 4.2% over the next two years. The dynamics of household consumption “At its latest meeting, the RBI maintained the policy rate at 6.5% and confirmed its hawkish stance of “withdrawal of monetary accommodation” and the need to bring down inflation towards target. We still expect the RBI to cut its policy rate this year, but only once, to 6.25%. We then expect 25bp of cuts in both 2025 and 2026,” the firm said. In March, it had penned in 50 basis points (bps) of rate cuts this year. In its updated Global Economic Outlook, the rating major has raised its global growth projections for this year to 2.6% from 2.4% estimated in March, noting that though growth is slowing from the 2.9% rise recorded in 2023, the deceleration is not as sharp as it previously expected. For 2025 and 2026, it expects the world economy to expand 2.4%, and stressed that these forecasts “paint a picture of a much more stable world economy in the middle of the decade compared to the volatility in 2020-2023”.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday, retail sales reached 3.92 trillion yuan ($540.42 billion) last month, up 3.7 percent year-on-year, compared with growth of 2.3 percent year-on-year in April. In the first five months of the year, retail sales grew by 4.1 percent to 19.52 trillion yuan, and online retail sales jumped by 12.4 percent to 5.77 trillion yuan, according to the NBS. \"The continuous recovery of the consumption sector so far this year underscores China's advantage of having an ultra-large market, and it is also a result of the continuous recovery of the economy's internal growth momentum and the release of consumer spending potential,\" NBS spokesperson Liu Aihua said at a press briefing on Monday. In May, sales of goods for upgraded spending posted fast growth. Among businesses above the designated size, retail sales of sports and recreational articles grew by 20.2 percent year-on-year, cosmetics rose by 18.7 percent, commercial telecommunications equipment grew by 16.6 percent, and home appliances and audio-video equipment jumped by 12.9 percent year-on-year, NBS data showed. Zhou Maohua, an economist at China Everbright Bank, told the Global Times on Monday that the accelerated recovery in consumption was underpinned by improving employment and income data, stronger consumer confidence, and increased willingness to spend due to low consumer prices amid a low interest rate environment. \"The holiday travel surge and a relatively low base from 2023 also contributed to the increase,\" Zhou said. About 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the five-day May Day holidays, up 7.6 percent year-on-year and a surge of 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019. It is important to actively expand domestic demand and implement the action plan for large-scale equipment renewals and trade-ins of consumer goods. It is also imperative to create more consumption scenarios to better meet people's needs for diversified and high-quality consumption, according to the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on April 30. The better-than-expected retail figure in May revealed the strength, resilience and potential of the world's second-largest economy, which will generate growth both this year and in the longer term, Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, told the Global Times on Monday. As the pace of consumption potential picks up speed, the role of consumer spending as a main driver of China's economic recovery will be further strengthened, Cao said, noting that the vitality of new types of consumption and services will in turn boost the development of new quality productive forces. The prolonged correction in the property market will constitute a drag on consumer spending, although the situation will gradually improve with the implementation of trade-in programs, more policies to support consumption and a further recovery in domestic demand, noted Zhou. A continued recovery in consumption will further repair expectations, stimulate internal circulation and contribute to the realization of the full-year growth target, said Zhou. Liu said that multiple positive factors will contribute to an accelerated recovery of the consumption sector. Recently, government agencies and provinces have implemented policies to expand domestic demand, especially specific measures to facilitate and encourage trade-ins of consumer goods, and this process will inject vitality into the market. In addition, new types of consumption are growing rapidly and market supply continues to improve, Liu stated.

(Dreamstime/TNS) By Tribune News Service | Tribune News Service PUBLISHED: June 15, 2024 at 9:24 AM EDT Andrea Felsted | (TNS) Bloomberg Opinion Revenge travel is losing its appeal. After three years of rushing to book trips in the wake of pandemic-era restrictions, sharply higher fares, protests against tourism, fatigue from endless hours spent in airports and incomes squeezed by inflation are all taking their toll on travelers. Travel demand is far from falling off a cliff. But there are signs that our wanderlust is downshifting from never-ending to a more normal pattern. For airlines and tour operators, the next few months will be crucial in filling remaining seats and hotel rooms. If demand is strong, they will be able to sell leftover capacity at higher prices. But if consumers hold off, they’ll be forced to discount, something that hasn’t happened in the past three years. In Europe, many people who were passionate about their vacations booked in January, in order to secure their preferred destination, hotel and even room. But in recent months, some consumers, particularly more budget-constrained families, have been holding off to see how their own finances, and holiday prices, developed. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, has sold about 60% of the vacations available this summer. That’s broadly in line with last year, but it’s still a lot of sunny breaks to shift in an uncertain environment. European travelers are also shopping around. At Thomas Cook, now reborn as an online tour operator, bookings to Spain’s Balearic and Canary Islands are flat year-over-year. This reflects cost — you can get more for your money in Turkey, mainland Spain and Egypt — where sales are up. But anti-tourism protests in the Canary and Balearic islands may also be playing a part. European consumers are still prepared to pay as much for their package holiday – well almost. TUI’s summer pricing is up 4%, close to the 5% increase reported a year earlier. But budget airlines Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc show that when it comes to air fares, consumers are reaching their limit. Michael O’Leary, chief executive officer of Ryanair, forecast that fares across its network this summer would be flat to 5% ahead, down from his previous prediction of a 5% to 10% increase, surprising given that capacity is constrained by delays to Boeing deliveries. Europe’s largest low-cost carrier has begun to cut ticket prices to fill its fleet. There are signs that the U.S. travel recovery, now in its third year, is maturing too. For example, Marriott International Inc. said U.S. leisure revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel performance, was flat in its first quarter. Airbnb Inc. forecast that revenue would expand by 8% to 10% in the second quarter, the lowest level for three years. It’s possible this is a blip — Easter was earlier this year — and Airbnb expects a bounce in the summer months. Indeed, the picture is complex. Some of the U.S. domestic weakness may reflect Americans traveling to Europe, emboldened by the strength of the dollar. This will likely have been boosted by one-offs, such as Taylor Swift’s concerts. And this isn’t the only factor that makes the travel temperature so difficult to take. After wildfires in Greece last year, climate concerns are at the forefront of consumers’ minds. Yet this is spurring some unusual behaviors, such as some European customers booking long-haul flights to destinations such as Mauritius, where summer temperatures are more predictable, and, after price increases at some traditional Mediterranean resorts, the cost differential has narrowed. As in other parts of the consumer economy, it may be that travel is polarizing, with the wealthy still splashing on trips further afield and top-notch accommodation, while those pressured by inflation and higher mortgage costs stick to a budget. After the West’s travel boom — and potentially a return to more pedestrian levels – the industry is now looking East, to the return of Chinese visitors, particularly to Europe. But for the coming weeks, short-term factors, such as elections in the U.K. and weather patterns – TUI said the winter season ended particularly strongly, likely boosted by cold and wet conditions – will matter most. Being unable to spread our wings during the pandemic has reinforced our love of getting away, and we may never return to a situation where we are prepared to stay home. That doesn’t mean we won’t alter our behavior, like skipping a week away in spring or autumn, or, for example, forgoing a city break to preserve our main vacation. There is much riding on this year’s peak summer season. Not only will it determine the level of profits at tour operators, hotels and airlines, but it will give the first glimpse of what a more settled post-pandemic travel market looks like. —— This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

As in other parts of the consumer economy, it may be that travel is polarizing, with the wealthy still splashing on trips further afield and top-notch accommodation, while those pressured by inflation and higher mortgage costs stick to a budget. After the West’s travel boom — and potentially a return to more pedestrian levels – the industry is now looking East, to the return of Chinese visitors, particularly to Europe. But for the coming weeks, short-term factors, such as elections in the U.K. and weather patterns – TUI said the winter season ended particularly strongly, likely boosted by cold and wet conditions – will matter most. Being unable to spread our wings during the pandemic has reinforced our love of getting away, and we may never return to a situation where we are prepared to stay home. That doesn’t mean we won’t alter our behavior, like skipping a week away in spring or autumn, or, for example, forgoing a city break to preserve our main vacation. There is much riding on this year’s peak summer season.

(Dreamstime/TNS) By Tribune News Service | Tribune News Service PUBLISHED: June 15, 2024 at 6:24 AM PDT Andrea Felsted | (TNS) Bloomberg Opinion Revenge travel is losing its appeal. After three years of rushing to book trips in the wake of pandemic-era restrictions, sharply higher fares, protests against tourism, fatigue from endless hours spent in airports and incomes squeezed by inflation are all taking their toll on travelers. Travel demand is far from falling off a cliff. But there are signs that our wanderlust is downshifting from never-ending to a more normal pattern. For airlines and tour operators, the next few months will be crucial in filling remaining seats and hotel rooms. If demand is strong, they will be able to sell leftover capacity at higher prices. But if consumers hold off, they’ll be forced to discount, something that hasn’t happened in the past three years. In Europe, many people who were passionate about their vacations booked in January, in order to secure their preferred destination, hotel and even room. But in recent months, some consumers, particularly more budget-constrained families, have been holding off to see how their own finances, and holiday prices, developed. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, has sold about 60% of the vacations available this summer. That’s broadly in line with last year, but it’s still a lot of sunny breaks to shift in an uncertain environment. European travelers are also shopping around. At Thomas Cook, now reborn as an online tour operator, bookings to Spain’s Balearic and Canary Islands are flat year-over-year. This reflects cost — you can get more for your money in Turkey, mainland Spain and Egypt — where sales are up. But anti-tourism protests in the Canary and Balearic islands may also be playing a part. European consumers are still prepared to pay as much for their package holiday – well almost. TUI’s summer pricing is up 4%, close to the 5% increase reported a year earlier. But budget airlines Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc show that when it comes to air fares, consumers are reaching their limit. Michael O’Leary, chief executive officer of Ryanair, forecast that fares across its network this summer would be flat to 5% ahead, down from his previous prediction of a 5% to 10% increase, surprising given that capacity is constrained by delays to Boeing deliveries. Europe’s largest low-cost carrier has begun to cut ticket prices to fill its fleet. There are signs that the U.S. travel recovery, now in its third year, is maturing too. For example, Marriott International Inc. said U.S. leisure revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel performance, was flat in its first quarter. Airbnb Inc. forecast that revenue would expand by 8% to 10% in the second quarter, the lowest level for three years. It’s possible this is a blip — Easter was earlier this year — and Airbnb expects a bounce in the summer months. Indeed, the picture is complex. Some of the U.S. domestic weakness may reflect Americans traveling to Europe, emboldened by the strength of the dollar. This will likely have been boosted by one-offs, such as Taylor Swift’s concerts. And this isn’t the only factor that makes the travel temperature so difficult to take.

(Dreamstime/TNS) By Tribune News Service | Tribune News Service PUBLISHED: June 15, 2024 at 6:24 AM PDT Andrea Felsted | (TNS) Bloomberg Opinion Revenge travel is losing its appeal. After three years of rushing to book trips in the wake of pandemic-era restrictions, sharply higher fares, protests against tourism, fatigue from endless hours spent in airports and incomes squeezed by inflation are all taking their toll on travelers. Travel demand is far from falling off a cliff. But there are signs that our wanderlust is downshifting from never-ending to a more normal pattern. For airlines and tour operators, the next few months will be crucial in filling remaining seats and hotel rooms. If demand is strong, they will be able to sell leftover capacity at higher prices. But if consumers hold off, they’ll be forced to discount, something that hasn’t happened in the past three years. In Europe, many people who were passionate about their vacations booked in January, in order to secure their preferred destination, hotel and even room. But in recent months, some consumers, particularly more budget-constrained families, have been holding off to see how their own finances, and holiday prices, developed. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, has sold about 60% of the vacations available this summer. That’s broadly in line with last year, but it’s still a lot of sunny breaks to shift in an uncertain environment. European travelers are also shopping around. At Thomas Cook, now reborn as an online tour operator, bookings to Spain’s Balearic and Canary Islands are flat year-over-year. This reflects cost — you can get more for your money in Turkey, mainland Spain and Egypt — where sales are up. But anti-tourism protests in the Canary and Balearic islands may also be playing a part. European consumers are still prepared to pay as much for their package holiday – well almost. TUI’s summer pricing is up 4%, close to the 5% increase reported a year earlier. But budget airlines Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc show that when it comes to air fares, consumers are reaching their limit. Michael O’Leary, chief executive officer of Ryanair, forecast that fares across its network this summer would be flat to 5% ahead, down from his previous prediction of a 5% to 10% increase, surprising given that capacity is constrained by delays to Boeing deliveries. Europe’s largest low-cost carrier has begun to cut ticket prices to fill its fleet. There are signs that the U.S. travel recovery, now in its third year, is maturing too. For example, Marriott International Inc. said U.S. leisure revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel performance, was flat in its first quarter. Airbnb Inc. forecast that revenue would expand by 8% to 10% in the second quarter, the lowest level for three years. It’s possible this is a blip — Easter was earlier this year — and Airbnb expects a bounce in the summer months. Indeed, the picture is complex. Some of the U.S. domestic weakness may reflect Americans traveling to Europe, emboldened by the strength of the dollar. This will likely have been boosted by one-offs, such as Taylor Swift’s concerts. And this isn’t the only factor that makes the travel temperature so difficult to take. After wildfires in Greece last year, climate concerns are at the forefront of consumers’ minds. Yet this is spurring some unusual behaviors, such as some European customers booking long-haul flights to destinations such as Mauritius, where summer temperatures are more predictable, and, after price increases at some traditional Mediterranean resorts, the cost differential has narrowed. As in other parts of the consumer economy, it may be that travel is polarizing, with the wealthy still splashing on trips further afield and top-notch accommodation, while those pressured by inflation and higher mortgage costs stick to a budget. After the West’s travel boom — and potentially a return to more pedestrian levels – the industry is now looking East, to the return of Chinese visitors, particularly to Europe. But for the coming weeks, short-term factors, such as elections in the U.K. and weather patterns – TUI said the winter season ended particularly strongly, likely boosted by cold and wet conditions – will matter most. Being unable to spread our wings during the pandemic has reinforced our love of getting away, and we may never return to a situation where we are prepared to stay home. That doesn’t mean we won’t alter our behavior, like skipping a week away in spring or autumn, or, for example, forgoing a city break to preserve our main vacation. There is much riding on this year’s peak summer season. Not only will it determine the level of profits at tour operators, hotels and airlines, but it will give the first glimpse of what a more settled post-pandemic travel market looks like. —— This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Δ The Richemont -owned luxury eCommerce platform is moving to focus on its core and more profitable markets, Bloomberg reported Friday (June 14), citing an emailed statement from a Richemont spokesperson. The Net-A-Porter platform was launched in China in 2013 but was unable to gain market share in the country’s competitive eCommerce market. Its sister platform, Outnet , left China in 2015. This move comes at a time when luxury retailers are under pressure in China because of weak consumer spending and a shift from buying luxury goods to focusing on bargains, according to the report. It also comes as Richemont is seeking to sell a majority stake in YNAP after an agreement with Farfetch fell through, the report said. Richemont said in July that China’s role in luxury retail was diminishing. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While the luxury sector had expected to see a revival in China that would offset sluggishness in the United States, sales in the sector continued to weaken. Richemont reported at that time that although it had witnessed an increase in sales from Asia, China’s slower-than-anticipated economic growth raised concerns about a potential reduction in consumer spending. In January, Richemont reported an 8% year-on-year increase in sales of its luxury goods for the quarter ended Dec. 31, exceeding analyst expectations, and reported that the growth was driven in part by strong demand in China, Hong Kong and Macau. Richemont’s greater exposure to the higher-priced hard luxury sector protected it from a significant downturn in aspirational and middle-class spending that hurt luxury sales at other companies. However, it was reported Friday that luxury brands in China are resorting to “unprecedented” discounts to sell unsold inventory and entice cautious Chinese consumers amid growing concerns about a slowdown in spending. The weakening demand from Chinese consumers has already impacted luxury earnings. Kering , the parent company of Gucci , warned of a potential profit drop of up to 45% in the first half of 2024 due to weak sales in China.

Results of the annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises ( ASUSE ) showed resilience of the informal sector - small entities like barber shops, cycle repair units - after the shock of the pandemic. Total number of establishments in the sector increased from 5.8 crore in 2021-22 to 6.5 crore in 2022-23, a growth of nearly 5.9%. The survey period of ASUSE 2021-22, particularly April-June, was severely impacted by the second wave of the pandemic and the overall annual aggregate estimates were affected, according to the statistics office, which released a factsheet. Among the sectors, the number of establishments in the other services sector grew by 15.1%, indicating a robust sectoral expansion, while the number of manufacturing entities rose by 2.2%, reflecting a gradual opening-up of the sector after the pandemic, the survey results showed. \"The survey reveals that average annual earnings for informal workers have increased between 2021-22 and 2022-23, indicating improved wage conditions in the sector, highlighting that effective economic policies to counter the impact of the pandemic had helped in recovery,\" said Rajesh Shukla, MD & CEO of People Research on India's Consumer Economy (PRICE), an economic think tank. The gross value added (GVA), a key indicator of economic performance, saw annual growth of 9.8%, largely led by manufacturing and other service sectors. While manufacturing GVA increased by 19.1%, for other services, it rose by 18.9%. The unincorporated non-agricultural sector employed about 11 crore workers from Oct 2022 to Sept 2023, up from 9.8 crore in 2021-22, an increase of 7.8%, highlighting strength in labour market growth. The maximum annual growth in employment during the period was in other services sector category at 13.4%, followed by the manufacturing sector at 6.3%. Majority of the workers in the non-agricultural unincorporated sector are informal workers and the survey showed that average annual earnings for these workers rose 4.3% to Rs 1,10,982 in 2022-23 from Rs 1,06,381 in 2021-22.

    "article_text": "Mark Zuckerberg’s wealthy investor group is pressuring Joe Biden to declare his 2024 version of the 2012 DACA amnesty — and is buying TV ads to reassure progressive Democrats who are worried about another amnesty’s impact on the upcoming election. The group’s soft-focus sentimental video pitch is titled “An American Love Story,” and it downplays the economic and pocketbook damage to Americans. It ignores the national rejection of Biden’s open-borders policy, and wraps up with a plea to “Protect American Families Today.” The couple lives in Phoenix, Arizona. The man, Everk Sanchez, is a Spanish-accented citizen who works in marketing and radio. His wife is an illegal immigrant who was protected by President Barack Obama’s illegal Deferred Action for Childhood Migrants (DACA) amnesty. They have five children. The amnesty pitch asks Biden to grant “parole” to at least one million illegal migrants who are married to U.S. citizens. The amnesty is being pushed by Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, an advocacy group for investors created in 2013 by Zuckerberg and other wealthy, consumer-economy investors. FWD.us and its allies have also been the major cheerleaders for President Barack Obama’s DACA program, partly because the controversy diverts attention from the inflow of white-collar visa workers that boosts investors’ stock values. “It’s the same kind of thing [as DACA] where they’re using sympathetic characters to try to push a broader agenda,” noted Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The long-standing parole loophole in the border laws was narrowed in 1996 to cover border emergencies such as a sick passenger on an international flight, or a person rushing to a U.S. funeral. But Biden’s deputies have used parole to pull more than a million economic migrants into U.S. jobs, partly because federal judges are not using their legal power to curb the White House’s easy-migration policy. In Congress, Democrats and business-first Republicans have blocked enforcement of the parole laws. The massive and damaging inflow has deeply damaged Biden’s polls before the 2024 election. The FWD.us campaign is also wooing the Democrats’ progressives who view themselves as champions for minorities, such as African migrants, regardless of the impact on their fellow Americans: The FWD.us pitch also highlights an illegal migrant healthcare technician in Montana as it suggests the parole amnesty is an extension of Obama’s DACA giveaway: The parole-for-marriage proposal — if enacted — would extend the parole loophole beyond the border and encourage more illegal migration and more parole amnesties, said Rob Law, the director of the Center for Homeland Security and Immigration at the American First Policy Institute. “It is going to create further pull factors [by telling migrants] that ‘if you too can just find your way into the United States and marry a U.S. citizen, you will find a way to a green card and a permanent life here’ in complete violation of the immigration laws, in complete disregard of our border security and national sovereignty,” he told Breitbart News. The “parole in place” plan is “legally questionable (at best),” wrote Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge who now works with the Center for Immigration Studies. “If the White House gets away with it, expect a cascade of other Parole in Place programs for illegal parents of U.S. citizens, and then parents of green-card holders, and so on,” Arthur added. The amnesty parole likely would be extended to other groups, such as the millions of illegal migrants who are parents of U.S. citizens, or the illegal-migrant siblings of citizens, said Law. Since 2021, Biden has stimulated the economy by welcoming more than 10 million legal, illegal, temporary, and quasi-legal migrant workers, consumers, and renters. The flood has reduced Americans’ wages and career opportunities, and it has also raised housing costs, mortgage rates, and crime victimization. The flood has also refloated former President Donald Trump’s ambitions and washed away Biden’s reelection chances. Advocates suggest the parole amnesty will revive Latino support, which is now lagging because Latinos suffer disproportionately from Biden’s immigration policy. “I don’t think it would actually move the needle very much,” responded Krikorian, adding: I can’t predict the future because it hasn’t happened yet, but it doesn’t seem likely that it will overcome all of the other issues [facing Latino voters] … Generally speaking, they’re worried about the same things as anybody else — economic issues, disorder at the border, their communities, and crime and all that stuff … Republicans get third of the Hispanic voters, and Trump might get close to half. He might even win the Hispanic vote, although that would be a reach. But you know, they’re regular voters, treat them like regular voters, But an amnesty might be damaging for Biden if it is seen as “one more example of executive lawlessness,” Krikorian added."

Δ Findings from the National Retail Federation ’s CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor announced Monday (June 10) showed that in May, consumer spending increased 1.35% relative to April, the highest month-to-month rise recorded in more than a year, and spending was up nearly 3% year over year . “Consumers have clearly retained their ability to spend and are driving solid economic growth,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement. “Spending is being supported by the job market and real wage gains. Inflation remains stubborn but is almost entirely in services rather than retail goods.” Yet major retailers are, for the most part, still seeing consumers show signs of conservative spending. “Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix, as they’re spending more of their paychecks on non-discretionary categories and less on general merchandise,” John David Rainey , executive vice president and chief financial officer at Walmart, told analysts on the retailer’s earnings call last month. Similarly, on a call Thursday (June 6) discussing Big Lots ’ first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results, President and CEO Bruce Thorn called out “continued pullback in consumer spending by our core customers, particularly in high-ticket discretionary items.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Target , meanwhile, is seeing consumers make room in their budgets for nonessential splurges — but not on retail products. “Business trends continue to reflect a normalization in spending patterns that first emerged more than two years ago, a pattern where consumers are remixing their spending back into services and entertainment outside of their homes after curtailing those activities during the pandemic,” Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told analysts on an earnings call in May. “This normalization, combined with the cumulative impact of higher prices on consumer budgets, is resulting in continued soft trends in discretionary categories.” In recent months, consumers have continued to feel the economic pressure. The April edition of the PYMNTS Intelligence “ New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report ” series found that the average consumer has three months of income saved, and 58% of consumers live paycheck to paycheck. Plus, the February/March edition of the report revealed that 60% of consumers have reduced the quantity of their nonessential retail purchases due to price increases, and half have switched to cheaper merchants. Even the NRF’s own data showed continued caution. Despite the increase in spending, the NRF still predicted that consumers will shell out less on gifts for their dads this Father’s Day than last year. As such, economic pressures continue to influence consumer behavior, leading to conservative spending patterns. Inflation in services and the lingering impacts of the pandemic on spending habits persist, prompting retailers to see consumers prioritizing essential expenditures and experiences over general merchandise and discretionary items.

    "article_text": "Bank of America Executive Says Consumers Still Spending Pandemic-Era Savings By PYMNTS | June 11, 2024 | Consumer spending is still being driven by savings that built up during the pandemic, Bank of America President of Regional Banking Dean Athanasia said Tuesday (June 11).

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions . Δ Speaking at a Morgan Stanley financial conference, Athanasia said consumers’ checking accounts are still 23% larger than they were before the pandemic, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Athanasia also said at the event that consumer spending is still growing but has slowed from 5% year over year in 2023 to 3.5% today. Demand for borrowing has also slowed, and credit card loss rates are returning to where they were in 2019, per the report. Another report found that consumers are becoming more discerning about their spending on nice-to-have retail products. For example, data from credit card transactions revealed a trend where consumers are willing to splurge on fashionable and trendy items while cutting back on big-ticket purchases. PYMNTS Intelligence found that consumers have still managed to keep spending, or at least keep their intent to spend intact, even though most of their collective paychecks are earmarked to meet expenses. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Most recently, the PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Consumer Credit Economy Monitor: Summer Travel 2024 ” showed that 48% of consumers have already made travel plans for the summer. Data from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of Commerce suggested consumers are pulling back on spending and paying down credit card debt. Reading across the data from the two agencies, lower retail sales in April and a slightly lower total of outstanding credit card debt signal that disposable income and/or savings are being used to pay down debt, PYMNTS reported Friday (June 7). Discount retailers have seen sales upticks as financially unstable consumers, squeezed by higher prices on everything from groceries to gasoline, increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. This trade-down behavior at a time of high inflation is providing a boost to companies such as Dollar General , Dollar Tree and The TJX Companies , which are seeing upticks in customer traffic and sales at a time when many retailers are seeing sales declines due to shoppers’ belt-tightening behaviors.

    "article_text": "... By Omar Mohammed Reporter, Economy & Finance Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member Inflation cooling down to the Federal Reserve's target of two percent will spark a decline of borrowing costs, including for mortgages, the World Bank said on Tuesday. This development could help unlock a housing market in the U.S. that has been hit hard by expensive home loans and elevated prices. Read more: Current Mortgage Rates Since March 2022, the U.S. central bank has hiked interest rates at an aggressive pace not seen since the 1980s to a two-decade high of 5.25 to 5.5 percent current range. This has pushed up the cost of borrowing for mortgages to its most expensive in 20 years. That policy move was geared to help slow down inflation, which still sits above the Fed's target of 2 percent. But economists at the World Bank expect that inflation will moderate over the next two years and by the end of 2026 interest rates will come down along with it, which experts say will buoy the housing market. \"By the end of 2026, borrowing rates are expected to have declined substantially as inflation returns close to target,\" the global financial institution said in a report. ... High interest rates in the U.S. have tightened financial conditions in the world's largest economy. But American consumers have powered through the restrictive environment helped by savings from the pandemic and contributed to economic growth that have defied expectations of a slowdown. Read more: How to Calculate How Much House You Can Afford The World Bank also revealed on Tuesday that U.S. economic growth will perform better in 2024 compared to an initial estimate earlier in the year. The economy is estimated to expand by 2.5 percent this year, nearly a percentage point increase from the earlier forecast of 1.6 percent. \"Data releases earlier this year surprised to the upside, particularly on the consumer spending side,\" the World Bank said. The U.S. is expected to continue growing in 2025 but at a slower pace of 1.8 percent as the effects of elevated rates continue to trickle down into the economy, slowing consumer spending along the way. Read more: First-Time Homebuyer Guide \"The slowdown in 2025 is expected to be driven primarily by the cumulative effects of past monetary tightening and a contractionary fiscal stance. Elevated real borrowing rates are set to restrain household spending on durable goods and residential investment,\" the Bank said. \"Broader consumer spending is expected to slow due to moderating growth in household income as labor market tightness recedes and savings diminish,\" it added. The Bank's expert suggested that household wealth will drop as house prices cool, adding to the overall ability of consumers to spend in the economy slow. \"Increases in house prices tapered off toward the end of 2023 and are expected to remain well below the strong pace seen over the past few years,\" the Bank noted. \"As wealth gains slow, household income growth is also expected to ease sequentially throughout 2024, with the labor market continuing to soften and U.S. job openings declining.\" Request Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial & AI Guidelines Add Newsweek as a preferred source on Google to see more of our trusted coverage when you search.

Championed by RWDSU, this act aims to address the increasing retail violence and ensure a safer workplace for retail workers. The New York State Senate has passed the Retail Worker Safety Act, following the passage of the coordinating bill in the Assembly. This landmark legislation mandates corporate retail employers to adopt comprehensive violence prevention plans, train workers in de-escalation and active shooter scenarios, and for large employers, install panic buttons throughout the workplace. The Retail Worker Safety Act addresses the escalating issue of retail violence, which poses significant risks to frontline retail workers. Under the act, the New York State Department of Labor is required to develop a model risk assessment and training program focused on de-escalation tactics and active shooter scenarios. Employers with 10 or more workers must adopt this model or create their own, providing annual safety training for employees. Additionally, employers with 500 or more workers nationwide must install panic buttons in their stores, enabling workers to call for help effectively and safely. The New York State Senate passed the Retail Worker Safety Act, requiring corporate retail employers to implement violence prevention plans, train workers in de-escalation and active shooter scenarios, and install panic buttons. Championed by RWDSU, this act aims to address the increasing retail violence and ensure a safer workplace for retail workers. The act has been vigorously championed by President Stuart Appelbaum and members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), who have mobilised retail workers across New York State. They organised rallies and press conferences in cities such as New York City, Albany, and online via Zoom, advocating for the bill alongside Senator Jessica Ramos and Assembly member Karines Reyes, RWDSU said in a press release. A survey conducted by RWDSU revealed alarming statistics. Over 80 per cent of respondents are concerned about the possibility of an active shooter entering their workplace. Nearly two-thirds experienced verbal harassment or intimidating conduct from a customer, co-worker, or manager within the past year. Only 7 per cent felt their employer had made workplace changes to improve safety following a violent incident. Nearly 75 per cent would feel safer with regular training on workplace safety, risk reduction, and response protocols during violent incidents. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said: “Today’s passage of the Retail Worker Safety Act by the State Senate is a critical step towards common sense safety measures for retail workers across New York. When the bill is signed into law, basic protections will be provided for both workers and customers. Throughout this campaign, we have heard deeply troubling workers’ stories from all over the state—stories of violent crimes, senseless shootings and harassment. “Workers in retail stores in New York should never have to experience anything like this. One thing is for certain, however: employers can and should do more to protect their employees. That’s why we’re championing this critical law, which requires that retail employers take full responsibility to protect their workers from violence.” Fibre2Fashion News Desk (DP) More Retail News - United States Of America...

    "article_text": "The investors who helped elect President Joe Biden in 2020 want a last-minute amnesty for roughly 1 million illegal migrants, even as multiple polls show rising public opposition to cheap-labor migration. The Democrats’ pro-migration donors and investors recognize that Biden is losing the election and “they’re just absolutely desperate,” Kevin Lynn, the founder of U.S. Tech Workers . If Trump is elected, “he will have the mandate to deport 21 million people,” said Lynn, because Biden’s vast inflow of roughly 10 million legal and illegal migrants has discredited the establishment’s claim that migration is good for America and Americans. The establishment’s pro-migration “narrative is collapsing, and they’re doubling down again” shortly before the election, Lynn said. RELATED: Joe Biden Calls Illegal Aliens “Model Citizens” in Amnesty Push Video Source: The White House / YouTube Any Biden amnesty late in the campaign would draft diverse party activists to defend the investors’ single cause of migration instead of their varied progressive causes, he said. The amnesty push is also an “insane” threat to Biden and his other left-wing non-migration interest groups because it raises their chance of collectively losing in November, he said. But Biden and his campaign staffers may be unable to stop White House policy staffers from declaring the amnesty giveaway, he said, because “the old man is out to lunch .” The Amnesty The amnesty plan would grant “immigration parole” status to perhaps 1 million illegal migrant spouses of American citizens. That grant would provide work permits, two years of temporary residency, and an incentive for much marriage fraud. “This is called AMNESTY for any reporters courageous enough to tell the truth,” said a June 10 twee t from the Immigration Accountability Project. The amnesty would mimic President Barack Obama’s 2012 award of work permits to 800,000 illegal immigrants who were brought into the United States while they were children. Obama’s “DACA” amnesty has been deemed illegal by the courts but has not been ended by judges. The “parole in place” plan is “legally questionable (at best),” wrote Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge who now works with the Center for Immigration Studies. RELATED: Activist Slams Kamala Harris for Lack of Action on Amnesty for Illegal Aliens Video Source: Ali-Jae Nicolai / Breitbart News The homeland security “secretary may parole aliens ‘only on a case-by-case basis’ and then only ‘for urgent humanitarian reasons’ or for a ‘significant public benefit,’ he wrote, adding: The problem with the [pro-amnesty] arguments, and with the Biden administration’s parole programs generally, is not just that they exceed DHS’s limited parole authority in section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA, but also that they have no “limiting principle” . … Accepting the [parole] memo at face value, nothing would limit the administration’s ability to grant parole to any alien, so long as it would “promote more efficient use of” DHS’s “resources and staffing”, thus opening the limited parole authority wide enough to swallow all of the other rules and requirements in the [immigration law]. “If the White House gets away with it, expect a cascade of other Parole in Place programs for illegal parents of U.S. citizens, and then parents of green-card holders, and so on,” Arthur added. A coalition of states has asked a federal judge to strike down another Biden policy that uses the parole language to let employers hire an additional 350,000 foreign workers each year. FWD.us The new amnesty push emerged in April from FWD.us, Mark Zuckerberg’s lobby group for West Coast investors. Those investors gain from migration, especially from the inflow of white-collar contract workers . The FWD.us push has since been picked up by a variety of other pro-migration advocacy groups, many of which get funding from Zuckerberg’s business group and from ideologically progressive foundations. FWD.us President Todd Schulte argued on June 9 that an amnesty would be a political counter to the public’s rising opposition to government-backed migration: In a time in which authoritarianism around the globe is fueled by anti-immigrant demagogues who seek to weaponize the plight of immigrants and those seeking refuge for their own political gain, we can either find humane and politically resilient approaches to the challenges presented by forced migration to build legal pathways and provide legal status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for years, or xenophobia will only become a more potent weapon. “Immigrants and immigration are good for America and Americans” — and also for progressive values, Schulte declared: if we do not build a modern, fair, just and orderly immigration system — and yes, these are mutually reinforcing values and operational realities — that not only upholds the best of our values, but that allows people to live, thrive and survive, the difficult politics that come — by design — from forcing the marginalized into more visible and even more marginalized positions — will be used to attack the best of America’s promise. FWD.us has a lot of clout in the White House, partly because Zuckerberg — and his “political strategist in residence,” Mark Plouffe — helped Biden in 2020. Their much-reported strategy was to spend more than $400 million to help grow turnout in Democratic-majority districts. Since June 9, the plan has been widely marketed via establishment media publications. NBC News reported on June 10: WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is considering a plan to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants who are the spouses of U.S. citizens and give them access to work permits, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The sources stressed that the proposal was not final and the timing was fluid. The program, known as “parole in place,” would also make it easier for some undocumented immigrants to get a green card and a path to U.S. citizenship. The New York Times reported on June 10: Even as he announced a restrictive border policy last week, Mr. Biden appeared to indicate that he was considering more progressive moves on immigration. “For those who say the steps I’ve taken are too strict, I say to you that — be patient,” Mr. Biden said on Tuesday. … Immigration advocates have left briefings with the White House optimistic about the potential for the protection , but also did not receive any indication that the administration would act right away. Immigrant advocacy groups like Fwd.US have said that more than a million undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens are in the country. The amnesty could help Biden regain support from American Latino citizens who have been hard hit by Biden’s mass migration, according to a June 9 report from CNN: Looking to shore up Latino votes in Nevada and Arizona for his reelection campaign, President Joe Biden is on the verge of soon following up last week’s executive action aimed at curbing border crossings with another move focused on providing legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens. … For Biden in Arizona, “Everything is on the margins, right?” said Democratic Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. “My sense is it should help.” “The orders have not yet been presented to Biden himself for review,” said the CNN report, which also included a quote from FWD.us: “As we approach the 12th anniversary of the DACA program, President Obama’s decision to take bold executive action to support our nation’s Dreamers remains a masterstroke of political ingenuity and the most successful immigration policy in decades,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in a statement. “Today, President Biden faces a similar pivotal moment.” The founders of FWD.us are wealthy coastal investors whose wealth is multiplied 20-fold when the stock market forecasts decades of extra profits whenever the government extracts cheap labor , government-funded consumers , and room-sharing renters from poor countries. The breadth of investors who joined with Zuckerberg to found and fund FWD.us in 2013 was hidden from casual visitors to the group’s website. But copies exist at the other sites . Despite their use of technology, most of the investors earn their wealth from the consumer economy, such as advertising, retail, or food delivery. RELATED: Trump Lays Out Immigration Policy — “NO AMNESTY!” Video Source: Donald J. Trump / Truth The pro-migration investors “will shred the Democratic Party,” warned Lynn, who campaigns against the white-collar visa programs that are used by investors to boost stock values and to keep control of the tech sector. “They’ll do whatever they can to keep this pipeline of money going,” he said. Numerous studies admit that migration transfers vast wealth from ordinary Americans to investors, CEOs, and C-suites. For example, a new study funded by the pro-migration Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation reported : A declining working age population may be associated with a rising labor share of income as well as (arguably) greater environmental sustainability. But these effects may also include lower economic growth, declining government revenues, flat or declining labor force participation and lower investment returns. That suggests a less favorable economic environment and lends credence to the idea that the switch to negative [working-age population growth] may strand assets. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The rarely mentioned economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

    "article_text": "Promoted Jem Lloyd-Williams, CEO of Mindshare UK, sees huge opportunities in retail media but warns against “reinventing the wheel” Keep calm and carry on “Retail media is growing exponentially and the opportunity is going to be huge,” said Lloyd-Williams during his keynote at Media 360. “But, according to the Profit Ability 2 study , you probably wouldn’t spend your next pound in retail media, it would be in linear TV and then press. So let’s keep our feet on the ground and not lose sight of what is incredibly important, which is the entire marketing mix.” No silver bullet Lloyd-Williams cautioned against believing that there is “one single technology, one single data source” that can create your retail media strategy for you. “We should be looking for easy ways to augment what we’re already doing,” he added. “It’s a very sophisticated and complicated ad ecosystem and we definitely need to stop focusing on the bottom of the funnel when it comes to retail media.” Prime testing Lloyd-Williams’ tip for creating “the rudiments of a retail media ecosystem” - “Amazon has a pre-built retail media test lab which you can tap into – from Prime Video big TV exposure, to mid-funnel display to search and re-targeting.” Mine the data It’s time to “reappraise our use of data, segmentation and our understanding of consumers” because “the opportunity in retail media is in data more than anything else. What retail media tells you is who your customers actually are as opposed to what your segmentation suggests there might be.” Build the right squad As well as a reappraisal of data, there needs to be a rejig of your on-field formation. “Nobody is going to come up with a new strategy unless clients, agencies and the experts rearrange themselves in a more meaningful way,” said Lloyd-Williams. “Brands need to bring new people into conversations, whether that’s logistics, retail trade team, retail readiness. And agencies should get somebody from the UX team and from the analytics team to sit in on the conversations about your retail media strategy.” Stay smart “Continue using smart media to increase your overall marketing performance – focus on incrementality and then test, learn and optimise in the whole media mix.” More than one Cornetto Lloyd-Williams had three case studies to illustrate the power of retail media. A campaign with Cornetto ice cream was “a simple example of how we used algorithmic decisioning to deliver the right message at the right time and the right place”. Circana sales opportunity data was ingested meaning that when the sun was shining, a customer would be served the most relevant ad based on their location. “This is not a new concept but it’s interesting because of how retail media augmented and supercharged [the campaign]. We served the media and saw exponential results”. Using Amazon to recruit new shoppers at Sainsbury’s A pharma brand wanted to grow share with Sainsbury’s by recruiting new shoppers. The strategy was to mine shopper behavioural data from Amazon to create a targeting strategy on Sainsbury’s, with cross-sell tactics against relevant competitors, keywords and audiences. The results were scaled reach by 80%, driving a 20% uplift in sales from new consumers with a significant uplift in conversions from competitor targeting strategies, outperforming existing targeting tactics in CPA and CVR. Driving sales with TV The third case study showed how Magnum ice cream used retail media data to target relevant segments at the top of the funnel, to drive sales of the new product. “By taking Tesco ClubCard data, ingesting audiences into ITV X, serving TV creative to people in their living rooms, we were able to identify the incremental sales impact in Tesco”. By using retail media segmentation data in your overall AV strategy, you can drive incremental sales. Increased complexity Lloyd-Williams predicts a more crowded retail media landscape with “more players in the market and more data alliances. There will be more businesses like Infosum and LiveRamp helping us mesh data to do interesting things.” He suggested: “Get your huddle around the problem and work out which components to use to help supercharge your strategy.”"

    "article_text": "The Federal Reserve's June meeting will consider interest rates, again, as the central bank weighs the effect of stubborn inflation that has made life, generally, more expensive for Americans. The benchmark rate that banks charge each other to loan money sits at 5.25% - 5.5%. It's designed to make borrowing more expensive and cool demand in the economy. How does the Fed decide interest rates? The Federal Reserve's June meeting could shape the economy's path. Will interest rates change amidst stubborn inflation? FOX 26's business reporter Tom Zizka explains what factors the central bank considers when setting interest rates. The bank will consider several data points in its decision. First, jobs. Rate hikes were expected to result in job losses because it would be more expensive for businesses to operate. The Labor Department's May jobs report of 297,000 new positions was a mixed bag. While certainly good news for people who are getting a paycheck, but most of those positions were part-time. Unemployment, meantime, ticked-up to 4%, but still remains historically low. Understandably, the Fed will spend a lot of time looking at what we do with our money. Ours is a consumer-driven economy, where $7 out of every $10 comes directly from our pockets. Consequently, they'll look at retail sales. The last two readings on this have been unchanged. There's also a report that looks at consumer sentiment: how we feel about things. Generally, we feel 'OK', but notably below a 10-year median line that they keep track of. Next, the central bank will look at what's going on with real estate, because buying a home is, typically, the biggest purchase a lot of people will make. This particular sector is still getting a kick in the pants. Mortgage rates remain around 7 percent right now, and home sales are just over half of what they were at their peak in 2005. In part, that's because inventory is low, as people don't want to move and let go of the sweet deal they may already have, which pushes prices higher for the homes that are on the market. SUGGESTED: States with the best and worst economies in 2024 It all leads to the two primary indicators of how the economy is performing. Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is the value of the nation's goods and services, and it measures economic output. It is slowing. Last year, it was at 4.9%, annually, and has fallen to 1.3%, now. Then there is inflation, the reason the Fed started raising interest rates. Most recently it stood at 3.4%, down from the high of 9% in 2022, but still above the Fed's target of 2%. Experts say, for now, the economy is just doing OK. \"There's no reason to cut rates, right now, because there's not enough evidence that inflation is moderating as fast as they would like it to,\" says Houston financial strategist Lance Roberts, \"But there's also no conversation that the Fed will need to hike rates.\" There is no expectation of a rate cut when the Fed concludes its latest meeting. While the next opportunities would come at the Fed meetings in July and September, prevailing wisdom suggests they'll wait till November, at the earliest, so there's no appearance of it affecting the election.

    "article_text": "« Wipeout in Europe: Conservative parties run away with big wins in EU parliamentary elections | Pride Month: The gay kiss on Disney’s Doctor Who and a Charleston school district employee struts for the kids » XPost Print Email June 10, 2024 It’s a greenie conundrum: Massive amounts of lithium detected in ‘fracking wastewater’ By Olivia Murray Uh oh, it’s fixing to be a battle between reality and leftist ideology—but who will win? Writing for Fox News, Charles Creitz recently reported on a very inconvenient truth, from a new study: fracking wastewater is full of lithium, making it a “promising domestic source” if tapped, and the process to extract it “reduces the cost” of traditional water decontamination efforts. Here are the details, from Creitz: Major lithium discovery in fracking wastewater leaves the left facing EV ‘irony’ A University of Pittsburgh study suggested processing byproducts from natural gas production in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale basin could potentially meet nearly half of U.S. lithium needs. … In the study, published in Nature’s ‘Scientific Reports,’ estimates of annual lithium yields from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale totaled 1,278 tons. The Marcellus Shale range covers large swaths of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and West Virginia. One of the researchers, Justin Mackey, told KDKA that in addition to supplying substantial amounts of lithium, processing the wastewater in that way ‘reduce[s] the cost of remediating and handling’ it…. Not only is lithium a crucial component for everything the left likes to inaccurately file under “net zero” technologies (electric vehicles, solar panel energy storage systems, wind turbines), but it’s necessary for basically all electronics—the computer I’m using to write this blog, and the phone from which you may be reading it. In the U.S., we’re largely reliant on foreign lithium, as Australia, Chile, and China produce 90% of the lithium on the global market—which leaves us in a precarious position if there are any supply chain disruptions or price fluctuations—so sourcing it from dirty fracking water, in a process that reduces the cost companies already pay to clean the contaminated water, is quite a good deal for the American consumer, economy, and environment. And, not only that, but considering how utterly filthy and destructive to the environment the traditional lithium mining process is—just think how much worse it is in unbound-by-climate-deals China—it’s an even better deal to use the market, or the law of supply-and-demand, to diminish our dependence on products that come with ecologically devastating consequences. If we were to implement this lithium-from-fracking-water process only at the Marcellus Shale, with its almost 1,300-ton annual yield of lithium, it would bump the U.S. into one of the top lithium producers in the world, contributing more lithium to the market than 185 nations combined . (Out of 193 nations, the bottom 185 produce together 700 tons of lithium each year.) Creitz also reported that the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania alone employed more than 100,000 union jobs—and in an era of Bidenomics, those private sector jobs are beyond crucial, because they’re what’s keeping everything from totally collapsing. I mean, we’ve got natural gas, we’ve got tons (literally) of lithium, we’ve got tons (figuratively) of jobs, and a seriously low environmental impact—this is like a win-win-win-win. And you know what that means? The political class and the bureaucracy will shut it down, and shut it down fast . Image: fdecomite, CC BY 2.0 , via Flickr , unaltered.

    "article_text": "Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Microsoft ( MSFT ): A tech giant that practically does everything, MSFT is a great buy. Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ): With its strong relationship with a key partner, TSMC is a powerful idea. Novo Nordisk ( NVO ): Novo Nordisk offers a cynical but incredibly relevant business profile. Give yourself some restful dreams with these safe stocks to buy. Source: shutterstock.com/marozhka studio With so many moving parts in the market, investors shouldn’t just focus on explosive growth ideas. Instead, they should turn to the safety of, well, safe stocks to buy. Before you start protesting, I’m not suggesting that you walk away from your star performers. If they’re working for you, ride them higher – be my guest. However, I also believe it makes sense to consider safe stocks to buy for providing a performance baseline. As an example, if you’re managing a baseball team, you don’t want your lineup to be too top heavy. Many games are won and lost in the bottom of the order. If you don’t have reliable players being productive across your roster, you’re going to be losing games you shouldn’t. It’s the same principle here. You’ll want to focus on your core names, the ideas that got you where you are right now. However, don’t ignore beefing up your performance holistically. With that, below are safe stocks to buy. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com When it comes to balanced safe stocks to buy, it may not get much better than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). As an overall technology juggernaut, Microsoft has its hands in everything: hardware, software, artificial intelligence, you name it, it’s doing it. As I’ve mentioned several times before, I believe the company offers tremendous relevancies for the burgeoning gig economy. Its suite of business software is simply indispensable. As for the hard numbers, they speak for themselves. In the four quarters between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, Microsoft posted an average earnings per share of $2.82. In terms of beating analysts’ consensus expectations, the positive surprise came out to 7%, per Yahoo Finance data. It’s not the most impressive print but MSFT wins in the consistency game. Over the trailing 12 months ( TTM ), the company posted net income of $86.18 billion, translating to EPS of $11.55. Revenue during the period reached $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS to rise 20.2% to hit $11.79. The top line may rise 15.6% to reach $244.92 billion. Thus, it’s a great idea for safe stocks to buy. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com While Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) may be an obvious idea for safe stocks to buy, it’s still worth mentioning. As a powerhouse in the semiconductor foundry business, the company – abbreviated as TSMC – plays a vital role in the tech value chain. Fundamentally, TSMC enjoys a strong relationship with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). And that’s where the “obvious” label comes in. Basically, whatever’s good for Nvidia should translate to downwind benefits for the semiconductor contract manufacturing specialist. Better yet, it delivers the goods financially. During the past four quarters, TSMC posted an average EPS of about $1.32. That translates to a positive earnings surprise of 6.55%. Again, it’s not blistering but it’s darn consistent. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS to rise to $6.31. That comes out to a 21.6% improvement over last year’s result of earnings of $5.19 per share. On the top line, experts are seeking sales of $85.19 billion. If so, that would be a 22.7% boost from last year’s $69.4 billion. There could be even more growth, with fiscal 2025 revenue projected to hit $103.48 billion. It’s easily one of the safe stocks to buy. Novo Nordisk (NVO) Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com While I’m going to stick Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO ) on this list of safe stocks to buy for its relevance to the weight-loss drug sector, the idea may come with a tad bit of controversy. That’s because analysts – while rating NVO a consensus strong buy – only have an average price target of $149.60. That only leaves about 5% of growth potential based on Thursday’s close. So, how is that really safe? It can be a tough argument because Novo’s forward annual dividend yield is around 1%. That’s not a whole lot when the capital gains potential is limited. However, analysts may need to adjust their expectations northward. First, weight-loss drugs have witnessed incredible popularity. Therefore, the trajectory seems quite vertical in a good way. On a terribly cynical note, multiple health organizations have noted that obesity is a major problem in the U.S. In other words, the narrative is expanding horizontally in a “good” way for NVO stakeholders. Now, however, you want to dice it, analysts see tremendous growth: 29.1% in fiscal 2024 to sales of $42.77 billion and 20.4% growth in fiscal 2025 to $51.48 billion. Kenvue (KVUE) Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com Another healthcare-related idea for safe stocks to buy, investors may want to consider the narrative for Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE ). As the former consumer health products unit of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Kenvue is now its own publicly traded entity. For stakeholders prior to the spin off, I genuinely believe value will be unlocked. As for new shareholders, KVUE should at least be a must-watch idea. Right now, the consumer economy faces myriad challenges. People are complaining about the high cost of living with rampant inflation and elevated borrowing costs. However, Kenvue brings products to the table that really indelible. I mean, everybody gets the occasional boo-boo. By providing first-aid kits and the elements within them, Kenvue practically enjoys permanent relevance. Also, it’s a powerhouse in the over-the-counter medicine sector. Again, everybody occasionally gets the sniffles. People aren’t necessarily going to run to the doctor for such incidents. So, they’ll turn to trusted brands, of which many fall under the Kenvue umbrella. Add in the sweet forward dividend yield of 4.29% and you’re going to be sleeping easy at night. Target (TGT) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com As a big-box retailer, Target (NYSE: TGT ) offers something for everyone – or about as close to everyone as you can get. What I appreciate about Target is that it falls right into the sweet spot in terms of customer income levels. Generally, its mainline rival Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) targets lower-to-middle-income households. Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) runs on the high end, in part due to its membership-only business model. Target? It appeals to the middle class. I’m not the arbiter of big-box retailers or anything. However, there’s a different ambiance when you walk into a Target as opposed to a Walmart. I can’t put my finger on it (well, I can, but let’s say I can’t). Here’s what we can all agree on: the financials. In the past four quarters, the average EPS landed at $2.23 approximately. That comes out to an average surprise of 23.6%. To be fair, Target missed the quarter ended April 30, 2024. And the current fiscal year’s sales may be disappointing at $106.9 billion, which would be down half-a-percent from last year. However, the high-side view also hits $107.55 billion. Further, a recovery should be in place by its fiscal 2026, with consensus revenue landing at $110.9 billion. With a dividend yield of 3.03%, I believe TGT makes for a solid case for safe stocks to buy. Coca-Cola (KO) Source: monticello / Shutterstock Global beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) inherently makes a case for safe stocks to buy. Obviously, it’s an absolute giant of an enterprise, with a market capitalization of $276.36 billion. It’s probably not going to make you rich. But it’s also probably not going to make you poor. A dividend yield of 3.02% helps ensure that statement. That’s well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. However, that’s not the main reason I’m discussing the icon of American capitalism. Instead, I’m intrigued by the possible forward potential of its energy drink called, surprisingly enough, Coca-Cola Energy. Let’s get the bad news out of the way. At the end of 2020, this new product represented just 0.7% of U.S. energy drink sales, according to The Wall Street Journal . So, it got pulled. Nevertheless, the potential is there. According to Grand View Research, the expected annual growth rate for energy drinks in the year 2030 comes to 8.3% . For the traditional coffee beverage, the growth rate over the same period lands at 5.2% . Again, there’s opportunity here if Coca-Cola wants to revisit or rebrand its energy beverage. Chevron (CVX) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com As a hydrocarbon energy giant, Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) should cynically benefit from the geopolitical flashpoints that are presently raging. However, it’s a tricky narrative. First, the Ukrainians have aggressively attacked Russia’s oil refineries. On paper, that’s bad for global supply and good for CVX stakeholders as demand artificially rises. However, the Russians aren’t exactly great at refining their crude oil. With its downstream units being compromised by the Ukrainians, Moscow must essentially greenlight fire sales of crude . That’s good for global supply and bad for CVX stakeholders. So, why mention Chevron in this list of safe stocks to buy? At the end of the day, the world continues to run on oil. Further, the situation in the Middle East could easily escalate. If so, global oil supply chains could be disrupted, leading to price swings higher. It appears that analysts have recognized the possibility of this framework coming to fruition. Recently, several analysts have reiterated or even assigned buy ratings. Overall, the consensus stands at strong buy and the average price target has improved to $187.20. That implies 20% upside potential. On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "article_text": "New retail investors jumping on to market bandwagon normally happens at the peak of rally. Image Source: IANS News New Delhi, June 10 : Indian stock markets emerged as a favourite investment destination for retail investors after Covid 19. Now retail investors are the driving force in the market due to making the right decisions at the right time. They appear far ahead of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and other large investors. For instance, there was a big rally in the market on June 3 due to the Exit Polls. According to NSE data, retail investors sold shares worth Rs 8,588 crore, while FIIs and mutual funds invested more than Rs 10,000 crore. On June 4, the day the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were declared, the Nifty fell 5.9 per cent. During that period, retail investors bought equity worth Rs 21,179 crore. At the same time, FIIs and mutual funds had sold equity worth Rs 12,511 crore and Rs 6,249 crore respectively. On June 5, after the results, retail investors had invested Rs 3,006 crore and equity worth Rs 6,481 crore was sold by FIIs. However, mutual funds had invested Rs 2,672 crore. According to experts, \"It is important to understand that the major driving force in this bull market, are the Indian retail investors, including HNIs. Big selling by FIIs is getting eclipsed by the aggressive buying of DIIs and retail investors.\" \"The fact that retail investors bought equity to the tune of Rs 21,179 crore on June 4, the day Nifty tanked 5.9 per cent, indicates the buying power and optimism of the retail investors,\" they added. The trend of investing in SIPs is also increasing rapidly in the Indian stock markets. The average monthly SIP figure has reached around Rs 20,000 crore."

    "article_text": "Business June 10, 2024 by Okwy Iroegbu-Chikezie and Agency Reporter Japanese economy strained but shows signs of improvement A Reuters poll conducted on Friday suggests the Japanese economy contracted at a slightly slower pace than initially estimated in the first quarter (January-March) of 2024. This revision is attributed to upgrades in capital spending figures. Economists anticipate a return to growth in the current quarter (April-June), fueled by government tax cuts and rising wages. The revised Cabinet Office data, due for release today, is expected to show a first-quarter GDP contraction of 1.9 per cent annualised, compared to the initially reported 2.0 per cent decline. This translates to an unchanged quarter-on-quarter contraction of 0.5 per cent. The Nation learnt that the primary driver for the upward GDP revision is a slight improvement in capital expenditure (spending by businesses on equipment and facilities). The revised data suggests a 0.7per cent decline, compared to a previously reported 0.8 per cent drop. Despite the slight positive revision, the Japanese economy still contracted in the first quarter. Read Also: Flooding, illegal structures, building collapses and the controversy of Lagos demolitions The Nation learnt the country is also facing rising import costs as a result of a weaker yen that is expected to put a strain on consumer spending. Disruptions in the auto manufacturing industry are also likely to hinder economic growth. The preliminary data indicated a 0.7per cent decrease in private consumption during the first quarter, as rising living costs impacted household finances. External demand, the net effect of exports and imports, is estimated to have subtracted 0.3 percentage points from overall GDP growth. Separate data from the Bank of Japan, expected on June 12th, is likely to show a 2.0 percent year-on-year increase in the corporate goods price index (May 2024) compared to the same month last year. This index reflects the prices businesses charge each other for goods. The slight improvement in the revised GDP figures offers a glimmer of hope for the Japanese economy. However, significant challenges remain, including rising import costs and disruptions in key industries. Monitoring consumer spending and external demand will be crucial in gauging the future trajectory of the Japanese economy.

For proof, one only needs to look at last week’s extremely volatile trading sessions. Ravindra Sonavane June 10, 2024 / 09:05 IST On June 3, when the market sentiment was extremely bullish on the back of exit poll predictions, NSE data shows that retail investors were selling shares – they were net sellers at Rs 8588 crore On June 3, when the market was doing really well because of exit poll predictions, retail investors sold Rs 8,588 crore worth of stocks to make money, while foreign investors as well as mutual fund were buying them. The next day, when the actual results poured in and the market went into a tailspin, retail investors picked up shares in a falling market and ended the day as net buyers of shares worth Rs 21,000 crore. FIIs and mutual funds were net sellers, at Rs 19,000 crore, on June 4. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The trend continued on June 5, when retail investors again ended the day as net buyers of equities worth Rs 3,000 crore, in sharp contrast to FII sales of Rs 6,500 crore. Mutual funds turned net buyers to the tune of Rs 2700 crore. Market experts attribute this trend to the increasing faith of the Indian retail investor in the stock markets emboldened by the post-pandemic experience where marjets have bounced back from every single fall with no meaningful correction.

Their confidence is also reflected in the growing pool of mutual fund assets. The average monthly SIP inflows of Rs 20,000 crore is also a strong counterforce against FPI selling, Bodke said.

Susie Lee would put the weight of the federal government behind efforts to prosecute criminals taking part in organized retail theft, the Las Vegas congresswoman announced Friday. Lee held a news conference Friday afternoon at the Rainbow Boulevard Target in Las Vegas alongside representatives of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the National Retail Foundation of Nevada. The proposed Bipartisan Combating Organized Retail Crime Act , targets individuals or groups involved in organized retail theft, with coordinated thefts of merchandise that can be resold at a lower price or returned to a store for refunds. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported retailer losses of nearly $100 billion dollars in 2022, with organized retail crime contributing a significant amount, according to the trade group. A survey by the National Retail Foundation said stores across the U.S. have reduced operating hours, changed the selection of in-store products, or closed locations of high-risk stores in response to retail crime. “The truth is that organized retail crime hurts every Southern Nevadan, from small business owners, to consumers, to taxpayers,” Lee said. “Let’s face it: This is not your recreational shoplifting. This is organized crime, that is being run by sometimes, international criminal syndicates.” Lee noted that the proceeds from organized retail theft fund their criminal enterprises like human trafficking and drug smuggling. Bryan Wachter, senior vice president of Retail Association of Nevada, noted that this type of crime “doesn’t have a ZIP code” and represents a safety issues for retail employees. “We have too many stories of retail employees being maimed, stabbed or hurt because of these criminal activities inside of our stores,” Wachter said. He noted that the perpetrators of these crimes are novices sent in by organizers who never directly participate in the thefts. One challenge in addressing organized retail crime is determining its scope. In a Brennan Center for Justice article , Ames Grawert and Ram Subramanian write that data on the prevalence of organized retail theft is often unreliable due to how its legal definition varies across municipalities. Sometimes, the researchers wrote, organized retail theft is categorized alongside crimes like employee theft, and sometimes municipalities put it in their own category. Nevada has passed its own law on organized retail theft and Lee hopes to pass the Bipartisan Combating Organized Retail Crime Act before the general election in November.

Image used for representational purposes Last month’s strong job growth reflected the durability of America’s consumer-driven economy. With the nation’s households continuing their steady spending, many employers have had to keep hiring to meet their customer demand. The unemployment rate edged up to a still-low 4%, from 3.9%, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4%, the Labor Department said Friday. That had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s. President Joe Biden is likely to point to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy’s robust health under his administration. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has focused his criticism of Biden’s economic policies on the surge in inflation, which polls show still weighs heavily in voters’ assessment of the economy. Last month’s robust job gain suggests that the economy should keep expanding at a steady pace. A healthy job market typically propels consumer spending, the economy’s principal fuel. Some recent signs of economic weakness have raised concerns that growth was faltering. May’s jobs report could help assuage those worries. Still, the Federal Reserve’s inflation fighters would like to see the economy cool a bit as they consider when to begin cutting their benchmark rate. The Fed sharply raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 after the vigorous recovery from the pandemic recession ignited the worst inflation in 40 years. Annual inflation has declined to 2.7% by the Fed’ s preferred measure, still above the Fed’s 2% target. Cooler hiring over time could slow wage gains and help fully tame inflation. Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed needs greater confidence that inflation is returning sustainably to its target before it would reduce borrowing costs. When the Fed began aggressively raising rates, most economists expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to cause a recession and drive unemployment to painfully high levels. Yet the job market has proved more durable than almost anyone had predicted. Even so, Americans remain generally frustrated by high prices, a continuing source of discontent that could imperil Biden’s re-election bid. A key reason why the economy is still producing solid net job growth is that layoffs remain at historic lows. Just 1.5 million people lost jobs in April. That’s the lowest monthly figure on record — outside of the peak pandemic period — in data going back 24 years. After struggling to fill jobs for several years, most employers are reluctant to lay off workers.

    "article_text": "FILE - A worker at Reata Engineering and Machine Works programs a Mazak Variaxis machine used to make semiconductor pieces on Feb. 15, 2024, in Englewood, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) WASHINGTON — America’s employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates. Last month’s sizable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other areas of the service sector. U.S. airports, for example, reported record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy’s principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May’s jobs report should help assuage those fears. Still, Friday’s report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate, for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4%, from 3.9%, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4%. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s. President Joe Biden is still likely to point to Friday’s jobs report as a sign of the economy’s robust health under his administration. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has focused his criticism of Biden’s economic policies on the surge in inflation, which polls show still weighs heavily in voters’ assessment of the economy. Hourly paychecks also accelerated last month, a welcome gain for workers but a trend that could contribute to stickier inflation. Hourly wages rose 4.1% from a year ago, faster than the rate of inflation and more quickly than in April. Some companies may raise their prices to offset their higher wage costs. The Federal Reserve’s inflation fighters would like to see the economy cool a bit as they consider when to begin cutting their benchmark rate. The Fed sharply raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 after the vigorous recovery from the pandemic recession ignited the worst inflation in 40 years. Annual inflation has declined to 2.7% by the Fed’s preferred measure, still above the Fed’s 2% target. Cooler hiring over time could slow wage gains and help fully tame inflation. Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed needs greater confidence that inflation is returning sustainably to its target before it would reduce borrowing costs. ADVERTISEMENT When the Fed began aggressively raising rates, most economists expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to cause a recession and drive unemployment to painfully high levels. Yet the job market has proved more durable than almost anyone had predicted. Even so, Americans remain generally frustrated by high prices, a continuing source of discontent that could imperil Biden’s re-election bid. A key reason why the economy is still producing solid net job growth is that layoffs remain at historic lows. Just 1.5 million people lost jobs in April. That’s the lowest monthly figure on record — outside of the peak pandemic period — in data going back 24 years. After struggling to fill jobs for several years, most employers are reluctant to lay off workers."

    "article_text": "Britain ’s economy will see faster-than-expected growth this year and next as the outlook brightens after a tough 2023, according to the CBI . The business group has upped its forecasts for UK growth to 1% in 2024 and 1.9% in 2025 thanks to an expected pick-up in consumer spending as inflation falls back and wages remain robust. It marks a upgrade on the CBI’s December predictions for expansion of 0.8% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025 and comes after the UK eked out growth of a paltry 0.1% in 2023, having slipped into a technical recession at the end of last year. The forecast also sees the CBI giving a much rosier outlook than the Bank of England, which predicted growth of 0.5% for this year in its last set of quarterly forecasts in May. The CBI said: “Encouragingly, economic activity began to recover at the start of 2024. “Robust growth over the first quarter completely reversed the decline in gross domestic product (GDP) seen over the second half of last year, and business surveys report that underlying economic momentum has been improving into the second quarter.” The report also follows hot on the heels of an upgrade this week from fellow business group, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which is now predicting growth of 0.8% in 2024 and 1% in 2025. open image in gallery The CBI said the main driver of the improving picture is consumer spending, ( PA Archive ) The CBI said the main driver of the improving picture is consumer spending, which it expects to rise by 0.8% this year, rising to 2.5% next year, as inflation is set to drop back to the Bank’s 2% target in the second quarter. “Nevertheless, households will feel the pinch this year from the cumulative increase in the level of prices over the last three years, in addition to still relatively higher lending rates,” the CBI cautioned. After falling to target, inflation is expected to pick up again at the end of the year, before falling back to 2% more sustainably in 2025. The CBI is predicting that interest rates will start to come down from their current level of 5.25% in August, before falling steadily to 3.5% between April and June next year. Louise Hellem, CBI chief economist, said: “It’s encouraging to see that the outlook for the UK economy is improving after a difficult 2023. “However, we cannot afford to be complacent about our progress going forward,” she added. “To ensure longer-term, sustainable growth, we must tackle our ongoing productivity problem.” The CBI also warned the stronger outlook was unlikely to offer much in the way of room for tax cuts for the next government. Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI, said: “While our forecast for stronger GDP growth means that the public finances outlook has improved, the next government will still face a difficult fiscal inheritance. “This implies that there will not be much room for significant fiscal stimulus over our forecast period.” Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments"

Subscribe now Revenge travel is losing its appeal. After three years of rushing to book trips in the wake of pandemic-era restrictions, sharply higher fares, protests against tourism, fatigue from endless hours spent in airports and incomes squeezed by inflation are all taking their toll. Travel demand is far from falling off a cliff. But there are signs that our wanderlust is downshifting from never-ending to a more normal pattern. For airlines and tour operators, the next few months will be crucial in filling seats and hotel rooms. If demand is strong, they will be able to sell leftover capacity at higher prices. But if consumers hold off, they’ll be forced to discount, something that hasn’t happened in three years. In Europe, many people who were passionate about their vacations booked in January in order to secure their preferred destination, hotel and even room. But in recent months, some consumers, particularly more budget-constrained families, have been holding off to see how their own finances, and holiday prices, developed. TUI, the world’s biggest tour operator, has sold about 60% of the vacations available this summer. That’s broadly in line with last year, but it’s still a lot of sunny breaks to shift in an uncertain environment. Also read: India slips 10 spots since 2019 on WEF’s travel & tourism ranking despite growth European travellers are also shopping around. At Thomas Cook, now reborn as an online tour operator, bookings to Spain’s Balearic and Canary Islands are flat year-over-year. This reflects cost—you can get more for your money in Turkey, mainland Spain and Egypt—where sales are up. But anti-tourism protests in the Canary and Balearic islands may also be playing a part. European consumers are still prepared to pay as much for their package holiday— well, almost. TUI’s summer pricing is up 4%, close to the 5% increase reported a year earlier. But budget airlines Ryanair Holdings and EasyJet show that when it comes to air fares, consumers are reaching their limit. Michael O’Leary, chief executive officer of Ryanair, forecast that fares across its network this summer would be flat to 5% ahead, down from his previous prediction of a 5% to 10% increase, surprising given that capacity is constrained by delays to Boeing deliveries. Europe’s largest low-cost carrier has begun to cut ticket prices to fill its fleet. There are signs that the US travel recovery, now in its third year, is maturing too. For example, Marriott International said US leisure revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel performance, was flat in its first quarter. Airbnb forecast that revenue would expand by 8% to 10% in the second quarter, the lowest level for three years. It’s possible this is a blip—Easter was earlier this year—and Airbnb expects a bounce in the summer months. Indeed, the picture is complex. Some of the US domestic weakness may reflect Americans travelling to Europe, emboldened by the strength of the dollar. This will likely have been boosted by one-offs, such as Taylor Swift’s concerts. Also read: Travel from foreign countries is the only major laggard now: MakeMyTrip CEO And this isn’t the only factor that makes the travel temperature so difficult to take. After wildfires in Greece last year, climate concerns are at the forefront of consumers’ minds. Yet this is spurring some unusual behaviours, such as some European customers booking long-haul flights to destinations such as Mauritius, where summer temperatures are more predictable, and, after price increases at some traditional Mediterranean resorts, the cost differential has narrowed. As in other parts of the consumer economy, it may be that travel is polarizing, with the wealthy still splashing on trips further afield and top-notch accommodation, while those pressured by inflation and higher mortgage costs stick to a budget. After the West’s travel boom—and potentially a return to more pedestrian levels—the industry is now looking East, to the return of Chinese visitors, particularly to Europe. But for the coming weeks, short-term factors, such as elections in the UK and weather patterns—TUI said the winter season ended particularly strongly, likely boosted by cold and wet conditions—will matter most. Being unable to spread our wings during the pandemic has reinforced our love of getting away and we may never return to a situation where we are prepared to stay home. That doesn’t mean we won’t alter our behaviour, like skipping a week away in spring or autumn, or, for example, forgoing a city break to preserve our main vacation.

Not only will it determine the level of profits at tour operators, hotels and airlines, but it will give the first glimpse of what a more settled post-pandemic travel market looks like. ©bloomberg Gift this article Catch all the Business News , Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Read our privacy notice . The company behind fashion brands JD Williams and Simply Be has reported weaker sales as shoppers continued to tighten their belts, but hailed a return to an annual profit. Shares in N Brown , which also owns menswear brand Jacamo , soared by nearly a fifth after it revealed it had shored up its balance sheet over the past year. The company swung to a pre-tax profit of £5.3 million for the year, having recorded a £71 million loss the prior year. Nevertheless, it faced challenging market conditions with cost-of-living pressures reflected in consumer spending behaviour. Whilst there are signs of improvement, there is still significant pressure on household budgets and consumer confidence is low by historical standards, impacting spending on non-essential items N Brown It reported group revenues of £601 million in the year to March, a 10th lower than the £666 million reported this time last year. N Brown said it felt the effect of cautious customer buying behaviour leading to fewer online orders. “Whilst there are signs of improvement, there is still significant pressure on household budgets and consumer confidence is low by historical standards, impacting spending on non-essential items,” the company said. It also said “unseasonable” weather conditions made it harder to sell summer ranges through the spring and July to August. But this was partly offset by an increase in the average selling price of its products, driven by price rises and by customers buying more of its premium ranges.

    "article_text": "Jun 4, 2024 April factory orders were up, slightly, for third straight month The 0.7% increase signals a healthy tone for manufacturing, at least relative to recent weak readings for construction and consumer spending. by Daniel Ackerman Play Listen Now Save Share Download Demand for construction and industrial equipment was up about 2% in April from March, boosted by federal infrastructure funding. Above, construction on a semiconductor plant in Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Factory orders for the month of April were released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday. The statistic tracks, basically, how much stuff the economy is asking manufacturers to make. Orders were up 0.7% from the month before . That’s good, but not great. In fact, April was the third straight month of good-but-not-great growth in factory orders. Another term for consistent good-but-not-great growth: resilience. The factory orders data contrasts with construction and consumer spending numbers, which came in below analysts’ expectations in the past week. So what’s going on? Keep in mind that April’s modest uptick in factory orders follows a modest downturn late last year, said Mike Montgomery, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Which is, in combination, sort of going nowhere very slowly,” he said. But there were some bright spots in Tuesday’s report. Demand for construction and industrial equipment was up about 2% from the month before. Ned Hill, a professor of economic development at Ohio State University, said the federal government has something to do with that growth. “It’s going to remain strong because of the industrial spending that’s triggered by the CHIPS Act and the other national industrial policies. It’s just starting to go into the ground,” he said. In other words, we’ve got factories building factories — or at least making components that will go into semiconductor and battery production. And when it comes to orders for consumer goods, “a surprise in there was the fact that looking year over year, household appliances is holding up pretty well,” Hill said. But there is evidence in April’s data that a couple of years of elevated interest rates are slowing some production lines, said Matt Colyar, an economist with Moody’s. “If you squint enough, you can see that there’s softening demand,” he said, mentioning new car sales. Still, Colyar added, as some other economic indicators cool off, manufacturers have held up “pretty admirably.” If consumer spending stays sluggish, that will hurt manufacturers eventually. But for now, Colyar said, factories seem to be chugging along.

    "article_text": "President Joe Biden’s much-touted pre-election border “shutdown” preserves multiple loopholes that allow unlimited mass economic migration into Americans’ workplaces and housing. At 2:00 p.m., Biden is expected to tout the made-for-TV policy, which allows — but does not require — curbs when more than 2,500 migrants rush across the open border and through the unfinished wall every day for a week. This means his border “shutdown” policy accepts the inflow of 75,000 illegal migrants per month — 900,000 migrants per year. That planned inflow of illegals adds up to roughly one illegal migrant for every four American births and is in addition to the inflow of roughly one million legal immigrants and 750,000 temporary workers allowed by Congress’s 1990 law. Yet the Biden plan also exempts a huge number of extra migrants who enter via his border loopholes. Those exemptions are already delivering at least 85,000 migrants across the border each month — or one million migrants per year — without approval from Congress. RELATED EXCLUSIVE: Thousands of Migrants Cross Border into Eagle Pass, Texas Video Source: Randy Clark / Breitbart Texas This means Biden’s border shutdown policy will allow the inflow of roughly 3.5 million legal, illegal, temporary, and quasi-legal migrants per year. That inflow adds up to roughly one extra migrant worker, renter, and consumer for every American birth. This nation-changing, wealth-shifting economic policy is very unpopular , even though it is strongly supported by investors, CEOs, and Wall Street. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign recognizes the pocketbook damage of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. White House officials briefed favored reporters about the new policy. Politico reported on January 14, shortly before the Biden speech: There will still be a number of exceptions, including for unaccompanied children, some victims of trafficking, migrants facing acute medical emergencies or imminent threats to their safety. Migrants who also have an appointment at a port of entry via Custom[s] and Border Protection’s smartphone app will still be processed. The Biden administration is currently processing roughly 1,500 migrants a day at official ports, and the president’s actions will not affect his humanitarian parole pathways established for certain migrants. In 2023, Biden allowed 138,000 migrants in via the “unaccompanied children” exemption. This door is kept open even though most of the “children” are youths seeking jobs in the American economy. The remainder are the left-behind children of illegal migrants, and their government-hand off to the migrants encourages the migrants to stay in the United States. The “victims of trafficking” exemption likely refers to girls and women who are being used as prostitutes in the nation’s population of at least 13 million illegal migrants. However, Biden’s pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, may also use it to welcome more adults who are being trafficked by labor brokers. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The third exemption — “migrants facing acute medical emergencies or imminent threats to their safety” — is likely small, but it provides an opening for U.S. non-profits to smuggle vulnerable migrants — such as women with sick children or pregnant women — through the border. The fourth exemption is huge —”1,500 per day” — and easily expanded. It covers “migrants who also have an appointment at a port of entry via Custom and Border Protection’s smartphone app.” That monthly “CBP-One” inflow is already 45,000 per month, and, if it is doubled to 90,000 per month, it will add another one million economic migrants per year. The fifth exemption is also huge and open-ended: “The president’s actions will not affect his humanitarian parole pathways established for certain migrants.” That quasi-legal inflow allows 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela via the narrow “humanitarian parole” exemption, as well as additional family reunification” migrants from several South American and Latin American countries. The reports do not mention the huge inflow of “gotaways” who sneak across the poorly guarded border. In 2023, about 670,000 migrants sneaked across Mayorkas’s mostly open border. United States Border Patrol/Fox United States Border Patrol/Fox The “shutdown” policy also ignores the growing population of white-collar workers who overstay their visas to keep working at Fortune 500 subcontractors. Very few illegals are sent home because Mayorkas has directed enforcement officials to mostly ignore illegals who do not commit felony crimes. The Biden policy reportedly does not provide any instructions to deport the rising population of unregistered gotaway illegals in the United States. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of extraction migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages, subsidizing low-productivity companies, boosting rents, and spiking real estate prices. The rarely mentioned economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation, shrunk trade, crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

    "article_text": "President Joe Biden’s government-run illegal migration is so unpopular voters are now turning against government-run legal migration. Even the New York Times is worried by Biden’s impact on public opinion and the election results in November. “Trump’s Harder Line on Immigration Appears to Resonate, Polls Show,” the newspaper admitted in the June 3 headline. The article then explained declining polls of the government’s It is not just unauthorized immigration causing consternation. A different poll in March from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that Americans have become more worried about legal immigrants. The cited poll by the Associated Press shows the growing opposition to legal migration, despite the relentless cheering for migration from business lobbies and establishment media: In 2017, 59 percent of 1,000 respondents in an AP poll said a “major benefit” of legal migration is that “American companies get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology.” By 2024, a March poll of 668 respondents showed the “major benefit” share had fallen by a third, to 41 percent, while the share of people who said it was “not a benefit at all” almost quadrupled from eight percent to 28 percent. Similarly, in 2017, 50 percent of respondents said legal immigrants “enrich American culture and values.” Eight years later in 2024, that number fell by a quarter to 38 percent while the “not a benefit at all” group jumped from 13 percent to 29 percent. Similarly, Biden’s mostly open border is wrecking public support for legal asylum, which was created to help small numbers of persecuted victims escape dictatorships. Biden and his deputies are using the asylum program to legalize the inflow of millions of workers, renters, and consumers under the claim that the migrants are being persecuted by poverty and criminal gangs. RELATED — 27 Illegal Immigrants Found Inside Horse Trailer During Traffic Stop Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety An AP poll of 1,262 people also showed that a majority of Americans — 53 percent — now want the government to “Reduce the number of immigrants who are allowed to seek asylum in the United States when they arrive at the U.S. border.” Just 12 percent of Americans — mostly Democrats — strongly oppose an asylum reduction, according to the 2024 poll. Investors and lobbyists for migration recognize that Biden’s chaotic mass migration undermines the public’s acceptance of white-collar and blue-collar economic migration. Biden’s migration chaos is pushing alienated investors to donate large sums to Donald Trump in the 2024 race, the New York Times reported on May 17: “In many instances, it’s less that they’re enthusiastic about Mr. Trump … and more that they’re exasperated with the economic and immigration policies of President Biden.” “This is very much an immigration election … It’s about [voters] saying, ‘Whoa, let’s stop this,'” Jeremy Robbins, the executive director of the business-backed American Immigration Council, told a May 14 meeting in Texas. “Forty-eight of Republican voters report that this is the issue that’s driving them to the polls, [but] just 8 percent of Democratic voters, so there’s a huge split,” he said, adding: There’s a very, very common theme that drives why people are voting on immigration: It’s about fear, it’s about anxiety, it’s about frustration, and it’s about instability. Sometimes it’s about “Well, hold on, like, why am I losing? Why when I go to the grocery store am I not hearing English? Like this is America! Why am I not able to understand people in my own country?” Sometimes it’s about language, it’s about culture. [Sometimes] it is economic, and it is about “Well, I feel really unstable in my job, I can’t even make ends meet. And now people are coming in and we’re going to compete against me!” Sometimes it is about security. I think that [issue] is very much inflamed by the media about this idea that, “Oh, my God, neighborhoods are going to be unsafe. They’re gangs of terrorists coming across the border!” The crux of what’s driving immigration [as a political issue is] if we feel like this immigration is happening to us, without our control, at a time when we feel unstable, that is going to make people retrench [and oppose more migration]. Overwhelmingly, [under Biden] Americans believe that our borders are out of control and that our cities are overwhelmed. Some of that is inflamed by the media. Some of that … is a reality of the facts on the ground, which is that we do not have a functioning asylum system, we do not have a functioning border … The challenge is going to be both detoxifying this issue before the election and showing there’s a real plan to take control [of the border]. ﻿ Many other recent polls show Americans increasingly view government-imposed legal migration as a burden, not a benefit. In February, almost 70 percent of Americans said the U.S. would benefit from new curbs on migration at the southern border, according to an Economist /YouGov poll of 1,671 citizens. A Fox News poll of 1,007 voters in December showed that 55 percent of GOP voters — and 37 percent of all swing voters — believe legal immigration hurts the United States. In October, a 54 percent majority of Americans say Biden’s migration is making life harder for all, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 4,415 adults. Just 34 disagreed, including just 29 percent of independents. A January 2024 YouGov poll of 1,592 adult citizens also showed that 37 percent of respondents — including 60 percent of Republicans, and 30 percent of swing voters — said legal and illegal migration “makes the U.S. … worse off.” Just 28 percent of all respondents in the poll said immigration makes the U.S. better. The political result is growing public recognition that the 1965 “Nation of Immigrants” narrative is damaging the ability of ordinary Americans to live the decent middle-class life that was common before a bipartisan coalition used a 1990 law to double the legal immigration numbers set in 1965. Just 25 percent of Americans say immigration is “extremely” important for their nation’s identity. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . Under Biden, the government has welcomed roughly 10 million legal, illegal, temporary, or illegal migrants. That flood delivers one migrant for every American birth. The rarely mentioned economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . RELATED: DPS Agents Discover 29 Illegal Immigrants Inside of Stash House in Webb County, TX Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

Here’s the latest… The next disruptive force in e-commerce: Low-priced Chinese retailers, muscling in on the U.S. market and elsewhere. Low costs are allowing them to grab a growing market share as inflation-weary consumers hunt for bargains. The big players among Chinese e-tailers are Temu , which sells an assortment of goods ranging from T-shirts to appliances at low prices, AliExpress , another cheap general retailer, Shein , the popular fast-fashion dealer and, increasingly, TikTok Shop — the portal for purchasing items on the social media platform known for its short, viral videos and rapid growth. All are seeking new markets outside China as the domestic Chinese consumer economy cools. From just $107.88 $24.99 for Kiplinger Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Sign up You might be surprised at their U.S. sales. Temu has nearly matched Amazon in terms of its regular monthly U.S. users: 51 million of them, vs. Amazon’s 67 million. Shein (29 million users) and AliExpress (23 million) are becoming giants, too. TikTok Shop doesn’t disclose users but has said that the number of sellers visiting its portal is up to 40% of Amazon’s seller traffic. What all these sites have in common — cut-rate prices enabled by low costs of production in China, and a shipping model that lets them avoid the customs duties levied on bulk quantities of imports. The Chinese retailers sell directly to customers and ship items individually or in small batches to stay below the $800 threshold that triggers duties on imported goods. That’s proving to be a boon for freight carriers and could keep air freight rates from going into their normal summertime decline, but it means multiweek delivery times for customers — the cost of duty-free shipping. They are also slashing the fees that sellers pay in order to undercut big U.S. sites like Amazon. In fact, there is speculation that Temu loses money on every U.S. sale as it tries to grow its market share. Temu charges sellers just 2%-5% per transaction, and may even subsidize some of them, whereas Amazon typically charges much more. The origins of many goods sold on these platforms are questionable, at best. Many items seem too cheap to have been made without some unethical practices. There is suspicion that some are made by slave labor in China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing operates de facto concentration camps for its Uyghur ethnic minority. Ethical considerations aside, expect China’s e-tail giants to keep growing. Both in the U.S. — where they threaten to take market share from players like eBay, Etsy and Target (but likely not from top sellers Amazon and Walmart) — and abroad. Temu in particular is targeting markets in Europe, Mexico, Japan and South Korea as its U.S. growth slows and potential new U.S. tariffs loom.

    "article_text": "Coca-Cola leads the global market, solidifying its status as the world's most purchased brand. Meanwhile, Red Bull and Sunsilk performed remarkablely in their respective categories. Coca-Cola's Household Penetration Growth With a staggering 8.3 billion purchases worldwide, Coca-Cola continues to be the most popular brand, a testament to its global impact and consumer appeal. Insights from Kantar reveal that Coca-Cola's household penetration, a key metric indicating the brand's reach, has experienced a robust growth of 2.6%, underscoring its ability to attract new consumers. The Brand Footprint report, a comprehensive study by Kantar, delves into consumer behavior across 62 markets, collectively representing 86% of the global GDP and 76% of the world's population. Consumer Spending Trends According to this year's report, the mean expenditure per household on food has surpassed $1,000 (€919.53), representing an almost 60% surge compared to the expenditure level documented ten years ago, in 2013. ESM - European Supermarket Magazine shares that consumer spending on name-brand products has experienced a notable surge, rising by 8.6 percent and reaching an average of $1,052 (€967.35) per customer, indicating robust growth in the market. Per Kantar's research, American consumers spent the most on packaged products, averaging $3,063 (€2816.52) per home. In contrast, Bangladeshi consumers spent the least, averaging less than $159 (€146.21) per household. As a coping mechanism for the increasing expense of living, consumers tended to indulge at home and buy high-end products, contributing to food inflation, which increased by an average of 4% during the year. When all of these indulgent purchases and high-end brand products are considered, the result is an increase in expenditure per item that is 6.7% higher on average. Red Bull and Sunsilk's Market Performance Red Bull has demonstrated its prowess as a fast-moving consumer goods brand, experiencing the highest rate of growth (17.8%) in terms of the number of times it has been purchased. This success is attributed to the brand's effective acquisition of new customers in key markets such as Brazil, mainland China, France, Germany, and the United States, solidifying its market dominance. In terms of consumer acquisition, Sunsilk has emerged as the most successful brand in other regions, as evidenced by over 26 million new households acquiring the brand as of 2023."

This surge, expected between Q2 2024 and the end of 2028, will see the completion of 88 new retail developments across the country, significantly outpacing the supply of the past decade, which totaled around 38 million square feet. This expansion will be concentrated in the top seven cities, which include Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata, and Chennai. This wave of new retail space marks a shift towards larger, more experiential retail centres. Modern shoppers' evolving preferences for unique and engaging shopping experiences are driving this trend. The average size of new retail developments is projected to increase by 30 per cent from the previous decade's average of 391,099 square feet to 507,341 square feet in the upcoming period. Dr Samantak Das, chief economist and head research & REIS, India, JLL, said, \"Out of the 88 upcoming retail developments in the next five years, there will be 12 large-sized projects encompassing area of at least 1 million square feet each. These projects will contribute a substantial portion, amounting to 37 per cent of the total supply expected until 2028.\" He added, \"This marks a notable increase in comparison to the previous decade, where retail centres of 1 million square feet and above accounted for just 27 per cent of completed supply. Furthermore, Delhi NCR will see two retail centres of over 2.5 million sq. ft each in the next 5 years.\" The growth in retail space is not just about size but also about quality and diversity. The increasing global travel and exposure of Indian consumers have heightened their demand for immersive retail experiences. Developers are responding by incorporating entertainment, leisure activities, and dining options into their projects, creating comprehensive destinations that cater to modern consumers' desires. 78 per cent of the upcoming retail supply will be lease-based, allowing developers greater control over tenant mix and property management, thus commanding higher rentals. This approach enables developers to curate a diverse and appealing mix of tenants aligned with their vision for each development. Rahul Arora, Head of Office Leasing Advisory and Retail Services, India, JLL, said, \"The existing retail stock, which stands at 89 million sq. ft, is expected to grow by 50 per cent and reach 134 million sq. ft by end-2028. Delhi NCR is expected to garner the highest share (43 per cent) in the supply in the next five years followed by Hyderabad with a share of 21 per cent and Chennai having a share of 13 per cent.\" He added, \"Retail assets remain an attractive investment avenue for large foreign institutional investors, who are increasingly opting for greenfield and brownfield development platforms. Notably, 16 per cent (7.2 million sq. ft) of the new supply is owned by institutional players.\" As of the first quarter of 2024, India's retail stock stood at approximately 89 million square feet. According to the Real Estate Intelligence Service (REIS), JLL Research and Retail, an aspect of this upcoming supply is the size of the developments. It is anticipated that 37 per cent of the new retail space will consist of large-scale projects, each with a gross leasable area of 1 million square feet or more.

    "article_text": "Getty Images Image for representation Reflecting the dynamic evolution of India 's retail sector, driven by increasing urbanization, rising consumer demand, and a robust economy, the completion of organized retail spaces is expected to surge significantly over the next five years. In response to the evolving preferences of modern shoppers seeking unique experiences, developers are also increasingly prioritizing the development of larger retail centres. The top seven Indian cities--Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata, Chennai--will add over 45 million sq ft of retail real estate through 88 new developments . This anticipated growth will outstrip the retail space supply from the past decade (2014-2023), which totaled around 38 million sq ft, showed data from JLL India. “The current retail stock of 89 million sq ft is projected to grow 50% to 134 million sq ft by end-2028. Retail assets remain an attractive investment avenue for large foreign institutional investors , who are increasingly opting for greenfield and brownfield development platforms. Notably 16% or 7.2 million sq ft of the new supply is owned by institutional players,” said Rahul Arora, head of office Leasing advisory and retail services, India, JLL. Majority or 78% of the upcoming retail supply of 45 million sq ft is lease-based that allows developers to have greater control over the quality of the tenant mix and day-to-day management of the property, thus enabling them to command higher rentals. As a result, they can curate a diverse mix of tenants that align with their vision for the development. Live Events “Strata sales of assets have been one of the causes of most grade C non-performing malls, leading developers to avoid this model now. Instead, developers prefer to retain control and operate the malls themselves, ensuring better decision-making and higher performance,\" said Pushpa Bector, Chairperson, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI). Over the past ten years, the average size of new retail supply was around 391,099 sq ft and this is expected to increase by 30% to reach 507,341 sq ft with the addition of new supply during until 2028. \"Of the 88 upcoming retail developments in the next five years, 12 will be large-sized, each with at least 1 million sq ft. These will account for 37% of the total supply expected by 2028, a notable increase from the previous decade's 27%,” said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head Research & REIS , India, JLL. The projected retail developments will be larger in size compared to those that became operational in the last decade. This signifies a notable trend in the retail market moving towards larger-sized experience-led developments. Increasing global travel and exposure has heightened shoppers' awareness, leading to a demand for unique and immersive retail experiences. Larger developments incorporating entertainment, leisure activities, and dining options are creating comprehensive destinations that cater to the modern consumer. Of the total expected addition of retail space, Delhi NCR is expected to garner the highest 43% share in the supply in the next five years followed by Hyderabad with a share of 21% and Chennai having a share of 13%.

This surge, expected between Q2 2024 and the end of 2028, will see the completion of 88 new retail developments across the country, significantly outpacing the supply of the past decade, which totaled around 38 million square feet. ANI Updated On Jun 3, 2024 at 01:10 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Mumbai: India is set to witness an unprecedented expansion in its retail sector, with projections indicating the addition of approximately 45 million square feet of retail space over the next five years, according to a recent report by JLL . This surge, expected between Q2 2024 and the end of 2028, will see the completion of 88 new retail developments across the country, significantly outpacing the supply of the past decade, which totaled around 38 million square feet. This expansion will be concentrated in the top seven cities, which include Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata, and Chennai. Advt This wave of new retail space marks a shift towards larger, more experiential retail centers Modern shoppers' evolving preferences for unique and engaging shopping experiences are driving this trend. The average size of new retail developments is projected to increase by 30 per cent from the previous decade's average of 391,099 square feet to 507,341 square feet in the upcoming period. Dr Samantak Das, chief economist and head research & REIS, India, JLL , said, \"Out of the 88 upcoming retail developments in the next five years, there will be 12 large-sized projects encompassing area of at least 1 million square feet each. These projects will contribute a substantial portion, amounting to 37 per cent of the total supply expected until 2028.\" He added, \"This marks a notable increase in comparison to the previous decade, where retail centres of 1 million square feet and above accounted for just 27 per cent of completed supply. Furthermore, Delhi NCR will see two retail centers of over 2.5 million sq. ft each in the next 5 years.\" The growth in retail space is not just about size but also about quality and diversity. The increasing global travel and exposure of Indian consumers have heightened their demand for immersive retail experiences. Developers are responding by incorporating entertainment , leisure activities, and dining options into their projects, creating comprehensive destinations that cater to modern consumers ' desires. Advt 78 per cent of the upcoming retail supply will be lease-based, allowing developers greater control over tenant mix and property management, thus commanding higher rentals. This approach enables developers to curate a diverse and appealing mix of tenants aligned with their vision for each development. Rahul Arora, Head of Office Leasing Advisory and Retail Services, India, JLL, said, \"The existing retail stock, which stands at 89 million sq. ft, is expected to grow by 50 per cent and reach 134 million sq. ft by end-2028. Delhi NCR is expected to garner the highest share (43 per cent) in the supply in the next five years followed by Hyderabad with a share of 21 per cent and Chennai having a share of 13 per cent.\" He added, \"Retail assets remain an attractive investment avenue for large foreign institutional investors, who are increasingly opting for greenfield and brownfield development platforms. Notably, 16 per cent (7.2 million sq. ft) of the new supply is owned by institutional players.\" As of the first quarter of 2024, India's retail stock stood at approximately 89 million square feet. According to the Real Estate Intelligence Service (REIS), JLL Research and Retail, an aspect of this upcoming supply is the size of the developments. It is anticipated that 37 per cent of the new retail space will consist of large-scale projects, each with a gross leasable area of 1 million square feet or more.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Mon, Jun 3, 2024 · 11:22 AM THE main drivers behind the remarkably resilient American consumer are losing steam at the same time, suggesting a recent pullback in household demand may be more than just a one-off. Real disposable incomes have risen only modestly over the past year. The saving rate now stands at a 16-month low as households have mostly exhausted the extra pile of cash they squirrelled away during the pandemic. In turn, many Americans are increasingly relying on credit cards and other sources of financing to support their spending. These factors help explain why real spending – which excludes the impact from inflation – fell in April, with consumers shelling out less on cars, restaurants and recreational activities. With the job market also cooling, companies such as Best Buy have noticed a change in recent months as shoppers switch to cheaper brands. “Slower labour market momentum will continue to limit income growth and push more families to exercise spending restraint amid reduced savings buffers and higher debt burdens,” Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, said on Friday (May 31). “Factoring increased price sensitivity, household spending momentum will gradually cool.” The dip in April consumer spending reported on Friday and the recent downward revision to the government’s estimate for gross domestic product in the first quarter provide fairly convincing evidence the US economy is coming off the surprisingly strong pace it set in 2023. The latest data are also likely to reassure officials at the Federal Reserve, where a debate has emerged in recent weeks over whether their policy rate – sitting at its highest level in more than 20 years – was restraining the economy as much as they had expected it would. The debate sprang from the strength exhibited by the US consumer over the past couple years. While that helped the US economy repeatedly defied recession calls, it puzzled Wall Street economists and Fed officials alike. Robust labour demand, pandemic-era savings and sizeable pay gains all contributed to that. But as inflation proves sticky, forcing the Fed to keep borrowing costs high, the US economy is finally starting to slow. Demand for workers has come down from its pandemic peaks, meaning employers are not hiking pay as quickly anymore. Wages and salaries advanced 0.2 per cent in April, the smallest gain in five months, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report showed. Recent company earnings indicated that consumers have increasingly been prioritising staples over large discretionary items. And higher-income consumers are trading down or hunting for deals, which helped boost sales at Walmart and discount retailer Dollar General. SEE ALSO US inflation rises in line with expectations in April US pending home sales suffer largest drop in three years US economic growth revised lower for Q1; weekly jobless claims edge up Views on US economy ‘more pessimistic’ as uncertainty grows: Fed More Jobs report Consumers are making “tough choices with their budgets”, Best Buy chief executive officer Corie Barry said on the first-quarter earnings call. The executive pointed to changes in the macroeconomic environment since the electronic retailer’s last quarterly report. “Three months ago, there were several indicators showing some favorability, including decreasing inflation, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound,” Barry said. “Since then, inflation is still high, mortgage rates are high and consumer confidence scores are trending lower.” A fresh government jobs report, due on Friday, will offer more insights into the direction of the labour market. Fed policymakers will pay close attention to those numbers as they continue their quest to tame inflation without breaking the economy. From that perspective, April’s decline in consumer spending likely contributed to the welcomed pullback in inflation. Yet it also may raise the question of how long the economy can hold up. “Fed officials will view today’s report as showing some cooling in consumer spending which points to less inflationary pressure,” Citigroup economists Andrew Hollenhorst and Veronica Clark wrote after the PCE report on Friday. “Our view of the US economy is not as optimistic.” BLOOMBERG Decoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

    "article_text": "Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve is stuck in a self-defeating paradox that makes cutting rates more difficult, economist warns Fortune · Kent Nishimura—Getty Images Jason Ma June 1, 2024 3 min read ^GSPC The Federal Reserve has talked financial markets into creating an easier environment, which paradoxically makes lowering rates a more difficult task for the central bank, a top economist said. The Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index indicates that the availability and cost of credit across money, bond, and equity markets are significantly more favorable today than when the Fed began raising rates in March 2022, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk. That's due to the central bank's pivot in November, when Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that inflation was cooling enough to halt rate hikes and start thinking about when rate cuts could begin. Wall Street interpreted the comments, incorrectly as it turned out, to mean easing would be imminent and that as many as six cuts would happen in 2024, sparking a massive stock market rally. In a blog post on Wednesday, Sløk estimated that the S&P 500 stock index has added $9 trillion in market cap since then and compared it to the $19 trillion in consumer spending last year. \"In other words, in a few months, the household sector has experienced a windfall gain corresponding to about 50% of last year’s consumer spending!\" he wrote. Meanwhile, the federal government has been spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure, green-energy initiatives, and semiconductor production capacity. As a result, the economy has remained strong as this fiscal stimulus continues to fuel growth while easier financial conditions offset Fed rate hikes, Sløk noted. In fact, the economy was so strong earlier this year that inflation readings came in above forecasts and showed signs of reaccelerating. That forced Powell to warn that rates could stay high for \" as long as needed \" because inflation appeared to be taking longer than anticipated to reach the Fed's 2% target. Still, he later acknowledged that further rate increases were unlikely and reaffirmed that the Fed's next move—whenever that will be—is likely a rate cut. And that's precisely the mistake Powell is making, in Sløk's view. \"Looking ahead, with the stock market hitting fresh all-time highs and fiscal policy still supportive, the expectation in markets should be that the economy will continue to accelerate over the coming quarters,\" he wrote. \"You can call this the Fed Cut Reflexivity Paradox: The more the Fed insists that the next move in interest rates is a cut, the more financial conditions will ease, making it more difficult for the Fed to cut.\" To be sure, GDP growth slowed in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, and was revised down to an annualized rate of 1.3% from a prior reading of 1.6%. The latest report also showed that fiscal stimulus was having a smaller effect. Story Continues But consumer spending on services remained strong, and more recent data on jobless claims showed the labor market continues to hold up. Meanwhile, minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting revealed that the economy's resilience in the face of rates at 23-year highs had prompted some officials to wonder whether all their tightening was exerting enough pressure on growth. High interest rates “may be having smaller effects than in the past,” the minutes said.

    "article_text": "US inflation up moderately in April, consumer spending weakens Business Business US inflation up moderately in April, consumer spending weakens Close Data provides little clarity whether Federal Reserve will start US rate cuts in September Follow on Updated On: Sat, 01 Jun 2024 11:05:41 PKT WASHINGTON (Reuters) – US inflation tracked sideways in April and consumer spending weakened, mixed signals for the Federal Reserve that provided little clarity on whether the central bank will be able to begin cutting US interest rates in September. The data suggested the elevated pace of price increases could last longer than expected but also the prospect that more tepid consumer spending may keep a lid on prices increases in the months ahead. \"People have been pinched for a while, and it's likely starting to show ... This cooling is encouraging for slower inflation in the coming months,\" said Elizabeth Renter, a senior economist at NerdWallet. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3 per cent last month, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday, matching the unrevised gain in March. In the 12 months through April, the PCE price index rose 2.7pc after advancing at the same pace in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it would climb 0.3pc on the month and 2.7pc on a year-on-year basis. The PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the US central bank for its 2pc target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2pc over time are needed to bring inflation back to target. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased by 0.2pc in April after a downwardly revised 0.7pc rise in March. Revised gross domestic product data released on Thursday showed consumer spending moderating to a 2.0pc pace in the first quarter from the brisk 3.3pc pace in the October-December period. Yields on US Treasury securities fell to their lowest levels in about two weeks following the release of the inflation report on Friday, while stocks reversed early gains and slid for a third consecutive day. The dollar was broadly weaker. Traders of futures tied to the Fed policy rate added to bets of roughly even odds that the central bank will begin to cut rates in September and boosted the odds of a second rate cut in December to about the same probability. Goods prices increased 0.2pc in April after edging up 0.1pc in the prior month, the PCE report showed. Services prices rose 0.3pc, down from 0.4pc in March. Housing and utilities remained the largest contributors to last month's increase. Energy prices rose 1.2pc and food prices decreased 0.2pc. The Fed has kept its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25pc-5.50pc range for the past 10 months, having been stung by several stronger-than-expected inflation and labour market readings this year after more encouraging data in the fourth quarter of last year. While inflation still remains sticky, job gains in April were at the lowest level in six months. REAL SPENDING FALLS The Fed has raised borrowing costs by 525 basis points since March 2022 in a bid to cool demand across the economy. Financial markets initially expected the first rate cut to come in March, which then got pushed to June and now to September. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index increased 0.2pc in April after rising 0.3pc in March. Core inflation increased 2.8pc on a year-on-year basis in April, matching March's advance. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing rose 0.3pc after a 0.4pc gain in March. Policymakers are closely monitoring the \"super core\" inflation to gauge their progress in fighting inflation. Inflation-adjusted personal spending declined 0.1pc in April, after an increase of 0.4pc in March. That reflected a 0.4pc decrease in real goods spending in April, down sharply from a 0.9pc increase in March, and a 0.1pc rise in real services spending, down from a 0.2pc increase in the prior month. \"We are in a be-careful-what-you-wish-for moment,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, about the pullback in consumer spending and its potential to lead to lower inflation. \"If ... the Fed is able to cut slowly as a result, then that will be good for markets. However, if consumer spending – and the economy – slows too quickly, then corporate profits and stock prices will go down much more quickly than the Fed will be able to cut rates.\""

    "article_text": "Get 100% ad-free experience Q1 GDP Revised Down, But Q2 Nowcasts See Firmer Growth By James Picerno Market Overview Published 05/31/2024, 07:26 AM Q1 GDP Revised Down, But Q2 Nowcasts See Firmer Growth View all comments (0) 0 James Picerno Articles ( 4141 ) | My Homepage Follow US economic growth rose a modest 1.3% in the first quarter, a softer increase vs. the government’s initial 1.6% estimate. The revised data reflects a sluggish pace of growth and the second straight quarterly downshift. But the current nowcast for Q2 suggests that output will stabilize if not strengthen, based on the median for a set of estimates compiled by CapitalSpectator.com. US economic activity is expected to increase 2.0% in the April-through-June period, according to the median nowcast. If correct, the advance will mark a solid rebound in growth over Q1’s 1.3% rise and the first quarterly acceleration since Q3 2023. Today’s revised median Q2 nowcast is in line with recent estimates. More than a week ago, for instance, we reported a median nowcast of 1.9% . As for Q1’s weaker print, the key factor is related to a downside revision in consumer spending, notes Wells Fargo’s economics team: In the initial estimate, goods outlays were reported to have contracted at a scant 0.4% annualized rate. All the weakness in the initial estimate was on the durable goods side with non-durable good spending flat. Today’s revisions marked down those spending estimates significantly. Goods spending is now estimated to have contracted at an 1.9% annualized rate including a 4.1% contraction in durable goods outlays and a 0.6% annualized drop in non-durable goods spending. These revisions are consistent with downward revisions to Q1 retail sales, and suggests we’ll see some revision to monthly durable goods spending. Recent data has highlighted that consumer spending has been softening. Retail sales in April, for example, were flat after two straight solid monthly gains. Given that consumer spending accounts for about 70% of US economic activity, the weak retail sales data raises questions about the outlook for the remainder of Q2. All of this goes back to the lagged effects of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes over the past two years. “The impact of the Fed’s tight interest rate policy is clearly visible in the first quarter GDP report,” says Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica. For the moment, it’s not obvious that the weaker Q1 data will spill over into Q2, or so today’s GDP nowcast suggests. The incoming data for May may determine if the relatively upbeat nowcasts for the current quarter are overly optimistic.

    "article_text": "Brandon Bell / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways A report on consumer spending and inflation showed incomes aren't keeping up with prices, as consumers lost buying power in April. Consumer spending decelerated, suggesting people are cutting back as prices pressure household budgets. Businesses may become reluctant to raise prices, as their customers become more budget-conscious, economists said. Just as it’s heating up outside, the economy seems to be cooling off. Inflation, spending, and income all downshifted in April, a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Friday. If Friday’s report is the beginning of a trend, the economy could be entering a new phase, one in which less money changes hands. Households—whose budgets have been pressured by elevated inflation, high interest rates for all kinds of loans and a job market where raises are becoming harder to get—may be forced to cut back their spending. In turn, merchants could face pressure to keep prices in check . In other words, the economy may be meaningfully slowing down, just as officials at the Federal Reserve hope to accomplish with their campaign of anti-inflation interest rate hikes . “Rapidly rising prices in recent months have depleted personal savings, and a slowing labor market may finally be taking a toll on some consumers’ willingness and ability to spend,” Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a commentary. Consumers Could Be Slowing Their Spending Pace The details of the report supported the idea that consumer spending, the most important part of the economy, could be running out of steam after a long period of rapid growth . Spending only increased 0.2% in April after jumping 0.7% in March and actually fell 0.1% after adjusting for inflation. Inflation-adjusted after-tax income also fell 0.1%, the fourth decline in the last 12 months. “Consumer spending in the first month of the new quarter slowed as real disposable incomes fell,” Jeffrey Roach, Chief Economist for LPL Financial, wrote in a commentary. “Businesses need to prepare for an environment where consumers are not splurging like they were last year.” It wasn't just Friday's report that hinted at a downshift in consumer spending. The measure of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was revised Thursday, showing consumer spending decelerated . \"On the one hand, the slowing GDP and slowing personal consumption are a sign that the economic expansion is cooling, which could be a concern for companies and stock market investors,\" wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance Thursday. \"But on the other hand, slowing consumption and economic growth could be just the news we need to see in order for the rate of inflation to keep coming down and allow the Fed to reduce interest rates after all.\" UPDATE—June 2, 2024: This article has been updated with a new image.

WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation tracked sideways in April and consumer spending weakened, mixed signals for the Federal Reserve that provided little clarity on whether the U.S. central bank will be able to begin cutting interest rates in September. The data suggested the elevated pace of price increases could last longer than expected but also the prospect that more tepid consumer spending may keep a lid on price increases in the months ahead. \"People have been pinched for a while, and it's likely starting to show ... This cooling is encouraging for slower inflation in the coming months,\" said Elizabeth Renter, a senior economist at NerdWallet. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 0.3% last month, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday, matching the unrevised gain in March. In the 12 months through April, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.7% after advancing at the same pace in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it would climb 0.3% on the month and 2.7% on a year-on-year basis. The consumption price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank for its 2% target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are needed to bring inflation back to target. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased by 0.2% in April after a downwardly revised 0.7% rise in March. Revised gross domestic product data released on Thursday showed consumer spending moderating to a 2.0% pace in the first quarter from the brisk 3.3% pace in the October-December period. Yields on U.S. Treasury securities fell to their lowest levels in about two weeks following the release of the inflation report on Friday, while stocks reversed early gains and slid for a third consecutive day. The dollar was broadly weaker. Traders of futures tied to the Fed policy rate added to bets of roughly even odds that the central bank will begin to cut rates in September and boosted the odds of a second rate cut in December to about the same probability. Goods prices increased 0.2% in April after edging up 0.1% in the prior month, the consumption report showed. Services prices rose 0.3%, down from 0.4% in March. Housing and utilities remained the largest contributors to last month's increase. Energy prices rose 1.2% and food prices decreased 0.2%. The Fed has kept its benchmark policy rate in the 5.25% to 5.50% range for the past 10 months, having been stung by several stronger-than-expected inflation and labor market readings this year after more encouraging data in the fourth quarter of last year. While inflation remains sticky, job gains in April were at the lowest level in six months. Real spending falls The Fed has raised borrowing costs by 525 basis points since March 2022 in a bid to cool demand across the economy. Financial markets initially expected the first rate cut to come in March, which then got pushed to June and now to September. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the consumption price index increased 0.2% in April after rising 0.3% in March. Core inflation increased 2.8% on a year-on-year basis in April, matching March's advance. Consumer inflation, excluding energy and housing, rose 0.3% after a 0.4% gain in March. Policymakers are closely monitoring the \"super core\" inflation to gauge their progress in fighting inflation. Inflation-adjusted personal spending declined 0.1% in April, after an increase of 0.4% in March. That reflected a 0.4% decrease in real goods spending in April, down sharply from a 0.9% increase in March, and a 0.1% rise in real services spending, down from a 0.2% increase in the prior month. \"We are in a be-careful-what-you-wish-for moment,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, about the pullback in consumer spending and its potential to lead to lower inflation. \"If ... the Fed is able to cut slowly as a result, then that will be good for markets. However, if consumer spending — and the economy — slows too quickly, then corporate profits and stock prices will go down much more quickly than the Fed will be able to cut rates.\" × Most recent U.S. stories US airlines cancel 1,200 flights Tuesday as government shutdown continues Supreme Court extends pause on order requiring Trump to fully fund food aid Praise and reform: Utah political leaders react to passage of shutdown-ending legislation Related topics Inflation Business U.S. Lindsay Dunsmuir More stories you may be interested in House returns to Washington for vote to end government shutdown Will there be a peace prize for Trump after all?

The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month. This revision was in line with analysts' expectations, even as both growth numbers mark a significant deceleration from the 3.4 percent expansion in the final quarter of 2023. While President Joe Biden has maintained that the US economy remains robust, he has been struggling to convince voters of his performance on the economic front ahead of November's presidential election. A cooling economy could prove to be another challenge, though analysts say there is underlying strength for now. \"The update primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending,\" the Commerce Department said of Thursday's revision. But business investment expanded at a stronger pace while residential investment accelerated more than estimated, added Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist of High Frequency Economics, in a note. Overall, GDP growth in the first quarter was supported by consumer spending, business investment and government spending, despite decelerations in some of these areas, the Commerce Department said. - 'Underlying momentum' - \"The weaker headline growth statistic looks discouraging, but it belies solid underlying momentum as the economy's core,\" said Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin in a note. Slower GDP growth could impact views on the Biden administration but Klachkin told AFP that consumers are likely to focus more on jobs and inflation data. \"Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion,\" he said. This would be good news for observers looking to a \"soft landing\" for the economy, meaning a situation where inflation eases without a painful downturn. There remain uncertainties in the outlook ahead, however, according to Farooqi. The Federal Reserve could delay starting interest rate cuts as it tries to stamp out stubborn inflation -- and this could weigh on growth in the coming quarters. \"But a weaker growth path that leads to a Fed pivot to lower rates over time should be supportive of households and businesses,\" she added. The US economy has been resilient in the face of higher interest rates, with unemployment remaining low and the job market stronger than expected. This, in turn, has allowed people to continue spending. But with households depleting savings from the pandemic and interest rates still elevated, analysts generally expect consumption to pull back.

Δ From hardware to software, both consumers and small to medium-sized businesses are pulling back on their purchases, Moynihan said at a New York financial conference, according to a Thursday (May 30) CNBC report . “Both of our customer bases that have a lot to do with how the American economy runs are saying, ‘You know what? I’m being careful, slowing things down,’” Moynihan said, referring to consumers and businesses, according to the report. Consumer spending, particularly through card payments, checks and ATM withdrawals, only grew 3.5% this year, compared to last May’s 10% growth, Moynihan noted, adding that the pullback is consistent with the “very low growth” environment of the period from 2016 through 2018. Likewise, business owners continue to be careful with their spending. Business owners are saying, “‘I still feel good about my overall business, but I’m not hiring as much. I’m not buying equipment as fast. I’m not making software purchases as fast,’” Moynihan said, according to the report. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The CEO’s comments are in line with recent data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which also suggested that consumers are cutting back on their spending. The bureau’s Thursday news release noted a “downward revision” for consumer spending. Personal consumption still grew, but at 2%, from the initial 2.5% reading. The bureau also found that prices continued to rise, as the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 3.4% in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. Retailers are taking notice of consumer pullback. Target and Walmart recently announced price cuts across household staples in a bid to win market share as consumers increasingly seek deals to stretch their dollars. “What’s interesting is [the price cuts are] likely to expand to the rest of retail, given Walmart and Target set the tone on pricing,” Joe Feldman , an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group , told the Financial Times, PYMNTS reported May 22.

    "article_text": "Business Automotive Economy Energy Finance Tourism Tech Defense Transportation News Analysis Curbed by consumers, US' Q1 economic growth revised down by Associated Press WASHINGTON May 30, 2024 - 3:48 pm GMT+3 Pedestrians walk on the street in Times Square in midtown Manhattan, New York City, U.S., Jan. 8, 2024. (Reuters Photo) by Associated Press May 30, 2024 3:48 pm The U.S. economy grew at a sluggish 1.3% annual rate from January through March, the government said Thursday, in a downgrade from its earlier estimate, depicting that consumer spending rose but at a slower pace than previously thought. The Commerce Department had previously estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) – the total output of goods and services – expanded at a 1.6% rate last quarter. The first quarter's GDP growth marked a sharp slowdown from the vigorous 3.4% rate in the final three months of 2023. But last quarter's pullback was due mainly to two factors – a surge in imports and a reduction in business inventories – that tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Thursday's report showed that imports subtracted more than 1 percentage point from last quarter's growth. A reduction in business inventories took off nearly half a percentage point. Consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of economic growth, rose at a 2% annual rate, down from 2.5% in the first estimate and from 3%-plus rates in the previous two quarters. Spending on goods such as appliances and furniture fell at a 1.9% annual pace, the biggest such quarterly drop since 2021. But services spending rose at a healthy 3.9% clip, the most since mid-2021. The U.S. economy has shown surprising durability since the Federal Reserve (Fed) started jacking up interest rates more than two years ago in its drive to tame the worst outbreak of inflation in four decades. The much higher borrowing costs that resulted were expected to trigger a recession. However, the economy has kept growing, and employers have kept hiring. shortlink copied Last Update: May 30, 2024 7:33 pm KEYWORDS us economy united states gdp data growth economy The Daily Sabah Newsletter Keep up to date with what’s happening in Turkey, it’s region and the world.

Δ And in the newest reading of how U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) fared in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicated that the slowdown was more pronounced than initially thought, coming in at 1.3%, where that annualized pace had been calculated at 1.6%. Are Consumers Flagging? The key headwind: Consumer momentum may be waning. The Bureau’s Thursday (May 30) news release noted the “downward revision” to consumer spending, which at this moment seems pronounced. Personal consumption still grew, but at 2%, from the initial 2.5% reading. “The increase in consumer spending reflected an increase in services that was partly offset by a decrease in goods,” per the release. In the meantime, the prices paid continued to tick higher, as the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.4% in the first, compared with an increase of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The news of the shift in spending from goods to services, we note, comes as companies such as Walmart and Target have been cutting prices on thousands of staples, such as household supplies and groceries. In the first quarter of this year, personal saving was $755.7 billion in the first quarter, compared with $815.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The personal saving rate — personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income — was 3.6% in the first quarter, compared with 4% in the fourth quarter. Keeping an Eye on Nonessential Spending We are, of course, on the cusp of the end of the second quarter, so the first-quarter analysis is decidedly backward looking. Yet the downward revisions hint that the key engine of the U.S. economy — consumer spending — is volatile at best, perhaps flagging at worst. Friday will give some further consideration of where things stand, with the release of April data. PYMNTS Intelligence data suggest that there’s a recalibration of what consumers are spending — and where. As roughly 60% of consumers live paycheck to paycheck, 20% of respondents have indicated nonessential spending has contributed to financial stress and instability. About 20% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers told PYMNTS they expected savings to decrease this year (which dovetails with the latest readings on declining savings rates). Other data released, as an advance reading from the U.S. Census Bureau on Thursday, show that wholesale inventories were up 0.2% in April vs. March’s levels. Retail inventories were up 0.7% over the same timeframe. The wholesale data, as expectations had been for a flat reading, may indicate that there are more “goods in the channel” that are needed on the shelves … and the price cuts by Target, Walmart and other retailers may be more widespread in the coming months.

Gross domestic product rose 1.3% annualized in the first three months of the year, below the previous estimate of 1.6%, Bureau of Economic Analysis figures published Thursday showed. The economy’s main growth engine — personal spending — advanced 2.0%, versus the previous estimate of 2.5%. The numbers underscore a loss of momentum to start 2024 after continual upside surprises in 2023. High interest rates, waning pandemic-era savings and slower income growth are some of the key factors weighing on American households and businesses. Consumer spending was marked down as outlays for goods — particularly autos — were much softer. Federal government spending slowed, while imports picked up compared to the first estimate. Net exports subtracted from growth for the first time in two years. The downward revision to consumer spending was partially offset by stronger business and residential investment. A key measure of underlying domestic demand known as final sales to private domestic purchasers rose 2.8%, versus the initially reported 3.1% increase. Economists have pointed to the strength in this metric as reason to believe that demand is still strong, even if the headline GDP figure looks weak by comparison. “Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion . We anticipate continued GDP gains this year and a healthy advance in 2024 overall,” Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin said in a note. “Some warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.” Metric Revision Initial Estimate GDP +1.3% +1.6% Consumer spending +2.0% +2.5% Nonresidential investment +3.3% +2.9% Residential investment +15.4% +13.9% Government spending +1.3% +1.2% Alongside its second estimate of GDP, the BEA also publishes data on gross domestic income, its other main measure of economic activity. GDI rose 1.5% in the first quarter, according to the report. GDP measures spending on goods and services, whereas GDI measures income generated and costs incurred from producing those same goods and services. The GDI data include figures on corporate profits. In the first quarter, adjusted pre-tax profits fell 0.6%, the first decline in a year. After-tax profits as a share of gross value added for non-financial corporations, a measure of aggregate profit margins, were little changed at 15.2%. On the inflation front, the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric — the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose at a 3.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, slightly down from the initial projection. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE gauge rose 3.6%, versus 3.7% in the previous estimate. Growth in disposable personal income was marked up to 1.9% versus 1.1% initially. That may bode well for consumer spending and GDP going forward. Economists are looking ahead to the release of monthly PCE data for April, due Friday from the BEA, after reports published earlier this month showed a stalling in growth of retail sales and a slower pace of increase in consumer prices to start the second quarter. Fresh merchandise trade figures for April suggest little room for improvement in the second quarter. Separate data out Thursday showed the gap in goods trade last month widened to the largest since May 2022. Meantime, initial applications for unemployment benefits were little changed in the latest week at low levels.

    "article_text": "May 30 (UPI) -- Real U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.3% in the first quarter, according to a second estimate Thursday from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The figures reported Thursday were based on more complete data than the advance estimate in April which showed a 1.6% increase in GDP. The BEA said the updated estimate \"primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending.\" \" The increase in real GDP primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment. \" The BEA said in a statement. \"Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.\" Related Stocks plummet on report U.S. GDP growth slowed to 1.6% in first quarter U.S. economy grew more than first reported in 2023 fourth quarter Though U.S. economy shows signs of strength, poll shows third of Americans rate it as poor The BEA said the deceleration in the first quarter real GDP \"primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending and a downturn in federal government spending.\" Current dollar GDP increased 4.3% at an annual rate. Personal income was up, with current dollar income up $404.4 billion in the first quarter. Disposable income also increased by $266.7 billion or 5.3% in the first quarter. The first quarter personal savings rate was 3.8%, or $796.6 billion. Real gross domestic income was up 1.5% for the quarter compared with 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. In April stock prices slid on BEA's GDP report that showed an annual rate of 1.6%. Dow Jones economists had expected a 2.4% annual increase. The fourth quarter 2023 GDP was stronger than expected. As for inflation measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, the BEA said, \"The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3% in the first quarter, a downward revision of 0.1% from the previous estimate. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.3% percent, a downward revision of 0.1%.\" Real gross domestic income increased by 1.5% in the first quarter, compared with a 3.6% increase in the fourth quarter of 2023. Corporate production profits, with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, decreased by $21.1 billion in the first quarter. Financial corporation profits were up $73.7 billion while non-financial corporate profits dropped by $114.1 billion, according to the BEA."

He attributed some of investors' skepticism to consumers' unfamiliarity with Nvidia's products and what exactly the company does. If Nvidia keeps up its current growth pace, Cramer said it could soar past Apple and overtake Microsoft soon. Stream Philadelphia News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC10. WATCH HERE CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday reviewed the rise of several market-leading giants. He suggested Nvidia could soon surpass Microsoft 's market capitalization but explained why some on Wall Street are suspicious of the artificial intelligence darling's swift rise to the top. \"Somehow, to so many, it just doesn't seem right that a company they rarely interact with could be this big. To me? It's as right as when Apple dethroned Exxon ,\" he said. \"I say all that happened is that Nvidia, at the far turn, was nowhere to be seen, but as we got to the stretch, it made its move. It shocked us.\" He attributed some investor suspicions to consumers' unfamiliarity with Nvidia's products and what exactly the company does. Much of the chipmaker's fame is derived from the enterprise sector, or with \"hard-core gamers\" on the consumer side, he said. Cramer noted that investors are comfortable with companies that can be more easily identified with the zeitgeist. For example, Apple's iPhone is ubiquitous, as is Microsoft Windows, while Amazon is a consumer economy giant and children are familiar with Alphabet 's Google. He also noted that Berkshire Hathaway 's Warren Buffett is perhaps the greatest and most well-known name in finance. At around $3.2 trillion, Microsoft is the biggest company on the market, followed by Apple at about $2.9 trillion. Nvidia is currently at roughly $2.8 trillion. \"Is a photo finish in the cards? No. Because, in the end, the race is eternal,\" he said. \"And for all we know Nvidia, not Apple, not Microsoft, is Secretariat, the greatest of them all.\" Nvidia declined to comment.

    "article_text": "Europe The Kremlin is all-in on war in Ukraine. That includes transforming Russia’s economy. | Sergei Bobylyov/Sputnik/Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with officials and heads of the country's military industrial sector outside Moscow, May 25, 2024. Loading... By Fred Weir Special correspondent May 29, 2024, 4:55 p.m. ET | Moscow Amid its grinding war of attrition and economic mobilization against Ukraine, Russia is changing fast. As the Defense Ministry spends ever-increasing amounts of money to procure the equipment it needs and to recruit more soldiers, the country’s business environment and economic geography are being reshaped. And the military-industrial complex, which was vastly downsized in post-Soviet years, is reviving quickly. Confounding observers in many ways , Russia’s war economy, despite Western sanctions, is now back at a level that outproduces the entire West in some key military goods. And the Kremlin appears to be committed to a war economy approach for the long haul, as suggested by the recent reshuffling of Defense Ministry leadership. Why We Wrote This Despite an unprecedented array of Western sanctions, Russia has persevered, even prospered. Now the Kremlin appears to be consolidating its economy fully toward the waging of war in Ukraine. Whether such an economic policy is viable is in debate. Optimists say the rapid economic development is economically positive on balance, or at least that Russia can sustain high levels of military spending for the foreseeable future. Pessimists argue that the Kremlin is building a permanent war economy, much like the one that strangled the Soviet Union , and that hopes of building a prosperous consumer economy are fast vanishing. But for the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears all in. Igor Palkin/Russian Orthodox Church Press Service/AP Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov attends the Main Cathedral of Russian Armed Forces in Alabino, Russia, May 26, 2024. “We have an overheating economy, and it’s changing in some ways. But for now it seems manageable,” says Alexei Vedev, an economist with the Gaidar Institute in Moscow. “If the war ends, as we all hope it will, it will be necessary to reverse some of the structural changes that are happening. We’ll have to seriously tackle inflation. And Russia needs sources of foreign investment,” which have largely dried up with the exodus of Western businesses from Russia. Russia’s war engine Many Western observers are belatedly acknowledging that Russia is politically consolidated and unexpectedly resistant to the most intense barrage of sanctions in history. And even while ostracized by the West and its friends, Russia appears to have strengthened its relations with China and many important countries of the Global South . But most surprising has been the Russian economy’s capacity to field and equip a growing army amid a long, grinding war of attrition, while continuing to provide stable living standards for the population. Though Russia’s gross domestic product shrank by 1.2% in 2022, it grew by 3.6% the next year and is expected to expand as much as 5% this year. Experts say that much of that growth is being driven by vastly increased military expenditures, which have ballooned from about $75 billion before the war to almost $400 billion this year. Thanks to its ability to continue exporting energy and raw materials, Russia can afford it. The biggest shock, for many observers, has been the ability of Russia’s economy to rapidly ramp up war production to levels unseen since the Cold War. As recently as five years ago, Russian military spending was actually falling , but Mr. Putin recently said it’s now around 8% of GDP and climbing. Ekaterina Shtukina/Sputnik/AP Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev (center) watches an antidrone rifle during a visit to the Pesochnensky training ground near Sertolovo, Russia, May 27, 2024. While that has produced inflation of almost 8% and interest rates of up to 20%, it’s also churning out the arms, materiel, and munitions sufficient to keep the Russian armies pressing forward in Ukraine. For example, Russian industry now produces three times more artillery shells than Europe and the United States combined, according to a recent report . An adaptive economy To manage the tsunami of new money into Russia’s military machine, Mr. Putin recently replaced his longtime loyal defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, with an economist, Andrei Belousov. Mr. Belousov is reputedly highly competent in matters of finance, but has no known military background. Analysts say that Mr. Belousov will attempt to implement a policy resembling U.S.-style “military Keynesianism,” in which industry is made to focus on war priorities – not through Soviet-style central planning and command, but with the incentive of lucrative state contracts. His difficult task will be to streamline the process of procurement, keep costs down, and induce business to innovate and react quickly to changing battlefield requirements. “Belousov supports the idea that the state has to invest into technological development and participate in the modernization of industry,” says Natalya Zubarevich, an economic geographer at Moscow State University. “The Ministry of Defense has lots of money, but it is spent in strange ways. To make all that money work more effectively, to optimize it, is a very big job.” According to Ms. Zubarevich, some industrial and mining regions that support war production are thriving, while others that rely on exports like coal and gas are hurting while they struggle with disruptions from sanctions. On the whole, because of industrial growth and an acute labor shortage, wages are rising rapidly. “The population’s incomes were up 16.5% as of January this year,” she says. “Effective demand is up, and new business opportunities are opening up. A lot of wealthy Russians are locked out of the West and have no way to get their money out. So they are investing in Russia. On the whole, for now, the Russian economy seems to be adapting.” Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP A visitor walks past a former Levi's boutique inside the GUM department store in Moscow, March 6, 2024. The former Soviet Union spent up to 20% of GDP on the military over a long period. Russian analysts say the country might be able to spend 10% for a few years without becoming bogged down. “Russia is a market economy, and it’s much more flexible and adaptable than the Soviet one,” says Ms. Zubarevich. Societal changes to come? Russia’s ability to recruit up to 30,000 soldiers monthly using economic inducements has enabled it to avoid another forced mobilization like 2022’s emergency drive , which led to serious public disruptions. It also portends lasting social changes. Russia has a preexisting culture of honoring war veterans, and a new generation of men who served in Ukraine is already being glorified . When the war ends and all these men return to civilian life, they will be expecting a reward. “At the beginning, participants of the special military operation were being paid about 200,000 rubles [about $2,200], but now payments have grown up to as much as 1 million [about $11,000],” says Ms. Zubarevich. “They and their families are the beneficiaries of this situation,” which has stimulated a housing boom in some regions. “What happens when they return home, what will their future status be? I do not know.” Andrei Movchan, a Russian financier and former director of the Moscow Carnegie Center who now lives in Britain, says the war has been beneficial for Mr. Putin’s regime, enabling it to consolidate power, eliminate opposition, isolate Russia from the West, and create short-term economic stimulus. But, he says, the long-term price tag will keep growing. “This situation reminds us of the processes in the Soviet economy in the late ’60s onward, when an increasing share of resources was spent on military purposes, which were given priority over consumer production,” he says. “We are seeing Russia take that road once again.” You've read of free articles.

The forthcoming edition of the Breeders' Cup World Championships, consisting of 14 Championship races worth $33 million in purses and awards, will be staged later this year (November 1-2) at beautiful Del Mar Thoroughbred Club in Southern California, providing a flagship finale to the flat and dirt racing calendar, including the season-defining $7 million Longines Breeders' Cup Classic (G1).

    "article_text": "One month is an eternity in the world of interest rate commentary. On 24 April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published the March quarter consumer price index (CPI), which showed that CPI inflation was tracking a little higher than economists and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expected. This sparked a procession of economists predicting that the RBA would raise interest rates soon. Advertisement Warren Hogan of Judo Bank was the most hawkish, forecasting three interest rate hikes by the end of 2024. Hogan subsequently backtracked on his forecast. Last week, he told Sky News that the RBA was unlikely to hike rates again due to soft consumer spending: “Bracket creep alone has taken $41 billion out of household budgets in the last two years, that’s a pressure that’s there, so even though the RBA hasn’t raised rates this year, and only raised them once this financial year, we can still see the soft retail spending because of that bracket creep”. Advertisement “They’re not going to raise rates while the consumer’s this week even if employment remains strong and even if inflation is just bouncing around at the top of that sort of 3% to 4% level”. Hogan also noted on Twitter (X) that discussions with businesses across the country revealed that consumer spending “stepped down big time from mid-April” . Tuesday’s retail sales data for April from the ABS confirmed Hogan’s findings, with annual retail sales growth collapsing to only 1.3% – the weakest annual result in at least three decades outside of the pandemic: Advertisement Adjusting for CPI inflation and population growth, retail sales have collapsed: Source: Shane Oliver (AMP) Perma-hawk Terry McCrann also noted that this level of retail sales would traditionally have forced the RBA to cut rates, although the massive stimulus handed out over the pandemic means these are not “normal times”: Advertisement “When allowance is made for inflation, retail sales have fallen by around 3-4% over the past year”. “When further allowance is made for our extraordinary immigration-driven near-3% population growth, real per capita sales have fallen by closer to 6%”. “Retail sales are usually a very good indicator of overall consumer spending; and consumer spending adds to nearly 70% of the economy”. “That would normally be signalling – indeed, statistically shrieking – recession with a capital-R”. The reality is that nearly all of the economic data released since last month’s shock CPI inflation print has been below expectations. In April, Australia’s unemployment rate increased by 0.2% to 4.1%, while the underemployment rate rose by 0.1% to 6.6%. Advertisement The unemployment rate is dangerously close to the RBA’s end-of-year unemployment prediction of 4.3%. Hours worked remained steady in April, but have fallen 0.8% over the last year, indicating a weaker labour market and a shift to part-time work. The data follows a dramatic increase in the number of applicants per job post reported this month by SEEK, which is currently tracking 55% higher than 2019 levels. Advertisement The ABS wage price index also showed that wages grew by only 0.8% in the March quarter (3.2% annualised), which was below economists’ and the RBA’s expectations. Wage growth was also below the March quarter’s headline CPI growth of 1.0% and underlying inflation of 1.1%. Advertisement This means that Australian real wages are decreasing once more, and they are now 7.1% lower than their June 2020 peak. Finally, this month’s NAB business survey showed slower economic activity, slower job growth, lower labour cost increases, and lower inflation. It also indicated that Australia’s per capita recession had worsened. Advertisement The RBA’s two mandates are price stability and full employment. As a result, with such weak conditions, the RBA is unlikely to raise interest rates. To the contrary, the next shift in interest rates will most likely be lower. It is simply a question of whether it happens this year or early next year. Advertisement Upcoming data releases will tell the tale."

    "article_text": "As I dialled my village across the Sutlej River, southwest of Bahawalpur, and inquired about their well-being, a profound response echoed back: “Brother, we’ve turned savage!” This stark description captures the dire state of Pakistan’s rural areas today, revealing not only the current turmoil caused by high input costs for agriculture and low returns but also hinting at the future if the status quo persists. Over the last three decades, rapid urban expansion has starkly contrasted with the decline of rural prosperity. Villages that once thrived on self-sufficiency and local governance are now mere shadows of their former selves. Roads and electricity may have integrated these villages into the broader consumer economy, but this integration has come at a steep cost. Crude oil from Arab lands disrupted traditional agricultural practices, replacing oxen and wells with tractors and tube wells. Initially, this brought about a wave of prosperity, as uncultivated lands turned productive and cash crops like cotton and wheat brought unprecedented wealth. However, this boom was short-lived. Viruses ravaged the cotton fields, and the mechanization of agriculture rendered traditional labour redundant. Dairy animals and shade trees were sold off to pay for rising electricity bills and children’s education. When the textile factories closed, jobs disappeared, and the cash flow dried up. The switch to sugarcane cultivation failed to revive the old prosperity, and educated youth, unable to find local opportunities, migrated to cities. Villages, once hopeful of regaining their lost glory, descended into chaos and desolation. Mainstream political parties need to champion local governance, not fear it. Today’s rural Pakistan is marked by jobless youth, an over-reliance on cash, and a struggling agricultural sector. While banks offered loans at one point, the exorbitant interest rates led to widespread land seizures, and this financial burden has only intensified. The new generation, in a bid to secure immediate needs, is selling off ancestral lands to build homes and fund weddings, neglecting the long-term implications for their children. This downward spiral is exacerbated by the lack of local democratic institutions. Without local governance, villages cannot manage their own economies or address social issues independently. This dependence on distant urban centers and centralized power structures only deepens their marginalization. The health and sanitation issues that arise from this neglect further compound the problems, creating a cycle of decline that is hard to break without significant intervention. Pakistan’s constitution mandates local democracy, recognizing its crucial role in ensuring balanced development and robust governance. Yet, mainstream political parties have consistently evaded this constitutional duty, fearing the decentralization of power. Local democracy is not merely a bureaucratic exercise; it is the backbone of a functioning and equitable society. Local councils can address immediate needs, manage resources efficiently, and ensure that the benefits of development reach every corner of the nation. Investing in local democracy can transform the economic landscape of rural Pakistan. Local governments are better positioned to understand and respond to the unique challenges faced by their communities. They can ensure timely and fair distribution of agricultural inputs like fertilizers and seeds, negotiate better prices for produce, and manage local infrastructure projects that directly impact daily life. For instance, a locally governed village can prioritize the repair of irrigation canals to prevent water wastage, or establish cooperative societies to market their produce collectively, ensuring fair prices and reducing dependency on exploitative middlemen. This localized control can revitalize agriculture, making it more resilient and profitable, thus attracting youth back to farming and stemming the tide of urban migration. The credibility of Pakistan’s democracy hinges on the empowerment of its rural populace. Without local governance, the majority of the population remains disenfranchised, unable to influence decisions that affect their lives. This disconnection breeds discontent and erodes trust in democratic institutions. Local elections, therefore, are not just a procedural necessity but a fundamental aspect of a healthy democracy. Political parties must recognize that their long-term viability depends on grassroots support. Engaging with local issues, fostering local leadership, and ensuring that local governments have the financial and administrative autonomy promised by the constitution will strengthen the democratic fabric of the nation. It will also diminish the influence of vested interests that thrive in the absence of accountable local institutions. The path to Pakistan’s prosperity, political stability, and global respect lies in embracing and implementing grassroots democracy. This requires a paradigm shift in how political power is perceived and exercised. It means trusting local communities to manage their own affairs and recognizing that a decentralized approach can lead to more sustainable and inclusive development. Mainstream political parties need to champion local governance, not fear it. They must push for regular, free, and fair local elections, and support policies that devolve financial and administrative powers to local councils. Only then can Pakistan break free from the cycle of decline, harness the full potential of its rural areas, and restore faith in its democratic institutions.

    "article_text": "Former President Trump throws a \"MAGA\" hat during a campaign rally Thursday in the Bronx. (Yuki Iwamura / Associated Press) Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Donald Trump ’s supporters often say they admire him because he always speaks his mind. “He’s brutally honest,” Larry Faria, a Trump fan in the San Joaquin Valley, told my colleague Jeffrey Fleishman in March. “His abrasiveness got him elected.” But on some topics, Trump can be as slippery as an eel. The presumptive Republican nominee has refused to be pinned down on abortion, Obamacare and the federal budget. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Let’s start with abortion. In 1999, Trump described himself as “very pro-choice.” Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, he declared himself anti-abortion, and he took credit for putting judges on the Supreme Court who overturned abortion rights in 2022 . But when it comes to federal action to ban or limit abortion, Trump has waffled — apparently because he knows any firm position would be unpopular with a big chunk of the electorate. He has warned others in the GOP that tough abortion policies would lose elections. In March, Trump found what he hoped was a safe harbor. He declared that since the Supreme Court had put abortion in the hands of the states , a presidential candidate didn’t need to take any position at all. “It’s up to the states,” he shrugged. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Problem solved? Not exactly. The federal government still regulates the two drugs used for medication abortions, which account for more than half of abortions. Anti-abortion groups want the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its approval for one of the drugs, mifepristone; some also want the Justice Department to ban the shipment of both drugs through the mail. Read more: Donald Trump puts America on notice again: If he loses, he won't go quietly Last month, a reporter for Time magazine asked Trump where he stood on those questions. “I will be making a statement on that over the next 14 days,” Trump replied. “I feel very strongly about it. I actually think it’s a very important issue.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement That was April 12, more than six weeks ago. Last week, I asked Trump’s campaign if he will be announcing his position on mifepristone soon. Aides did not reply. Meanwhile, a television reporter in Pittsburgh asked Trump if he supports any restrictions on contraception. “We’re looking at that, and I’m going to have a policy on that very shortly,” the candidate responded. Read more: Column: A lesson from Presidents Biden and Trump — the new normal is nonstop crises That was a mistake, and Trump quickly posted a statement that he “will never advocate imposing restrictions on birth control.” Aides said the candidate thought he was being asked about mifepristone, on which he still doesn’t have a position. A senior moment, perhaps? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now, Obamacare — the federally funded health insurance program known formally as the Affordable Care Act. Trump tried to repeal the ACA when he was president in 2017 but failed. He still denounces the program vigorously. “Obamacare Sucks!” he declared in a social media post last year. But when Democrats said they looked forward to campaigning against him on the now-popular law, the former president backpedaled. “I’m not running to terminate the ACA,” he posted. “We’re going to make it much better.” But he has offered no proposals for improving the ACA. Last week, I asked Trump’s campaign if he will be unveiling any proposals for improving Obamacare. There was no reply. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Read more: Column: Trump and Biden both think they can land a knockout in the debates. They can't both be right Finally, taxes and the federal budget. Two weeks ago, at a rally in New Jersey, Trump made a sweeping promise : big tax cuts for everybody. “I’ll give you a Trump middle-class, upper-class, lower-class, business-class, big tax cut,” he said. “You’re going to have the biggest tax cut.” Tax cuts are popular, so you might think a candidate would offer some enticing details. But Trump doesn’t appear to have an actual tax plan — just a broad promise. The problem is that tax cuts are expensive, at least under traditional budget rules. Orthodox economics and historical experience teach that lower taxes reduce government revenue and increase deficits. For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Trump's 2017 tax cuts increased federal deficits by at least $1.8 trillion. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Not only that, a big tax cut would pump money into the consumer economy, which would normally push inflation upward. Until Trump made his tax-cut pledge, the debate over tax policy focused on current rates, which are scheduled to increase at the end of next year, when the 2017 Trump cuts expire. President Biden has said he wants to raise taxes on corporations and households earning more than $400,000 a year but leave everyone below $400,000 untouched. Republicans in Congress say their main goal is making sure taxes don’t go up for anybody, including high-income taxpayers or corporations. They notably didn’t rally around Trump’s expansive promise of new cuts. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Read more: Migrants play 'the asylum lottery' on controversial U.S. government app Fiscal hawks in the GOP would normally insist on a plan to make sure new tax cuts don’t increase the annual budget deficit and the long-term national debt. Trump has offered no such outline. Without any details, his promise looks like what Silicon Valley calls “vaporware” — an announcement without a product. Last week, I asked Trump’s campaign if he will offer any more details on his tax cut or other budget plans. Once again, no reply. There’s a straightforward reason Trump hasn’t clarified his views clearly on these three issues: He doesn’t think it will help him win. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “He’s making the campaign about issues that favor him: the economy and immigration,” Republican strategist Alex Conant explained. “Abortion isn’t an issue Republicans think they can win on. Obamacare isn’t going to decide the election … and voters don’t expect a detailed plan on taxes or the budget.” And it’s probably good politics. “He’s actually running the most disciplined campaign he’s ever had,” Conant said. “It’s been mostly gaffe-free, with only a few small exceptions.” But if Trump wants to be president, he owes voters clearer explanations of his policies on mifepristone, Obamacare and the federal budget. Until he does, it’s time to stop giving him credit for being plainspoken. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He’s candid only when it serves his interest.

    "article_text": "Decoding Williams-Sonoma Inc (WSM): A Strategic SWOT Insight GuruFocus Research May 25, 2024 4 min read WSM Williams-Sonoma Inc ( NYSE:WSM ) faces a challenging market with a 5.4% decrease in net revenues and hesitancy in furniture purchases. Despite market challenges, WSM's gross profit increased by 18.9%, with a gross margin rise to 48.3%. WSM's strategic focus on growth, customer service, and earnings amidst an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Williams-Sonoma Inc ( NYSE:WSM ) boasts a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MCHP. Williams-Sonoma Inc ( NYSE:WSM ), a renowned specialty retailer of high-quality sustainable products for the home, has recently released its 10-Q filing dated 2024-05-24. The company, with a diverse portfolio of brands, operates through e-commerce websites, direct-mail catalogs, and retail stores. Despite a challenging market, WSM reported a significant increase in gross profit by 18.9%, with a gross margin rise to 48.3%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. However, net revenues decreased by 5.4%, indicating customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases. With a strong liquidity position of $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, WSM is focusing on growth, customer service, and earnings to navigate the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Decoding Williams-Sonoma Inc (WSM): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Brand Portfolio and Market Positioning : Williams-Sonoma Inc ( NYSE:WSM ) boasts a robust portfolio of nine brands, catering to a wide range of categories, aesthetics, and life stages. This diversity allows WSM to capture various market segments and maintain a strong market presence. The company's ability to offer high-quality, sustainable products positions it as a leader in the home goods industry, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Financial Health and Profitability : The company's financial health is evident in its increased gross profit and margin. The gross margin improved to 48.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiencies. This profitability reflects WSM's pricing power and operational efficiency, even amidst global inflation pressures and supply chain disruptions. Omnichannel Retail Strategy : WSM's omnichannel platform and infrastructure, including e-commerce, catalogs, and retail stores, provide a seamless shopping experience for customers. The company's loyalty and credit card program, The Key Rewards, further enhances customer engagement across the Williams-Sonoma family of brands. Weaknesses Market Sensitivity and Consumer Spending : WSM's recent decline in net revenues highlights its sensitivity to market conditions and consumer spending behavior. The hesitancy towards furniture purchases, as indicated in the filing, suggests a vulnerability to economic downturns and shifts in consumer priorities. Story Continues Dependence on High-Ticket Items : The company's significant portion of revenue comes from higher ticket furniture sales, which are subject to greater volatility during economic fluctuations. This reliance on big-ticket items can lead to more pronounced revenue swings in response to market conditions. Operational Risks : WSM's global operations expose it to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. While the company has managed these risks effectively thus far, they remain a potential weakness that could impact future performance. Opportunities Global Expansion : With a presence in several international markets, WSM has the opportunity to further expand its global footprint. The company's strong brand recognition and commitment to sustainability can be leveraged to enter new markets and grow its customer base. Product Innovation and Sustainability : WSM's focus on sustainability is not only a brand strength but also an opportunity to innovate in product offerings. As consumer demand for eco-friendly products grows, WSM can capitalize on this trend by introducing new sustainable product lines. Technological Advancements : Investing in technology to enhance the customer experience, streamline operations, and improve supply chain management can provide WSM with a competitive edge. The company's omnichannel strategy can be further bolstered by leveraging emerging technologies. Threats Economic Uncertainty : The current macroeconomic environment, characterized by a weak housing market, elevated interest rates, and inflationary pressure, poses a significant threat to WSM's performance. These factors can dampen consumer confidence and reduce discretionary spending on home goods. Competitive Landscape : The home goods market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. WSM must continuously innovate and differentiate its product offerings to maintain its competitive position. Regulatory Changes : Changes in trade policies, tariffs, and other regulatory factors can impact WSM's cost structure and supply chain. The company must remain agile and adapt to any regulatory shifts to mitigate potential negative impacts. In conclusion, Williams-Sonoma Inc ( NYSE:WSM ) demonstrates a strong market position with a diversified brand portfolio and a solid financial foundation. However, it must navigate the challenges of economic uncertainty and consumer spending behavior. Opportunities for global expansion, product innovation, and technological advancements present avenues for growth, while threats from economic conditions, competition, and regulatory changes require strategic vigilance. WSM's focus on returning to growth, elevating customer service, and driving earnings positions it to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses effectively.

Jenny Kane/Associated Press, file NEW YORK — Consumers are increasingly struggling to pay their credit card bills, raising concerns about severe delinquencies spiraling and sapping consumer spending. The share of credit card debt that’s more than 90 days overdue rose to 10.7% during the first quarter, a 14-year high, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s report on first-quarter household debt. A year ago, severe delinquencies totaled only 8.2% of credit card debt. The first-quarter jump in severe delinquencies was the biggest since 2011. Meanwhile, total credit card debt rose to $1.12 trillion from just under $1 trillion a year ago. Those in their 20s and 30s are having the most difficulty paying their credit card bills. Those age groups typically have a mix of less earnings power and lower savings. The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat four-decade high inflation, which peaked in June 2022 at 9.1%. Those rate increases made borrowing more expensive on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Advertisement Consumer spending fuels economic growth, so trouble paying credit card bills is a worrisome signal. The direction of the labor market could determine whether debt stress becomes a bigger concern. Job and wage growth helped counter the hit to consumers wallets from rising inflation, but a continued slowdown or reversal there could tip the scales. “While these indicators do not necessarily predict a recession, especially with a robust labor market, a weakening in employment conditions could exacerbate household financial instability,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY (formerly Ernst & Young). “The combination of subdued job growth, sluggish income progression, and diminished savings could lead to increased delinquencies and a potential retrenchment in consumer spending.” Wall Street has so far brushed off concerns about rising credit debt levels and payment struggles, forecasting earnings growth to accelerate from 5.6% in the first quarter to 17.1% by the fourth quarter. Still, retail spending unexpectedly stalled in April in a sign of consumer fatigue and worry. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods like home furnishings and electronics. Coffee chain Starbucks lowered its sales expectations for the year as people visit its cafes less often, and McDonald’s is offering more deals as people cut back on fast food and eating out. The Fed is now faced with the prospect of inflation remaining stubbornly high around 3%, above its target of 2%. The mix of high inflation, expensive borrowing rates and a slowing economy has thrown more doubt around the central bank’s ability to tame inflation without causing a recession. Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report. That alleviates some concerns, but the increase in delinquencies seems to be outpacing income growth, and there is likely a large group of consumers who are paying their minimum balances and staying out of delinquency but are too financially stressed to actually pay their full balances. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency. “If our forecast of a benign moderation in the labor market is correct, we think consumer spending will remain resilient,” wrote Michael Gapen, Bank of America Global Research analyst. “However, elevated credit card delinquencies among lower-income consumers could increase the sensitivity of these consumers to an adverse labor market shock.”"

    "article_text": "Australian Flash PMI Data Points to Resilience in Economy, Stubborn Inflation Published on 05/22/2024 at 06:42 pm EDT - Modified on 05/22/2024 at 08:43 pm EDT Dow Jones Share By James Glynn SYDNEY--Australia's economy continues to register a clear and detectable pulse, with purchasing managers' index data for May remaining firmly in expansionary territory. The Judo Bank flash Australia composite PMI output Index came in at 52.6 in May, down from 53.0 in April. The result suggests that private-sector activity expanded for a fourth straight month. The strength of the report comes despite evidence elsewhere strongly suggesting that the economy has slowed as the impact of higher interest rates and a cost-of-living surge curbs consumer spending, while lowering consumer confidence to levels consistent with a deep recession. \"At face value, the strength in the Australian PMI activity indexes in 2024 points to an economy growing at around the long-term trend rate, if not a touch higher. But we know that consumer spending remains soft and will be a drag on growth over the first half of 2024,\" said Warren Hogan, chief economic advisor at Judo Bank. The mixed messages on the economy are keeping the Reserve Bank of Australia on edge. It kept interest on hold at a policy meeting last week but warned that the outlook for the economy is highly uncertain and kept all policy options on the table. The good news from the Judo Bank data is that despite soft consumption growth, businesses are still hiring and creating jobs, which should keep the economy expanding over the year ahead, Hogan said. The employment index rose to its highest level in more than six months in May, suggesting that private-sector demand for labor remains strong. Still, price indicators were also up, with the composite input price index rising to the highest level in six months in May. Service-industry cost pressures were up slightly, confirming that there has been no real easing of cost pressures in the last 12 months, Hogan said. \"This does not suggest that we will see a material step down in domestic inflation pressures in the second quarter,\" Hogan added. \"Any increase in goods inflation in the presence of stubbornly high domestic service sector inflation is a major concern for the RBA.\" Write to James Glynn james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ (END) Dow Jones Newswires 05-22-24 2042ET © Dow Jones - 2024 Share"

    "article_text": "May 22, 2024 UH News Reading time: 3 minutes Japan’s economic struggles post-pandemic, unexpected inflation, and interest rate hikes abroad have contributed to the weakest yen in nearly 35 years, approaching 160 yen to the dollar. While visitors to Japan, especially from Hawaiʻi , see it as an opportunity for a travel experience at a more affordable rate, experts say it imposes costs on Japan’s people and has mixed implications for Japan’s businesses. “For Hawaiʻi residents looking to travel to Japan, now is a great time. The dollar may never again have this much purchasing power in Japan,” said University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization ( UHERO ) Senior Research Fellow and Professor Emeritus Byron Gangnes. “U.S. travelers to Japan may have to compete with strong demand from Japanese themselves, who are discouraged from foreign travel by the weak yen.” Gangnes authored a UHERO blog, published May 21, detailing Japan’s struggles to escape inflation . According to Gangnes, like all countries, Japan was hit hard by COVID-19, and the economy has struggled to get back on track since. Some headwinds are familiar to Japan: the softness in foreign markets (more sellers than buyers) has hurt an economy for which exports remain an important source of growth. But the pandemic’s aftermath also brought unfamiliar conditions, in particular renewed inflation in a country that averaged less than 0.2% inflation between 1995 and 2019. Economic challenges ahead As consumer prices surged from zero to more than 4% in 2021–23, real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) declined sharply, falling by more than 6% before stabilizing recently. As a result, consumer spending has contracted for the past four quarters, pulling down overall GDP . Trade has also weighed on Japanese growth. Through much of 2022 and 2023, exports to China and the rest of Asia were particularly weak, reflecting China’s economic struggles and their regional impacts, even as exports to the rich developed regions were expanding at a healthy pace. Concerns about renewed inflation led the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ), the country’s central bank, to move away from the extraordinary period of zero interest rates and longer-term rate control. Its moves are expected to be limited and will have to take into account any further weakness in the economy. While a higher-rate policy might be expected to support a stronger yen, BOJ ’s announced policy change has not halted a decline in the currency. A weak yen will continue to weigh on Japanese travel and domestic purchasing power, even if it supports the demand for Japanese goods and services. In consumer spending, three-month inflation-adjusted retail sales were slightly positive in March. But real consumer spending continued to decline in the first quarter. Forward-looking indicators of consumer confidence are more encouraging. Businesses are less optimistic. According to a BOJ survey, firms’ overall assessment of business conditions has improved. But, after a better year for sales in 2023, fewer firms are expecting net sales growth in 2024. Slight rebound in annual growth UHERO ’s projects annualized quarterly Japanese growth to pick up to the roughly 1–1.5% range this year. Partly because of weakness in the second half of last year, annual growth for 2024 as a whole will come in at 0.8%, firming only slightly to 0.9% in 2025. “Growth in the 1% range is about the best we can expect for Japan in the near term, and the economy will decelerate further as we move into the second half of the decade,” Ganges said. The slower growth trend reflects an anticipated decline in the country’s labor force, which has been delayed so far by an impressive and unexpected surge in the labor force participation of women, which has risen from 49% in 2013 to 55% last year. Despite that, a falloff in available labor appears inevitable. Read the entire blog on UHERO ’s website . UHERO is housed in UH Mānoa’s College of Social Sciences .

It does not anticipate a recession this year, but does expect consumer spending growth to cool further and for overall GDP growth to slow to under 1 per cent between the Q2 and Q3 2024. The US economy started this year on a softer note than anticipated as elevated inflation and interest rates continued to weigh on the economy, according to The Conference Board (TCB). Though the US think tank does not anticipate a recession this year, it does expect consumer spending growth to cool further and for overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to under 1 per cent between the second quarter (Q2) and the third this year. The US economy started this year on a softer note than anticipated as elevated inflation and interest rates continued to weigh on the economy, The Conference Board noted. It does not anticipate a recession this year, but does expect consumer spending growth to cool further and for overall GDP growth to slow to under 1 per cent between the Q2 and Q3 2024. Thereafter, inflation should gradually normalise to the Federal Reserve’s 2-per cent target in 2025 as quarterly annualised GDP growth rises toward its potential of near 2 per cent, the think tank said in a release. The TCB leading economic index (LEI) for the country decreased by 0.6 per cent in April this year to 101.8 after decreasing by 0.3 per cent in March. Over the six-month period between October 2023 and April 2024, the LEI contracted by 1.9 per cent—a smaller decrease than its 3.5-per cent decline over the previous six months. The LEI provides an early indication of significant turning points in the business cycle and where the economy is heading in the near term. “Another decline in the US LEI confirms that softer economic conditions lay ahead,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, TCB senior manager, business cycle indicators. “Deterioration in consumers’ outlook on business conditions, weaker new orders, a negative yield spread, and a drop in new building permits fueled April’s decline. In addition, stock prices contributed negatively for the first time since October of last year. While the LEI’s six-month and annual growth rates no longer signal a forthcoming recession, they still point to serious headwinds to growth ahead, she added. Interest rates should fall starting in late 2024, but may stabilise at levels exceeding the pre-pandemic average. Though US consumer spending held up remarkably well in 2023 despite numerous headwinds, the trend has begun to wane, the think tank noted. Real retail sales growth is in retreat and consumer confidence has fallen for several months. Gains in real disposable personal income growth are softening, pandemic savings have been exhausted, and household debt is increasing rapidly. Consumers are spending more of their income to service debt and auto loan and credit card delinquencies are rising quickly. Thus, the think tank forecasts that overall consumer spending growth will continue to slow in Q2 and Q3 2024 as households struggle to find a new equilibrium between income, debt, savings and spending. The TCB coincident economic index (CEI) for the United States rose by 0.2 per cent in April to 112.3 after also increasing by 0.2 per cent in March. As a result, the CEI was up by 0.9 per cent over the six-month period ending April 2024, slightly ahead of its 0.8-per cent increase over the previous six months. The CEI offers an indication of the current state of the economy. Fibre2Fashion News Desk (DS) More The Conference Board News... More Textiles News - United States Of America...

Rules in England are set to change after demands from Martin Lewis, with MPs backing the Money Saving Expert founder. MPs have finally called for compulsory financial ed in English primary and secondary schools after damning evidence from Mr Lewis and others. ‌ BBC and ITV star Mr Lewis has welcomed the Eduction Committee's new report – which has put forward many of his proposals – arguing that every child deserves to be properly equipped for independent financial life. ‌ The Committee recommended to make PSHE compulsory in primary AND secondary schools – and ensure financial education is taught within it. It also recommended a review of the maths curriculum up to age 16 and to improve teaching materials and training for teachers. ‌ READ MORE DWP 'bootcamps' for Universal Credit 'desperate' and 'won't work' It also called to itroduce new 'financial education co-ordinators' and also embed financial education into the curriculum for 16- to 18-year-olds. Mr Lewis said in a statement: \"I'm delighted that the Education Committee has taken on board so many of the points that we put forward to them.\" Article continues below He added: \"We've been fighting for proper financial education in English schools for over a decade now, and it's moved very, very slowly. If you consider it would take just a fraction of a per cent of the amount of money paid back in PPI (payment protection insurance) reclaims alone to fully fund all financial education in schools, it's incredibly shortsighted that we don't invest a small amount in making sure our children are tooled up in this competitive consumer economy that we live in. \"There is no excuse and there should be no hiding place. Every child deserves to understand the financial landscape they're going into and to be properly equipped for independent financial life. I'm delighted the Committee is pushing this and I will continue to work on this in future.\""

Shettima added that due to such options adopted by the Federal Government, the country is on course to economic prosperity in a short while, in spite of temporary pain. Also yesterday, former Bauchi State Governor Isa Yuguda and All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje listed the prospects arising from the policies of the Tinubu administration. They spoke at the APC Professionals Forum’s Policy Roundtable Conference tagged: “Asiwaju ScoreCard Series” in Abuja yesterday. Shettima was represented by his Special Adviser on General Duties Aliyu Moddibo Umar. Umar is a former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He said critical decisions and policies of the administration were germane to the health and future prosperity of the country. Justifying the decisions taken by the administration, he said they “are to guarantee the course of our nation for generations to come instead of postponing the setbacks for our children and their children.” Shettima added: “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made the difficult but necessary choices to ensure Nigeria’s long-term stability and prosperity are never in doubt. He has chosen a path that, although demanding, promises to save our nation from economic downfall. “This began with the calculated removal of the fuel subsidy. This decision was not made for its own sake, but to redeem the reality of the nation’s unsustainable debt service-to-revenue ratio, which had grown to alarming levels over the past few years.” The vice president emphasised that the administration’s eight-point agenda provided a clear framework for policies and programmes. He explained that “these initiatives are not just plans on paper; they are actions being implemented to create tangible improvements in the lives of everyday Nigerians”. Read Also: Tinubu devoted to interfaith unity, religious freedom — Shettima Shettima said while the huge investment in agriculture would reduce the nation’s reliance on imports and boost local production, the ‘Renewed Hope Housing Scheme’ would address the housing deficit and stimulate economic growth. He added: “Similarly, we are also focused on reducing unemployment and underemployment through various initiatives, including the Outsource to Nigeria Initiative, Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises, and the Expanded National MSME Clinics. These programmes are designed to create more job opportunities and foster economic inclusivity.” Shettima said the administration’s commitment to education was evident in the launch of the student loan scheme and the appointment of Mr. Jim Ovia to chair the Nigerian Education Loan Fund. He said: “This initiative will empower our youth and ensure that they have the resources needed to succeed, and I assure you that the policy is in place to offer interventions to vulnerable or disadvantaged Nigerians without discrimination or favouritism.” On government’s efforts to ensure transparency and integrity, Shettima said: “The ongoing digitisation of revenue collection across all government sectors is expected to yield significant results and enhance the transparency we have promised the people of Nigeria.” Urging Nigerians to exercise patience, he added: “Our economic indicators will improve as we continue to implement our policies, and we are confident that significant growth is on the horizon. The results of our interventions are promising, and we are proud of the progress made in strengthening the Naira.” ‘Tinubu can’t be blamed for woes’ Yuguda said the nation’s economic woes could not be attributed to President Tinubu, advising the opposition to be objective in their assessment of the administration. He said: “The President did not create any of the problems people are talking about, whether in the economy or in the other sectors. Infact, what he met on ground would have created a worse situation if not properly handled. But, he is championing reforms that are required to pave the way for a better society. Era of volatile, unstable economy now over - Shettima Shettima returns to Abuja after showcasing Nigeria’s climate leadership at COP30 Shettima returns to Abuja after showcasing Nigeria’s climate leadership at COP30 “We all recall how on assuming office, President Tinubu announced the removal of fuel subsidy, but again for the avoidance of doubt, he did not remove subsidy on PMS. It was not in the later part of the 2023 budget, but surprisingly the Tinubu administration has had to bear the brunt for subsidy removal. “Indeed, the President has today been proved right with the manner petrol importation has gone down by 50% since June 2023 and it is almost certain to go down more in a few months when the 650,000 barrels per day Dangote Refinery begin to produce PMS locally as well as the impending resumption of production at the Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries. “If any Nigerian is still in doubt about how payment of subsidy has over the years strained the country’s resources, they must have seen how the sub-nationals now receive more than double what they used to get from Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).” Highlighting the achievements of the administration, Yuguda said the central government, the sub-nationals and local governments in April 2024 shared N1.2 trillion as against N655.8 billion shared by the three tiers in 2023 during the subsidy era. He added: “The reform-minded Tinubu administration also unified the exchange rates, which inevitably sent those benefiting from the arbitrage out of business. And of course, it did not take long before Nigerians began to reap the benefits as the economy grew by 3.46% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 2.54% in the preceding quarter. Also Capital importation was up by 66% in Q4 of 2023 compared to a 33% decline in the previous quarter. “Let us not forget how oil production has grown steadily since the second quarter of 2023 from 1.22m barrels per day to 1.55m barrels per day which means additional resources even as non-oil revenue continue to rise as a result of financial re-engineering of the Tinubu administration. “There was a time, specifically in the first quarter of 2023, when debt service went from about 95% of the nation’s revenue to 183%, according to data from the Budget office, even though our debt-to-GDP ratio looked good. “Today, Nigeria’s debt service-to-revenue ratio has dropped to about 66.9% which is the lowest in four years. This is largely due to fuel subsidy removal and the unification of the foreign exchange market, which have not only increased revenue inflows but also ensured the allocation of more funds for capital projects.” APC will enlarge its coast, says Ganduje APC National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje, said the party will enlarge its coast before the next general election. He said the economy was being transformed into a credit-based consumer economy that will improve agriculture, boost food security, enhance infrastructural development and facilitate access to education. Ganduje said following the shift to renewable and sustainable energy sources, the use of cheap and clean Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has now become a reality under the administration. Hailing the president for living up to expectation, he said: “Mr. President has approved the construction/completion and rehabilitation of several road projects across the country to include the Kano – Abuja Road, Kano – Eastern Bypass Road, the 700 Km Lagos – Calabar Coastal Road, the 1000 Km Badagry – Sokoto Road, the 3500 Units Renewed Hope Housing Cities and Estates now being built in 13 states for starters. “In the next few days, the Students Loan Fund will become operational, and Nigerian youths will now have easier access to higher education by applying for funds from the scheme. “On power, I have observed the increased transmission capacity of the country that now peaks at 14,000 megawatts.” Ganduje peeped into the future, saying that victory is certain for the platform during elections. He said: “Although it is not yet an election period, we are reinvigorating the party to ensure that come 2027, we will retain and get new state governors, as well as Mr President to secure another mandate to continue with his government’s policies and programmes. “We have also constituted at the national level a Reconciliation Committee that would reconcile all aggrieved party members, and such committee will be established at the state, local government and ward levels.” Ganduje said APC would be restructured so that it can become a truly grassroots progressive party. He said: “We have directed our state chapters to liaise with their respective governors and other stakeholders to ensure that we have full-fledged, functional offices in every political ward and state to enable our members across the country to have symbolic representation in their neighbourhood.” TAGS: Shettima Abuja doctor reveals a unique way to permanently cure weak erection, small and shameful manhood, and infertility issues without side effects within a short period.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s campaign is clearing the way for Republicans to speak about how Americans are suffering huge pocketbook damage from the Democratic Party’s pro-migrant policies and the low wages those policies cause. The populist attack on migration was buried deep in a Washington Post article touting the claimed benefits of Biden’s high-migration, low-wage economic policy: In a statement, the Trump campaign said President Biden is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans.” Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Biden’s policies of issuing migrants work permits while their requests for legal residency are pending “is especially devastating to African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and union workers who are forced to watch their jobs and public resources stolen by people who Joe Biden should never have allowed into our country.” The statement is a populist door-opener for many Republican candidates and campaign committees who want to use kitchen-table pocketbook pitches to the many swing voters who prefer to downplay the chaos and crime of illegal migration. So far, nearly all GOP candidates have avoided those populist pitches amid business support for the continued inflow of taxpayer-aided consumers, apartment-sharing renters, and wage-cutting workers. The Trump campaign’s dollars-and-cents response was also a useful counterweight to the Washington Post ‘s pro-migration article, which leaned heavily on academic debates instead of admitting the obvious pocketbook impact of Biden’s cheap-labor policy. The Post article began: As Donald Trump touts increasingly aggressive plans to crack down on illegal immigration, economists are wary that his proposals would deal a massive blow to the U.S. job market, which has stayed strong thanks in part to foreign-born workers. The Post article then slid into a professor vs. professor dispute that hid the painful pocketbook reality of Biden’s high-migration economy: Some academic research does show that a rise in immigration drags down wages and job opportunities for all workers. For example, Harvard economist George Borjas has found that a 10 percent increase in the number of immigrants within a particular group probably lowers that group’s wage by 3 to 4 percent, which can particularly affect workers with lower levels of education. But his work also found that lower wages can bring higher profits for an employer, with those added gains ultimately growing the economy for native workers. The article cited Michael Clemens, “an economist specializing in international migration at George Mason University,” who contended that a migrant, whether illegal or not, working in the kitchen of a restaurant complements an American citizen “serving a table,” and that each of those employees depended on the other for their job. Still, some reporters at other media outlets are making the damage clear. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported on May 17: “Adjusted for inflation, net worth was up just 0.7% through Biden’s first three years, compared with 16% through Trump’s first three years.” Wall Street Joural chart of household net worth (wsj.com) Other reporters describe migration’s massive economic and civic damage to the United Kingdom , Canada , and Australia . But most reporters perfume the grinding economic exploitation enabled by the federal government’s migration policies. The Financial Times , for example, reported from New York on May 21: When Silvana arrived in New York with her husband and daughter after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador through the jungle, she immediately started looking for a job. … Silvana now sells plates of rice and soup out of a white cooler outside the shelter where she lives, earning $60 for four hours of work each day. Silvana’s wage adds up to $300 per week, or $15,000 per year, ensuring her complete reliance on welfare and aid from the state’s taxpayers. Her willingness to work for a pittance also drags down the wages earned by other illegals, migrants, and American citizens, thus expanding the demand for welfare and aid programs. But the Financial Times prefers to focus on the concerns and desires of employers, contending, “New York’s hospitality industry ‘absolutely still needs labour,’ said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group for the city’s restaurants and bars.” Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has relied on Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded, low-status Americans. The policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

He pointed to recent reports from home improvement retailers Lowe's and Home Depot , both of which suggested that customers are feeling the burden of high interest rates and continued inflation. According to Cramer, Wall Street is fixated on one prevailing theme: data. Companies will spend handsomely to improve computing power, much of which goes to data centers, he said. Cramer asserted that \"the spigot from the tech titans to everything else\" is endless and unavoidable, calling out the biggest names that have and interrogate data, including Amazon , Alphabet , Microsoft , Meta and Apple .

    "article_text": "• Consumers plan to spend more on summer travel this year, at about $2400 on average. • Credit cards are the most popular way to pay for travel, driven by reward and cash-back programs. • Most consumers who prefer paying with credit cards like a single charge, but pay later plans also have substantial appeal.

Δ Summer is just around the corner — and consumers are getting ready to spend big on travel. Roughly half of United States consumers had made travel plans by early April, when PYMNTS Intelligence conducted its latest survey. Generation Z consumers are particularly keen on summer trips, with 58% indicating they will travel. Moreover, many summer travelers say they will spend nearly $200 more on average than last year. When it comes to paying for summer excursions, consumers widely prefer to use credit cards. More than one-third of those paying for at least part of their summer travel by credit card cite rewards and cash-back programs as the primary reason. Although consumers who pay by credit card generally prefer to pay with a single charge, many plan to use pay later plans, particularly Gen Z and those in lower income brackets. Here Comes Summer Travel Key Findings Conclusion Methodology Here Comes Summer Travel Consumers are enthusiastic about summer travel, and many plan to increase their travel compared to last year. 66% of high-income consumers have summer travel plans. As warmer weather arrives and school break nears, 48% of consumers have already made travel plans for the summer. Another 18% remain undecided about traveling, while 34% do not currently plan to do so. Notably, Generation X and younger age groups are more likely to say they will travel. For example, 58% of Gen Z plans to travel, compared to 39% of baby boomers and seniors. Income plays an even larger role in whether consumers have travel plans. Two-thirds of respondents annually earning more than $100,000 say they will travel this summer. Forty-eight percent of those in the middle bracket and 27% of their peers earning less than $50,000 say the same. The data also shows that consumers’ credit scores are a strong indicator of their intent to travel. Fifty-seven percent of those with high scores (more than 720) have summer travel plans. Fifty-one percent of those with mid-level scores (between 620 and 720) and 32% of those with low scores (less than 620) say the same. Interestingly, respondents who said they do not know their credit score are even less likely to have travel plans, at 28%. This suggests that consumers who pay little attention to credit scores may have less ability to pay for travel. These are just some of the findings detailed in “ Consumer Credit Economy Monitor: Summer Travel 2024 ,” a PYMNTS Intelligence and i2c collaboration. This edition examines consumers’ plans for summer travel and their related payment preferences. It draws on insights from a survey of 2,127 U.S. consumers held from March 29 to April 4. Key Findings More than one-third of consumers planning summer travel say they will travel more than last year. 50% of Gen Z consumers with summer travel plans say they will travel more this year. Many consumers will travel more heavily this summer than last, reflecting a strong willingness to spend on trips despite persistent elevated inflation and higher prices. Across the sample, 37% of respondents with summer travel plans say they will travel more than they did last year. Fifteen percent say they will travel less. That said, 48% expect to travel about the same. This general trend varies relatively little across demographic groups, though Gen Z is an exception. Half of Gen Z travelers plan to travel more heavily this year than last, compared to 31% to 38% for the other generations. PYMNTS Intelligence found several key factors driving consumers to travel more this year. Forty-one percent of consumers planning to travel more cite greater interest as an important reason. Twenty-one percent name this as their top motivation. This likely reflects demand normalization as the pandemic and related disruptions move further into the rearview mirror. Having more time for travel is the second-most cited reason, cited by 36% of those planning to travel more. Eighteen percent indicate this as the top reason for ramping up their travel. Improved personal finances follow, at 29%. Most consumers traveling this summer plan to spend more than they did last year and prefer to use credit cards. 78% of consumers with travel plans expect to pay at least a portion of the bill with a credit card. The average consumer who plans to travel this summer will be reaching deeper into their pocket. Across the sample, those with travel plans expect to spend roughly $2,400 on summer trips. This amount is $175 more on average than they spent last year, representing an 8% increase. The most notable shift occurs among middle-income travelers, who plan to spend roughly $500 more this year. This 30% jump contrasts sharply with flat spending for higher-income consumers and a 10% drop for the low-income bracket. Gen X and baby boomers and seniors drive this higher spending. Baby boomers and seniors will spend an additional $300, and Gen X will spend nearly $400 more. At the same time, younger consumers are budgeting slightly less than last year. Consumers clearly prefer credit cards when paying for travel expenses. Sixty-nine percent of those planning to travel this summer say they will pay for at least part of it by credit card. This share is substantially higher than those who expect to reach for debit cards or cash, at 59% and 57%, respectively. Notably, reward points — which typically come from using credit cards — rank fourth. The data reveals some notable variations across certain demographics. For example, older consumers and those with higher credit scores tend to favor paying with credit products. This likely reflects these cohorts’ access to quality credit products with higher credit limits. Conversely, Gen Z consumers and those with low credit scores — groups struggling to access credit — both favor debit over credit. Most consumers prefer to pay for their travel expenses with a single charge. 33% of consumers who plan to travel this summer and pay for at least some expenses expect to pay primarily by credit card with a single payment. Credit cards are the go-to way to pay for summer travel. More than 4 in 10 consumers who plan to travel this summer expect to pay primarily with a credit card, with 33% saying they expect to pay for the expenses in a single charge and 11% expecting to use credit card installments. Debit cards come in second, at 32%, with cash far behind, at 9.6%, and substantially lower shares for digital wallet, bank transfer and buy now, pay later (BNPL). While most travelers prefer paying by credit card with a single charge, a significant portion plan to use pay later plans to pay for at least some of their summer travel. Roughly 34% of consumers plan to use one of these plans, such as credit card installments or BNPL, to pay for at least some of their travel. Younger consumers are the most enthusiastic about using pay later plans for their travel purchases. Among Gen Z travelers, 53% indicate they will use one. On the other hand, just 20% of baby boomers and seniors plan to pay for travel using pay later options. Looking more closely at the average planned spending reveals that pay later plans are important for lower-income consumers. Overall, respondents who plan to use a pay later plan for some of their summer travel expect to spend less than those who do not. However, the opposite is true for consumers earning less than $50,000. They expect to spend 13% more on average if they use a pay later plan. This indicates that pay later plans help consumers with limited income access travel that otherwise might be out of reach. Rewards and cash-back programs drive the use of credit cards for travel expenses. 34% of consumers who plan to pay for travel by credit card cite rewards or cash back as their primary reason. Consumers turn to credit cards for a variety of reasons. When it comes to travel, rewards programs dominate. Thirty-four percent of consumers who plan to use credit cards to pay for travel name rewards or cash-back programs as their primary reason, more than three times as many that name other benefits such as cash flow management and accessibility. These findings confirm that credit card providers should focus on rewards programs to maximize their appeal for travel spending. Rewards and cash-back programs appeal to older consumers in particular. Among consumers who plan to pay for summer travel expenses by credit card, half of baby boomers and seniors name rewards or cash back as their top reason, and 43% of Gen X say the same. This share drops to 25% for millennials and 8.4% for Gen Z. In fact, cash flow management and quicker access to money rank as more important for Gen Z — an important takeaway for providers targeting younger consumers. When considering consumer income, rewards and cash back top the list across the board. However, those with high and middle incomes are much more likely to name rewards and cash back as their most important reason, at 38% and 33%, respectively. For consumers in the lowest income bracket, rewards and cash back still lead at 18%, but cash flow management ranks close behind, at 17%, followed by quicker access to money, at 15%. Conclusion Consumers are gearing up for a busy summer travel season. They are ready to travel more and spend more on average than last year. Travelers point to credit cards as their favorite way to pay for their travel, with rewards and cash-back programs as the most important reason. Although most consumers who prefer to pay by credit card like to pay with a single charge, the study finds that pay later plans also have substantial appeal. Younger consumers, particularly Gen Z, show especially strong interest in pay later options, as do consumers with lower incomes. Providers should consider these differences as they tailor their offerings to different market segments.

    "article_text": "Headline inflation is cooling, too. (Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images) The Conversation The U.S. economy is slowing, but not crashing. In the dismal science , this is what counts as good news. That’s the message I took away from the latest inflation data , released May 15, 2024, which showed U.S. consumer prices rising 3.4 percent in the 12 months to April 2024. This is down slightly from the 3.5 percent year-over-year increase reported in March 2024. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In other words, while prices are rising, they’re not going up as sharply as they once were. That’s good news for shoppers; the U.S. economy is far from the 9.1 percent annual inflation seen in June 2022. While energy and shelter prices increased in April, these gains were relatively modest. Meanwhile, food prices remained steady compared to last year and even declined by 0.2 percent compared to March. What’s more, people in the market for a car were in luck: New and used vehicle prices fell 0.4 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in April. The “core” consumer price index – which doesn’t include volatile food and energy prices and is often considered better at predicting future inflation than so-called “headline” CPI figures – is also down slightly. After posting a year-over-year increase of 3.9 percent in January and 3.8 percent in February and March, it slowed to 3.6 percent in April. So the overall report is relatively positive: It didn’t show the uptick in inflation that many consumers feared, and reported inflation rates were actually slightly lower than market expectations. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As an economist , I see this data report as yet more evidence that economic growth is slowing – in a good way. The economy grew at a lower-than-expected 1.6 percent rate in the first quarter of 2024, according to the most recent gross domestic product data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The most recent jobs report also showed a slowdown in hiring , and the latest data on job vacancies similarly showed the labor market cooling off . Why the Fed is paying close attention The Federal Reserve’s main objective is to strike a balance between two goals : maintaining stable employment and ensuring price stability. It does this by managing and influencing interest rates. Lowering rates stimulates the economy, which encourages economic growth and job creation – but that can fuel inflation. Raising rates does the opposite: Economic growth slows, which dampens inflation, but also hinders employment. So, when inflation started increasing dramatically after the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve responded with a two-year campaign of rate hikes – they’re currently at a 23-year high . Since this raises the cost of borrowing, investors and potential homebuyers are keen for the Fed to dial back its rates. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement After May’s report, I don’t believe the Federal Reserve will be in any rush to cut interest rates from their current elevated level. There’s a slowdown, to be sure, but the slowdown is so steady that it’s not pulling prices down in any rapid fashion. This is no doubt frustrating for the Fed – which has an inflation target of 2 percent – as well as for potential homebuyers. But it’s evidence that the economy is stable at the moment. Inflation isn’t surging, and consumer spending, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is still growing. In March, consumer spending increased 5.8 percent year over year , up from February’s 4.9 percent rate. All eyes on the American shopper Going forward, hopes for a “ soft landing ” – economist-speak for when the Fed slows inflation without triggering a recession – will depend in large measure on U.S. shoppers. Consumer spending makes up roughly two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product. If American shoppers suddenly stop spending, then inflation will slow considerably, job vacancies will evaporate, and gross domestic product could contract. At that point, the Fed will turn attention away from inflation and toward economic stimulus, and rates will fall. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I mention this because a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed a troubling uptick in consumer credit card delinquency rates . If much of the recent increase in consumer spending is due to Americans relying more on credit cards, then the economy could be on shakier ground than it appears. The good news is that delinquency rates are still way below where they were ahead of the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 through June 2009 . So, while this data may be troubling, there’s no need to panic just yet. In short, while inflation rates still aren’t to the Fed’s liking, the economy – for now – appears to be on a stable path.

Walmart raised its Q2 and full-year guidance, now expecting second-quarter net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5%. Full-year net sales are projected to come in at the high end or slightly above its previous outlook of 3% to 4% growth. “That said, we're one quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said Thursday. Dive Insight: Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said during an earnings call that growth in units sold, transaction counts and market share gains, including in general merchandise, are among the current key factors driving positive momentum. Additionally, McMillon said Walmart’s consistent focus on value, selection and the shopping experience are resonating with customers. “We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this year while managing our price gaps and investing in our associates at the same time,” McMillon said. Rainey said more customers are shopping with Walmart more often and across more categories. Additionally, Rainey noted the number of U.S. marketplace sellers grew 36% for the quarter, pushing the SKU count to over 420 million. During the quarter, marketplace sales in furniture, sporting goods, kids apparel and home grew more than 20%, Rainey said. But consumer wallets are still stretched. Rainey said people are opting or needing to spend more on non-discretionary items and less on general merchandise. “In a tightening consumer economy, Walmart is showing very few signs of fatigue as it churns out yet another strong set of results,” Neil Saunders, GlobalData Managing Director, said in emailed comments. And higher income consumers are continuing to divert more of their consumables spending to Walmart, according to Saunders. GlobalData found that Walmart has increased its share of households that earn over $100,000 by over 2 percentage points during the last three years. While that reflects broad acceptance of the company’s value proposition, going forward the retailer will need to deepen its relationship with that demographic as inflation drops, which could make further gains challenging, he said. The retailer's merchandise mix continues to hinder margins, Rainey said, adding that Walmart U.S. is pursuing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility of its e-commerce brand assortments in fashion, home and electronics. Growth across various segments and markets indicate that Walmart “is on a path to drive consistently higher sales and profits,\" Jefferies analysts led by Corey Tarlowe said in a Thursday note. The first-quarter earnings report comes just days after the retailer confirmed it eliminated hundreds of corporate jobs . It also asked “the majority” of its remotely employed associates, along with those in offices in Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto, to relocate. Most will move to the company’s Arkansas corporate headquarters. Walmart last month also announced it’s closing its U.S. health centers . McMillon on Thursday said “given reimbursement rates and cost to serve, we could no longer see a path to achieving an acceptable level of profitability” for the initiative. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Operations, Financial News"

    "article_text": "Economy / May 16, 2024 Biden’s Best Move Is to Declare Class War. Why Is He Holding Back? With Donald Trump making promises to oil barons, the President has avoided making his Republican opponent’s connections to corporate America a feature of his reelection campaign. Chris Lehmann Share Copy Link Facebook X (Twitter) Bluesky Pocket Email President Donald Trump arrives to deliver remarks about American energy production during a visit to the Double Eagle Energy Oil Rig, Wednesday, July 29, 2020, in Midland, Texas. (Evan Vucci / AP Photo) An air of puzzled frustration clings to the Biden reelection effort. As the many deficiencies of Donald Trump go on garish display in courtrooms, spur extended bouts of campaign rally aphasia , and generally assail the mediasphere, the consensus view in Bidenland is, “How can we be losing to this guy?” Of course, that’s when the lead Biden strategists aren’t insisting that all the adverse polling numbers that pile up in their inboxes with such worrying frequency are just plain wrong . There’s a set of presuppositions fueling the Biden team’s bewilderment. It’s long been axiomatic, at least among political science savants, that core metrics of economic performance, like overall growth, wage growth, and low unemployment, should all but guarantee an incumbent president’s reelection . Since the economy on Biden’s watch has hit those key benchmarks—historically so in the case of employment—the November presidential balloting should be a coronation. Yes, inflation remains a stubborn obstacle—particularly in the big-ticket housing sector—but it hasn’t gone above the level reached during Ronald Reagan’s commanding “Morning in America” economic pitch in 1984. So where’s the hitch? Politics, that’s where. Fueled in no small part by the core ineptitude of mainstream media economic coverage, an electorate contending with unpredictable upward lurches in consumer pricing reverts to a false but beguiling narrative: Tax-slashing and trade-baiting Donald Trump had presided over a balmy pre-pandemic economy, while regulation-minded and free-spending Joe Biden has botched his handling of it. In reality, of course, economic shifts don’t neatly match up with presidential tenures, and Trump was every bit the deficit monger that Biden is held to be in right-wing folklore—and then some . However misguided this retrospective account of economic switchbacks and reversals may be, it does little political good to grouse about its unfairness. Instead, it has to be met head-on with a more persuasive narrative, detailing how the Biden White House has husbanded broadly distributed prosperity—and more important still, its active role in countering the grasping villainy of a callous and overindulged economic oligarchy. As Henry Adams long ago noted, politics is the organization of hatreds, and Team Biden’s economic messengers need to round up some targets of economic populist rancor pronto. Fortunately, it’s a target-rich environment. Indeed, the Trump campaign has graciously crafted a perfect opening for such a message. As The Washington Post reported late last week , Trump hosted a premium donor confab for oil industry executives, and made them a baldly transactional pitch: Fork over a billion dollars (yes, that’s billion with a “b”) for my reelection, and I will rescind a wide range of Biden environmental regulations, thwarting the widespread rollout of electric vehicles and unleashing a reckless and destructive wave of industry profiteering. Even by the debauched standards of post– Citizens United campaign finance law, Trump’s overture was stunning—though of course, still technically legal, in all likelihood. Not since the ill-starred presidency of Warren Harding has an aspiring chief executive auctioned off energy policy to the highest bidders—and here Trump was doing it as a de facto cattle call to Big Oil’s lead proprietors, over Mar-a-Lago platters of chopped steak. What’s more, the same energy profiteers Trump was romancing en masse are conveniently some of the biggest engineers behind the supply-chain inflation that continues to upend the consumer economy. Studies of the wave of corporate “ greedflation ” artificially driving prices further upward in the wake of the pandemic lockdowns have identified energy concerns as the lead offenders—who, as a direct result, realized some of the greatest profits from those inflationary surges. And that rash of price gouging was further abetted by the forces of paper speculation —hedge funds, principally—that have long sent energy prices skyward . Current Issue December 2025 Issue Trump’s open-air policy auction was so egregious that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, led by ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), have opened up a probe into its details—though, since they are not in the House majority, they won’t be able to compel industry cooperation with subpoena powers. Still, Raskin’s efforts had previously unearthed $7.8 million in illicit payments to Trump family businesses from foreign nationals—a blatant violation of the Emoluments Clause, and ample cause for a third Trump impeachment, had other congressional Democratic leaders been able to sustain any sort of focus on the systematic corruption of the country’s political economy. And Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R,I,), chair of the Senate Budget Committee, has given preliminary indications that he might turn his panel’s attention to Trump’s quid pro quo proposal to the oil barons. Welcome as these congressional inquiries are, they shouldn’t be what’s driving public attention to the moneyed corruption of the MAGA grift: That has to be the prime directive of the Biden campaign. As Celinda Lake, a pollster for the Democratic National Committee who worked on Biden’s 2020 campaign, told Guardian columnist Stephen Greenhouse , the Biden campaign needs to reverse the logic of its economic pitch: “They tend to start the message with their accomplishments. They need to start the message with the overall narrative and then go to their accomplishments.” The key ingredient of that narrative, she said, is the very sort of bad economic actors whom Trump is courting. “We need to have a dramatic framing that we’re going to take on villains to make the economy work for you and your family,” said Lake. “The villains can be a lot of things—corporations that don’t pay any taxes or drug companies that make record profits while they gouge you on prices.” Or oil companies who’ve been responsible for driving up the cost of living throughout the economy—and are now apparently in cahoots with Trump to fatten their bottom lines further at the expense of the environment and the urgent demands of climate-change mitigation. When Biden has taken up the cry of greedflation, as he did during his State of the Union address, he tends to focus on nudge-style efforts at piecemeal reform, such as curbing the shrinkage of volume in snack packaging or rescinding junk airline and hotel fees—just the sort of gnat-straining wonkery that Lake and other Democratic pollsters caution against. Biden needs to make oil industry CEOs the face of the corporate brigandry that Trump would sanction in a second term—and then drive the point home by underlining the pain that feckless Trump policies such as his proposed across-the-board 10 percent tariff would create for working families. When Franklin Roosevelt—the Democratic President Biden would like most to be compared to—mounted his own reelection campaign in 1936, he thundered from the convention podium that he had won the hatred of the Depression economy’s predatory financial class, and that he gleefully “welcome[d] their hatred.” How far is Biden from that sort of appeal? When the Post reporters Josh Dawsey and Maxine Joselow were working on their scoop on the oil barons’ Mar-a-Lago orgy, they solicited a comment from Biden’s campaign—who turned them down, only to deliver a pro forma statement once the story blew up online. You can rest assured that FDR is looking down from economic populist heaven through his pince-nez—and wincing.

Instead, it has to be met head-on with a more persuasive narrative, detailing how the Biden White House has husbanded broadly distributed prosperity—and more important still, its active role in countering the grasping villainy of a callous and overindulged economic oligarchy. As Henry Adams long ago noted, politics is the organization of hatreds, and Team Biden’s economic messengers need to round up some targets of economic populist rancor pronto. Fortunately, it’s a target-rich environment. Indeed, the Trump campaign has graciously crafted a perfect opening for such a message. As The Washington Post reported late last week , Trump hosted a premium donor confab for oil industry executives, and made them a baldly transactional pitch: Fork over a billion dollars (yes, that’s billion with a “b”) for my reelection, and I will rescind a wide range of Biden environmental regulations, thwarting the widespread rollout of electric vehicles and unleashing a reckless and destructive wave of industry profiteering. Even by the debauched standards of post– Citizens United campaign finance law, Trump’s overture was stunning—though of course, still technically legal, in all likelihood. Not since the ill-starred presidency of Warren Harding has an aspiring chief executive auctioned off energy policy to the highest bidders—and here Trump was doing it as a de facto cattle call to Big Oil’s lead proprietors, over Mar-a-Lago platters of chopped steak. What’s more, the same energy profiteers Trump was romancing en masse are conveniently some of the biggest engineers behind the supply-chain inflation that continues to upend the consumer economy. Studies of the wave of corporate “ greedflation ” artificially driving prices further upward in the wake of the pandemic lockdowns have identified energy concerns as the lead offenders—who, as a direct result, realized some of the greatest profits from those inflationary surges. And that rash of price gouging was further abetted by the forces of paper speculation —hedge funds, principally—that have long sent energy prices skyward . Current Issue December 2025 Issue Trump’s open-air policy auction was so egregious that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, led by ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), have opened up a probe into its details—though, since they are not in the House majority, they won’t be able to compel industry cooperation with subpoena powers. Still, Raskin’s efforts had previously unearthed $7.8 million in illicit payments to Trump family businesses from foreign nationals—a blatant violation of the Emoluments Clause, and ample cause for a third Trump impeachment, had other congressional Democratic leaders been able to sustain any sort of focus on the systematic corruption of the country’s political economy. And Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R,I,), chair of the Senate Budget Committee, has given preliminary indications that he might turn his panel’s attention to Trump’s quid pro quo proposal to the oil barons. Welcome as these congressional inquiries are, they shouldn’t be what’s driving public attention to the moneyed corruption of the MAGA grift: That has to be the prime directive of the Biden campaign. As Celinda Lake, a pollster for the Democratic National Committee who worked on Biden’s 2020 campaign, told Guardian columnist Stephen Greenhouse , the Biden campaign needs to reverse the logic of its economic pitch: “They tend to start the message with their accomplishments. They need to start the message with the overall narrative and then go to their accomplishments.” The key ingredient of that narrative, she said, is the very sort of bad economic actors whom Trump is courting. “We need to have a dramatic framing that we’re going to take on villains to make the economy work for you and your family,” said Lake. “The villains can be a lot of things—corporations that don’t pay any taxes or drug companies that make record profits while they gouge you on prices.” Or oil companies who’ve been responsible for driving up the cost of living throughout the economy—and are now apparently in cahoots with Trump to fatten their bottom lines further at the expense of the environment and the urgent demands of climate-change mitigation. When Biden has taken up the cry of greedflation, as he did during his State of the Union address, he tends to focus on nudge-style efforts at piecemeal reform, such as curbing the shrinkage of volume in snack packaging or rescinding junk airline and hotel fees—just the sort of gnat-straining wonkery that Lake and other Democratic pollsters caution against. Biden needs to make oil industry CEOs the face of the corporate brigandry that Trump would sanction in a second term—and then drive the point home by underlining the pain that feckless Trump policies such as his proposed across-the-board 10 percent tariff would create for working families. When Franklin Roosevelt—the Democratic President Biden would like most to be compared to—mounted his own reelection campaign in 1936, he thundered from the convention podium that he had won the hatred of the Depression economy’s predatory financial class, and that he gleefully “welcome[d] their hatred.” How far is Biden from that sort of appeal? When the Post reporters Josh Dawsey and Maxine Joselow were working on their scoop on the oil barons’ Mar-a-Lago orgy, they solicited a comment from Biden’s campaign—who turned them down, only to deliver a pro forma statement once the story blew up online. You can rest assured that FDR is looking down from economic populist heaven through his pince-nez—and wincing.

    "article_text": "The U.S. economy is slowing, but not crashing. In the dismal science , this is what counts as good news. That’s the message I took away from the latest inflation data , released May 15, 2024, which showed U.S. consumer prices rising 3.4% in the 12 months to April 2024. This is down slightly from the 3.5% year-over-year increase reported in March 2024. In other words, while prices are rising, they’re not going up as sharply as they once were. That’s good news for shoppers; the U.S. economy is far from the 9.1% annual inflation seen in June 2022. While energy and shelter prices increased in April, these gains were relatively modest. Meanwhile, food prices remained steady compared to last year and even declined by 0.2% compared to March. What’s more, people in the market for a car were in luck: New and used vehicle prices fell 0.4% and 6.9%, respectively, in April. The “core” consumer price index — which doesn’t include volatile food and energy prices and is often considered better at predicting future inflation than so-called “headline” CPI figures — is also down slightly. After posting a year-over-year increase of 3.9% in January and 3.8% in February and March, it slowed to 3.6% in April. So the overall report is relatively positive: It didn’t show the uptick in inflation that many consumers feared, and reported inflation rates were actually slightly lower than market expectations. As an economist , I see this data report as yet more evidence that economic growth is slowing — in a good way. The economy grew at a lower-than-expected 1.6% rate in the first quarter of 2024, according to the most recent gross domestic product data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The most recent jobs report also showed a slowdown in hiring , and the latest data on job vacancies similarly showed the labor market cooling off . Why the Fed is paying close attention The Federal Reserve’s main objective is to strike a balance between two goals : maintaining stable employment and ensuring price stability. It does this by managing and influencing interest rates. Lowering rates stimulates the economy, which encourages economic growth and job creation – but that can fuel inflation. Raising rates does the opposite: Economic growth slows, which dampens inflation, but also hinders employment. So, when inflation started increasing dramatically after the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve responded with a two-year campaign of rate hikes – they’re currently at a 23-year high . Since this raises the cost of borrowing, investors and potential homebuyers are keen for the Fed to dial back its rates. After May’s report, I don’t believe the Federal Reserve will be in any rush to cut interest rates from their current elevated level. There’s a slowdown, to be sure, but the slowdown is so steady that it’s not pulling prices down in any rapid fashion. This is no doubt frustrating for the Fed — which has an inflation target of 2% — as well as for potential homebuyers. But it’s evidence that the economy is stable at the moment. Inflation isn’t surging, and consumer spending, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is still growing. In March, consumer spending increased 5.8% year over year , up from February’s 4.9% rate. All eyes on the American shopper Going forward, hopes for a “ soft landing ” — economist-speak for when the Fed slows inflation without triggering a recession — will depend in large measure on U.S. shoppers. Consumer spending makes up roughly two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product. If American shoppers suddenly stop spending, then inflation will slow considerably, job vacancies will evaporate, and gross domestic product could contract. At that point, the Fed will turn attention away from inflation and toward economic stimulus, and rates will fall. I mention this because a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed a troubling uptick in consumer credit card delinquency rates . If much of the recent increase in consumer spending is due to Americans relying more on credit cards, then the economy could be on shakier ground than it appears. The good news is that delinquency rates are still way below where they were ahead of the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 through June 2009 . So, while this data may be troubling, there’s no need to panic just yet. In short, while inflation rates still aren’t to the Fed’s liking, the economy – for now – appears to be on a stable path."

    "article_text": "Photo: Dutch News The Dutch economy contracted by -0.1% in the first quarter of 2024, against the forecasts of economists who had expected a slight growth. The national statistics agency CBS said static exports in goods and services and a weak industrial sector were the main reasons for the decline, but government and consumer spending remained relatively strong. The Netherlands emerged from recession at the end of 2023 with 0.3% growth in the final quarter, after nine months of negative figures. But the latest figures show the Dutch economy lagging behind Belgium, which grew by 0.3% in the first quarter, France and Germany, which recorded 0.2% growth, and the UK, which was up by 0.6%. The 27 EU countries grew by 0.3%. On a year-on-year basis the Dutch economy shrank by 0.7%, mainly as a result of the downturn in the middle two quarters of 2023. Pieter Hein van Mulligen, chief economist at the CBS, said industry had endured its worst three-month spell in 15 years , while the construction sector also had a poor start to the year. More investment But he said there were also positive signs, such as a 0.4% increase in investments. “It seems businesses are still optimistic enough to start ordering machinery and transport equipment again,” he said. Consumer spending was up by 0.7%, while government spending increased by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2024. Households spent more money on clothing, shoes and holiday flights, but relatively little on energy and fuel, partly reflecting the mild winter weather. The CBS said consumer spending increased year-on-year by 0.4% in March , continuing a rising trend that began in October, and conditions for April were more favourable. Exports decline However, exports of goods were down by nearly 6% from the previous year, the 10th consecutive month that the figure has been negative. The biggest decline was in exports of food, chemicals, electronics and machinery. Goods account for around three-quarters of all Dutch exports. Van Mulligen said the Dutch national bank DNB’s forecast of 0.3% growth for the year was still attainable. “We’re seeing consumers loosening the purse strings and the jobs market is doing well too,” he said. “In the first quarter we gained just over 40,000 extra jobs.” Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.

Home Depot reports earnings on Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2023. Home Depot's sales continued to soften in the first quarter as the nation's largest home improvement retailer not only was constrained by high mortgage rates and customers dealing with inflation concerns, but it also had to deal with a delayed start to spring. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File) (Nam Y. Huh, Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Home Depot's sales continued to soften in the first quarter as the nation's largest home improvement retailer was not only constrained by high mortgage rates and higher inflation for its customers, but it also had to deal with a delayed start to spring. Sales slipped 2.3% to $36.42 billion for the period ended April 28, just shy of the $36.65 billion that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected. It was the third consecutive quarter of declining sales for the retailers, which saw sales skyrocket during the pandemic. Recommended Videos Customer transactions dipped 1% in the quarter, with shoppers also spending a bit less, averaging $90.68 per receipt compared with $91.92 a year earlier. Sales at store open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, declined 2.8% globally, and 3.2% in the U.S. Last week the average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell for the first time in a month, a slight relief for home shoppers already facing the challenges of rising housing prices and a shortage of homes for sale. The modest pullback followed a five-week string of increases that pushed the average rate to its highest level since November 30. When mortgage rates rise, they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, limiting how much homebuyers can afford. Americans are pulling back on large home remodeling projects, like bathrooms and kitchens, and that is hitting Home Depot, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “Many more households are reluctant to undertake activity due to financial constraints or the higher cost of using credit to pay for work,\" Saunders said in an email. “We are also detecting some hesitation among consumers who hope to move in the future so do not want to undertake big improvement projects in the homes they currently live in.” While people are still spending money on less expensive home decor projects, Saunders says Home Depot faces more competition in that area from garden centers, paint specialists and others and consumers are shopping around for the best bargains and deals. The professional side of Home Depot's business is stronger, but Saunders says there's still some pockets of softness. “Overall, Home Depot remains a formidable business. The current challenges are all caused by a period of churn in the consumer economy rather than by any missteps the company has made. Even so, we think the year ahead will be one of continued reset,” he said. Home Depot remains focused on the strength of the professional builder and contractor side of its business and catering to the needs of those customers. In March Home Depot announced that it was buying SRS Distribution, a materials provider for professionals, in a deal valued at approximately $18.25 billion including debt. SRS provides materials for professionals like roofers, landscapers and pool contractors. Ann-Marie Campbell, senior executive vice president, said during the company's conference call that later this year, Home Depot will provide a way for professionals to be able to have big, bulky items and other goods that need be returned picked up at their job sites. “This is a massive win not only for pros but also for associates and our stores, and will drive better customer satisfaction and greater store productivity,” she said. For the first quarter, Home Depot Inc. earned $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per share, down from the $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, it earned in the same period last year. But that was better than the $3.61 per share that Wall Street expected. The Atlanta company maintained its fiscal full-year forecast for total sales growth of about 1%, which includes a 53rd week. It still anticipates same-store sales falling approximately 1% for the 52-week period. Shares declined slightly in afternoon trading on Tuesday. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

    "article_text": "We are entering a crucial period for financial markets and forecasters as Americans' near-term inflation expectations rise again. Upcoming reports on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for April, along with new data on retail sales and industrial production, will provide valuable insights into the second quarter's real GDP and consumer spending growth, helping to shape expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and longer-term interest rates. A primary question the new data will address is whether current economic activity represents genuine growth or is merely an inflationary illusion. There is currently a disparity between GDP forecasts from the Atlanta Fed and the New York Fed, reflecting uncertainty about the economy's strength. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast for Q2 has surged to 4.18% annualized, while the New York Fed’s Nowcast has decreased to 2.23%. Both estimates exceed most economist growth forecasts which assumes further weakening in consumer spending and labour market growth in the coming months. Rapidly rising consumer prices are eating into spending power, with recent substantial price hikes in retail gasoline and other commodities suggesting another high monthly inflation reading. In April, significant increases in the ISM Manufacturing and ISM Services prices-paid indexes pointed to rekindled inflationary pressures. Moreover, consumer one-year inflation expectations rose to 3.5% in May from 3.2% in April and 2.9% in March, according to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey which could be the canary. The CPI data for April will be a focal point for markets, with an expected 0.4% increase in the headline measure for the third consecutive month, and a slight deceleration in the core measure to 0.3%. Year-over-year headline and core inflation rates are projected to moderate to 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively, primarily due to favorable base effects rather than real progress on near-term inflation. Consequently, a \"hot\" April CPI report is unlikely to change the FOMC's view that inflation remains too high. As Fed Chair Jay Powell has stated, “inflation remains too high, and the path to bringing it down is not assured.” Therefore, while high consumer inflation is unlikely to trigger another rate hike, it will likely keep the Fed on a cautious, data-dependent path over the summer and fall. April retail sales, released concurrently with the CPI report, are expected to show minimal growth against rising prices. Advance retail sales are forecast to rise 0.4%, matching the inflation rate, but excluding vehicle and gasoline sales, growth plummets to 0.1%. In inflation-adjusted terms, retail sales excluding motor vehicles and gas may actually decline by 0.3%. With personal savings rates now well below pre-pandemic levels at 3.2%, rising delinquency rates on autos and credit cards, and falling consumer confidence, robust consumer spending seems increasingly unsustainable at current restrictive interest rates. In summary, this week’s reports are likely to depict a second-quarter economic environment where real GDP and consumer demand are slowing to a more sustainable pace, while inflation remains persistent. This scenario may allow for potential rate cuts from the Fed later in the year, possibly by September, despite the near-term inflation outlook remaining uncertain.

    "article_text": "Photo Essay: “My Hourly Wage” Posted by Cindy Carter | May 13, 2024 As the Chinese economy continues to recover from the long pandemic (and post-pandemic) slowdown, wages in many industries remain stagnant , and economic- and job-related insecurity runs high. This is particularly true for workers who occupy a more precarious position in the economic structure: migrant workers, temporary workers, and hourly-wage workers. A recent report by Yang Shengli, Liu Jinpan, and Wang Haiyan of Hebei University’s School of Economics forecast that unemployment among China’s migrant workers will peak in 2027 , which could have enormous implications for labor unrest, social stability, population movement, and economic well-being in China. At the same time, China is experiencing both deflationary and inflationary pressures, albeit in different areas of the consumer economy. The recent online popularity of the term “winner-take-all” (通杀, tōngshā) illustrates the effects of both inflation and deflation on working-class pocketbooks. The term was originally used to describe games of chance in which the banker, house, or a single player executes a “massacre” of all the other players, i.e. impoverishing all of the other players by taking their money. More recently, it has been used to describe a situation in which prices for food and other essentials are rising, while the prices of luxury goods and services—far beyond the reach of working-class or middle-class workers anyway—are falling. The rich are reaping the benefits of deflation and getting richer, while the poor are grappling with inflation for essential goods ( including utilities ) and getting poorer. “My Hourly Wage,” a recent photo essay from Chinese-language media outlet Why Not ( 歪脑, wāinǎo ), illustrates this phenomenon in vivid detail by juxtaposing photos of various people in their work environments with details on their hourly wage and an illustration of the purchasing power of that hourly wage. For each job, the occupational hazards are also listed: among these are long periods spent outside, excessive overtime , exposure to dangerous chemicals or particulates, and the risk of traffic

Generate Key Takeaways Russian President Vladimir Putin’s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country’s defense ministry with someone widely seen as a competent technocrat. That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry of Defense from Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012. Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia’s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia’s economy. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Putin’s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,” Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X . “Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.” Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia. Russia's President Vladimir Putin, center-right, with Sergei Shoigu, at Red Square for the Victory Day military parade in central Moscow on May 9, 2024. - Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition: NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly three times more artillery shells per year than the US and Europe for Ukraine. Having a competent economic manager at the top of the defense ministry can be an asset for Putin, especially when the US Congress has finally turned on the taps of more military aid to Ukraine and as Russia presses forward with a new advance along Ukraine’s northeastern border. Whether that advance represents a new front for Russia or an effort to divert Ukrainian forces remains unclear, but it puts more pressure on Kyiv as its allies rush to deliver more weaponry. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The appointment of Belousov could also represent house-cleaning at the Ministry of Defense. In recent weeks, the ministry has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and arrest of a former deputy to Shoigu. A game of musical chairs Prokopenko, who is one of the most perceptive observers of the Russian economy, described Belousov as “well-versed in military-industrial complex matters” in her thread on X, adding that he “embodies Stolypin-esque statesmanship,” a reference to the reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who led an effort to overhaul and modernize Russia’s inefficient economy after its humiliating military defeat by Japan in 1905. But the reality may be more complex. Putin has shifted Shoigu sideways to a post as the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, meaning that Shoigu is not completely out of the picture. Discussing Shoigu’s new appointment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the former defense minister would remain immersed in matters of military production. But competent management of the wartime economy is now key: Peskov noted that defense spending is approaching 7% of Russian GDP, close to the level seen in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when military priorities and central planning strangled the consumer economy and stifled technological innovation. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Today on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,” Peskov said in a call with reporters Sunday. “And therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.” The appointment of a civilian to the defense ministry, then, does not signal a less hawkish approach to the war in Ukraine. General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia’s General Staff and one of the architects of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, remains in place. The top echelons of power remain committed to Putin’s brand of personalistic rule — and Putin’s goal of subjugating Ukraine. Nevertheless, the newest government shakeup does hint at a potential future power struggle among Russia’s elite. With Shoigu’s new appointment, Nikolai Patrushev, the previous Secretary of the Security Council, was relieved of his position and is “due to a transfer to another job,” according to Peskov. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Patrushev represents a class known as the siloviki — the men of power who graduated from the ranks of the Soviet security services. A former head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Patrushev has been one of the more hardline members of Putin’s inner circle. And the Patrushev family name has often come up in speculation about who may be next in line to the throne after Putin dies — because, as the Russian president begins a fifth term of office, smart money has him staying on as president-for-life. Putin has no clear successor (if he dies or is incapacitated while in office, his duties will be assumed temporarily by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin), but Kremlin-watchers keep a running list of potential aspirants for a successor. Dmitry Patrushev, the son of the former security council chief, is sometimes described as one of the “princelings” who are waiting; the younger Patrushev was just made a deputy prime minister in the latest reshuffle. Despite the changes at the top, there is no sense that the overall goals of the Kremlin — pursuing the war on Ukraine and continuing a confrontation with the West — have changed. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Putin’s primary objective is to enhance the state’s capacity to support military needs more effectively, while most elements of the existing ‘structure’ will stay intact,” wrote political observer Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder and CEO of the analytical group R.Politik, on X. So the music may be spinning faster inside the Kremlin, but the same loyal contenders are playing musical chairs. For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com About Our Ads"

DEMAND AND SUPPLY - Boo Chanco - The Philippine Star May 13, 2024 | 12:00am The peso is skidding again and no one is paying attention anymore. That’s probably the only reasonable reaction because we can’t do anything about it anyway. The peso’s value against the dollar is largely dependent on the US Federal Reserve and how it moves on its interest rate policy. Because many fear the US has not licked inflation just yet, any relaxation of interest rates may not happen before the US elections in November. So, the peso is bound to get weaker than its current 57.46 exchange rate vs the US dollar. Back in May 2021, the peso was trading at P47.95. Then it went as low as 58.82 in October 2022. Last week, it was reported that the BSP had been quietly propping up the peso after it breached the 57 level. But it was explained by BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. that “We were active in small amounts – not to affect the value but to maintain orderly markets… We all know this is a case of a strong dollar as many other currencies have also weakened. So not very strong grounds for significant intervention.” The peso has fallen to 17-month lows in recent weeks and there are implications on our inflation because of our high dependence on imported food, notably rice. More than a fourth of the country’s foodstuffs are now imported to include chicken, pork, onions, beef, milk. But because our OFWs are fueling our strong consumer-driven economy, their families back home will be getting more pesos for every dollar remitted. A good part of that will be spent to cover rising food prices. As for the BPO industry, the other leg of our economy, the strong dollar is good news. A Bloomberg article noted that “The Philippine peso has weakened nearly four percent this year and emerged as Asia’s worst performer since the start of the second quarter. That’s burnished the appeal of the Southeast Asian nation as a cost-effective destination for business process outsourcing… placing the industry on course to become the nation’s top foreign exchange earner by 2026.” BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, is forecasting “the Philippine peso to depreciate only by one percent against the US dollar, from an average of 55.63/USD in 2023 to 56.00/USD in 2024. It is a relatively stable outcome compared with a depreciation of 11 percent in 2022 and two percent in 2023.” They also have “a positive outlook for consumer spending in the Philippines in 2024.” But cautioned that “the key risks to this outlook include prolonged inflation; decrease in remittances, which fluctuate as a result of external market conditions including depreciation of the peso; weakening of the domestic economy; and geo-political tensions in the Middle East (the Israel-Iran conflict) which can create oil price shocks that can result in higher overall inflation and potential rise in interest rates.” BMI also noted that “consumer confidence in the Philippines remains sluggish, although there has been some upward momentum as the market continues to recover from the pandemic years, when consumer confidence sank to a low of -54.5. In Q1 2024 (latest data available), consumer confidence stood at -10.9 vs Q4 2023 reading of -19.0, which was the lowest reading since Q4 2021.” BMI thinks foodgrain inflation will subside by the end of Q2 2024 as the El Niño weather pattern responsible for deficit supply will end by that time. But that may be unlikely since the Department of Agriculture has yet to implement reforms in the food logistics system now in the hands of traders who take advantage of problematic situations like what we have now. How will our consumer driven economy react to all these? BMI thinks that “consumers still need to get acclimatized to higher than usual inflation in the short term. Additionally, if nominal income growth doesn’t keep pace with inflation, purchasing power of consumers will deteriorate which would be a drag to their spending. Prolonged inflation, particularly in foodgrains, will mean that consumers will have to increasingly allocate more of their disposable income toward meeting basic necessities…Risks to our consumer spending forecasts stem from the possibility that inflation remains elevated for longer than we currently forecast, potentially eroding purchasing power…” In other words, BMI is optimistic but very cautiously so. Goodbye Sofitel Philippine Plaza My wife won a gift certificate for an overnight stay at Sofitel Philippine Plaza during a raffle at their STC high school homecoming. The gift certificate was expiring in a week so we checked-in last Thursday. Little did I know it was the hotel that was expiring. I saw the news as soon as I switched on the hotel WiFi on my iPhone. Apparently, my son who was on a business trip in NYC read that too, especially the part about the hotel’s structural damage and told my grandson. When we called my grandson in Singapore, he was worried about the danger to us being there. My friend Stella Arnaldo of Business Mirror went beyond the press release to tell us the hotel’s closure is a business decision after failing to get a lease extension. The hotel owners apparently want to do a major rehab to, among others, fix the structural problem in the over 50-year-old hotel that was constructed in a hurry on freshly reclaimed land by Imelda. But they want a longer period for the lease, beyond the 17 years remaining, to recoup an estimated P8.6-billion rehab cost. They have to close down now for safety reasons as they experienced bursting water pipes, gas leaks and other problems. So, what will GSIS do with an empty hotel that has lost value after Sofitel leaves? The hotel looked fully booked during our stay. So many people at the pool area and the breakfast buffet. We experienced excellent service from the staff. Other hotels should start hiring them now. Boo Chanco’s email address is [email protected] .

    "article_text": "RBC is out with its monthly Canadian consumer spending tracker and the picture is positive, with spending increasing across almost all categories. Retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, experienced significant growth during the month, largely driven by an uptick in home-related purchases, sporting goods, and clothing. These trends indicate a broader seasonal trend as Canadians prepare for summer, according to the April spending tracker from RBC. The metric is based on the credit card data of Canada's largest bank. They noted that spending on the category of home furnishings, renovation materials, and garden supplies saw its first notable increase in a year, while building materials accounted for nearly a third of April’s overall spending increase. Other strength was in hotels and restaurants. The lone categories that saw decreases were groceries, gasoline, and miscellaneous goods. Overall, RBC doesn't think the strength in spending will last: April RBC consumer spending data marked a stronger start to Q2 than we expected. But one month does not make a trend. We are cautiously optimistic that consumer activity will improve this year- as adjustment to higher rates hits households less hard in 2024. The question is- will consumer optimism prevail into summer? Labour market headwinds have been building with the unemployment rate up one full percentage point from a year ago and layoffs rising in recent months. A ramp up of business insolvencies in Q1 alongside higher household credit delinquency rates add to these headwinds. We continue to expect consumer spending to pick up in the back half of the year once BoC cuts are underway, likely starting in June"

    "article_text": "The retail industry is going through a tough time as it copes with inflation-weary consumers and a rash of bankruptcies, prompting chains to announce the closures of almost 3,200 brick-and-mortar stores so far in 2024, according to a new analysis. That's a 24% increase from a year ago, according to a report from retail data provider CoreSight, which tracks store closures and openings across the U.S. Although some retailers are planning to expand this year, major chains have announced 4% fewer openings compared with a year earlier, the analysis found. Blame changing consumer habits, as well as retailers' management struggles and bankruptcies, with the latter impacting companies including Rite Aid and Rue21. The largest number of store closures stems from Dollar Tree's announcement earlier this year that it plans to close more than 600 Family Dollar locations in 2024, with the discount store citing the impact of inflation on its customers as well as an increase in shoplifting. \"A lot of this year's closures are related to bankruptcies of chains that have been in trouble for a while, like Rite Aid and Rue21,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also seeing several retailers, like Family Dollar, take action to weed out underperforming locations.\" Although consumer spending has remained solid this year, there are \"pockets of softness creeping in, and retailers want to ensure they are in good financial shape to weather any challenges\" Saunders added. \"That means optimizing store portfolios.\" Brick-and-mortar retailers are also struggling with ongoing competition from online rivals such as Amazon.com. By contrast, some companies blundered strategically, such as Express, which filed for bankruptcy last month and announced plans to close 100 of its 500 locations. The clothing chain, known for its workplace fashion, failed to connect with consumers after the pandemic ushered in working from home, Saunders said. That put the company \"firmly on the wrong side of trends and, in our view, the chain made too little effort to adapt,\" he said in a recent research note. Are consumers cutting back? Recent data shows that Americans are still opening their wallets. Consumer spending in March rose 0.8% (the most recent data available), which economists say represents solid growth. But some signs consumers are starting to fade amid a modest economic slowdown. On Friday, the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumer sentiment index for May dropped to 67.4, the largest monthly decline since mid-2021. Confidence is dipping because of expectations for higher inflation and softer growth, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in an email. \"Uncertainty about the inflation path could suppress consumer spending in the coming months,\" he noted. Consumers have also spent down any remaining extra money they socked away during the pandemic, when federal stimulus checks and other benefits bolstered their bank accounts, Roach said in an earlier report. \"[T]here are potential risks to consumer spending,\" he said. \"When households exhaust these accumulated savings, it could lead to a decline in discretionary spending.\" Even so, some retailers are planning to open hundreds of new stores, CoreSight found. Dollar General, a rival of Dollar Tree, said it will add more than 800 locations this year, putting it at the top of the list of retailers opening new stores this year, according to the research firm. In second place is 7-Eleven, which plans to open more than 270 U.S. locations this year, followed by discount store Five Below, with plans to open 227 outlets, the analysis found.

    "article_text": "ADVERTISEMENT OnePlus partners with JioMart Digital in India to increase its offline retail presence Post your comment Comments (8) Prasad 10 May 2024 OnePlus Android OnePlus today announced that it is partnering with retailer JioMart Digital in India to increase its retail presence in the country. Going forward, OnePlus products will now be available across 2000+ cities and towns in India. JioMart Digital is a chain of retail stores owned by Reliance that specializes in electronics. The brand has over 100k+ retail stores across the country with greater presence in smaller towns and areas not often covered by online retailers. \"As we continue to extend our range of OnePlus products across the JioMart Digital store network, we are positive that our community and consumers at large will continue to truly benefit from this opportunity by being able to easily access and gain a personalized experience of our OnePlus devices at their nearest retail outlets.\", said Ranjeet Singh, Director of Sales at OnePlus. This partnership comes just under a month after the Organized Retailers Association (ORA) and the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) in India threatened to stop sales of OnePlus products across retail outlets due to allegations of the brand not supplying enough stock, giving them poorer margins, not handling service claims properly, and not engaging the retailers with visits from promoters and people demoing the new products. The ORA and AIMRA feel brands like OnePlus often prioritize sales from their online partners over offline retail partners. OnePlus has since provided assurances that it will be working with retail partners to address highlighted issues. With this announcement, it seems tensions have been smoothened out for now.

(Reuters/Adrian Portugal/File Photo_ SPONSORED ARTICLES How logistics industry experts plan to ‘move forward’ after COVID-19 Reasons why Filipinos love Korean culture and products Why Batangas is the destination for budget-friendly family holidays Weak consumer spending offsets rebound in exports Inflation dampens domestic demand Economy remains resilient, says economic minister Q1 reinforces expectations policy rates to stay on hold MANILA (Updated 4:40 p.m.) — The Philippine economy accelerated less than expected in the first quarter as weaker consumer spending restrained growth, reinforcing expectations that the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged next week, despite rising inflation. Gross domestic product grew 5.7% in the first three months from the same period last year, the statistics agency said on Thursday, up from the previous quarter’s 5.5% but below the 5.9% forecast in a Reuters poll. The Southeast Asian nation’s government remains optimistic about growth, said Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, including a strong rebound in exports fuelled by a recovery in shipments of electronic products. “Despite our challenges on both domestic and international fronts, our economy continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and growth,” Balisacan told a press conference. “We are in good shape.” On a seasonally adjusted basis, growth slowed to 1.3% from 2.1% in the previous three months, although this was above the 1.0% growth forecast in the Reuters poll. Balisacan expressed confidence the economy can hit the government’s 6.0%-7.0% full-year growth target, but not everyone shared the minister’s optimism. Capital Economics stuck to its 5.5% growth forecast for 2024, saying in a note that an anticipated global slowdown could dampen export demand and remittances from Philippine workers overseas, a key driver of consumer spending. Inflation quickened for a third straight month in April, continuing to curb domestic demand, which grew 4.6% in the first quarter, the weakest since a 4.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2021. “The weaker domestic demand picture, coupled with moderate overall growth, strengthens the case that the central bank is likely to maintain current interest rates at its upcoming meeting,” Robert Dan Roces, chief economist at Manila-based Security Bank, said in a note. The central bank, which meets on May 16, has held its benchmark rate PHCBIR=ECI at a 17-year high 6.5% at its last four meetings. — Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales and Mikhail Flores in Manila; Writing by Karen Lema; Editing by John Mair and William Mallard Interaksyon"

Wed, 08 May, 2024 - 14:01 Ronan Smyth       Consumer spending in Dublin grew by 2.9% during the first three months of the year, outpacing the rest of the country, largely driven by increasing expenditure on entertainment, new data shows. According to the latest MasterCard Spending Pulse report, produced on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, the value of retail spending increased by 2.9% between January and March compared to the same period last year. The rest of the country combined saw consumer spending increase by 2.7% year-on-year in comparison. Entertainment remained the primary driver of growth with an increase of 7.1% compared to last year while spending on necessities grew by 4.4%. Spending on household goods increased by a more modest 2%. Online spending also saw positive growth, up 2.4% year-on-year. However, the report did note that there was a drop in discretionary spending of 0.6% compared to last year. Post-pandemic growth Global Head of Spending Pulse at MasterCard Michael McNamara said growth rates are now “normalising as we move away from the deep declines experienced during the pandemic”. While spending did grow compared to last year, the rate of expansion was at its weakest in three years with the report suggesting that this indicates that “consumer spending patterns are now in a period of relative stability”. Tourism spending returned to growth over the first three months of the year rising 4.7% compared to 2023 but spending by US tourists continued to decline. Spending from this market — which is is very important to the Dublin and national economies — declined by 3.3% compared to the period of October to December last year, which will be of concern heading into the summer season. Spending by tourists from China also saw a decline with a reduction of 23.2% so far this year. On the other hand, spending amongst French tourists rose by over 26% compared to the end of 2023. Spending by UK and German tourists were up 5.5% and 3.3% respectively. It has also been a disappointing start to 2024 for the hospitality sector which saw a 2.5% decline in spending at hotels, bars and restaurants between January and March compared to the end of 2023. What's your view on this issue? You can tell us here According to the latest purchasing manager’s index for Dublin, the private sector saw steady growth during the first three months of the year outpacing growth seen elsewhere in the country. The PMI is a single-figure indicator of a sector’s performance, with any figure greater than 50.0 indicating growth. The PMI for Dublin rose to 53.1 between January and March while the rest of Ireland’s PMI stood at 51.1. This activity growth in Dublin was partly driven by the services sector, with a PMI of 54.1, while the construction sector returned to growth with a PMI of 51.9.

And Granny Retail XRT always has a lot to say about the consumer and the markets. Consumer Spending and Economic Growth : Consumer spending constitutes approximately two-thirds of the U.S. economy. When consumers buy goods and services, it directly contributes to economic growth. A robust and self-sustaining recovery relies on solid growth in consumer spending. However, during the post-recession period, consumer spending has been growing at a modest pace compared to previous recoveries. Factors like gasoline prices impact consumer spending. For instance, rising oil prices lead to higher gasoline costs, reducing families’ disposable income for other purchases. Commodity Pricing and Consumer Spending : Commodity prices, especially oil prices , significantly affect consumer spending. When oil prices rise, families allocate a larger share of their budget to filling up gas tanks, leaving less money for other goods. This reduction in real income due to higher commodity prices can slow down the economy. The Pace of Recovery : With GDP not so great, we have had a slow, moderate pace of expansion since covid . Structural issues, such as housing oversupply and debt burdens, continue to impact the recovery. Job growth is essential for income growth, which, in turn, fuels consumer spending. The Labor market is slowing down. Where consumers allocate their spending: Housing : The largest category of consumer spending in the U.S. is housing , accounting for approximately 3% of total annual expenditures in 2022. This includes rent, mortgage payments, utilities, and home-related expenses. Transportation : Following housing, transportation represents a significant portion of consumer spending, making up 8% of total expenditures. This category covers expenses related to vehicles, fuel, public transportation, and maintenance. Food : Food expenditures account for 8% of total consumer spending. What does the chart tell us about the state of the economy and the markets? With our comments this week on how transportation IYT is a laggard, XRT is doing ok. BUT XRT failed to hold the 50-DMA. While XRT is above the January 6-month calendar range high, it is underperforming the benchmark. Plus, real motion shows no divergence, so that tells us XRT can climb higher from here. However, we must also watch for the recent rally to run its course, forcing XRT back down to test lower levels. Most importantly, is that oil and gas levels have come off from their highs, which helps of course. But can that last? Consumer confidence is lower than it has been.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Tue, May 7, 2024 · 11:40 AM JAPANESE service sector activity grew at the fastest pace in eight months in April thanks to solid business and consumer spending, a private survey showed on Tuesday (May 7), results that should keep the central bank on track to hike rates again this year. The final au Jibun Bank Service purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 54.3 last month, the highest level since August 2023, and up slightly from 54.1 in March. The index has remained above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion since September 2022, but it edged down from the flash reading of 54.6. The survey showed prices charged by firms to their clients increased sharply, with the rate of inflation hitting its highest since April 2014 when the nation raised the sales tax. The firms cited rising expenses from higher wages as the main reason for passing on costs to customers, a fact that will not be lost on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) which has for years urged firms to raise pay at a steady pace to spur consumption. The BOJ, which ended negative interest rates in a landmark decision in March, is expected to hike rates again this year. The central bank has signalled a cautious approach to further tightening due to a fragile economic recovery. The service sector has been a bright spot in an economy that has struggled to mount a broad-based post-Covid revival, helping to offset some of the persistent weakness seen in manufacturing. For policymakers, the strength in business and consumer spending in the latest survey should be welcome news. “April data revealed another strong month for the Japanese service sector as rising business and consumer spending fuelled the fastest upturn in business activity since August 2023,” said Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. New business growth accelerated for the sixth straight month to hit the fastest pace since June 2023, with firms saying that sales were also boosted by robust inbound tourism, the survey showed. SEE ALSO Japanese companies struggle with yen’s continued weakness Bank of Japan upbeat on consumption, service price outlook Japan’s March factory output rises 3.8% vs month earlier Input prices increased at the quickest pace since August due to rising labour costs, as well as higher prices of transport and raw materials, which drove the substantial uptick in prices charged to clients. “Service providers are increasingly seeking to negotiate higher prices charged with clients in response to elevated cost pressures,” Moore said. The composite PMI, which combines the manufacturing and service activity figures, expanded to 52.3 in April, the highest level since August 2023, from 51.7 in March.

    "article_text": "FIS raises annual profit forecast on strong consumer spending Published on 05/06/2024 at 05:15 pm EDT Reuters Share May 6 (Reuters) - Banking and payments processing conglomerate Fidelity National Information Services raised its forecast for annual adjusted profit and posted a 49% jump in its first-quarter profit on Monday, helped by resilient consumer spending. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT Payment processors such as FIS collect transaction fees from financial institutions and businesses that are strongly correlated with consumer spending volume. A tight labor market and rising wages have afforded job security to U.S. residents, allowing them to continue spending on shopping, travel and dining out. KEY QUOTE \"We are off to a very strong start in 2024. This marks the fifth straight quarter of exceeding our financial outlook, and we are pleased with the continued new sales momentum we are seeing across the business,\" said FIS CEO Stephanie Ferris. BY THE NUMBERS - FIS now expects annual adjusted profit per share to be between $4.88 and $4.98, higher than its previous forecast of $4.66 to $4.76. - The company also forecast adjusted profit to be between $1.21 and $1.25 per share in the second quarter, above analysts' average expectation of $1.15 per share, according to LSEG data. - The company's adjusted net income from continuing operations, which includes businesses other than the Worldpay merchant solutions business, rose 49% to $635 million for the quarter ended March 31. - Revenue from the banking solutions business, which offers core processing and transaction processing software to financial institutions, rose 2% from a year earlier to $1.68 billion. MARKET REACTION Shares of the company jumped 3.1% in extended trading. The stock has risen 17.3% so far this year, as of its last close.

He is best known for his economic predictions based on the Economic Confidence Model, which he developed. Eleven states may face capital gain taxes to comply with the Biden Administration’s 2025 budget , in which the government must hunt the people for taxes to pay for a fraction of their spending. The concept of capital gains was not within the original Constitution. The Founding Fathers established a completely new nation in an attempt to flee government tyranny, but yet again, Democracy has fallen into a Republic where the people have no say. Capital gains were introduced in 1913, The 16 th Amendment granted US Congress the power to levy income via taxation, which remained at around 7% until 1921. Congress quickly determined that they needed to extort citizens for more money and created two brackets. The 7% tax became a standard for income tax, but investors who held for over two years, an insignificant amount of time, were punished for saving and forced to pay 12.5% to Washington. Fast forward to 2025, and we are looking at the top marginal rate rising to up to 57.9%! The current capital extortion rate is around a quarter of one’s capital. This idea of hunting down the rich is utter nonsense as it becomes an excuse to eliminate the middle class. The big money can take the risk, but the average investor cannot. This will deter small business investment and entrepreneurs who greatly contribute to innovation as they bring creativity and imagination to business. Naturally, the 11 states are primarily blue. Californians really destroyed their state by voting for Gavin Newsom, and now they may face a top tax of 57.9% to cover the state’s excessive spending and growing deficit. New York and New Jersey, two states that should have stayed red, will face the second-highest capital gain taxation at a rate of 55.5%. These states already pay astronomical taxes on things such as property. Minnesota is looking at a tax of 55.45%, Oregon 54.5%, and Maine 51.75%, with the remaining states (Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Georgia, and Idaho) all facing capital gain extortion rates above 50%. Why on Earth would anyone want to conduct business in these states? If Biden remains in power, it will be a wonder if major corporations continue to choose to do business in the United States at all. Businesses could go literally almost anywhere else and face lower rates of taxation. Additionally, the American consumer has been stretched so thin through dollar devaluation, inflation, and taxation that they are not spending the way they once did. Capitalism is under attack; success is a punishable offense. America’s consumer economy will continue to decline while places like China see their middle class grow and the consumer economy rise. China is not creating worthless spending packages on climate change. Remember, they told us clear as day that the goal is to destroy America’s standing as the world’s leading superpower. Klaus Schwab has been aiming for 2030, but the computer has been honing in on 2032 before Schwab released plans for Agenda 2030. Unfortunately, this is all precisely on schedule as America enjoys its final time in the spotlight as the world’s financial capital. STAY INFORMED!

China is not creating worthless spending packages on climate change. Remember, they told us clear as day that the goal is to destroy America’s standing as the world’s leading superpower. Klaus Schwab has been aiming for 2030, but the computer has been honing in on 2032 before Schwab released plans for Agenda 2030. Unfortunately, this is all precisely on schedule as America enjoys its final time in the spotlight as the world’s financial capital.

PHOTO: EPA-EFE Ven Sreenivasan Follow topic: Stocks and shares Published May 06, 2024, 05:00 AM Updated May 06, 2024, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Last week, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell indicated that after a series of disappointing inflation data, the US central bank is unlikely to cut rates by June. At the same time, he remains convinced that deflationary pressures are still in play, and has no intention of hiking rates. In short, the Fed funds rate could stay unchanged at 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent for the foreseeable future. How the highest rates in 23 years prevailing through much of the second half of 2024 will impact future corporate earnings and consumer spending remains to be seen.

    "article_text": "Wall Street’s most influential mega-investor says migration makes it difficult for developed countries to embrace the high-tech, productivity-boosting technologies that will raise the income of ordinary people. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China , and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, who oversees $10 trillion worth of investments worldwide: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme. “This is a guy who tried very hard to profit off mass migration … and then realized it backfired and now he’s regretting his choices,” said Rosemary Jenks, cofounder of the Immigration Accountability Project . “The United States has a history of proving that you can increase productivity and increase per capita GDP with low immigration –we did that all through the 1950s….. the World War II era until the mid-1960s,” Jenks said. Since the 1960s, “what we have also proven is that mass immigration is a detriment … it reduces per capita GDP, it reduces quality of life, it reduces equality,” Jenks added. Throughout history, labor shortages have bumped up wages, boosted innovation, and reduced economic divides. The economic damage caused by immigration is increasingly recognized in Washington, Jenks said: Obviously not by the Chamber of Commerce — they’re still crying about a labor shortage even though every single economic data point says not — but an increasing number of Republicans recognize that mass migration is not the answer. I think Democrats realize that mass migration is not the answer for our economy — [but] I think they have different reasons for wanting it … [so] I don’t want to give Fink any credit for anything. In recent months, U.S. and foreign economists , policymakers, and politicians have been admitting that mass migration has fueled inflation, housing prices, and interest rates . Worse, economists admit it shrinks CEOs’ willingness to pay for the vital growth in the automation and productivity that allows voters to earn more wages by doing more work each day. Yet President Joe Biden, age 81, is still championing the pro-migration policy touted by investors — who want more low-wage workers, consumers, and renters — and by government progressives. “One of the reasons why our economy is growing is because of you and many others. Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said on April 30, according to a report by a pool reporter. He continued: Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic. They don’t want immigrants! …Immigrants are what makes us strong. Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and just contribute. Biden’s economic strategy of Extraction Migration serves his coalition well — it bumps up stock prices for many investors and imports many poor dependents for federal, state, and local governments. In contrast, President Donald Trump has promised to end illegal migration. But he has not discussed how to revamp legal migration to raise innovation and incomes for white-collar and blue-collar voters, despite the potential for an election-day reward. “The paradigm of negative population growth is going to be changing,” Fink told the World Economic Forum meeting. “The social problems that [we] will have in substituting humans [work] for machines work] is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations.” Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has relied on Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . The policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has damaged small nations , and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

    "article_text": "Woman berates supermarket prices amid cost of living crisis Struggling Britons cut back on beer and meat to make ends meet during the cost of living crisis, according to a new analysis. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT The traditional favourites of barbecue season were the first to be sacrificed when people were looking to do away with non-essentials. Spending has also been reduced on recreation and big ticket purchases for the home, such as washing machines. The details come from an analysis of spending habits using official data by the Financial Times. Consumer spending has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels in Britain, underperforming the US and eurozone. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT READ MORE: Top UK supermarkets record 97% profits as food inflation batters Britons Consumer spending has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels in Britain (Image: Getty) UK households slashed purchases of beer by 15 per cent, confectionery by 10 per cent, meat by 7 per cent, and bread and fruit by 9 per cent each in the two years to the final quarter of 2023, shows an analysis of detailed consumer spending figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The trend partly reflects the impact of the pandemic, together with the fact household finances have hit by a rise in interest rates to a 16-year high. The analysis found people have been spending more but getting less for their money over the two years. Cash spending was up 15 percent over the two years that this purchased 0.5 percent fewer goods. The volume of food purchased by consumers was 8 percent lower, even as spending on groceries increased by 16 percent over the past two years. At the same time households spent 70 percent more on gas to heat their homes, but consumption fell 10 percent as many rationed their use. Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at investment company T Rowe Price, told the FT: “The cost of many essential items, such as energy and food, has risen dramatically in the past two years, and wages have not kept up with the large rise in prices. Given household budget constraints, something had to give.” People have been spending more but getting less for their money over the two years (Image: Getty) He added: “Households had to cut back on many non-essential items such as goods and luxury services”, as well as on energy consumption, and switched away from more expensive branded foodstuffs. UK consumer price inflation peaked at a 42-year high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022, while real wages contracted for most of 2022 and 2023. Inflation dropped to 3.2 per cent in February, but prices remain about 20 per cent above their mid-2021 levels. ONS data shows inflation-adjusted spending on household appliances, such as coffee machines and dishwashers, dropped 19 per cent in the two years to the end of 2023 and was 8 per cent below pre- Covid levels. Real spending on furniture was down 9 per cent, with fewer purchases of cars, plants, jewellery and insurance. Overall, household real spending in the final three months of 2023 was 2.4 per cent below its level in the same period of 2019. This compares with an 8 per cent expansion in the four years to the end of 2019. British households fared worse than others, official data suggests. In the US consumer real spending rose 10 per cent from pre-pandemic levels in the final three months of 2023, and Britain’s performance was weaker than that of the eurozone and Canada. The sharper contraction in consumer spending in the UK “was probably largely due to the UK’s higher and longer-lasting inflation problem”, said Ruth Gregory, economist at research company Capital Economics. She added: “The UK had the worst of both worlds, a big energy shock like the eurozone and worse labour shortages like the US.” Mark Boyd-Boland, partner at consultancy LEK, said that in addition to cutting discretionary spending, consumers had “sought to moderate what they bought at the grocery store”, buying “a few less of the nice things” and downgrading to supermarket own-label items.

    "article_text": "Industry 3 min read Consumer companies on recovery path; FY25 India business looks bright Global and Indian companies like Coca-Cola, Apple, and Reliance Retail anticipate a successful year ahead with strengthened demand post-March, despite global economic challenges. Robust growth forecasts are backed by increased consumer spending and a positive outlook for India's GDP. Writankar Mukherjee & Sagar Malviya ET Bureau Updated On May 4, 2024 at 09:11 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Kolkata | Mumbai: Chief executives and CXOs of 10 top global and Indian consumer-facing companies, including Coca-Cola , Reliance Retail , Apple , Shoppers Stop , Pernod Ricard, Carlsberg and Dabur , said demand has strengthened since March, bolstering quarterly sales, and forecasting a robust year ahead amid grim economic commentary for several global markets. The optimism for FY25 is a reversal from their earlier stance when most companies struggled with faltering demand and a slowdown over the past four-five quarters as inflation curtailed spending by the middle class and rural consumers. Beverage giant Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told analysts that the India business was a \"little softer\" in January and February, but \"March and April have now bounced back.\" He said the company expects to have a \"strong year this year\" in India. Brands in its portfolio such as Thums Up had done well, he said. Advt In the grocery retailing business, sales in the weeks before Holi (March end) exceeded that in the same period to Diwali (November 12), Reliance Retail chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja told analysts last month. \"Diwali is the biggest consumption period in the country. But for the first time, we saw that the sale during the pre-Holi period was very strong in a few markets,\" Taluja said. Monsoon Boost Department store chain Shoppers Stop said on its quarterly earnings call this week that sales staged a recovery in March, growing 13.5%, compared with 6% in February and little change in January from the year before. \"March was very, very good,\" said chief executive Kavindra Mishra. \"April also, the first 15 days have been outstanding.\" He, however, cautioned that the elections and extreme summer may have a temporary impact on demand. The apparel business is showing signs of a turnaround after a long time. Apple , Carlsberg, AO Smith, Pernod Ricard and others reported high single-digit or double-digit expansion in the March quarter in India, outstripping overall business growth. Apple posted March quarter revenue records in India with the business growing at \"strong double digits,\" CEO Tim Cook said on Friday. Advt Pernod Ricard management said there had been an \"acceleration of momentum\" in India in the last quarter that will continue in the April-June period as well. \"So, growth is strong, broad-based and accelerating with the consumer demand for spirit, with continued and sustainable trends towards premiumisation and an overall strong performance for our strategic international brands, like Jameson, Absolut and our Indian whiskeys,\" said Helene de Tissot, executive vice president of finance and IT. To be sure, most companies have forecast a demand revival in India given the above-normal monsoon forecast, boosting agriculture income. This will be aided by higher spending that's expected to be made by the new government in rural areas. India's general elections are currently underway in phases until June 1 with votes being counted on June 4. The southwest monsoon runs from June to September. Growth forecast Several global agencies have forecast robust growth in India's gross domestic product (GDP) in FY25. The Asian Development Bank has revised its estimate from 6.7% to 7%. The International Monetary Fund too has raised India's GDP growth projection by 30 basis points to 6.8%, while the Reserve Bank of India forecast 7% growth in its monetary policy review. That will maintain India's status as the fastest-growing major economy.

Read our privacy notice . Activity in the UK’s services sector increased at the fastest rate in nearly a year in April, strengthening hopes that the economy is pulling itself out of a shallow recession, according to new data. The S&P Global UK services PMI survey scored 55.0 in April, up from 53.1 in March and the highest level since May last year. It came in ahead of the reading of 54.0 that economists were expecting. The latest survey results are consistent with the UK economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% and therefore pulling further out of last year’s shallow recession Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Intelligence Any score above 50 indicates that the services sector is growing, while anything below that implies it is shrinking. The services sector, which spans businesses including pubs and restaurants, transport, property and financial services firms, has been growing steadily for the past six months. April saw more firms benefit from a boost to sales thanks to improved confidence among consumers and businesses who were reported to be feeling more optimistic about the outlook for the economy. This includes evidence that the cost-of-living crisis is continuing to ease, with the rate of UK inflation dropping to 3.2% in March, according to official figures. Businesses therefore had more new work coming in last month, including from other countries amid reports that sales had strengthened to customers in the US and Asia. Tim Moore, the economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Service providers benefited from improving business and consumer spending in April as more favourable demand conditions underpinned the greatest improvement in activity since May 2023. “The latest survey results are consistent with the UK economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% and therefore pulling further out of last year’s shallow recession.” However, businesses faced a sharp increase in costs in April following the national minimum wage increasing at the start of the month and extending to 21 and 22-year-olds for the first time.

It also meant firms were more reluctant to take on new staff, leading hiring to increase at the slowest pace in four months, the survey found. Mr Moore added: “Business activity expectations for the year ahead were upbeat overall in April, therefore adding to signs that the recovery in service sector performance has further to run. “Election uncertainty and fading prospects for interest rate cuts were cited as headwinds on the horizon, but survey respondents still mostly reported positive sentiment towards their business investment plans and longer-term growth opportunities.” More than half of the firms surveyed said they were expecting business activity to rise in the year ahead, while just a 10th were expecting a decline. An expected UK general election later this year, still-elevated interest rates, and fragile global economic conditions were among the factors businesses suggested could dampen growth in the near future.

    "article_text": "President Joe Biden’s mass migration is raising inflation, chiefly by raising housing prices, according to the Economist , a U.K.-based pro-globalism magazine for elites. Citizens’ rents, per-capita wages, and workplace productivity are being damaged in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada , and other wealthy countries where governments are extracting migrants from developing countries, says the April 30 article , headlined “Immigration is surging, with big economic consequences.” “Immigration’s impact goes well beyond an arithmetic effect on GDP [Gross Domestic Product] — it extends to inflation, living standards and government budgets,” the April 30 article admits as it debunks the elite narratives : Many policymakers have recently argued that migration is helping contain price rises by relieving labour shortages … Yet the evidence is weak and may, in fact, point in the opposite direction. Across the G 10 [group of wealthy countries] … there is no doubt immigrants need things as soon as they arrive, boosting demand [for used autos, food, etc.]. Nowhere is this clearer than in the case of rental housing, which is in short supply across the anglosphere. Research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that in Australia each 100,000 increase in annual net overseas migration boosts rents by about 1%. A paper by the Bank of Canada in December noted that “the initial rise in immigration that Canada has experienced is more likely inflationary in the near term.” The magazine’s admission is useful, in part, because few media outlets in the United States have dared describe the damage done to the economy and to Americans’ pocketbooks by Biden’s decision to welcome roughly 10 million illegal, quasi-legal, and legal immigrants since 2021. That connection is also ignored in the GOP’s migration-related campaign pitches which highlight border chaos, illegal migrants, crime — and increasingly — the taxpayer burden of providing free healthcare and schooling for legal and quasi-legal migrants. So far, the GOP’s donor-funded attack ads have ignored the links between Biden’s migration, inflation, and housing prices — despite swing voters’ anger at inflation, interest rates, and housing prices. For example, an April 28-30 poll by YouGov showed that “inflation/prices” is the most important issue for 23 percent of independents. But the connection between consumer demand, immigration, and inflation is sneaking through the gatekeepers in the establishment media. For example, Bloomberg noted on April 4, “FHN Financial’s Chris Low points out that while a bigger labor force puts downward pressure on wages, ‘it also puts upward pressure on prices.’ After all, ‘more people are eating, driving and living here.’” Meanwhile, Biden’s deputies are trying to downplay the inflation spurred by his decision to import 10 million illegal, quasi-legal, and legal consumers, renters, and workers into the U.S. economy since 2021. Yet the administration’s own reports also admit that housing prices are responsible for roughly half of the nation’s inflation that helped push up interest rates: Housing’s contribution to inflation has significantly increased. Housing now accounts for a third of the consumer basket of items measured in CPI, so even small increases can have an outsized impact on inflation. [1] Last June, housing accounted for a fifth of inflation, contributing 1.7 percentage points. By March 2023, housing’s contribution rose to 2.6 percentage points, making up half of annual CPI inflation. For perspective, before the pandemic housing would typically contribute about 1 percentage point to inflation. The rising inflation caused by migration has prompted the Federal Reserve to bump up interest rates, which then drives up the cost of the loans needed to construct or buy housing. WTOP reported April 11 on the dilemma facing Anton and Shelby Rogozhnikov in Texas. The couple owns a townhome in Dallas and want more space now that they’re planning on having their first child. They’re looking for a house with at least three bedrooms that’s priced within their budget of around $300,000. … “I know interest rates will go down eventually, but I feel like when they go down housing prices might go back up again,” said Shelby Rogozhnikov, 38. a dental hygienist. “I have the mortgage rate thing to worry about and my biological clock, which has less time on it than the mortgage rates, so it’s now or never.” Also, the Economis t article noted that Biden’s migration tends to push down the average or per capita wages, and productivity that could offset the damage caused by Biden’s inflation and interest rates: Although new arrivals are clearly boosting GDP [Gross Domestic Product, or the size of national economies], they appear to be dragging down GDP per person — the yardstick by which economists usually assess living standards. GDP per person has fallen or failed to grow for four consecutive quarters in Australia and seven in Britain. In Canada, where the drop in the measure is most pronounced, output per person fell by 2% in 2023. The picture is similar in Germany, Iceland and New Zealand. Cheap-labor migration also reduces pressure on employers to equip their American workers with labor-saving machinery, the Economist noted when it referred to a study by Ethan Lewis , an economist at Dartmouth University. Lewis wrote : Some metropolitan areas experienced faster growth in the relative supply of less-skilled labor in the 1980s and 1990s due to an immigration wave and the tendency of immigrants to regionally cluster. [Factory] Plants in these areas adopted significantly less machinery per unit output, despite having similar adoption plans initially. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has relied on Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after it helped investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The economic policy has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . The policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

    "article_text": "Amazon is using artificial intelligence to help shoppers and sellers at its online shop, and plans to spend billions on new data centers for its AWS cloud computing unit AFP E-commerce titan Amazon on Tuesday said profit in the first three months of 2024 tripled as its cloud, ads, and retail businesses thrived. Amazon shares were up more than 3 percent in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings figures, with Wall Street keeping a close eye on the impact of AI. \"It was a good start to the year across the business,\" Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an earnings release. The Seattle-based company reported $10.4 billion in profit on revenue of $143.3 billion compared with a profit of $3.2 billion on $127.4 billion in sales in the same period a year earlier. \"Amazon opens its new fiscal year with a robust set of numbers that show it has mostly brushed off pressures in the consumer economy,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in a note to investors. Sales at Amazon online stores grew by 7 percent in the quarter despite competitive pressure from rivals such as Shein and Temu, according to Saunders. \"Our customer data still shows that Amazon is a focal point for those consumers wanting value for money and convenience,\" Saunders said. \"We also believe that Prime members are leaning more heavily into Amazon to maximize value from their subscriptions.\" Growth in online store sales indicated last year's turnaround at Amazon's e-commerce business is continuing, according to Emarketer senior analyst Blake Droesch. \"While the core ecommerce business is no longer the biggest growth driver, it remains an essential component of the Amazon flywheel, particularly in propelling its ad business,\" Droesch said. Jassy said the adoption of AI capablities was getting companies to modernize their tech infrastructures through Amazon's AWS cloud computing division, which is on track to bring in a hundred billion dollars over the course of the year. AWS revenue in the recently ended quarter was $25 billion compared with $21.4 billion in the same period last year, the earnings figures showed. Jassy also pointed to Amazon's young ad business that was gaining momentum at its online shop and Prime streaming television service. The tech giant has also been driving down costs, he added. The company last year eliminated some 27,000 jobs in a move it said at the time was necessary, after years of sustained hiring. Amazon's shares have risen by nearly 75 percent in the past 12 months as investors applauded its aggressive cost-cutting early last year, an increase in sales and the potential of its cloud computing platform in the coming AI era. The company founded by Jeff Bezos is also expanding into AI and testing a chatbot named Rufus that would provide shopping tips to US mobile app customers. Amazon also added more generative AI features for sellers to use when creating listings. The company plans to invest billions of dollars in AWS datacenters in Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the US in coming years, according to the earnings release. Amazon's exceeding of market expectations comes after Microsoft last week reported solid earnings as it continued its aggressive push into artificial intelligence boost revenues and profit. The embrace of AI has boosted sales of its key cloud services, such as Azure, a rival of AWS. Like most tech titans, Amazon faces increased regulatory scrutiny. Amazon is being sued by the top US antitrust regulator that accuses the online retail giant of running an illegal monopoly by strong-arming independent sellers on its platform and stifling potential rivals. It was also forced to abandon its buyout of the iRobot vacuum maker after the EU's antitrust authority objected to the plan over competition concerns. © Copyright AFP 2025. All rights reserved."

    "article_text": "Advertisement China economy Opinion China Opinion Zhou Xin My Take | China’s Labour Day ‘golden week’ controversy reflects the limits of Beijing’s consumer spending push For some Chinese workers, the arrangement is a bit too intentional and the altered calendar may end up adding work pressure that will dampen the holiday mood The original meaning of Labour Day has gradually weakened, with the festival gaining new meaning in enriching middle-class lifestyles instead of worker’s rights Reading Time: 3 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Zhou Xin Published: 7:00am, 30 Apr 2024 Updated: 7:06am, 30 Apr 2024 China’s special calendar for the Labour Day holiday has stirred controversy. According to the official arrangements, Chinese workers will start a five-day holiday from Wednesday. But the trick is that only one day, May 1, is an actual holiday. May 4 and 5 is a weekend while May 2 and 3 are compensation for two extra working days on April 28, which was Sunday, and May 11, a Saturday. Advertisement The purpose of the rejigging is to create a “golden week” holiday based upon the one-day holiday, so that Chinese workers can arrange holiday plans during the five consecutive days off to boost the country’s consumer spending. In a likely scenario, when tens of millions of Chinese households decide to take advantage of the holiday, it will provide a much-needed shot in the arm for tourism on the mainland and even brighten economic prospects. Hong Kong is also hoping for a mainland tourist influx in the coming week to help struggling local merchants and restaurants. But for some Chinese workers, the arrangement is a bit too intentional and the altered calendar may end up adding work pressure that will dampen the holiday mood. “So, I have to work from 9am to 9pm for six days a week, twice, to celebrate a holiday that is designed for protecting worker rights,” according to one meme circulating on Chinese social media. The controversy partly reflects the challenges in shifting to a consumer-driven growth model. While China has been keen to rely more on consumers – instead of debt-ridden local government and state-owned enterprises – to drive growth, the institutional mechanics are actually not in favour of the endeavour. It is hoped that Chinese wage-earners will splurge as much as possible, but they still have to work extra days to earn a time window to do it. The golden week concept is relatively new for Chinese society. It started in 1999 when then Premier Zhu Rongji decided to boost domestic demand, as China’s exports were hit hard by the Asian financial crisis. International Labour Day, which falls on May 1, became one of China’s three weeklong holidays, along with National Day in October and the Lunar New Year. In 2007, China tweaked its holiday arrangements by shortening the public holiday for Labour Day to one day. Along with their hailed roles in unleashing consumer spending, the golden weeks have changed Chinese society. Before their introduction, leisure activities like summer breaks in government-designated resorts was a privilege reserved for those with special roles and functions, but the golden weeks made holiday plans and paid annual leave a widely accepted concept. Mainland Chinese tourists visit Hong Kong’s Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, April 25, 2024. Photo: Jelly Tse The original meaning of Labour Day – unifying the working class to fight for worker’s rights, or highlighting socialist values in voluntary labour – has gradually weakened, with the festival gaining new meaning in enriching middle-class lifestyles. As such, golden weeks have facilitated a role change among the Chinese working population, from frugal hardworking socialists who artificially suppressed personal wants, to unapologetic modern consumers ready to seek leisure and pleasure from the marketplace.

    "article_text": "When it comes to investments that have driven massive returns, many of them came from the retail sector. Innovative retail concepts and regional to international expansions have often delivered outsized returns. Still, for every millionaire maker like Home Depot or Walmart , there is a Bed Bath & Beyond or a JCPenney that wipes out many investors. Thus, while investors should not forget individual stocks, some may prefer to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) instead, to hedge against failed retailers. Fortunately, investors have numerous choices in ETFs tied to consumer discretionary stocks . However, of all the choices prospective investors may have in this category, the VanEck Retail ETF ( RTH +0.55% ) may be best positioned to deliver. Here's why. Expand NASDAQ : RTH VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Retail ETF Today's Change ( 0.55 %) $ 1.39 Current Price $ 255.19 Key Data Points Market Cap $0B Day's Range $ 253.60 - $ 255.74 52wk Range $ 206.24 - $ 255.74 Volume 3.8K Avg Vol 0 Gross Margin 0.00 % Dividend Yield N/A What is the VanEck Retail ETF? The VanEck Retail ETF tracks the performance of the U.S.'s consumer discretionary sector. Unlike some consumer ETFs, this is different from funds meant to replicate indexes. Instead of having hundreds of stocks, like competing funds such as the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF , this fund only claims 26 holdings. As with most funds, allocations are not even. It likely will not surprise many to know that Amazon is its largest holding. What may shock some investors is that it allocates around 21% of the fund to the e-commerce and cloud computing company. In comparison, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF 's largest holding, Microsoft , is only 7% of that fund. Additionally, no other stock makes up more than 10% of the fund. The second-largest holding, Costco , is over 8% of the VanEck Retail ETF. Home Depot, Walmart, Lowe's , TJX , and McKesson are also among the fund's major holdings. How its performance compares to competitors The VanEck Retail ETF is not the only fund of its kind, but few can argue with its results. Over the last five years, it not only outperformed its competitors, but also earned higher returns than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF , a frequently cited benchmark for market performance. Admittedly, the fund's higher expense ratio of 0.35% annually might compare poorly to some funds that charge 0.10% or less. Nonetheless, according to Morningstar, that is just under the industry average of 0.37%. Moreover, over five years, its returns were over 20 percentage points higher than those of the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF and almost 8 percentage points higher than the SPDR S&P 500 index. Such outperformance indicates that the VanEck Retail ETF justifies the higher expense ratio. RTH Total Return Level data by YCharts Consider the VanEck Retail ETF Ultimately, the VanEck Retail ETF is an excellent choice for retail stock investors. The ETF addresses the concerns of retail investors who are afraid they may pick the next Bed Bath & Beyond rather than the Home Depot of the future. Additionally, its fund managers have chosen a basket of stocks that outperformed the S&P 500 over a five-year period, making it appealing to investors who may have struggled to beat that benchmark. While it may charge a higher expense ratio, its managers have shown this ETF can outperform the market over time, making the extra cost worthwhile. As long as this overperformance continues, more passive investors might want to look at the VanEck Retail ETF instead of comparable funds or individual retail stocks."

    "article_text": "Study: Texas among best states for small businesses in 2024 Luisa Barrios April 27, 2024 2 min read EL PASO, Texas ( KTSM ) – Are you having second thoughts about opening a small business? A new study revealed the best and worst states for small businesses in 2024. And yes, the Lone Star State is among the best ones. To establish the best and worst states to start a business, the research team at LLC Geek evaluated 20 relevant factors spread across the following categories: business costs; workforce; business environment; infrastructure; and economical conditions. According to the study, each factor was graded on a 100-point scale, with a score of 100 representing the best conditions for small businesses. The top five results were the following: Rank State Total score 1 South Dakota 50.56 2 Texas 49.90 3 Ohio 49.43 4 Colorado 49.04 5 Florida 48.90 South Dakota takes the top spot on the list as the best state for small businesses, but Texas comes second on the list. Here are some of Texas’ key points as provided by the study: With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 7.7 percent and the second highest GDP in the country, Texas’ economy offers highly lucrative opportunities for entrepreneurs, also reflected by its lack of income and corporate taxes. Over 4,000 new small businesses received Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, and the state clearly wants to push its industry further as it ranks third for the highest investment in research and development (R&D). These factors further point out to Texas’ stability, but also to the many opportunities it offers for businesses to grow. The working age population is the fifth highest in the US, at 66.1 percent, offering a larger workforce than most states and a healthy growth of consumer spending, at almost 10 percent. Texas is a good state for small businesses due to its robust GDP growth, lack of income and corporate taxes, and proactive support for entrepreneurs. With a sizable working-age population and strong consumer spending growth, Texas offers good business growth and success opportunities. Now, this year, National Small Business Week takes place from Sunday, April 28 to Saturday, May 4. It is the perfect opportunity for entrepreneurs looking to launch a small business to finally do it.

Kalyan Parbat ET Bureau Updated On Apr 27, 2024 at 07:26 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Kolkata: Consumer spending on mobile services jumped sequentially in the October-December quarter of 2023, driven by the cricket World Cup , which galvanised smartphone sales in the festive season, propelled strong customer upgrades from 2G to 4G/5G services and boosted data usage levels. Consumer spending (after GST) on mobile services rose 2.5% sequentially to around Rs 54,750 crore during the period —the third quarter of FY24 — as per the latest sector performance data released by Trai. In the fiscal second quarter, this growth was 1.84%. Spending on data was Rs 47,560.3 crore, up 3.4% from the previous quarter when the sequential growth was 3%. Advt Higher consumer spending on mobile broadband services helped Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio boost their combined 4G/5G market shares by 0.25 and 0.05 percentage point sequentially to 28.8% and 54.1%, respectively, an analysis of the Trai data by ICICI Securities showed. The average revenue per user (ARPU) of telecom operators rose 1.8% on-quarter to Rs 158, on the back of an acceleration in 2G to 4G/5G conversions, rising postpaid user base and higher data consumption. “Consumer spending on mobile services rose sequentially in Q3FY24 on continued improvement in subscriber mix through adoption of 4G/5G plans. Additionally, during the festive season, smartphone sales, typically, increase and big-ticket sporting events like the cricket World Cup resulted in higher data consumption volumes and additional data recharges,” Kunal Vora, head of India Equity Research at BNP Paribas, told ET. The surge in customer upgrades to 4G/5G services was visible in the latest sectoral numbers collated by Trai. For instance, the 4G segment contributed nearly 87% to total data usage in Q3FY24, while 5G accounted for 12.6%. By contrast, the 2G and 3G user segments accounted for paltry 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Jio and Airtel had reported around 2.7% and 1.2% sequential growth in average monthly data usage per user to 27.3 GB and 22 GB, respectively, in the third quarter of FY24, helped by a rapid uptake of 5G services. However, without 5G and a weaker 4G presence, Vodafone Idea suffered a 2.8% sequential fall in data usage to 15.73 GB, especially as Jio and Airtel gained more mobile broadband users at its expense amid the 2023 Cricket World Cup action. Advt Latest data furnished by Trai, though, revealed that the net industry revenue growth was slightly slower at 8% on-year compared to the 8.5% rise in consumer spends on mobile services during the same period, as intercompany settlements between the telcos rose over 20.5% from a year earlier. Intercompany settlements, typically, include payments towards roaming charges and international interconnect usage charges that are settled among operators and partner global carriers. It is also the difference between gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue from mobile services.

    "article_text": "ETMarkets.com U.S. monthly inflation rose moderately in March , but stubbornly higher costs for housing and utilities suggested the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates elevated for a while. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday, which also showed strong consumer spending last month, offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation after data on Thursday showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter. \"Markets should breathe a sigh of relief this morning,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \"Given the elevated levels of inflation, and this is the new normal for 2024, the market is going to need to get over hopes for Fed rate cuts.\" The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% last month, matching the unrevised gain in February, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Goods prices edged up 0.1% as increases in the costs of gasoline, clothing and footwear were partially offset by a decline in prices of motor vehicles and parts. Services prices rose 0.4%, quickening from February's 0.3% advance. They were boosted by a 0.5% increase in the cost of housing and utilities, which include rents. Rents have remained sticky even as the supply of apartments has increased and independent measures showed a decline in rent demands. Live Events Economists expect that these lower rents should start showing up in the data at some point this year. Transportation services prices shot up 1.6%, while financial services and insurance were 0.5% more expensive. In the 12 months through March, inflation rose 2.7% after advancing 2.5% in February. The increase in inflation last month was broadly in line with economists' expectations. There had been fears that inflation could exceed forecasts in March after the release of the advance gross domestic product report for the first quarter on Thursday showed price pressures heated up by the most in a year. The spike in inflation occurred in January. The PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank for its 2% target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note backing away from a five-month high reached in the previous session. The dollar advanced versus a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Fed policymakers are expected to leave rates unchanged next week. The central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range since July. It has raised the policy rate by 525 basis points since March 2022. Financial markets initially expected the first rate cut to come in March. That expectation got pushed back to June and then September as data on the labor market and inflation continued to surprise on the upside. A handful of economists continue to expect that borrowing costs may be lowered in July on the belief that the labor market will slow noticeably in the coming months. Others believe the window for rate cuts is rapidly closing. \"Fed officials will likely not have enough evidence based on inflation data alone to cut rates as soon as June,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. \"But we continue to think officials will be increasingly uncomfortable leaving rates at restrictive levels for too long and will find evidence in May and June inflation data to cut rates in July.\" SERVICES INFLATION HOT Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index increased 0.3% in March after rising by the same unrevised margin in February. Core inflation increased 2.8% on a year-on-year basis in March, matching February's advance. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing climbed 0.4% after a 0.2% gain in February. The so-called super core inflation rose 3.5% on a year-on-year basis in March. Policymakers are monitoring the super core inflation to gauge their progress in fighting inflation. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased by a solid 0.8%, matching the rise in February. The data was included in the GDP report, which showed consumer spending moderating to a still-solid 2.5% pace in the first quarter from the brisk 3.3% pace in the October-December period. The economy grew at a 1.6% rate last quarter, held back by an increase in the trade deficit. The wider trade gap reflected a surge in imports, a function of strong domestic demand. Households spent more on both goods and services last month. Goods outlays vaulted 1.3%, with gasoline and other energy products as well as food and beverages, recreational goods and vehicles, and household equipment accounting for the jump. Services spending rose 0.6%, lifted by healthcare, housing and utilities as well as financial services and insurance. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending climbed 0.5%. The so-called real consumer spending also increased 0.5% in February. March's strong gain put consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the second quarter. \"Consumers appear to have solid momentum coming out of the first quarter,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. \"While we don't have much hard data for the second quarter at this point, the end-point for the first quarter suggests that second-quarter spending growth could be strong.\" Personal income increased 0.5% after a 0.3% gain in February, boosted by a 0.7% rise in wages amid a tight labor market. But higher inflation eroded some of the increase. Disposable household income after accounting for inflation and taxes rebounded 0.2% after slipping 0.1% in February. Consumers saved less and also tapped into savings. The saving rate fell to a 16-month low of 3.2% from 3.6% in February. \"The low saving rate is not a huge concern because we think it mostly reflects the strong state of household balance sheets, with debt-to-income ratios low, the cost of servicing debt still extremely low, and household net worth rising rapidly amid elevated house and equity prices,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

    "article_text": "Getty Images Image for representation Kolkata: Consumer spending on mobile services jumped sequentially in the October-December quarter of 2023, driven by the cricket World Cup , which galvanised smartphone sales in the festive season, propelled strong customer upgrades from 2G to 4G/5G services and boosted data usage levels. Consumer spending (after GST ) on mobile services rose 2.5% sequentially to around Rs 54,750 crore during the period —the third quarter of FY24 — as per the latest sector performance data released by Trai. In the fiscal second quarter, this growth was 1.84%. Spending on data was Rs 47,560.3 crore, up 3.4% from the previous quarter when the sequential growth was 3%. Higher consumer spending on mobile broadband services helped Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio boost their combined 4G/5G market shares by 0.25 and 0.05 percentage point sequentially to 28.8% and 54.1%, respectively, an analysis of the Trai data by ICICI Securities showed. The average revenue per user (ARPU) of telecom operators rose 1.8% on-quarter to Rs 158, on the back of an acceleration in 2G to 4G/5G conversions, rising postpaid user base and higher data consumption. “Consumer spending on mobile services rose sequentially in Q3FY24 on continued improvement in subscriber mix through adoption of 4G/5G plans. Additionally, during the festive season, smartphone sales, typically, increase and big-ticket sporting events like the cricket World Cup resulted in higher data consumption volumes and additional data recharges,” Kunal Vora, head of India Equity Research at BNP Paribas, told ET. Live Events The surge in customer upgrades to 4G/5G services was visible in the latest sectoral numbers collated by Trai. For instance, the 4G segment contributed nearly 87% to total data usage in Q3FY24, while 5G accounted for 12.6%. By contrast, the 2G and 3G user segments accounted for paltry 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Jio and Airtel had reported around 2.7% and 1.2% sequential growth in average monthly data usage per user to 27.3 GB and 22 GB, respectively, in the third quarter of FY24, helped by a rapid uptake of 5G services. However, without 5G and a weaker 4G presence, Vodafone Idea suffered a 2.8% sequential fall in data usage to 15.73 GB, especially as Jio and Airtel gained more mobile broadband users at its expense amid the 2023 Cricket World Cup action. Latest data furnished by Trai, though, revealed that the net industry revenue growth was slightly slower at 8% on-year compared to the 8.5% rise in consumer spends on mobile services during the same period, as intercompany settlements between the telcos rose over 20.5% from a year earlier. Intercompany settlements, typically, include payments towards roaming charges and international interconnect usage charges that are settled among operators and partner global carriers. It is also the difference between gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue from mobile services. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

To stream WUSA9 on your phone, you need the WUSA9 app. Download the WUSA9 app More Videos Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video WASHINGTON — So much for The Tortured Poets Department, Taylor Swift will be the talk of American University's Department of Economics as the school plans to offer a class surrounding the pop star. According to the American University website , the class was part of a student-designed course competition. The winning idea was created by political science and economics major Megan Wysocki and economics and journalism major Mackenzie Shultz. After learning about the competition, the two Swift-ly got to work collaborating to create a unique course using their love for Taylor Swift to help get people more interested in economics. The pair ended up presenting “Swiftonomics: Economics of Taylor Swift.” . American University is not the first college to create Taylor Swift-inspired courses. Colorado State University announced a course called Spanish for Swifties just one day before the drop of The Tortured Poets Department, Swift's 11th studio album. “It’s a great moment because Taylor Swift is so big right now in the world, not just the US and there’s a lot we can learn,\" said CSU's Assistant Professor for Spanish Specific Purpose Miller De Rutte. \"The course will explore her lyrics, her impact globally, particularly in Spanish-speaking countries, so it’s sort of an introduction of linguistic through the lens of Taylor Swift.\" However, the big difference between most courses and Wysocki and Shultz designed class is the subject. Many courses focus on Swift's lyrical work, however, \"Swiftonomics\" will focus on the economic impact of the singer and songwriter, who recently became a billionaire , and her Eras Tour, which is currently the highest-grossing concert tour of all time . According to TIME , the Eras Tour is projected to generate close to $5 billion in consumer spending in the United States alone. “If Taylor Swift were an economy, she’d be bigger than 50 countries,” said Dan Fleetwood, President of QuestionPro Research and Insights, in a story for GlobalNewsWire . The course will also touch on Ticketmaster issues, which led to some fans paying thousands of dollars to resellers to attend the show. The high-profile ticket problems are part of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice , which is planning to sue Live Nation. American University says any students who have completed Principles of Microeconomics can register for the fall 2024 class under ECON-396-001 “Swiftonomics: Economics of Taylor Swift.” Related Articles Taylor Swift's 'The Eras Tour' is heading to Disney+ What does Taylor Swift's new album sound like?

    "article_text": "Amazon Announces Prime Day’s Return as Shoppers Flock to Seasonal Deals By PYMNTS | April 26, 2024 | With consumer spending increasingly motivated by deals and seasonality, Amazon is gearing up for its tenth-ever Prime Day savings event, as Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, announced via LinkedIn Friday (April 26).

Δ “Last year, we had our biggest Prime Day in our company’s history: Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across Amazon stores,” Herrington said. “We are working hard and inventing new ways to pack even more great savings into the event this year.” Indeed, consumers are looking for these kinds of deals. Last summer’s Prime Day, for instance, garnered purchases from 40% of United States consumers, per PYMNTS Intelligence’s “ Summer Deal Days 2023: How Amazon Still Dominates .” The event resulted in $12.7 billion in total consumer spending for Amazon Prime Day. Moreover, a PYMNTS Intelligence report last year found that 46% of retail shoppers are deal chasers, willing to go wherever they will get the best price. Not only are deals becoming a stronger driver of consumer spending, but so is seasonality. “In the past year, we’ve seen engagement in our promotions with higher-than-expected volume around popular seasonal moments,” Katie Stratton, chief growth officer at Target-owned on-demand delivery aggregator Shipt , noted in an interview with PYMNTS earlier this month. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Amid this shift toward buying at peak times, Amazon is going all in on its seasonal deals events, expanding its offerings to more parts of the year. This year, for instance, it held its first Big Spring Sale , offering deals on seasonal items including cosmetics, sports gear, outdoor products, apparel and electronics. The event was popular, but not as popular as the eCommerce giant’s other savings events. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Amazon First Annual Big Spring Sale: A Sale Too Many? ,” for which we surveyed more than 7,400 U.S. consumers following the event, revealed that 28% of U.S. consumers shopped during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. That figure marks a 29% drop from Amazon’s last major sales event, despite this one being the company’s first open to non-subscribers. Amazon is not the only one looking to meet this demand — the company’s savings days have spawned similar such events from rivals such as Walmart and Target and even from DoorDash . The “Summer Deal Days 2023” study noted that 1 in 5 shoppers participated in Walmart+ Week last July, bringing in an estimated $10.5 billion for the superstore chain. Across digital and physical retail channels, consumers are demanding deals, per the PYMNTS Intelligence study, “ 2024 Global Digital Shopping Index: U.S. Edition ,” created in collaboration with Visa Acceptance Solutions . The report, which drew from a survey of more than 2,400 United States consumers, found that 74% of U.S. retail shoppers expect relevant promo codes. Plus, 75% expect digital coupons. “Shoppers have been impacted by inflation for the past two years and they are now changing their journey — kicking off their shopping by exploring sales and discounts first,” Frank Minervini , the vice president and head of marketing at Ziff Davis Shopping , the parent company of RetailMeNot , told PYMNTS in a conversation earlier this year.

U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note backing away from a five-month high reached in the previous session. The dollar advanced versus a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Fed policymakers are expected to leave rates unchanged next week. The central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range since July. It has raised the policy rate by 525 basis points since March 2022. Financial markets initially expected the first rate cut to come in March. That expectation got pushed back to June and then September as data on the labor market and inflation continued to surprise on the upside. A handful of economists continue to expect that borrowing costs may be lowered in July on the belief that the labor market will slow noticeably in the coming months. Others believe the window for rate cuts is rapidly closing. \"Fed officials will likely not have enough evidence based on inflation data alone to cut rates as soon as June,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. \"But we continue to think officials will be increasingly uncomfortable leaving rates at restrictive levels for too long and will find evidence in May and June inflation data to cut rates in July.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement SERVICES INFLATION HOT Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index increased 0.3% in March after rising by the same unrevised margin in February. Core inflation increased 2.8% on a year-on-year basis in March, matching February's advance. PCE services inflation excluding energy and housing climbed 0.4% after a 0.2% gain in February. The so-called super core inflation rose 3.5% on a year-on-year basis in March. Policymakers are monitoring the super core inflation to gauge their progress in fighting inflation. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased by a solid 0.8%, matching the rise in February. The data was included in the GDP report, which showed consumer spending moderating to a still-solid 2.5% pace in the first quarter from the brisk 3.3% pace in the October-December period. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The economy grew at a 1.6% rate last quarter, held back by an increase in the trade deficit. The wider trade gap reflected a surge in imports, a function of strong domestic demand. Households spent more on both goods and services last month. Goods outlays vaulted 1.3%, with gasoline and other energy products as well as food and beverages, recreational goods and vehicles, and household equipment accounting for the jump. Services spending rose 0.6%, lifted by healthcare, housing and utilities as well as financial services and insurance. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending climbed 0.5%. The so-called real consumer spending also increased 0.5% in February. March's strong gain put consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the second quarter. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"Consumers appear to have solid momentum coming out of the first quarter,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. \"While we don't have much hard data for the second quarter at this point, the end-point for the first quarter suggests that second-quarter spending growth could be strong.\" Personal income increased 0.5% after a 0.3% gain in February, boosted by a 0.7% rise in wages amid a tight labor market. But higher inflation eroded some of the increase. Disposable household income after accounting for inflation and taxes rebounded 0.2% after slipping 0.1% in February. Consumers saved less and also tapped into savings. The saving rate fell to a 16-month low of 3.2% from 3.6% in February. \"The low saving rate is not a huge concern because we think it mostly reflects the strong state of household balance sheets, with debt-to-income ratios low, the cost of servicing debt still extremely low, and household net worth rising rapidly amid elevated house and equity prices,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

By Lance Roberts Market Overview Published 04/26/2024, 05:37 AM Retail Sales Data Suggests Strong Consumer in the Face of Inflation - or Does It? View all comments (8) 8 Lance Roberts Articles ( 2123 ) | My Homepage Follow CL -0.25% The latest retail sales data suggests a robust consumer, leading economists to become even more optimistic about more robust economic growth this year. To wit: “It has been two years since forecasters felt this good about the economic outlook. In the latest quarterly survey by The Wall Street Journal, business and academic economists lowered the chances of a recession within the next year to 29% from 39% in the January survey. That was the lowest probability since April 2022, when the chances of a recession were set at 28%. Economists don’t think the economy will get even close to a recession. In January, they, on average, forecast sub-1% growth in each of the first three quarters of this year. Now, they expect growth to bottom out this year at an inflation-adjusted 1.4% in the third quarter.” – WSJ According to the March retail sales data, consumer spending added “fuel” to economists’ exuberance about this year. Rising inflation in March didn’t deter consumers, who continued shopping at a more rapid pace than anticipated, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Retail sales increased 0.7% for the month, considerably faster than the Dow Jones consensus forecast for a 0.3% rise though below the upwardly revised 0.9% in February, according to Census Bureau data that is adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation.” – CNBC The chart below shows the monthly change in the retail sales data over the last two years. While mainstream economists trumpeted the strength of the consumer, the March retail sales data had some interesting points worth noting. First, retail sales data was extraordinarily weak from October to January, the traditionally strongest shopping months of the year. That period included Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and NYear’sr’s. So, to some degree, the strength of spending over the last two months is unsurprising as, eventually, consumers need to buy goods or services previously postponed. Secondly, while the March retail sales data was strong, it was weaker than February. However, March contained two significant spending periods, Spring Break and Easter, which generally don’t occur. Since Spring Break and Easter are considerable travel and shopping periods, it is unsurprising that the retail sales data increased with oil prices rising. As shown below, there is a very high correlation between nominal retail sales and oil prices. Paying More For The Same Amount Economists often overlook another important point about the retail sales data. As noted above, the March retail sales report was NOT adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, the report is in nominal “dollar volume” and not the amount of goods or services sold. Oil and gasoline prices are an excellent example of the issue with the retail sales data. Let’s assume you own a car with 18-gallon fuel tank. Your daily activities are mostly going to work, going to the grocery store, eating out, having entertainment, etc. As such, you consume one tank of gas each week. Here is the math: Week 1: 18-gallons of gas @ $3/gallon = $54. That week, the store adds $54 to the monthly retail sales total for selling 18 gallons of gasoline. However, the price will increase to $4 per gallon next week. Week 2: 18-gallons of gas @ $4/gallon = $ 72. Here is the question. While the retail sales data increased by $18 in week two, did the consumer purchase more gasoline? In other words, if the economy’s strength is ultimately measured by how much we produce ( gross domestic product), then does spending more for the same amount of goods or services equate to a stronger economy? The picture is quite different if we adjust the nominal retail sales data for inflation. Again, it is unsurprising that even on an inflation-adjusted basis, retail sales rose in February after declining for four months previously. However, with March containing Spring Break and Easter, the data suggests a weaker consumer that headlines tout. It is worth noting that retail sales data is not very useful in determining whether the economy is nearing a recession. As shown below, an annual growth rate of 2% has been a good marker for economic growth. As such, retail sales should grow at roughly 2% annually as well, given that personal consumption expenditures comprise approximately 70% of the economic equation. However, other than 2007, retail sales did not clarify economic strength. In other words, spending more for the same amount of goods and services is not a sign of economic strength. Economic Forecasts Tend To Be Erroneous Furthermore, while the recent nominal sales data was robust, it is crucial to remember the economic data has a significant lag. Each of the dates below shows the economy’s growth rate immediately before the onset of a recession. You will note in the table that in 7 of the last 10 recessions, real GDP growth was running at 2% or above. In other words, according to the media, there was NO indication of a recession. But the next month, one began. Crucially, I am not saying a recession is starting next month. However, I suggest that relying heavily on one month’s retail sales data to claim the economy avoided a recession is not likely ideal. Let’s revisit that chart of the WSJ economic forecast. I have added two notations: the start and end of recessions and when the NBER officially dated that period. As shown in both previous recessions, WSJ economists had a very low probability of the economy entering a recession just before it occurred. The reality is that on an inflation-adjusted basis, the retail sales data suggests the consumer remains weak. While spending more to buy the same amount of goods or services may look good on paper, the average household has less money to spend elsewhere. As shown, the annual rate of change in real retail sales is near some of the lowest levels outside of a recession. Lastly, consumer credit supporting retail sales will become more problematic with rising interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to reduce the average growth rate of retail sales data. Our advice is to remain cautious about economic exuberance. Those forecasts are often disappointing. Retail Sales Data Suggests Strong Consumer in the Face of Inflation - or Does It?

For context, always refer to the full article. FILE PHOTO: The Charging Bull or Wall Street Bull is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 16, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo REUTERS INFO The US economy grew by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024, missing expectations, but still outperforms other advanced countries WASHINGTON, USA – US economic growth slowed more than expected in the first quarter, but an acceleration in inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates before September. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.6% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP on Thursday, April 25. Growth was largely supported by consumer spending. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.4% rate, with estimates ranging from a 1.0% pace to a 3.1% rate. The economy grew at a 3.4% rate in the fourth quarter. It is expanding at a pace above what US central bank officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8%. The International Monetary Fund last week upgraded its forecast for 2024 US growth to 2.7% from the 2.1% projected in January, citing stronger-than-expected employment and consumer spending. Job gains in the first quarter averaged 276,000 per month versus the October-December quarter’s average of 212,000. The economy has defied prophecies of doom since late 2022 following the Fed’s aggressive rate hiking campaign to stamp out inflation. The United States is outperforming other advanced economies. Consumers locked in lower mortgage rates, while businesses refinanced debt before the tightening cycle began, economists say. – Rappler.com Summarize this article with AI Share in Chat Share article Facebook X (Twitter) Copy Link Copied How does this make you feel?

In the fourth quarter of 2023, real GDP increased 3.4 percent. The GDP estimate released today is subject to further revision. The second estimate for the first quarter, based on more complete source data, will be released on May 30, 2024. As per reports, the growth figure from the Bureau of Economic Analysis was far below analysts' expectations of a 2.5 per cent rise. The increase in real GDP in the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment. Compared to the fourth quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending and a downturn in federal government spending. These movements were partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Imports accelerated during the period. Coming to disposable personal income, it increased USD 226.2 billion, or 4.5 percent, in the first quarter, compared with an increase of USD 190.4 billion, or 3.8 percent, in the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal income increased 1.1 percent, compared with an increase of 2.0 percent.

The United States is a consumer driven economy. Each year, thousands of people wait for holidays like Black Friday to splurge, and retailers stock inventories in anticipation of mega shopping events such as the Holiday Season. As a result, the health of the American economy is tied to how much Americans spend, and in 2024, the environment is starkly different from what existed before the coronavirus pandemic. Before the pandemic struck, credit was relatively easy to score and as a result, spending was as you’d expect it to be. However, in the immediate aftermath of COVID 19, spending in key areas such as accommodation was different in a way that few would have thought would be possible in December 2019. Research from the banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) shows that in the U.S., consumer spending for staples products was quite high after lock downs were enforced in March 2020. Spirits saw the highest jump, along with other products such as coffee and hand sanitizers also seeing greater interest. At the same time, spending on items such as cosmetics dropped as work from home requirements changed the nature of grooming for work. Fast forward to 2024, analysts and economists are bracing themselves for the same set of jitters that they felt in mid and end 2022. These jitters are quite relevant to consumer spending as well. Mid April 2024 is seeing the stock market and the Federal Reserve deal with a set of inflation data that they would have preferred had painted a different picture instead. Data from the Labor Department show that the Consumer Price Index in the U.S. stood at 3.5% in April, for another set of figures that overshot estimates. As a result, stocks were sharply down, and Fed chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that higher rates would need to take longer to work their way through the economy to sustainably reduce inflation. What does this mean for consumer spending? Well, apart from inflation, spending is influenced by the economic state and the labor market. On the latter front, U.S. economic growth has been robust; so much so that some estimates believe that despite higher interest rates than what most people would like, the economy can continue to grow in 2024 nevertheless. Some of the most optimistic estimates come from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which now believes that the projected American GDP growth of 2.7% in 2024 will outpace all peer economies. The labor market is also doing well as it added more than three hundred thousand jobs in March and unemployment also dropped. Both these metrics mean that consumer spending should at least maintain the pace even though rates are high since people are finding work and are able to afford at least staples. A report from U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) ties these things to describe the state of U.S. consumer spending as of March 2024. It reveals that U.S. household debt, one of the metrics of consumer spending, is growing in line with wage growth. This indicates that the more consumers make, the more they spend and the fact that these levels are in balance should soothe economists in an otherwise uncertain environment. The report adds that while the data appears to be indicative of stability as of now, analysts need to be on the watchout for changes to the labor market and revolving credit levels – both of which can make consumers pull back. As for global consumer spending, here’s what the consumer goods giant The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) had to say during its latest earnings call : In summary, North America, Europe focus Markets, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America, which combined represent three-quarters of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in quarter two, with three points of volume growth and three points of price mix. These same markets grew 9% in quarter one with around two points of volume growth and seven points of price mix. Continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing, consistent with our guidance. The balanced 25% of company sales including Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa were impacted by local market issues we described. Quarter two organic sales for this group were down five points versus prior year. We expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing, SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve, and over time return to mid singles, and we expect market pressures in the Middle east and Turkey to ease over time. So which countries are the biggest consumer spenders? Take a look below! Niloo / Shutterstock.com Our Methodology To make our list of the countries with the greatest consumer spending, we used the World Bank’s data for final consumption expenditure in 2022 in current U.S. dollar terms. 20 Countries with the Highest Consumer Spending in the World 20. Republic of Poland Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $524 billion The Republic of Poland is a sizeable European country with an $844 billion nominal GDP and a GDP per capita of $23,000. Apart from services, manufacturing and banking also play crucial roles in the Polish economy. 19. Republic of Turkiye Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $625 billion Turkiye is an Asian and European country that is one of the members of the group of sizeable global economies called the G20. The Turkish economy is worth $1.14 trillion, making it one of the biggest in the world. 18. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $627 billion Saudi Arabia is a Middle Eastern nation that is the world’s largest supplier of crude oil. Oil funds the Saudi economy, with the main earnings coming through the dividends that the world’s biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco, pays its majority shareholder, the Saudi government. 17. The Netherlands Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $686 billion The Netherlands is the second European nation on our list of the world’s countries with the highest consumer spending. A former colonial power, it has well developed financial markets which were dealt a scare through a fire in the stock exchange in April 2024. 16. Republic of Indonesia Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $800 billion Indonesia is one of the most populous countries in the world courtesy of the 279 million people that live inside its borders. However, it ranks low on our list despite the sizeable population advantage. 15. Kingdom of Spain Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1 trillion Spain is another former European colonial power. It has a $1.6 trillion economy, moderate levels of income equality, and high levels of human development. 14. Republic of Korea Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.1 trillion The Republic of Korea, or South Korea, is a prosperous Asian country. It has some of the biggest consumer facing businesses in the world, such as the electronics behemoth Samsung and car makers like Hyundai and Kia. 13. Commonwealth of Australia Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.1 trillion Australia is an oceanic country that is one of the largest in the world in terms of area but is also quite sparsely populated. It has a $1.7 trillion economy and a GDP per capita of $66,589. 12. United Mexican States Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.1 trillion Mexico is one of two countries that share a land border with the United States. This allows it to benefit from a close relationship with the American manufacturing industry. 2024 has seen its inflation undershoot expectations, opening up hopes for interest rate cuts. 11. Russian Federation Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.4 trillion Russia is the largest country in the world in terms of land mass. As its invasion of Ukraine enters a second year, analysts worry that government spending might be masking other Russian economic woes. 10. Federative Republic of Brazil Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.5 trillion Brazil is the most prosperous country in South America with a GDP of $2.3 trillion. However, a GDP per capital of $11,352 is quite low and belies high levels of income inequality. 9. Canada Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.6 trillion Canada is America’s second neighbor. Its proximity to America means that Canadians and Americans often have the same outlets and goods for consumer spending splurges. 8. Italian Federation Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $1.61 trillion Italy is a developed European country that is also a global political power. It has a $2.3 trillion GDP and a GDP per capita of $39,580. 7. French Republic Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $2.1 trillion France is one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and also one of the handful of countries with nuclear weapons. It has sizeable companies that operate in the construction, defense, and other crucial industries. 6. Republic of India Final Consumption Expenditure in 2022: $2.4 trillion India is the most populous country in the world. It is also one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, and recent statistics put the Indian economy at a cool $3.9 trillion.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Thu, Apr 25, 2024 · 08:48 PM US ECONOMIC growth slowed more than expected in the first quarter, but an acceleration in inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates before September. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.6 per cent annualised rate last quarter, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP on Thursday (Apr 25). Growth was largely supported by consumer spending. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.4 per cent rate, with estimates ranging from a 1.0 per cent pace to a 3.1 per cent rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 per cent rate in the fourth quarter. It is expanding at a pace above what US central bank officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8 per cent. The International Monetary Fund last week upgraded its forecast for 2024 US growth to 2.7 per cent from the 2.1 per cent projected in January, citing stronger-than-expected employment and consumer spending. Job gains in the first quarter averaged 276,000 per month versus the October-December quarter’s average of 212,000. The economy has defied prophecies of doom since late 2022 following the Fed’s aggressive rate hiking campaign to stamp out inflation. The United States is outperforming other advanced economies. Consumers locked in lower mortgage rates, while businesses refinanced debt before the tightening cycle began, economists say.

The world’s biggest economy grew 1.6 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said, missing analysts’ expectations of a larger 2.4 percent rise. This was also a clear slowdown from the 3.4 percent increase seen in the final three months of last year. While the latest figure still shows expansion, economic pressures could weigh on President Joe Biden as he seeks reelection in November. Biden has been working to improve perceptions surrounding his handling of the economy even as soaring inflation has eased since the Covid-19 pandemic and the jobs market remained solid. On Thursday, the slowing in growth “primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending,” said the Commerce Department. There was also a “downturn in federal government spending,” the report said. Consumption has been more resilient than anticipated last year, even as economists predicted that spending would cool as households depleted their savings from the pandemic period and while borrowing costs stayed high. A key factor has been a robust labor market, fueling job and wage gains. All of this has boosted optimism that the country is achieving a “soft landing” where inflation moves lower on the back of higher interest rates without triggering a recession. For now, Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics expects consumer spending will still help to support the economy this year. – ‘Uncertain’ outlook – Consumers remain willing and able to spend “even if they are being more scrutinous in the face of high prices,” said EY chief economist Gregory Daco. “Looking ahead, we see the economy gently cooling as slower labor demand, easing wage growth, stubborn inflation, and tight credit conditions constrain private sector activity,” he added. Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, noted that the latest growth rate was the weakest since 2022. “The outlook going forward is uncertain,” she said. Labor market strength will probably prop up household spending and economic growth. But stubborn inflation could risk the US central bank keeping interest rates higher for a longer period of time, she said. This could weigh on consumers and businesses in the coming quarters. But with GDP figures in the first quarter potentially revised later on, economist Robert Frick of the Navy Federal Credit Union believes the latest number “shouldn’t be taken as a fundamental downshift in the economy.” In this article: Economy , gdp , indicator , US Written By AFP With 2,400 staff representing 100 different nationalities, AFP covers the world as a leading global news agency.

It is less focused on promoting consumer spending because of the growing competition with the U.S. and its allies. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Secretary of State Antony Blinken is staying tonight at this hotel behind me. They've already set out the metal detectors in his honor. He's to meet China's president here in Beijing. And as he does, we're getting a glimpse of China in 2024, which is not easy to do, because in a way, the United States and China have moved farther apart, as we learned when we started our journey here from Washington. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Ladies and gentlemen, Group 1 and 2 in the blue lane. Group 3 in the green lane. Please have your passports open to the photo page. (Speaking German). INSKEEP: That was the flight attendant as we boarded at Washington's Dulles Airport. She's speaking German because we will stop in Frankfurt, Germany, on the way to Beijing. Before the pandemic, nonstop flights connected the two capitals, around 14 hours. Now our editor Reena Advani and I needed about 22 hours, including a layover spent at a German airport restaurant. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Working on the food, or I'll take it already? INSKEEP: You can take this unless you want it, Reena. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: No need, no need? INSKEEP: I could use some more coffee, though. And a zigzag course across Central Asia, which Reena monitored from her seat. REENA ADVANI, BYLINE: The plane went a different course than was expected. INSKEEP: Avoiding the faster route over Russian airspace, as most flights have since Russia invaded Ukraine. When we reached Beijing, where airport traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels, I mentioned our longer flight to Qian Liu (ph), who's a Chinese economist. QIAN LIU: It's a great metaphor in the sense that COVID changed China and its relationship with the rest of the world big time. Even though COVID was completely over the beginning of 2023, a year ago, unfortunately we have not fully resumed to everything back to normal. INSKEEP: Qian Liu stresses that China still has the world's second-largest economy. That was obvious looking around. We were sitting on a bench in a courtyard surrounded by City of Oz-style skyscrapers. In an upscale mall nearby, the staff serves spicy fish and cheers every customer who enters. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Non-English language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting in non-English language). INSKEEP: But new foreign investment is down. Distrust between China and the U.S. is way up. Qian doesn't think Americans understand this place much at all because it's been harder to visit. And she recently quit her job with a firm advising global businesses. She used to see herself as a bridge between China and the rest of the world. LIU: There was a point in time where being a bridge was a lot more valued. Both sides value you and know you can help to make a difference with the other side. But increasingly, over the past several years, my Chinese friend would be, don't you forget you're Chinese. And my foreign friends would be, you've lived in China for too long - you've been brainwashed by the Chinese Communist Party. And it's very saddening. INSKEEP: One stated purpose of Secretary Blinken's meetings here in Beijing is to rebuild bridges, though nobody expects that to be easy. And we plan to ask Blinken about that on tomorrow's MORNING EDITION. While waiting for him to arrive in Beijing, we got a look at China's economy from the bottom. We spent an hour on a Beijing block lined with motorbikes, delivery vehicles. The drivers take their breaks here. The quiet of this really busy city street is a sign of China's economy. All of these bikes are lined up here, coming and going, and they're electric. They're being passed by, in many cases, electric cars making hardly any sounds at all. And the delivery people themselves are a sign of China's economy because they're doing the physical work of delivering the stuff that somebody bought online. We chatted with drivers and learned that some moved here from small towns to work. One said, all of our stories are the same. We are all poor. Others said the job offers freedom. And Liu Shiwei (ph) says it at least earns enough that he's been able to save some money. He was having lunch, noodles and beer in a food court just off the street. Is that good beer? LIU SHIWEI: (Through interpreter) Quite nice. INSKEEP: He was wearing the yellow shirt of a service that delivers meals, groceries, clothes and more. How's business? LIU: (Through interpreter) Not good. INSKEEP: Why? LIU: (Non-English language spoken). INSKEEP: He says orders are down, and too many people are taking work as drivers. That reminded me that youth unemployment last year climbed so high that the government temporarily stopped publishing statistics about it. I've heard a lot of younger people have trouble finding work. Do you think that's true? LIU: (Through interpreter) Of course it's true, otherwise there won't be so many delivery guys now. INSKEEP: Oh, you think there's more delivery guys because people can't find other kinds of jobs? LIU: (Through interpreter) Yes, of course. INSKEEP: China's economy is still growing, but consumer spending is down, which affects a bar owner we met on a narrow street of historic brick homes. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND CHIMES) INSKEEP: Sun Kai's (ph) bar has outdoor tables with wind chimes hanging overhead. The owner sat at one of those tables as he explained why business is slower than he would like. SUN KAI: (Non-English language spoken). INSKEEP: \"People are definitely spending less,\" he said. \"They're less likely to get an extra drink after dinner.\" To understand what's happening, we ordered not whiskey, but tea with Dan Wang. She is the chief economist at China's Hang Seng Bank. DAN WANG: You came to China at the right time. There are a lot of interesting things going on simultaneously. One thing is that the consumer confidence is at a historical low. And when we look at how much people spend comparing to four years ago, now is about 40% less. And that's the average urban resident. So it's quite significant. People save way more than before. INSKEEP: Weren't people already saving a lot in China compared to the United States? WANG: Oh, definitely. China was already one of the biggest savers in the world, and now it's even more so. Currently, there is about $20 trillion saved up as household deposits in Chinese commercial banks. So that's a lot of money. INSKEEP: You said consumer confidence is low. So people are not spending because they have dark feelings about the future? WANG: People generally don't feel that optimistic about the economic growth anymore. INSKEEP: Part of the problem is real estate. Home values rose for decades, making the owners feel richer. Then prices stopped rising, making people feel poorer. And there's another issue. China's government is less focused on promoting consumer spending. That's because of the growing competition with the United States and its allies. WANG: This is a big change in China's economic agenda because when it comes to what industries get more policy support, it usually would be associated with consumer market before the trade war. So the Chinese government had been quite keen to develop a large enough middle class so that the domestic demand was strong. And that was also in line with the common prosperity agenda. But since the trade war started, you can feel that narrative has changed quite drastically. And when it comes to the industrial decisions, there were way more support towards the heavy industries, towards the high tech, because the government is quite keen to fend off the threat from the U.S. In my opinion, the China-U.S. relationship is pretty much beyond salvation, so it doesn't matter how many conversations are going on or how friendly one side appear from time to time. They have their long-term agenda as an adversary or competitor. INSKEEP: The government is making national security decisions rather than pure economic decisions. Is that right? WANG: Oh, for sure. In the long term, the national security would dominate China's economic agenda. INSKEEP: That is one part of the backdrop for this week's diplomatic meetings as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets Chinese leaders here in Beijing. The world's second-largest economy is still adjusting to life after the pandemic. And both countries are trying to find their balance at an unstable time. Copyright © 2024 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu The U.S. economy likely expanded at a solid pace in the first three months of the year and perhaps even better than Wall Street expects, while still below the robust level at the close of 2023. Gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced across the sprawling U.S. economy, is expected to post a 2.4% annualized growth rate for the first quarter, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. If that estimate is accurate, it would mark a step down from the 3.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 and just a touch less than last year's 2.5% full-year growth rate. However, it would still reflect an economy showing solid progress and ahead of the 2.2% average rate in the years between the 2008-09 financial crisis and the Covid pandemic that began in early 2020. \"The U.S. economy is still very resilient, supported by a solid labor market that continues to support robust income growth and in turn, consumer spending activity,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"We are seeing a little bit of cooling in terms of the consumer spending momentum. Nothing dramatic.\" Daco expects the economy actually grew at a 2.6% pace, slightly ahead of the consensus, as consumption and parts of the housing sector, which is still trying to catch up to demand, act as driving factors. Underpinning the optimistic outlook is a belief that the labor market is still holding up and helping propel consumer spending, which drove more than two-thirds of all activity in the fourth quarter. \"We are seeing some signs that the labor market is starting to cool,\" Daco said. \"We're seeing modestly slower labor demand. You can see that in the hiring rate, you can see that in the hours worked, you can see that in the diffusion of job growth in the payrolls report. But there isn't any form of retrenchment that would be alarming in terms of future income trends and in terms of future consumer spending trends.\" While Daco's outlook for growth is more bullish than the consensus, there are other indicators that GDP gains could be even greater. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracker of incoming data, which has shown solid accuracy particularly as it gets closer to the actual Commerce Department release date of the report, is indicating a 2.7% rate. Noting the above-consensus level of the Atlanta Fed indicator, Goldman Sachs is forecasting a growth rate of 3.1%, which it notes is a full percentage point below the second half of 2023 though well above the Street view for the first quarter. The bank's forecast is based around four \"key factors,\" including a \"sharp rise\" in residential investment, a rebound in both auto production and manufacturing activity and \"another quarter of strong consumption growth,\" Goldman economist Spencer Hill said in a note. Goldman expects consumption to rise an above-consensus 3.3%, driven by a 1.1% gain in core retail spending and big upward revisions in the March retail sales report from the Commerce Department. The GDP report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday and will also include data on the personal consumption expenditures prices index, a key inflation reading for the Fed, as well as the \"chain-weighted\" price index, which is expected to show a 3% quarterly increase."

ASIC expects more than 10,000 companies will have entered administration by the end of this financial year, as inflation dogs the economy. Businesses are being squeezed between rising wages and costs and flattened consumer spending, and a growing number aren't coping. More Information Featured: Wayne Owens, insolvent Perth builder Suresh Manickam, Restaurant and Catering Industry Association Brendan Rynne, KPMG chief economist Credits Jon Daly, Author Image Details Suresh Manickam is the CEO of Restaurant and Catering Australia. ( ABC News: Daniel Irvine ) Program: More from AM Transcript Sally Sara: A wave of business insolvencies is sweeping through the nation's economy at a level not seen for more than a decade. ASIC expects more than 10,000 companies will enter administration by the end of this financial year as inflation dogs the economy. Some businesses are being squeezed between rising wages and costs and flattened consumer spending and a growing number aren't coping. John Daly reports. Jon Daly: Behind each failed business is often an owner picking up the pieces. Wayne Owens ran his Perth-based commercial building company for three decades. It went into voluntary administration last year. Wayne Owens : I'm still dealing with this on a daily basis, the way it has impacted on my life, to be the happy person I used to be.\" Jon Daly: His business ran into big problems with fixed price contracts when building costs jumped almost 30% in recent years. Now in his 60s, Mr Owens now has no super and few assets and he's struggling to see a way forward. Wayne Owens : You know, I'm sort of, atYou know, I'm sort of, my age concerned that, you know, yes, I'm probably going to be working until I drop and two, I don't want to be out in the street trying to find somewhere to live, you know. Yeah, so that's what I deal with on a daily basis and it has been stressful. Jon Daly: The latest ASIC data shows more than 7,500 companies have entered administration in the first three quarters of this financial year, a 36% increase on the previous corresponding period last financial year. Building and construction firms are the worst affected, making up nearly 30% of businesses going under. That's followed by accommodation and food services, accounting for 15% of insolvencies this year. Suresh Manickam is Chief Executive of the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association. Suresh Manickam: So on one side of the equation in terms of all of the inputs, they are rising and they're rising at a rapid and disproportional rate. On the other side of the equation in terms of consumer spending and to some extent discretionary spend we're finding that consumers are also finding it tough. Jon Daly: ASIC expects more than 10,000 businesses across the economy will have gone into administration by the end of this financial year, a level not seen since the 2012-2013 financial year. KPMG Chief Economist Brendan Rynne says this is a flow-on effect from COVID stimulus and more lenient insolvency laws during the pandemic. Brendan Rynne: Businesses that were struggling beforehand but tried as best as they could to keep going but ultimately it's now caught up with some. Jon Daly: Brendan Rynne says this wave of insolvencies, as painful as it is, is a necessary post-pandemic correction. Brendan Rynne: So you'll often hear about zombie firms where they're continuing to operate but are in fact pretty lifeless. They're not being able to invest and they're really using labour and funds that could be used elsewhere more productively within the economy. Jon Daly: Another tough medicine to take in the current economy. Sally Sara: Jon Daly.

    "article_text": "View Market Dashboard How can you cultivate a strong financial safety net for your siblings? Millennials prioritize personal financial goals, but should also consider younger siblings' financial security. Investing in mutual funds SIPs can yield significant growth over time, tailored to siblings' future needs. Insurance policies provide a crucial safety net for unforeseen circumstances. Hemant Lakhotiya Published 18 Apr 2024, 09:07 AM IST Mutual fund SIPs and insurance policies offer long-term financial security and comprehensive protection for siblings. As millennials, it's commonplace for us to prioritise our personal financial aspirations. However, amidst our pursuits, we must recognize the financial security of our younger siblings, who may still need to gain the maturity or resources to secure their own financial futures. Rather than solely indulging in fleeting pleasures like gadgets or social outings, we must explore avenues to invest in their long-term success and stability. In today's diverse demographic landscape, millennials span an age range from individuals in their late twenties to those in their early forties, each harbouring distinct mindsets, goals, and ambitions. Millennials in India are known to be keen on achieving a healthy work-life balance, nurturing mental and physical well-being, and embarking on enriching travel adventures. While prioritising personal financial goals is essential, it's equally vital to consider the future well-being of our younger siblings. Also Read: Mutual fund assets skyrocket 35% in FY24, revealing key March trends One strategic avenue for securing the financial future of younger siblings is through mutual fund systematic investment plans (SIPs). These plans offer a generous gesture and a strategic move toward long-term financial security. Even modest investments can yield significant growth over time, thanks to the compounding interest and rupee-cost averaging inherent in SIPs. With India's consumer-driven economy experiencing robust growth, the potential returns on such investments are substantial.

Mutual fund calculator explains Moreover, mutual funds offer flexibility, allowing investors to tailor investment strategies according to their siblings' age and future financial requirements. For instance, equity mutual funds present optimal growth potential for siblings requiring educational support in the future, while transitioning to hybrid funds as their financial needs evolve can effectively balance risk and returns. In addition to mutual funds, insurance is a crucial safety net for safeguarding younger siblings' financial well-being. By securing term life insurance policies and comprehensive health insurance plans, millennials can ensure their siblings are adequately supported in unforeseen circumstances. Critical illness coverage and child education insurance plans further enhance the comprehensive protection afforded to younger siblings, alleviating financial strain and providing peace of mind. Also Read: Your Questions Answered: Is there an insurance plan to preserve family savings amidst inflation? As millennials, we harbour our own dreams and ambitions, yet we can also strike an optimal balance between our life goals and the financial safety of our siblings and loved ones. By investing in their well-being alongside our own, we contribute to both creating and preserving wealth, ensuring a secure and prosperous future for all.

Subscribe now Mumbai: Supermarket chain Vishal Mega Mart Ltd has appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital Co, ICICI Securities, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Jefferies as bankers for an initial public offering (IPO) up to $750 million, three people aware of the development said. The company, which competes with Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail, Tata Group's Trent and grocery giant Avenue Supermarts, is expected to make its IPO filing by the end of the year, the people said on condition of anonymity. Vishal Mega Mart is owned by Switzerland’s Partners Group and India’s Kedaara Capital. The two private equity firms had acquired it from TPG and Shriram Group for $350 million in 2018. According to the people cited above, the company's owners expect a valuation of $5 billion. “The valuation will be determined by one of the private equity funds supporting the company, though their initial valuation request leans towards the higher end. Nonetheless, the final valuation will be contingent upon the feedback received from the prospective investors,\" said one of the three people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Queries emailed to spokespersons of Kotak Mahindra Capital Co, Morgan Stanley, ICICI Securities, Kedaara Capital, and Partners Group remained unanswered till press time. Jefferies and JP Morgan declined to comment. Vishal Mega Mart joins a queue of PE-backed Indian companies seeking an IPO over the next 6-12 months, including Ola Electric , FirstCry, Aadhaar Housing Finance, Indegene and GoDigit. Also Read: The crowd of small firms in IPO street has never been bigger Unlike D-Mart, Trent and Reliance Retail , which operate company-owned outlets, Vishal Mega Mart operates through a mix of its own stores and franchises. In FY23, it opened 56 franchisee stores, and an average of 64 franchisee stores between FY20 and FY23. Vishal Mega Mart ended 2023 with 589 franchised stores in over 350 cities, with a totalling store area of over 10.6 million sq. ft. The company's consolidated revenue grew 36% to ₹ 7590 crore in FY23, driven by the increase in outlets as well as steady same-store sales growth. According to credit rating agency India Ratings, the supermarket chain will sustain healthy growth in the mid-teens rate over the medium term. It also expects the company’s debt service coverage ratio to be comfortable over the next three years, as no term loans are outstanding. \"VMM’s expansion plans are likely to be largely funded through internal accruals, with little reliance on additional debt,\" India Ratings said in a report dated 4 March. Through a wholly owned subsidiary Airplaza, the company is also engaged in wholesale trading under the 'Vishal' brand. Boston Consulting Group estimates India to become the world's third-largest consumer economy, with a size of $400 billion by 2025. According to Kearney Research, the retail industry may grow at a 9% annual rate between 2019 to 2030, climbing from $779 billion in 2019 to $1.407 trillion by 2026 and exceeding $1.8 trillion by 2030.

The latest data shows a pickup following eight consecutive declines but it's not all good news as March spending on goods -- particularly furniture and clothing -- was soft. That was contrasted with increasing services spending. \"March RBC consumer spending data suggests Canadian household spending is still running cold (on a per-person basis) but there are early signs of thawing,\" RBC writes . \"We look for Canadian consumer spending to remain soft in the first half of this year before ticking higher in the second half.\" Much of the spending pickup was on groceries and gasoline while car buying continues to retrench due to high interest rates. Services discretionary spending rose for the sixth consecutive quarter and spending on eating out and hotels showed a nice bump in March. Overall, I don't see any great signs for Canada but the spring housing market has done much better than feared and I'm fairly confident we've reached a bottom. If anything, I'm afraid that bidding wars come back."

Fewer US taxpayers have received a refund this year in the run-up to tax day compared to 2023, signaling some consumer spending may be disrupted.

By Bryan Mena Tuesday, April 16, 2024 Spending at US retailers rose in March for the second consecutive month, underscoring the strength of the US consumer fueled by a robust job market. WASHINGTON -- Spending at US retailers rose in March for the second consecutive month, underscoring the strength of the US consumer fueled by a robust job market. Retail sales rose 0.7% in March from the prior month, a slower pace than February's upwardly revised 0.9% gain, the Commerce Department reported Monday. That beat the 0.4% increase that economists projected, according to a FactSet poll. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. Retail spending has increased in seven of the past 10 months through March. Sales were up across several categories in March, including at gas stations, which increased a strong 2.1% from February. Gas prices have steadily risen in the past several weeks. Still, excluding sales at gas stations, retail sales were up 0.6% in March. Online sales jumped 2.7% in March, while specialty stores saw sales increase a solid 2.1%. Spending at restaurants and bars rose 0.4% last month. Meanwhile, sales of electronics, clothes, and sporting goods fell 1.2%, 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. \"Today's retail sales figures show strong consumer spending wrapping up the first quarter of 2024,\" said Claire Tassin, retail and e-commerce analyst at Morning Consult, in a note Monday. \"In March, promotional activity from e-commerce brands like Amazon helped to drive up online sales.\" No rush to cut rates Monday's report adds to evidence that the US economy remains solid, keeping the Federal Reserve in wait-and-see mode. A strong economy means the Fed won't be in a rush to cut rates, especially considering that there are some signs that inflation's progress has stalled in recent months. Fed officials have said they are not yet convinced that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal. \"With inflation running above target, economic growth continuing to show momentum, and elevated prices across a range of asset markets, the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate,\" Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said Friday at a conference in Overland Park, Kansas. He does not vote on interest rate decisions this year. \"Therefore, rather than preemptively adjust the policy rate, I would prefer to be patient and wait for clear and convincing evidence that inflation is on track to hit our 2% target before adjusting the stance of policy,\" he said. For now, interest rates are at a 23-year high after the Fed raised rates aggressively starting two years ago. Analysts at major Wall Street banks have recently pushed back their estimates on the timing of the first rate cut. Goldman Sachs is forecasting the first cut to be in July instead of June, while Bank of America now sees the first cut in December instead of June. Could robust spending persist? Americans have been on a spending spree these past few years and economists argue that will likely continue this year. The US economy grew at a brisk pace last year, thanks to strong consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic growth. Spending has remained solid, even in the face of still-high inflation and elevated interest rates. \"Households are just not changing their spending patterns, but they've been changing everything else,\" Shannon Seery Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN previously. \"There has been this change in psyche in which they change everything to fit their spending patterns. They're saving less on a monthly basis, they're pulling out money from other assets such as retirement accounts, we've seen a pickup in Buy Now Pay Later, we've continued to see a pickup in credit card usage and so on.\" \"I think you're going to keep seeing households spend at the rates that they have,\" she added. The Commerce Department releases broader figures on consumer spending for March later this month. In February, spending on goods and services advanced 0.8%, the strongest monthly gain in more than a year. Consumer spending hasn't contracted since March 2023. And as long as the job market remains healthy, so will spending. Employers added a shocking 303,000 jobs in March as the unemployment rate fell to a low 3.8% that month. Annual wage growth, measured as average hourly earnings, slowed last month, but it continued to beat inflation. The US job market is currently one of the strongest in history: Job growth has expanded for 39 straight months, the fifth-longest streak on record, and the unemployment rate has been below 4% for more than a year.

US retail sales picked up by 0.7 percent in March to $709.6 billion, after February’s increase was revised to 0.9 percent, said the Commerce Department. From a year ago, the March figure was 4.0 percent higher. Boosting the headline figure was a 2.1 percent rise in gas station sales from February to March, said the latest report. Excluding gas stations, overall sales were up by a slightly lower 0.6 percent. But motor vehicle and parts dealers saw a sales decline of 0.7 percent in March, while electronics and appliance stores’ sales slid 1.2 percent. While resilience in consumer spending has helped US economic growth in the last year, analysts expect demand to cool this year amid cost fatigue and high interest rates. Households would also have drawn down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period. “Even as households face ongoing challenges from high borrowing costs and elevated inflation, they continue to spend,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. She added in a note that looking ahead, an eventual decline in the Federal Reserve’s benchmark lending rate should be “positive for consumer spending” while a robust labor market should help with incomes, spending and growth. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics cautioned that retail sales numbers are “hard to forecast with much confidence” given the potential for substantial revisions. For now, Pantheon expects consumption in the first three months this year to slow from that in the fourth quarter last year.

Then again, one local investor – who boasts a discount retail background – is trying to save at least a portion of those stores in an effort to carry on the brand to better days. The Commerce-based discount grocer and retailer, largely citing debt-related challenges and the costs of doing business, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 7 after failing to find prospective buyers and renegotiate with creditors. The filing came days after the company announced its shutdown and a liquidation sale that slashed prices across its 371 stores in California, Nevada, Arizona and Texas. Chris Wilson , national agency retail lead for real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. , said while he was sorry to see the “legendary retailer” go down, he felt it would ultimately shake up the market in a positive way. “There’s been a supply imbalance throughout the country for the last three years, with interest rates starting to rise in the first quarter of 2022,” said Wilson, who is based at JLL’s downtown office. “We’ve basically seen redevelopment projects sidelined. As the result of that, and the extremely strong consumer economy, there’s a lot of retailers looking for space. “You’re going to see a massive shakeup, with tons of retailers showing interest in these buildings,” he added. Rise and fall of a brand Founded in 1982 by Cleveland expat Dave Gold , the 99 Cents Only Stores – sometimes branded as the 99 Cent Store – quickly took off from its initial Ladera Heights location. The company went public in 1996 and in 2011 went private again after private equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Public Pension Plan Investment Board bought out the shares in a $1.6 billion transaction. With inventory that depended largely on who was offloading product in a particular area, the stores became known for “treasure hunting” by customers shopping for one thing and finding other pleasant surprises on the shelves. You were as likely to find a brand-name product as its generic alternative – and very often for just 99 cents. “Even though it was a multibillion-dollar company, 99 Cents Only operated under a premise straight from the Great Depression: a fair shake for everyone who entered,” Gustavo Arellano , a columnist with the Los Angeles Times , wrote last week. “Here, the retiree shopped alongside the hipster, and the only colors that mattered were the bright blue and pink on the marquee of each store. The chain had locations in blue-collar towns such as Santa Ana and Colton, but also suburbs such as Alhambra and Santa Monica.” In the company’s bankruptcy filings, Chief Restructuring Officer Christopher Wells indicated that, like its retail competitors, 99 Cents Only Stores struggled to combat supply chain issues, fluctuating customer counts, inflation, the cost of labor and retail theft since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The company was emerging from a major debt restructuring when the pandemic took hold, and it refinanced debt and secured $200 million in equity to keep the ship afloat. Still, rising costs and retail theft forced the company to raise prices, Wells said, with the amount of merchandise priced at 99 cents or less dropping to below 50% by 2023. “The company had no choice but to pass on to its customers some of the resulting costs, in the form of higher prices, which was met by significant customer resistance and reduced customer traffic,” he added in the filing. Attempts in the last few months to find options to raise financing, seek a merger, selling the company, right-size its operational footprint and negotiate with creditors ultimately went nowhere. “Usually when you have a company with that many stores, you would typically find some restructure option,” observed Richard Rizika , founder and president of El Segundo-based real estate brokerage and advisory firm Beta Agency . “That’s what we’ve been seeing with a lot of retailers in distress. It came as a surprise to a lot of people that they filed bankruptcy the way that they did.” Good opportunity for newcomers Whatever happens to the 99 Cents Only Brand, it’s likely that its empty storefronts will be filled sooner rather than later. Rizika said, according to his company’s research on the retailer, there were 164 stores in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area – an area that includes Orange County – comprising 3.8 million square feet. Within the county there also is a distribution center of several hundred thousand square feet in the vicinity of the San Pedro Bay port complex. “A lot of these are urban infill locations. Most have good parking and access and visibility. I would expect to see interest from grocers, discounters as well as fitness and other uses that would be able to utilize the existing footprints,” Rizika said. “You have an opportunity to come into a market and be open overnight.” It isn’t without precedent. Wilson, at JLL, highlighted that retail giant Target entered the L.A. market after Gemco closed its doors in 1986. He said the real estate world was “buzzing” at the potential opportunities here. “I can’t tell you with any certainty, but I promise there are retailers in America right now looking at those footprints and wondering whether this is the time to enter Southern California,” Wilson said. “There are stores that have been sitting on the same real estate for 20 to 25 years and there’s all kinds of buildup sitting around them. The opportunity to enter those intersections, those lots, is historic for a lot of people.” Could the brand be saved – partially? If one entrepreneur has his way, he’ll enter those lots with the same 99 Cents Only Stores branding. Mark Miller , president of Culver City-based Pic ‘N’ Save Bargains , has signaled his hopes of acquiring all of the Southern California locations of the 99 Cents Only Stores. Formerly president of Big Lots – which acquired the original Pick ‘N’ Save and converted those locations – Miller relaunched Pic ‘N’ Save in 2020, with the initial store in Anaheim. He has since opened a second location in Whittier. The La Cañada Flintridge-based businessman said he came to know Gold, the 99 Cents Only Stores founder, as a friend and friendly competitor. When he restarted Pic ‘N’ Save, he said he tried to emulate the “never know what you’re going to get” experience of Gold’s empire. Miller said he sees the root of 99 Cents Only Stores’ problems being that it started to lose that magic as it lost touch with its customer base. “I think over the years, that’s just kind of drifted away,” he said. “When you go from entrepreneurial to private equity, that kind of goes away.” As the liquidation continues, Miller said he has a bankruptcy attorney in “constant communication” with all parties. In addition to all – or some – of the 143 SoCal stores, he said he also has his eyes on two of the distribution centers in Commerce and would like to headquarter the reignited company at one of them. “I think we’re in as good a position as anybody to take a piece of these 143 stores,” Miller added. In any case, Rizika said the opportunity for small-format grocers or other discount retailers was ripe. The undoing of 99 Cents Only Stores, he noted, came largely as a result of bad debt, so if an investor or company has strong financial backing they may be able to avoid that issue. “I’d like to think there is an opportunity to improve the quality of retail as new owners backfill these existing stores,” Rizika said. “As long as these owners have a basis in real estate and the liquidity to create these conversions, they should be able to do well.” Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Print Previous article City Buys 120-Unit Multifamily Asset Next article B.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Sat, Apr 13, 2024 · 12:20 AM WAGES offered to new hires in China snapped three quarters of decline in the first three months of this year, suggesting an improvement in the labour market that could boost consumer spending in the world’s second-largest economy. Average monthly salaries offered by companies to new recruits in 38 key Chinese cities rose 2.2 per cent from a year before to 10,323 yuan (S$1,941), according to data from online recruitment platform Zhaopin compiled by Bloomberg. That was the first increase recorded since the start of 2023. Separately, a survey of Shanghai residents published by the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics found employment conditions improved in the first quarter of the year, following two quarters in which conditions worsened. A strengthening in wages and labour demand could go some way to boosting consumer spending. A weak job market is a key reason for low consumer confidence in China, Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group said in a note last week. Still, both surveys suggested conditions weaker than in previous years. China’s economic data so far this year has been mixed, with rapid industrial output growth and signs of strong consumer spending on services around the Chinese New Year holiday alongside weak inflation and an ongoing housing market slump.

    "article_text": "The EUR/USD pair extends its downside to near five-month low around 1.0660 in Friday’s European session. The major currency pair falls sharply on firm speculation that the European Central bank (ECB) will begin reducing interest rates from the June meeting. The ECB kept its key borrowing rates unchanged on Thursday at 4.5% to maintain downward pressure on the consumer price inflation. In the monetary policy statement, the ECB said that restrictive financial conditions and interest rate hikes yet made are weighing on the overall demand and pushing downward pressure on inflation. Also, the ECB said that it will remain data-dependent to determine how long interest rates are needed to remain restrictive. The central bank refrained from committing to any particular rate path. The speculation for ECB pivoting to rate cuts from June strengthen after ECB President Christine Lagarde said that if a fresh assessment increased policymakers' confidence that inflation is heading back to target, then it \"would be appropriate\" to cut interest rates, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, the market sentiment is downbeat as traders pare big bets leaning to Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning to reduce interest rates from the June meeting. S&P 500 futures have posted losses in the European session. 10-year US Treasury yields falls slightly after refreshing more than four-month high near 4.60%. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the US Dollar’s value against six major currencies, jumps to near five-month high around 106.00. Going forward, investors will shift focus to the monthly Retail Sales data, which will be published on Monday. The Retail Sales data is a leading indicator of consumer spending. Higher Retail Sales suggests robust consumer spending, which leads to a stubborn inflation outlook.

Read our privacy notice . Half of consumers have cut back on their non-essential spending so far this year, with eating out the most likely cull from budgets, a survey suggests. Just 3% of consumers say that they have been able to spend more on non-essentials in the first quarter, with 52% cutting back, according to the KPMG Consumer Pulse survey. Eating out was the most common discretionary spending cut, listed by 72% of those who are scaling back, followed by clothing purchases (62%) and takeaways (58%). When asked what they would most likely do should prices of goods and services drop, 47% said they would put the money into savings and 20% said they would put money towards essential costs such as mortgage or rent, energy, fuel and food. Should macroeconomic conditions lead to an easing of pressure on household budgets, then four times more consumers say they would boost or replenish their savings, rather than spend more on non-essentials Linda Ellett, KPMG Just 11% said they would increase their non-essential spending. Consumers are continuing to adapt their buying behaviour to save money, with 38% buying more own-brand over the first three months of the years, 37% buying more promotional or discounted items, and 35% buying fewer items. Taking or booking a holiday was the most common big ticket purchase in the last three months, for a quarter of consumers, while 35% also said that they would be spending money on a holiday during the remainder of 2024. One in 10 said they had carried out home improvements so far this year, with a further quarter of consumers saying they will be doing so by the end of the year. A quarter of consumers said they do not plan to spend any of their savings this year, while a quarter also said that they are currently using their savings to help meet their essential costs. Linda Ellett, head of consumer, retail and leisure markets for KPMG, said: “Essential costs remain at a level where nearly half of the consumers we surveyed said they have cut their non-essential spend in the first quarter of the year.

TROISE The Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. markets are far outpacing their global counterparts in 2024, continuing a decade-long trend of strong growth compared with the rest of the world. The S&P 500 is up 10% for the year, compared to just 4% for developed markets outside the U.S. Since 2019 the S&P has gained 48%, compared to just 10% for other developed markets, according to the MSCI, a benchmark of global stocks. Since 2004, the S&P 500 has nearly quadrupled, while the MSCI is up 48%. Faster earnings per share growth is the main driver of the trend: Earnings for the S&P 500 are up nearly 47 times that of the broader global market over the last 17 years, according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Earnings growth overall for companies in the S&P 500 is expected to jump 11% in 2024, following nearly 2% growth in 2023 and 4.5% growth in 2022. Strong consumer spending and a solid jobs market have been fueling the U.S. economy, despite stubbornly high inflation and high interest rates making it more difficult to borrow money. The U.S. economy has historically been far more consumer-driven than counterparts in Europe and Asia, helping to fuel steady earnings growth for U.S. companies over a longer period of time. Stock buybacks have also steadily increased over the last few decades, which tends to inflate earnings. Also, big tech companies typically dominate the movement of the S&P 500 and their profits have skewed growth for the benchmark index. Advertising “The bottom line is investors pay for earnings growth and developed markets (outside the U.S.) haven’t delivered,” Wren said, in a note to investors. A series of recent reports on jobs, manufacturing and spending have reaffirmed that the U.S. economy remains strong. Inflation also remains stubbornly high, adding more uncertainty to hopes for interest rate cuts this year. The strong economic data bodes well for investors focused on earnings growth as a key investment consideration. The U.S. government’s latest jobs report for March is a key example, coming in much stronger than expected and helping to rally stocks. “To the extent that consumer spending and corporate profits are more important to investors than how soon, and how many times, the Fed will cut rates, then stock prices can move higher on this report,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief Investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. The European Central Bank also has its key interest rate at a record high, but has hinted that it could start making cuts in June. The Swiss National Bank made a surprise cut to its key interest rate in March. The moves could boost confidence in the European economy, which all but stalled in 2023. Markets in Japan are poised for growth as the nation’s central bank raises interest rates for the first time since 2007, ending a policy of negative rates. Corporate confidence is improving, which could lead to more corporate investments by Japanese companies that would benefit shareholders, according to a market assessment from J.P.Morgan. Meanwhile, weak consumer spending and lackluster income growth could continue to hamper China’s economy.

Retails sales growth slowed early in 2024 and consumer sentiment remains weak. “Despite some constructive developments at the aggregate level, the Chinese recovery remains lopsided,” said Alejandra Grindal, chief economist at Ned Davis Research, in a report."

    "article_text": "Gulliver’s Retail Park in Santry went for €29.5m Donal Buckley Thu 11 Apr 2024 at 03:30 Commercial property investment volumes are expected to be considerably higher in the latter half of this year after they dropped to €162m on the first quarter of this year – the lowest quarter spend since 2012. This is the view of CBRE’s Colin Richardson, who says several notable sales processes are progressing well across the shopping centre, supermarket, residential and industrial sectors, alongside prime and secondary Dublin office sales. “Feedback from investors across Europe indicates that second-hand offices, on a selective basis, are now pricing attractively. Many investors, particularly those with equity, believe that now is the right time to be acquisitive,” he adds. “We continue to see renewed investor interest in the retail sector, with retail assets attracting the most capital in Q1 (43pc of spend). “The sale of two retail parks completed in the last quarter, included that of Kilkenny Retail Park to Iroko Zen for about €25m. Considering ongoing sales processes, retail is on course to be the most invested sector in 2024, for the first year since 2016.” A notable retail deal saw Minaun Capital, an investment vehicle of entrepreneur Tom Kelly, acquire Gulliver’s Retail Park in Santry for €29.5m. It was developed by the Cosgrave family, one of Dublin’s longest established developers. Indeed Minaun’s purchase reflected how private investors were particularly active, accounting for at least 25pc of investment in Q1. They have mainly been focussed on retail assets.

    "article_text": "Mark Cuban is worried Americans will put too much emphasis on the economy when voting this fall. He argues that presidents have little impact on the economy. Polls show Americans still consider the economy a top issue for the election. The billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban isn't running for president this year, but he is worried that Americans will put too much emphasis on the economy when choosing between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. When asked what he wished more people understood about the economy , especially during an election year , he wrote in an email, \"how little impact any president has.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"It's the 330 million of us that move the economy, not one person,\" he wrote. The president's influence on the economy is often overstated Americans view the economy's health as one of the major issues the president and Congress should tackle this year. In a poll of 5,140 American adults conducted in January by the Pew Research Center , 73% of those who completed the survey said \"strengthening the economy\" should be a top priority for the president and Congress in 2024, the highest percentage for any response in the poll. President Joe Biden. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Experts rarely mention presidential policy when looking at the issues that most impact the economy moving forward. Rather, the factors that have the biggest impact are interest rates, jobs, and consumer spending. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Interest rates are influenced by the Federal Reserve, and while rates are still higher than the Fed's target, the decision on when to cut rates is strongly influenced by the job market and consumer spending , both of which remain strong. Ultimately, the Fed must walk that fine line between consumers spending too little, which hurts businesses, and spending too much, which can cause inflation . Spending and hiring are factors that the American people control rather than the president. To be sure, there are ways that government policy can impact the issues that affect interest rates. For example, tariffs can affect the success of businesses, which in turn impacts hiring and can also influence how much money is being spent by Americans if prices on goods change. Former President Donald Trump. Scott Eisen/Getty Images The economy is still chugging along, but many Americans still don't feel great about it because interest rates and prices are still high. But that shouldn't influence their voting decisions this fall. Read the original article on Business Insider About Our Ads"

    "article_text": "Data from the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) shows that 502 businesses in the retail sector have gone into administration so far in 2023-24, compared with just 193 during the same period in 2021-22. Factors such as the cost-of-living crisis and high mortgage interest rates are weighing on consumer spending, with smaller retailers bearing the brunt. “The pessimism that has dominated the consumer mood for nearly two years now is still showing few signs of lifting” , Matthew Hassan, senior economist at Westpac, said. Advertisement “Outside of the deep recession of the early 1990s, this is easily the second-most protracted period of deep consumer pessimism since we began surveying in the mid-1970s”. National Retail Association CEO Rob Godwin expects more businesses in the sector to collapse in the final months of the financial year. He is calling on the federal government’s budget in May should provide financial assistance for retailers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses. “Retail trade is suffering. We did a sentiment survey last week which illustrated 77% of those businesses are struggling with operational costs, [and] 44% of businesses are doing less profit than last year” , Godwin, said. Advertisement “Retailers are seeing that lack of consumer confidence every day. They’re seeing reduced foot traffic, they’re seeing reduced traffic to their websites, and they’re seeing a reduced spend per customer”. “So you combine that with the increase in cost of operation, with also the general reduction in spending, and it’s tough”. The below table from ASIC tells the tale, with insolvencies across retail more than doubling this financial year (to 522) from the same time in 2022 (197): Still, retail (522) is holding up far better than construction (2,067) and accommodation and food services (1,130), which have recorded much bigger rises in insolvencies. Advertisement Nevertheless, retail faces stiff headwinds from plunging household consumption, which fell by 2.5% in 2023 due to stagnant real earnings, rising mortgage rates, and increased income taxes: Traditional retail also faces stiff structural headwinds from online retailers like Amazon and eBay, which offer greater convenience and price competitiveness. Advertisement The only upside for the sector is that the federal government is hell bent on maintaining its mass immigration Big Australia policy, which continues to funnel greater quantities of consumers into Australia, offsetting individual spending cuts."

A decade of fast-paced digital financial revolution Apart from concerns over governance and security issues, complete financial inclusion is yet to be realised By Anshika Kayastha Updated - April 10, 2024 at 10:41 AM. | Mumbai × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/elections/a-decade-of-fast-paced-digital-financial-revolution/article68047804.ece Copy The most visible fintech innovation has so far been in UPI-based payments due to its customer facing nature, with the sector seeing huge investments from both foreign and domestic institutions. | Photo Credit: KAMAL NARANG As the ruling NDA seeks its third term in office, the rapid strides made in digitising payments and the entire financial services ecosystem have been among its main achievements. The last 10 years have seen the country emerging as a major global innovator and driver of e-commerce, digital payments and financial services. While measures such as UIDAI were being rolled out even before 2014, for the NDA government, one of its key legacies will be the implementation of an integrated digital ecosystem, orchestrated on the shoulders of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). From the introduction of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and FasTag in 2016 to positioning RuPay to challenge the duopoly of Visa and Mastercard, and more recently taking UPI international, there’s been no looking back. While demonetisation and the Covid-19 pandemic acted as catalysts to accelerate the pace of digital adoption in the country, the government pushed people to get onboarded onto public digital infrastructure through timely initiatives such as mandating Aadhar, introduction of GST, and the push for JAM (Jandhan Yojana, Aadhar, and Mobile) trinity. This not only brought more people into the fold, but also helped support the agenda of financial inclusion through ease of access and better internet connectivity. Volume of mobile transactions increased 38 per cent to 6,295 crore in H2 CY23 whereas the value of transactions rose 31 per cent to ₹152.33 lakh crore. Between January and December 2023, the volume of transactions was up 34 per cent whereas value was up 33 per cent. This also encouraged the growth of a whole new industry of financial technology companies or fintechs, which have significantly altered Indians’ relationship with money. UPI-based payments The most visible fintech innovation has so far been in UPI-based payments due to its customer facing nature, with the sector seeing huge investments from both foreign and domestic institutions. The UPI network saw record transactions worth ₹19.78 lakh crore in March 2024, 40 per cent higher on year. The number of transactions rose 55 per cent to 1,344 crore during the month, also a record high. In FY24, UPI processed 13,115 transactions aggregating to ₹199.29 lakh crore compared with 8,376 crore transactions worth ₹139 lakh crore in FY23. It is expected to breach 100 crore transactions per day by FY27, as per a report by PwC India, which projects UPI to account for 90 per cent of retail digital payments volume over the next few years. While payments in itself is not a monetarily lucrative business, it heralded a culture of ‘super apps’ from both BFSI and other companies alike, largely due to their potential in paving the way for converting data points and insights into targeted and customised offerings. Further, the government push for back-end or B2B digitalisation has helped improve data collection, availability of data and access to data, resulting in great insights into consumer requirements, spends and credit behaviour, cash flow or bank statements, credit history, and repayment capabilities. QR codes UPI QR codes grew 57 per cent from July 2022 to 31.7 crore as of December 2023, and Bharat QR codes grew 32 per cent to 59.6 lakh, as per a recent Worldline India report. Point of Sale (PoS) terminals expanded 26 per cent between July 2022 and December 2023 to reach 85.6 lakh. Private sector banks dominated the space with a market share of 73 per cent. The number of toll tags issued grew 45 per cent to 8.12 crore as of December 2023. The volume of transactions through FasTags were 13 per cent higher at 189 crore and the value was up 20 per cent to ₹31,948 crore. Combined with increased customer convenience and fintech development, data sourced from these customer touchpoints has proved to be the guardrails for innovation in digital lending, investments, wealth management, stock broking, cards, banking services, insurance distribution, toll collection, and bill payments. As per an Experian report, currently 60 per cent of travel, 40 per cent non-grocery retail, 30 per cent education, 25 per cent food and beverages services and 6 per cent of pharma/grocery transactions are done through digital channels. India is projected to be a $800 billion digital consumer economy by 2030, a ten-fold growth from $90 billion in 2020. Further, the share of digital lending is seen rising from 15 per cent in 2020 to 40 per cent by 2027. Huge investments The last decade has seen financial companies investing huge sums of money into product innovation, technology upgradation, strengthening the digital infrastructure, research and development, cyber security, top class digital distribution channels and customer touch points, and more recently AI & ML. However, this rapid growth has brought with it several concerns on corporate governance, cyber security, frauds, data storage and breaches, mis-selling and the growth of unregistered entities. RBI, while being relatively proactive, has in several instances left trying to catch up with the initial pace of development in the sector. The second half of the decade then also saw the introduction of several licences and frameworks, aimed at allowing for their growth while bringing them into the fold of the formal banking system. The categorisation of different fintech, their use cases and the digital lending guidelines introduced in 2022, were some key landmarks in this regard, bringing a semblance of sanity to a previously chaotic fintech landscape. The fintech ecosystem is still in nascent stages and continues to evolve, and so do the regulations around it. While there is still distance to cover in terms of complete financial inclusion and digital adoption, the last 10 years have been nothing short of a case study on the digital transformation and the role of fintechs in nudging India into the next phase of development.

The Puig family will retain a majority stake. Puig’s biggest markets are Europe and the US, with Asia-Pacific accounting for just 10 percent of revenue in 2023. So there is scope to expand in the Asian beauty market, which is dominated by skincare and cosmetics but where fragrance is getting more popular. Putting Puig’s 2023 Ebitda on a combination of L’Oréal SA and Coty Inc.’s multiples would imply an enterprise value of €17 billion. But this may prove ambitious for several reasons. ADVERTISEMENT Some 72 percent of Puig’s revenue came from its fragrance and fashion business in 2023. Assuming the latter is a small part of the division, then the majority of the unit’s revenue is generated by perfume. Fragrance sales have surged since the pandemic. Cooped up at home, consumers experimented with scent as a way to make themselves feel good. Demand only accelerated as economies reopened and we stocked up on our favourite perfumes to go back to the office and social events. This sparked talk of a Fragrance Index, with Coty, Estée Lauder Cos Inc. and L’Oréal all seeing strong demand. This is a variation on the Lipstick Index, first observed by Leonard Lauder during the 2001 recession, which described how women facing an uncertain economic environment splurged on more affordable treats. In this sense, Puig has more in common with Galderma Group SA, which offers dermatological products, another fast-growing category, than Germany’s answer to beauty behemoth Sephora, Douglas AG. While Galderma shares soared 21 percent in its market debut last month, Douglas slumped 11 percent. There is a question mark over whether Puig’s perfume brands are sought after by Gen-Z buyers. Its overall portfolio is clearly premium, and it has some niche scents, such as Penhaligon’s, L’Artisan Parfumeur, Dries Van Noten and Byredo. What’s more, fully or majority-owned brands account for more than 90 percent of revenue, making it less at risk than some rivals of luxury houses taking control of their beauty offerings and delivering higher margins. Puig had an Ebitda margin of 20 percent in 2023, compared with the almost 18 percent expected for Coty in the year to June. Puig’s biggest brand is Rabanne, which reached €1 billion of revenue last year, with Carolina Herrera also approaching this level of sales. These are mainstream fragrances, and Puig will need to work hard to ensure these brands appeal to discerning buyers by adding more premium artisanal lines. Cosmetics and skincare remain smaller parts of the business. The company is building its presence in these markets, for example buying dermatological skincare brand Dr. Barbara Sturm in January. The appeal of Charlotte Tilbury shows no sign of diminishing, with this brand also approaching €1 billion of revenue. But Puig will need to continue to invest in makeup and skincare, particularly to tap Asia. And when it comes to buying either niche fragrance names or beauty brands, prices can be high. Perhaps the biggest risk is from a cooling in the red-hot beauty market. Ulta Beauty Inc. chief executive officer Dave Kimbell said last week that the retailer had seen both the mass-market and luxury segments slow “meaningfully” since the beginning of February. He said the deceleration had been “a bit earlier and a bit bigger” than expected. ADVERTISEMENT It’s not immediately clear whether this is a good or bad sign for the broader consumer economy. A positive reading would be that if women aren’t buying lipstick and premium haircare, perhaps they are splashing out on handbags or getting their hair done at salons. A more worrying scenario is that consumers are pulling back from smaller purchases because of rising prices or because they bought enough moisturiser and mascara over the past three years. Kimbell blamed higher credit-card debt and the return late last year of student loan repayments for the retrenchment. Either way, the development is an unhelpful one for a beauty business that’s coming to market. Against this backdrop, Puig must put its best face — or fragrance — forward.

This anticipation comes as major credit companies move to adjust their fee structures, potentially impacting consumer spending and the broader economy. What Happened : The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released findings on Monday, revealing a significant portion of the population bracing for harder times in securing credit. A net 68% of survey respondents foresee more difficult credit conditions over the next twelve months, Bloomberg reports. This figure marks the highest level of consumer pessimism regarding credit access in four months, and is slightly lower than the 70.4% recorded a year prior. See Also: Larry Summers Says There’s Still A ‘Real Possibility’ Of A Fed Move Higher – ‘Would Be An Inappropriate Act To Cut Rates’ At June Meeting Meanwhile, a Fannie Mae survey revealed that 58% of respondents believe obtaining a home mortgage today would be challenging, marking a 4% increase from February and the most significant monthly rise since September. This perception of difficulty has risen by 6% compared to last year. This persistent concern over tightening credit standards underscores the potential for a deceleration in loan growth, which historically has been linked to broader economic downturns, according to Bloomberg. Why It Matters : The apprehension among U.S. consumers regarding credit access comes at a time when major credit card companies like Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA ) and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V ) are making significant changes to their fee structures. Mastercard announced an increase in specific credit card fees starting April 15, following a $30 billion settlement with Visa over swipe fees. This move is expected to impose additional costs on retailers, which could trickle down to consumers. The Merchants Payments Coalition reports that the network “assessment” fee is set to rise from 0.13% to 0.14%, leading to an extra $259.1 million in fees, given last year’s transactions surpassed $2 trillion. This development could further tighten the credit landscape, affecting consumer spending behavior and potentially contributing to the economic slowdown anticipated by the surveyed consumers.

Login Investors are becoming increasingly sceptical that the Reserve Bank of Australia will need to cut interest rates at all this year, after more upbeat data in the US reinforced expectations that borrowing costs in the world’s largest economy will remain higher for longer. Last month, there had been hopes that the US Federal Reserve could kick off an easing cycle mid-year, paving the way for the RBA to lower its benchmark rate in September.

The numbers The Australian sharemarket traded steadily throughout Monday following a solid lead from Wall Street on Friday as US investors welcomed a surprisingly strong US jobs report. The S&P/ASX 200 Index closed up 15.8 points, or 0.2 per cent higher at 7789.1 points, kept afloat primarily by stronger technology stocks. The Australian sharemarket opened in the green on Monday. Credit: Louise Kennerley The lifters IT firm Life360 kept its lead as the bourse’s best performer of the day with a 16.8 per cent share price surge after the company provided a positive update to the market. The company revealed net additions of 4.9 million global monthly active users for its first quarter, bringing the total to 66.4 million. It is a record result for a first quarter and it is up from net additions of 2.2 million in the first quarter last year. Among the miners, Paladin shares finished 6.7 per cent higher and Newmont rose 6.6 per cent. Qantas shares climbed 4.8 per cent after investors gave their stamp of approval after the airline’s unveiling of a long-awaited revamp of its frequent flyer program , as part of its push to restore the carrier’s credibility with consumers. The laggards Advertisement Loading Giant agribusiness Elders finished as the day’s worst performer, plunging 24.4 per cent after the company issued a trading update that revealed first-half earnings were likely to come in “significantly below expectations”. Elders projects underlying earnings before interest and taxes of between $120 million and $140 million for 2023-24, down from $170.8 million in the same period a year earlier. Beach Energy shares slid 15 per cent after the company revealed further delays and cost blowouts to its Waitsia Stage 2 LNG project in Western Australia. Strike Energy slid 6 per cent. The lowdow n Capital.com senior market analyst Kyle Rodda said the ASX was hanging onto gains “by the fingernails”. “A spike in Australian yields has been a headwind to the market, although – just like on Wall Street – the tech sector has defied conventional wisdom and climbed despite the dynamic,” he wrote in a note. Technology stocks were largely responsible for keeping the benchmark ASX 200 in the green: WiseTech Global is up 0.8 per cent and TechnologyOne rose by 1.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar demonstrated “impressive resilience” last week thanks to surging commodity prices and better than expected global manufacturing data, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. “Whether the AUD/USD can lock in a third straight week of gains will depend on whether commodity prices can extend recent gains, as well as CPI and PPI data in the US, given the Fed’s focus on inflation. Australian consumer confidence data scheduled for release tomorrow may also have a say,” he wrote. Shares of major supermarket Coles dipped 1.2 per cent after Craig Emerson’s interim report into the food and grocery code of conduct recommended making the code mandatory and called for major penalties for breaches. Shares of rival Woolworths sank 0.3 per cent. Mining giants were a mixed bag: Rio Tinto closed 1 per cent higher while BHP dipped 0.2 per cent. Fortescue Metals lifted 0.3 per cent. On Friday, stocks ended solidly higher on Wall Street and bond yields rose as investors digested relatively strong jobs data. The surprisingly robust jobs figures boosted Wall Street. Credit: NYSE The S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 per cent, making up most of the losses from the previous day, and moving closer to its record set last week. However, the benchmark still posted its first weekly loss in three weeks. The gains were broad. Every sector in the S&P 500 finished in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.2 per cent. Loading Technology stocks accounted for a big slice of the rally. Market darling chipmaker Nvidia’s shares gained 2.4 per cent, while Google’s parent company Alphabet rose 1.3 per cent. US employers added a surprisingly strong 303,000 workers to their payrolls in March, according to a government report. The stronger than expected jobs market has helped fuel consumer spending and earnings growth for businesses, lifting the likelihood of solid economic growth. Still, the robust jobs numbers fuelled concerns that inflation might be creeping higher, which could delay expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, reports indicated that wages had risen by a modest 0.3 per cent for the month, which puts less upward pressure on inflation. Wall Street still expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in June. Treasury yields climbed following the jobs report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.4 per cent, from 4.31 per cent just before the report was released. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.75 per cent, from 4.65 per cent. Investors will get another key update on inflation next week, when the government releases its March report on consumer prices.

Qantas shares climbed 4.8 per cent after investors gave their stamp of approval after the airline’s unveiling of a long-awaited revamp of its frequent flyer program , as part of its push to restore the carrier’s credibility with consumers. The laggards Advertisement Loading Giant agribusiness Elders finished as the day’s worst performer, plunging 24.4 per cent after the company issued a trading update that revealed first-half earnings were likely to come in “significantly below expectations”. Elders projects underlying earnings before interest and taxes of between $120 million and $140 million for 2023-24, down from $170.8 million in the same period a year earlier. Beach Energy shares slid 15 per cent after the company revealed further delays and cost blowouts to its Waitsia Stage 2 LNG project in Western Australia. Strike Energy slid 6 per cent. The lowdow n Capital.com senior market analyst Kyle Rodda said the ASX was hanging onto gains “by the fingernails”. “A spike in Australian yields has been a headwind to the market, although – just like on Wall Street – the tech sector has defied conventional wisdom and climbed despite the dynamic,” he wrote in a note. Technology stocks were largely responsible for keeping the benchmark ASX 200 in the green: WiseTech Global is up 0.8 per cent and TechnologyOne rose by 1.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar demonstrated “impressive resilience” last week thanks to surging commodity prices and better than expected global manufacturing data, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. “Whether the AUD/USD can lock in a third straight week of gains will depend on whether commodity prices can extend recent gains, as well as CPI and PPI data in the US, given the Fed’s focus on inflation. Australian consumer confidence data scheduled for release tomorrow may also have a say,” he wrote. Shares of major supermarket Coles dipped 1.2 per cent after Craig Emerson’s interim report into the food and grocery code of conduct recommended making the code mandatory and called for major penalties for breaches. Shares of rival Woolworths sank 0.3 per cent. Mining giants were a mixed bag: Rio Tinto closed 1 per cent higher while BHP dipped 0.2 per cent. Fortescue Metals lifted 0.3 per cent. On Friday, stocks ended solidly higher on Wall Street and bond yields rose as investors digested relatively strong jobs data. The surprisingly robust jobs figures boosted Wall Street. Credit: NYSE The S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 per cent, making up most of the losses from the previous day, and moving closer to its record set last week. However, the benchmark still posted its first weekly loss in three weeks. The gains were broad. Every sector in the S&P 500 finished in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.2 per cent. Loading Technology stocks accounted for a big slice of the rally. Market darling chipmaker Nvidia’s shares gained 2.4 per cent, while Google’s parent company Alphabet rose 1.3 per cent. US employers added a surprisingly strong 303,000 workers to their payrolls in March, according to a government report. The stronger than expected jobs market has helped fuel consumer spending and earnings growth for businesses, lifting the likelihood of solid economic growth. Still, the robust jobs numbers fuelled concerns that inflation might be creeping higher, which could delay expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, reports indicated that wages had risen by a modest 0.3 per cent for the month, which puts less upward pressure on inflation. Wall Street still expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in June. Treasury yields climbed following the jobs report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.4 per cent, from 4.31 per cent just before the report was released. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.75 per cent, from 4.65 per cent. Investors will get another key update on inflation next week, when the government releases its March report on consumer prices. Tweet of the day Quote of the day ‘This is about providing more access to more seats on more flights across more time periods. It’s also about making sure we do that sustainably.’ That’s Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson on why the airline has created a third tier instead of making more Classic Rewards seats available.

    "article_text": "Navbharat Times The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has announced the launch of a mobile application, the ' G-sec App ', as part of its Retail Direct Scheme . This initiative aims to simplify the process of investing in government securities (G-Secs) for retail investors. As per the RBI Governor, \"The RBI Retail Direct Scheme was launched in November 2021. It is now proposed to launch a mobile app for accessing the Retail Direct portal. This will be of greater convenience to retail investors and deepen the G-sec market. \" As per the statement given by RBI, \"RBI Retail Direct Scheme, launched in November 2021, gives access to individual investors to maintain gilt accounts with RBI and invest in government securities. The Scheme enables investors to buy securities in primary auctions as well as buy/sell securities through the NDS-OM platform. To further improve ease of access, a mobile application of the Retail Direct portal is being developed. The app will enable investors to buy and sell instruments on the go, at their convenience. The app will be available for use shortly.\" Let's delve into how this app works and its significance: What is the Retail Direct Scheme? Live Events The Retail Direct Scheme was introduced in 2021 to enable individual investors to directly invest in G-Secs issued by the Central and State Governments. This eliminates the need for intermediaries or agents, making the investment process more accessible and transparent. How Does the G-Sec App Simplify Investment? The G-sec App serves as a one-stop solution for retail investors looking to invest in government bonds and treasury bills. It provides a user-friendly interface for buying and selling securities, eliminating the complexities of traditional investment methods. What Are Government Securities? Government securities, also known as G-Secs, are investment instruments issued by governments to raise funds. They offer a low-risk investment option with fixed interest rates. Treasury bills are short-term securities issued for less than 12 months, while bonds are issued for longer durations. Why is the G-Sec App Important? The G-Sec App enhances the accessibility of G-Sec investments for retail investors. It streamlines the investment process, making it easier for individuals to participate in the G-Sec market. The app's launch is expected to attract more investors, particularly those seeking low-risk investment options. What Do Market Participants Say? Market participants believe that the app will foster a fairer environment in the G-Sec market by enhancing transparency and efficiency. The app may also lower transaction costs for retail investors, making G-Sec investments more attractive. The G-sec App is a significant step towards democratizing investment in government securities. By simplifying the investment process and enhancing accessibility, the app is expected to deepen the G-Sec market and empower retail investors to make informed investment decisions.

Consumers remain cautious as UK high street sales continue to plummet Published: 08:14 05 Apr 2024 BST The onset of spring did not translate into positive sales figures for the UK high street, despite a slight boost from Mother’s Day and Easter. According to the BDO High Street Tracker, total like-for-like (LFL) sales were down by 2.2% in the five weeks to 31 March compared to the same period last year, marking the sixth consecutive month of negative performance. Store sales decreased by 1.8%, a significant drop from a strong performance of +6.6% in March 2023, while non-store sales fell by 2.3% from a positive base of +2.8% last year. Lifestyle sales showed resilience, likely buoyed by gift purchases around Mother’s Day, while Fashion and Homewares plummeted 3.2% and 10.9% respectively. BDO’s data suggests that the generally positive footfall in March, helped by Mother’s Day and the Easter long weekend, was not enough to offset broader trends of cautious consumer spending and the ongoing impacts of economic uncertainty. “Following the Spring Budget, it remains to be seen whether the changes to the National Minimum Wage and National Insurance bands result in increased consumer spending, however the latest consumer confidence data suggests consumers remain wary about the national economic outlook,” said BDO.

Robinhood’s share price rose sharply as retail engagement accelerated. The big question is how long the recent acceleration in retail trading will last, the report said. The key question for trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is how long the recent acceleration in retail trading will last, broker KBW said in a research report that initiated coverage of the stock with a market perform rating and a $20 price target. KBW notes that retail engagement materially ramped up in the first quarter, helping drive the share price up 150% in only four months. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

If there is continued strength in retail stocks and cryptocurrency prices, the acceleration in retail engagement could continue and may even increase, the report published Tuesday said. Still, the stock price has already “adequately captured the baseline upside” from new product launches and has started to “price in a higher level of normalized retail trading activity,” analysts led by Kyle Voigt wrote. Retail activity is expected to moderate from the levels seen in the first quarter and gradually decline into 2025, the note said. The U.S. self-directed brokerage industry is one of the quickest growing sectors of the broader U.S. wealth market, and “Robinhood is positioned as a small (but quickly growing) player in a secularly growing industry,” the report added. “With Robinhood only having ~1% share of U.S. self-directed assets, but ~20% share of estimated total U.S. self-direct brokerage accounts, we believe there is room for HOOD to outpace the overall asset growth in the self-directed industry as its core client cohort matures,” the authors wrote. Robinhood shares closed at $19.20 on Tuesday, and have gained over 50% year-to-date.

Breslin’s articles from Jackson Lewis P.C. are most popular: in United States Jackson Lewis P.C. are most popular: within Intellectual Property and Law Practice Management topic(s) As more state and local pay transparency laws are enacted throughout the country, retail industry employers face a new challenge in an ever-evolving industry. State Pay Transparency Laws Pay transparency laws are in effect in nine states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington. The District of Columbia and Illinois pay transparency laws are scheduled to go into effect on June 30, 2024, and Jan. 1, 2025, respectively. Additionally, at least seven local jurisdictions have pay transparency laws in effect, and proposed legislation is pending in many other state and local jurisdictions. This patchwork of pay transparency laws throughout the country has and will continue to challenge retail industry employers in their hiring practices. Patchwork Uniquely Impacting Retailers The requirements of the laws, existing and proposed, generally are similar in that employers must provide a rate or range of pay the employer in good faith believes at the time of the posting it would pay for the advertised job. Many of these laws, however, impose unique requirements that are critical for retail industry employers to consider. For example, retail employers in California with fewer than 15 employees need only provide a pay scale to an applicant upon request, but if an employer employs at least 15 employees, a pay range is required in all job postings. On the other hand, Hawaii's law applies only to employers with at least 50 employees. In some jurisdictions, including Colorado, employers must include a general description of the benefits and other compensation applicable to a specific job being posted. They also must provide the date the application window is anticipated to close. Retail employers with multi-jurisdiction operations must be aware of and account for these and other new requirements, which likely will continue to evolve as more laws are enacted and existing laws are amended. Given the high level of seasonality employment in the retail industry, including a surge in hiring during holiday seasons, retail employers must ensure that the job posting includes an accurate good faith rate or range of pay when posted for the job advertised. Similarly, retail industry employers have a unique challenge when it comes to the competition for talent in areas with pay transparency laws. A seasoned and well-qualified retail employee may shop around when searching for their next seasonal position, focusing on opportunities with the highest rate of pay. This trend can make it difficult for certain retail industry employers to hire workers. Employers should consider and account for the rates and ranges of pay offered by their competitors in particular geographic areas. The common industry practice of using third-party job-posting vendors is another challenge in the retail industry. Retail employers using a third-party to post or publish a job posting should provide the rate or range of pay to its third-party vendor to include in their job postings. While some pay transparency laws are silent or do not clearly state when a retail employer is liable for its third-party vendor's violation, failure to provide this information to a third-party vendor could result in penalties and exposure to the employer. Potential penalties under many of pay transparency laws are on a per-violation basis, which could more significantly impact employers in the retail industry than those in other industries. Because of the high rate of turnover and seasonality of many positions in the retail industry, some retail employers may post a higher number of job listings and advertisements than other industries each year. Thus, the higher number of postings could lead to more non-compliant job postings or advertisements and a higher risk of penalties than for employers in industries with a more stable, long-term workforce. Additionally, the pay transparency laws in some jurisdictions, including California, provide a private right of action to individuals who believe they have been aggrieved. Practical Steps for Employers Retail industry employers must be proactive in identifying applicable pay transparency laws in jurisdictions in which they operate and employ individuals. Retail industry employers should be diligent in developing uniform processes and forms used when advertising for a specific job, accounting for a specific jurisdiction's requirements, to avoid potential penalties or other claims. Moreover, retail industry employers should consider developing and implementing training on pay transparency requirements for individuals within their organization responsible for recruiting and hiring. This growing trend of pay transparency laws enacted around the United States is here to stay. Retail industry employers, especially those with multi-jurisdictional operations, should plan for these new requirements in more jurisdictions throughout the country. Proactive planning will avoid disruption to hiring needs and operations and mitigate the risk of potential business exposure.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Tue, Apr 2, 2024 · 04:34 PM THE Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) will offer 300-billion yuan (S$56.1 billion) in financing to boost the nation’s tourism sector amid sluggish consumer spending in the world’s second-largest economy. The country’s biggest bank signed a cooperation pact with China’s culture and tourism ministry on Tuesday (Apr 2) to “stimulate” tourism investment and spending, according to a statement posted on the ministry’s official WeChat account. ICBC and ministry will work together on key tourism-related construction projects, according to the statement. Some tourism agencies based in several Asian cities including Seoul, Tokyo and Thailand also signed agreements with ICBC’s branches. China’s economy has been hampered by deflationary pressure and a protracted property crisis, dampening consumer spending. Tourism, however, has been a rare economic bright spot. The country saw domestic tourism trips soar 93.3 per cent last year from 2022, with spending reaching 4.91 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 140.3 per cent. During February’s eight-day Chinese New Year holiday, domestic trips rose 19 per cent from the pre-Covid 2019, while spending climbed 7.7 per cent.

    "article_text": "1 Magnificent S&P Dividend Stock Down 12% to Buy and Hold Forever Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool April 1, 2024 4 min read AAPL NVDA MSFT When it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta (NASDAQ: META) , and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple. Apple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year. AAPL data by YCharts . Apple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon. Why is Apple stock down? Apple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China. China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul. Now that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side. Is Apple stock a buy now? Here are three reasons for optimism: Consumer strength Services Return of capital. While iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust. Another reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below. Source: Statista. Services include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable. Story Continues Apple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today. Apple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020. Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by \"bridging the physical and digital space.\" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation. Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips.

    "article_text": "When it comes to Nvidia ( NVDA 3.06% ) , Microsoft ( MSFT +0.53% ) , Meta ( META 0.74% ) , and Apple ( AAPL +2.12% ) , which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple. Apple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year. AAPL data by YCharts . Apple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon. Why is Apple stock down? Apple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China. China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul. Now that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side. Is Apple stock a buy now? Here are three reasons for optimism: Consumer strength Services Return of capital. While iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust. Another reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below. Source: Statista. Services include Apple Pay, iCloud subscriptions, advertising, and others. Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable. Apple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks . Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today. Apple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year.
