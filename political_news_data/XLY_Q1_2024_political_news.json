The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed consumer spending rising by the most in just over a year last month, underscoring the economy’s resilience. The United States continues to outperform its global peers despite higher borrowing costs, thanks to persistent labor market strength. “Core services inflation is slowing and will likely continue throughout the year,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “By the time the Fed meets in June, the data should be convincing enough for them to commence its rate normalisation process.” The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Data for January was revised higher to show the PCE price index climbing 0.4 percent instead of 0.3 percent as previously reported. Goods prices rose 0.5 percent last month, boosted by a 3.4 percent jump in the cost of gasoline and other energy products.

In the 12 months through February, PCE inflation advanced 2.5 percent after increasing 2.4 percent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index gaining 0.4 percent on the month. Though price pressures are subsiding, the pace has slowed from the first half of last year. Fed officials last week left the US central bank’s policy rate unchanged in the current 5.25 percent -5.50 percent range, having raised it by 525 basis points since March 2022. Policymakers anticipate three rate cuts this year. Financial markets expect the first rate reduction in June. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Wednesday, “there is no rush to cut the policy rate” right now, but he did not rule out trimming borrowing costs later in the year. Most US financial markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday, with the exception of the foreign exchange market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on the data.

The increase in the so-called real consumer spending suggested that consumption likely retained most of its momentum in the first quarter, which bodes well for the economy’s prospects.

    "article_text": "CNN - Business/Consumer By CNN Newsource Published March 29, 2024 5:37 am By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN New York (CNN) — The latest US inflation report showed that rising prices continue to weigh on American consumers. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, was up 2.5% for the 12 months that ended in February, a faster pace than January’s 2.4% rise in prices . However, it was in line with FactSet consensus estimates. Driving the increase in the annual inflation rate was a 2.3% jump last month in energy prices. The Commerce Department data released Friday means the Fed is even further from achieving its goal of 2% inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell wasn’t fretting about it. The data was “pretty much in line with our expectations,” Powell said Friday at an event hosted by the San Francisco Fed. He added that it’s generally good when data aligns with the central bank’s forecasts. The report also contained some welcome news. Central bankers will likely take some solace in the core PCE index that excludes energy and food. That index slowed slightly to 2.8% from the 2.9% annual rate seen in January. And, on a monthly basis, it slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in January. Both core inflation measures were in line with expectations. Another bright spot was the 0.3% overall monthly pace of price increases, a slight drop from 0.4% in January. That was below what economists polled by FactSet forecast. At 0.5%, the monthly rise in the price of goods outpaced the 0.3% rise in the price of services. That’s significant because service-side inflation has been a huge driver of overall inflation in the economy for the past two years. The Fed’s historic rate increases that pushed interest rates to a 23-year high have had a limited effect on containing increases in the price of services. That’s because those price increases have been stemming from labor shortages, and to attract more workers employers have had to raise wages. In turn, that’s caused them to also raise prices. Consumer spending staged a huge comeback Although recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending, Friday’s PCE data showed the opposite effect. Consumer spending accelerated by 0.8% last month from 0.2% in January. That’s the biggest monthly rise in over a year. While consumer spending is the main economic engine of the US economy, the run-up may not be something to celebrate right now. “This underscores that consumers have overextended themselves and have essentially drawdown all of the $2.1 trillion in pandemic-related savings,” Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a note on Friday. That’s evidenced by credit card debt , which is at a record high. “As long as employment growth remains strong, it can underpin solid spending, however, consumers overall are not prepared for a weakening in the labor market should it unfold,” she said. More rate cut delays? The latest inflation data is unlikely to shift the Fed’s plans for eventually cutting interest rates. Central bankers including Powell have signaled that achieving 2% inflation will be a bumpy path. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller emphasized that in a speech he gave earlier this week titled “There’s Still No Rush.” Recent inflation readings, he said, tell him that “it is prudent to hold this rate at its current restrictive stance perhaps for longer than previously thought to help keep inflation on a sustainable trajectory toward 2%.” Fed officials continued to pencil in three rate cuts this year. Investors anticipate the first of those three will come in June. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "People walk past the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Peter Morgan/Associated Press Stocks wrapped up a monster first quarter on a subdued note Thursday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting double-digit gains the first three months of 2024 – powered by investors’ optimism about the state of the economy. The S&P 500 gained 10.8% in the first quarter, continuing a rally that began in late 2023 and notching its strongest start to the year since 2019. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also notched a respectable first quarter with a gain of 5.5%, which analysts took as a welcome sign that the current rally isn’t wholly dependent on Big Tech. The market surge is driven by the continued strength of the economy, with consumers continuing to open up their wallets, analysts said. “Underscored by a solid economic landscape and strong labor market coupled with resilient consumer spending, the Dow has powered ahead to post new highs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. Advertisement The Dow closed at 39,807 Thursday, up 0.1% for the day and setting a record. The S&P 500 closed at 5,254, up 0.1% for the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1% to close at 16,379. The strong quarter for all three indexes extends gains in the final months of 2023, when a cadre of Big Tech stocks dubbed the Magnificent Seven pulled the market higher. Companies that benefited from the hype around advancements in artificial intelligence wowed Wall Street the most, specifically Microsoft and Nvidia. But the market’s performance so far in 2024 has also broadened the rally. The Dow, which includes 30 large companies traded on U.S. stock exchanges ― so-called blue-chip companies, including Apple, Boeing, Nike and Walmart – is a closely watched bellwether of how the stock market is doing. Because it excludes several of the Magnificent Seven, some analysts consider it to be more representative of the U.S. economy itself ― “Main Street America’s favored index,” as Krosby puts it. The Dow’s strength suggests the current rally in stocks might have staying power, analysts said. The success of the Dow “indicates prosperity in this country, and an expanding economy,” said Michael Farr of the Washington, D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington. Advertisement One factor behind the Dow’s strong performance was a rally among companies linked to the financial sector, which accounted for almost half of its increase for the quarter, Farr said. American Express and insurance company Travelers have each gained about 20% since the start of the year; Goldman Sachs climbed more than 7%; and JPMorgan finished the quarter up by about 16%. The rally in the financial sector is supported in large part by the fact that consumer spending has held up better than expected, said Wayne Wicker of MissionSquare Retirement. “The resilience of the economy is an upside surprise for investors this year. … The economy remains vibrant, and consumer spending continues to drive forward,” Wicker said. Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the path of interest rates as well. The Federal Reserve is keeping rates at their current high until they see more evidence of inflation coming down. But the central bank is expected to pursue three rate cuts in 2024."

The rally in the financial sector is supported in large part by the fact that consumer spending has held up better than expected, said Wayne Wicker of MissionSquare Retirement. “The resilience of the economy is an upside surprise for investors this year. … The economy remains vibrant, and consumer spending continues to drive forward,” Wicker said. Looking ahead, investors will be closely watching the path of interest rates as well. The Federal Reserve is keeping rates at their current high until they see more evidence of inflation coming down. But the central bank is expected to pursue three rate cuts in 2024."

    "article_text": "The US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong consumer spending and business investment in nonresidential structures like factories and healthcare facilities. The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed profits rising at a solid clip last quarter, driven by nonfinancial corporations. Increasing profits, together with rising worker productivity, could encourage companies to retain their employees. Labour market resilience is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy afloat despite dire predictions of a recession in the aftermath of 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 to quell inflation. “The consumer will be front and centre when it comes to gauging the strength left in this recovery, and their spending that has shifted to services will be critical this year,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualised rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be unrevised. The economy is growing above what US central bank officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8% and continues to outperform its global peers. The economy grew at a 4.9% pace in the July-September quarter. It expanded 2.5% in 2023, an acceleration from 1.9% in 2022. Growth estimates for the first quarter are converging around a 2.0% pace. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased at a 3.3% rate, adding 2.20 percentage points to GDP growth. It was previously estimated to have grown at a 3.0% pace. The upward revision was in services. The upgrade to business spending reflected higher outlays on manufacturing as well as commercial and healthcare structures than previously estimated. Spending on intellectual property products was also revised up, while the decline in outlays on equipment was not as steep as previously estimated. Corporate profits including inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $133.5bn in the fourth quarter after rising $108.7bn in the July-September quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations increased$136.5bn, while those of financial corporations rose $5.9bn. That more than offset an $8.9bn decline in profits from the rest of the world. When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a robust 4.8% rate. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 1.9% pace in the July-September quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. A widening gap between GDI and GDP in prior quarters had raised concerns among some economists that the economy was not as strong as suggested by the GDP figures. The surge in GDI reflected higher wages and profits. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 4.1% rate last quarter after advancing at a 3.4% pace in the third quarter. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended March 23. Economists had forecast 212,000 claims in the latest week. Claims have been hovering in a 200,000-213,000 range since February. Most employers are retaining their workers despite a rash of high-profile layoffs at the start of the year. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 24,000 to 1.819mn during the week ending March 16, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March’s unemployment rate. Continuing claims were little changed between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in February."

    "article_text": "Summary The latest revisions put Q4 GDP at 3.4%, the second fastest quarterly growth rate in two years. Much of the upside was attributable to stronger consumer spending, yet fresh profits data affirmed it was a good quarter for the bottom line as well with profits up by the most since the Q2-2022. Hindsight 2024 In its latest revision to fourth quarter GDP, the Commerce Department flagged growth during the period at 3.4%, which is a faster clip than previous estimates (chart). With the benefit of even more hindsight, consumer spending is now pegged at an annualized growth rate of 3.3% up from just 3.0% previously (chart). What drove the adjustment higher was a better finish than expected for services outlays. While it may be encouraging to see sustained consumer spending growth in this sector, the staying power could be problematic for the Fed should the sustained demand there prevent a cooling in service prices. Tomorrow will bring monthly data for February on PCE inflation; we already know from the January report that the trend decline in services inflation has been interrupted. Structures spending jumped to 3.7% from 2.4% in the prior estimate on upward revisions to private nonresidential construction spending. One theme we've highlighted is how a boom in manufacturing construction has scope to lift future output capacity. In the meantime it can be supportive to topline growth through stronger structures investment. Residential fixed investment growth was revised lower by a tenth of a percent.

    "article_text": "WRAPUP 2-US economy continues to shine with help from consumers, labor market \"It is operating on a more even keel than during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath.\" Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Reuters | Updated: 28-03-2024 22:30 IST | Created: 28-03-2024 22:30 IST SHARE The U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong consumer spending and business investment in nonresidential structures like factories and healthcare facilities. The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed profits rising at a solid clip last quarter, driven by nonfinancial corporations. Increasing profits, together with rising worker productivity, could encourage companies to retain their employees, and extend the economic expansion. The economy has shrugged off fearmongering about a recession following 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 to quell inflation. Though momentum has slowed, it continues to outpace its global peers. The report, which also showed underlying inflation pressures easing last quarter, did not change expectations that the U.S. central bank will start cutting rates by June. \"The economy is in good shape,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas. \"It is operating on a more even keel than during the pandemic and its immediate aftermath.\" Gross domestic product increased at a 3.4% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the previously reported 3.2% pace, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. The revision reflected upgrades in consumer spending, business investment as well as state and local government spending, which offset downgrades to inventory accumulation and exports. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be unrevised. The economy is growing faster than the 1.8% pace Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary rate of growth. It grew at a 4.9% pace in the July-September quarter, and expanded 2.5% in 2023, an acceleration from 1.9% in 2022. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.0% pace. The increase in core inflation last quarter was trimmed to a 2.0% rate from a 2.1% pace. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed ahead of the Good Friday holiday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. CONSUMER SPENDING UPGRADED Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.3% rate, adding 2.20 percentage points to GDP growth. It was previously estimated to have grown at a 3.0% pace. The upward revision was in services. The upgrade to business spending reflected higher outlays on manufacturing as well as commercial and healthcare structures than previously estimated. Spending on intellectual property products was also revised up, while the decline in outlays on equipment was not as steep as previously estimated. Inventory investment was lowered to a $54.9 billion rate from the previously estimated $66.3 billion pace. While that subtracted 0.47 percentage point from GDP growth, the outlook for this year is encouraging. Stronger consumer spending last year and expectations for a moderation this year likely resulted in the slower pace of inventory accumulation. \"We anticipate that inventory accumulation will stabilize, then begin to pick up again over the next few years,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"That turn in the inventory cycle will help support GDP growth this year and make the slowdown gradual.\" Nearly all industries contributed to growth last quarter, with nondurable goods manufacturing leading the charge, followed by retail trade, durable goods manufacturing and healthcare and social assistance. But agriculture, wholesale trade and arts, entertainment and recreation were minor drags. Corporate profits including inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $133.5 billion after rising $108.7 billion in the July-September quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial firms increased $136.5 billion, while those of financial institutions rose $5.9 billion, more than offsetting an $8.9 billion decline in profits from the rest of the world. Profit margins were solid. \"While firms have generally pulled back on making large capital expenditures, decent year-end profitability suggests businesses entered 2024 in adequate financial shape,\" said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"To the extent continued profitability enables hiring, spending could be sustained.\" Higher profits together with fairly strong wage gains boosted the income side of the growth ledger. Gross domestic income (GDI) grew at a robust 4.8% rate after increasing at a 1.9% pace in the July-September quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. The sharp narrowing in the gap between GDP and GDI should assuage concerns that the economy's health was being overstated. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 4.1% rate last quarter after advancing at a 3.4% pace in the third quarter. A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended March 23. Economists had forecast 212,000 claims in the latest week. Claims have been hovering in a 200,000-213,000 range since February despite a rash of high-profile layoffs at the start of the year.

The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March's unemployment rate. Continuing claims were little changed between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in February. \"The labor market is becoming better balanced between demand for and supply of workers, which will help moderate upward wages pressures,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos. LEARN MORE While their real estate values went up slightly, the value of their privately held businesses declined, essentially canceling out all other gains outside of stocks. The quarterly gain marked the latest addition to an unprecedented wealth boom that began in 2020 with the Covid-19 pandemic market surge. Since 2020, the wealth of the top 1% has increased by nearly $15 trillion, or 49%. Middle-class Americans have also seen a rising wealth tide, with the middle 50% to 90% of Americans seeing their wealth increase 50%. Economists say the rising stock market is giving an added boost to consumer spending through what is known as the \"wealth effect.\" When consumers and investors see their stock holdings soar, they feel more confident spending and taking more risk. \"The wealth effect from surging stock prices is a powerful tailwind to consumer confidence, spending and broader economic growth,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. \"Of course, this highlights a vulnerability of the economy if the stock market were to falter. This isn't the most likely scenario, but it is a scenario given that stocks appear richly (over) valued.\" Yet, the latest report also highlights how top-heavy stock ownership remains in the U.S. According to the Fed report, the top 10% of Americans own 87% of individually held stocks and mutual funds. The top 1% own half of all individually held stocks. Economists say a rising stock market brings outsized benefits to the wealthy, mainly boosting the high end of the consumer and spending markets. The wealth of middle-class and lower-income Americans depends more on wages and home values than stocks. \"Those households in the top one-third of the income distribution and who own the bulk of the stock holdings account for approximately two-thirds of consumer spending,\" Zandi said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab , said stocks represent a growing share of the assets of the top 1%. Stocks accounted for 37.8% of the overall share of household assets for the top 1% at the end of 2023, up from a recent low of 36.5%. Yet because the wealthy don't need to spend as much of their gains – a phenomenon known as the marginal propensity to consume – Sonders said the added stock wealth for the 1% may not have a substantial impact on the consumer economy. She noted that consumer confidence among those making more than $125,000 a year has been in \"secular decline\" since 2017, according to the Conference Board. \"While the bump in stock prices might link to stronger confidence, it doesn't necessarily point to stronger spending at the higher end,\" she said. With the S&P 500 already up 10% this year, it is likely that the wealth of the upper echelon has already topped the record at the end of 2023. While inequality declined slightly in 2021 and 2022, as wages increased and housing prices surged, the wealth gap has since crept back to pre-pandemic levels. The top 1% accounted for 30% of the nation's wealth at the end of the fourth quarter, while the top 10% accounted for 67% of all wealth.

This isn't the most likely scenario, but it is a scenario given that stocks appear richly (over) valued.\" Yet, the latest report also highlights how top-heavy stock ownership remains in the U.S. According to the Fed report, the top 10% of Americans own 87% of individually held stocks and mutual funds. The top 1% own half of all individually held stocks. Economists say a rising stock market brings outsized benefits to the wealthy, mainly boosting the high end of the consumer and spending markets. The wealth of middle-class and lower-income Americans depends more on wages and home values than stocks. \"Those households in the top one-third of the income distribution and who own the bulk of the stock holdings account for approximately two-thirds of consumer spending,\" Zandi said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab , said stocks represent a growing share of the assets of the top 1%. Stocks accounted for 37.8% of the overall share of household assets for the top 1% at the end of 2023, up from a recent low of 36.5%. Yet because the wealthy don't need to spend as much of their gains – a phenomenon known as the marginal propensity to consume – Sonders said the added stock wealth for the 1% may not have a substantial impact on the consumer economy. She noted that consumer confidence among those making more than $125,000 a year has been in \"secular decline\" since 2017, according to the Conference Board. \"While the bump in stock prices might link to stronger confidence, it doesn't necessarily point to stronger spending at the higher end,\" she said. With the S&P 500 already up 10% this year, it is likely that the wealth of the upper echelon has already topped the record at the end of 2023. While inequality declined slightly in 2021 and 2022, as wages increased and housing prices surged, the wealth gap has since crept back to pre-pandemic levels. The top 1% accounted for 30% of the nation's wealth at the end of the fourth quarter, while the top 10% accounted for 67% of all wealth.

    "article_text": "Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty Close Welcome to Investopedia's economics live blog, where we'll explain what the day's news says about the state of the U.S. economy and how that's likely to affect your finances. Here we will compile data releases, economic reports, quotes from expert sources and anything else that helps explain economic issues and why they matter to you. Today, a measure of the economy's health was revised upward and pending home sales gave insight into whether the gridlock in the housing market is starting to clear. Catch the economics blog again on Monday, as we will take a break while the markets are closed on Friday. Mortgage Rates Dip, Sparking Hope Inventory is Sustainably Improving March 28, 2024 04:08 PM EDT Mortgage rates continued to move below the 7% level this week, a good sign that more homes could be for sale soon as rates could continue to move lower, according to Freddie Mac. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.79%, slipping from last week’s 6.87% . The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was also lower, dropping to 6.11% this week. Since December, mortgage rates have see-sawed under 7%. “Rates remain elevated near 7% as markets watch for signs of cooling inflation, hoping that rates will come down further,” Khatner said. Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khatner pointed to “encouraging” data showing existing home sales jumped in February. That was an improvement from last year when inventory problems stymied the home sales market as mortgage rates moved to decades-high levels . -Terry Lane Consumer Views on the Economy Are Stabilizing March 28, 2024 11:28 AM EDT In its final reading for March, consumer sentiment surged ahead of economists' projections but remained relatively steady throughout the first quarter of 2024. The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index moved up to 79.4 in March, up from the prior reading of 76.9. However, that's within the margin of error, showing that opinions on the economy have been mostly locked in since January, said survey director Joanne Hsu. Consumer sentiment is nearly 30% higher than year-ago levels. “This stability reflects a perception among consumers that the economy has been holding steady in its current state,” Hsu said. Consumers also felt better about inflation, the survey showed. Their expectations for price increases moderated for both the year ahead and the long run. Consumer survey results on both current economic conditions and economic expectations improved. “Assessments and expectations of personal finances improved modestly from last month, as the perceived negative effects of high prices and expenses on living standards eased,” Hsu said. -Terry Lane Home Sale Contracts Ticked Up In February As Housing Market Thaw Continued March 28, 2024 10:11 AM EDT It’s not saying much, but 2024 is shaping up to be a better year for the housing market than 2023 was, according to new data on pending home sales. There were 1.6% more sales for existing homes in the pipeline in February than in January, based on contract signings that month, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. If that forward-looking indicator translates into actual home sales, it would continue this year’s trend of home sales bouncing back from the rock-bottom levels they hit in 2023. High mortgage rates, low for-sale inventories, and record prices combined to stifle homebuying last year to its slowest pace since 1995 . Two of those three factors have improved since late last year—the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has hovered in the high 6% range after nearing 8% late last fall, according to Freddie Mac. As a result, more homes have come on the market, the association said. The job market is still favorable to workers despite a recent slowdown, keeping some buyers in the market no matter how unaffordable it’s become . \"While modest sales growth might not stir excitement, it shows slow and steady progress from the lows of late last year,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. “Ongoing job gains are clearly increasing demand along with more inventory.” Despite the uptick, home sales still face massive headwinds—pending home sales were still down 7% compared to February 2023, the association said. Economy Grew Faster Than Thought In Fourth Quarter March 28, 2024 09:44 AM EDT Consumer spending is once again propelling the economy at a faster pace than initial estimates indicated. With all the data from the fourth quarter now in, it turns out the U.S. economy—as measured by inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product—grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, faster than the prior estimate of 3.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its third and final revision of the quarter’s data. The increase, due to upward revisions in estimates of consumer spending, beat forecasters’ expectations for 3.2% annual growth, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal . Figures for nonresidential fixed investment—things like business equipment—also increased, offsetting a downward revision for how much businesses built up their inventories, trends that could set the stage for more growth down the road. “There is plenty to like in the upward revision to Q4 U.S. real GDP growth as stronger consumer spending and slower inventory build pave the way more favorably for growth early this year,” Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a commentary. The 3.4% annual growth rate was a slowdown from the blockbuster 4.9% growth of the third quarter but still underscored how consumer spending, the beating heart of the U.S. economy, has stayed solid despite punishingly high interest rates. Resilient consumer spending has helped stave off a long-predicted recession amid the Federal Reserve’s anti-inflation interest rate hikes, at least so far. The Fed’s efforts to cool inflation—and the economy—with the highest interest rates since 2001 haven’t slowed business down as much as many economists had initially feared. Inflation is still running above the central bank’s target of a 2% annual rate, and data including the GDP shows the economy running hotter than expected. Because of this, some economists are bracing for the war on inflation to drag on at least through the end of the year , with interest rates staying higher for longer. Initial Jobless Claims Fell Slightly Last Week March 28, 2024 09:12 AM EDT Fewer people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ending March 23 than they did the week before. Initial jobless claims were down 2,000 people from the revised numbers from the prior week to 210,000. The four-week average, which is less volatile than the weekly number, was down 750. These numbers still are historically low, indicating that the labor market remains strong in the face of high interest rates. \"The Fed doesn't require significant weakening in the labor market to begin cutting interest rates but needs to be confident the job market is balanced enough to support a continued slowing in wage growth,\" wrote Oxford Eocnomics' Nancy Vanden Houten.

    "article_text": "March 28 (UPI) -- The U.S. economy grew even more in the fourth quarter of 2023 than previously reported, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report released Thursday. U.S. Gross Domestic Product was revised up to an annual rate of 3.4%, while personal income increased by $230.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up $10.7 billion from the previous estimate. The increase in real GDP, adjusted for inflation, was 3.2%. \"The update primarily reflected upward revisions to consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment,\" the Commerce Department's BEA said in a statement. Related Though U.S. economy shows signs of strength, poll shows third of Americans rate it as poor Joe Biden needs to make voters understand how to make this 'the best of times' U.S. economy added 275,000 jobs in February, unemployment was 3.9% Driving the revised real economic output were consumer spending increases, government spending, exports and fixed investments. Even the previous estimate of a 2.5% GDP rise before this upward revision beat economic expectations for the 2023 fourth quarter. Personal saving grew, too. It was up $6.3 billion to $815.5 billion. The saving rate climbed by one percent to 4.0%. On top of the personal income and savings gains, domestic U.S. corporate profits increased by $5.9 billion, compared with a $9 billion rise in profits for the third quarter of 2023. For 2023 as a whole, the BEA said, real gross output increased 2.1%, private goods-producing industries increased 2 % , private services-producing industries increased 2.1%, and government increased 2.2%. \"Overall, 17 of 22 industry groups contributed to the increase in real gross output,\" it said. As for prices, the BEA said the price index for gross domestic purchases was up 1.9% in the fourth quarter while PCE, the personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.8%. The PCE index excluding food and energy increased 2.0%."

Δ But the latest — and revised — data on gross domestic product released Thursday (March 28) by the Bureau of Economic Analysis details the fourth quarter and gives some hints as to what may come in the months ahead. The headline numbers show that real GDP was 3.4% higher in the fourth quarter, an upward revision of 0.2% from the earlier estimate for the period. The new revision still notches a marked slowdown from the 4.9% growth rate that had been seen in the third quarter. The bureau said in its Thursday release that the upward revision was tied to increases in consumer spending and private investment, as supplemental materials revealed that real final sales in the quarter were 3.3% higher, up 0.4% from the earlier estimates. The price index was 1.9% higher, unchanged from earlier data, and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was also unchanged, with 1.8% growth. Real consumer spending was 0.2% higher than consensus expectations for the quarter, indicating that the U.S. household is resilient — at least when it comes to forking over money at the register. Disposable Income Revised “Disposable personal income increased $190.4 billion, or 3.8%, in the fourth quarter, a downward revision of $12.1 billion from the previous estimate,” the bureau said. “Real disposable personal income increased 2%, a downward revision of 0.2%.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Real disposable income is adjusted for inflation and indicates what consumers have left in the tank, so to speak, to keep spending, to invest or to save. We’re already nearly at the end of the first quarter, and we’ll get fresh data for February on Friday (March 29) about core PCE and personal spending. Each data point, month by month, quarter by quarter, winds up telling a story. The deceleration in the economy bears watching, even if the fourth quarter got a slight bump. At the household/consumer level, real disposable income may be growing, but the pace is lumpy. What Comes Next? The impact may be measured in the present-day intent to spend, especially against the backdrop where, as PYMNTS Intelligence reported late last year, consumer debt is three times “more” than disposable income. Separate data on consumer sentiment noted that the Expectations Index — which The Conference Board said is based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions —fell to 73.8 from the February number of 76.3. “An Expectations Index reading below 80 often signals a forthcoming recession,” the board added. The board also gave assessments of consumers’ spending outlook. In 16 separate categories — spanning from motor vehicles to pet care to travel — only a minority of respondents said they would look to spend over the near term. Many said they would spend the same amount through the next six months. As many as 30% of consumers said they anticipated spending less over the next six months on travel. Nearly 18% said the same for spending on beauty and personal care items and services. A full 26.2% said they would spend less at restaurants.

    "article_text": "The U.S. economy ended last year growing at an even stronger pace than previously thought, data from the government showed Thursday. Gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the economy, grew at a 3.4 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2023. The previous estimate had the economy growing at a 3.2 percent pace. The figures are adjusted for inflation. Consumer spending rose at a 3.3 percent annualized rate, much faster than the 3.0 percent rate estimated a month a ago. Estimates of economic growth get revised as the government collects more data about output, consumption, and investment. The last update, the third since the end of the quarter, reflects an upward revisions to consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment. Business investment in inventories was revised down, partly offsetting the upward pressure on GDP. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, rose at a 1.8 percent pace, matching the previous estimate. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, rose at a 2.0 percent pace, a downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.1 percent. Gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity, rose at a 4.8 percent pace. This is the first estimate of GDI. Some economists average GDP and GDI as a way of approximating economic growth. The average in the fourth quarter was 4.1 percent. GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 2023, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in 2022. The increase was driven by faster growth in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, exports, and federal government spending."

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s attempts to convince consumers that the country’s economy is recovering are on thin ice. The UK officially entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, at the end of last year, due to higher inflation, reduced external demand and record interest rates. The economic slump has prompted swathes of criticism from opposition politicians, notably Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who said that Sunak “has broken his promise to grow the economy and left Britain in recession with working people paying the price,” according to Yahoo Finance. “The Conservatives cannot claim that their plan is working or that they have turned the corner on more than 14 years of economic failure,” she said. Ahead of the general election, the prime minister has been trying to reassure consumers and Tory MPs alike that the economy is recovering, mainly based on private sector activity bouncing back lately. This technical recession is the first one since the first half of 2020, when the UK economy was still reeling under the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Related Member states invest in new euro coins to celebrate special events Michelle Yeoh to join business and political leaders at Global Citizen NOW summit to fight poverty The final estimate for the quarter-on-quarter GDP report for the last quarter of 2023 was released on Thursday, clocking in at -0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was in line with analyst forecasts, although a step down from the last quarter’s -0.1%. Falling exports were one of the key reasons for this dampened number, as well as changes in inventory. Household consumption also fell somewhat by 0.1%, versus -0.9% in the previous quarter. This was largely due to decreased spending on household goods and services, culture and recreation and footwear and clothing. However, fixed investment increased by 0.9%, stabilising after two quarters of reduction, mainly due to investments in transport and buildings. Government consumption also inched up 0.1% for the third quarter in a row, mainly because of increased defence and public administration spending. The year-on-year GDP report for Q4 2023 came in at -0.2%, in line with analyst expectations, but down from the last quarter’s 0.2%. US economy expands more than expected in Q4 2023 Things may appear brighter across the pond. In the US, the final estimate for the quarter-on-quarter GDP for Q4 2023 clocked in at 3.4%, which was more than analyst expectations of 3.2%, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, it was also a sharp reduction from the previous quarter’s 4.9%. This was mainly due to consumer spending increasing by 3.3%, from 3% in the second estimate. Consumer spending on goods inched up less than the previous estimate, at 3%, down from 3.2%. However, consumer spending on services was revised upwards to 3.4% from 2.8% in the previous estimate. Non-residential investment also rose to 3.7% from 2.4%, however, residential investment fell to 2.8% from 2.9% in the second estimate. Coming to the full year 2023, the US economy advanced by 2.5% from 1.9% in the previous year.

    "article_text": "QUOTE OF THE DAY 'No one should have to work longer than they want to. But I do think it's a bit crazy that our anchor idea for the right retirement age â€” 65 years old â€” originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.'Â BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in his annual shareholder letter, which focused mainly on the U.S.'s retirement crisis due to longer life expectancies. His suggestions for a solution included encouraging Americans to work longer before retiring. In The Spotlight What does 'Quiet on the Set' mean for kids' TV? \"Quiet on the Set\" is raising quite a ruckus. The four-part documentary goes behind the scenes of Nickelodeon's popular turn-of-the-millennium shows to depict a \"volatile, dysfunctional and sometimes sexualized environment\" for child actors, said The Washington Post. \"There's a dark underbelly to child stardom,\" said Bryan Hearne, who was an actor on \"All That.\" The documentary focuses on Dan Schneider, the \"golden boy\" creator of many Nickelodeon shows who left under a cloud of scandal in 2018. Interviewees \"recounted tales of alleged racism, sexism, harassment and verbal abuse at his hands,\" USA Today said. Schneider expressed remorse in an interview posted to his YouTube page. \"I definitely owe some people a pretty strong apology,\" he said.Â \"Apologies aren't enough,\" said The Guardian. The actors traumatized by their time on Nickelodeon shows are \"seeking change and accountability in an industry that turned a blind eye to predatory behavior.\" Will the shocking revelations produce change?Â The latest \"More protections are now in place\" since Schneider's ouster, The Wrap said, but industry experts say \"there's still more to be done.\" Background checks are now mandatory, and parents or guardians must be in sight of child actors at all times. However, too many people fear being blackballed by the industry.Â One former star â€” Drake Bell, of \"Drake & Josh\" â€” was sexually abused by a dialogue coach. Nickelodeon said it is committed to \"fostering a safe and professional workplace environment.\" But the response feels \"pretty empty,\" because \"they still show our shows,\" Bell said during a podcast interview. \"And I have to pay for my own therapy.\" The reaction Nickelodeon's \"nebulous\" response to the documentary does \"little to assure audiences that there's been any notable transformation\" in working conditions for child actors, Lorraine Ali said at the Los Angeles Times. The \"weak-sauce defenses\" demonstrate that the \"hushing effect of power and the quiet acceptance of predatory behavior is still an evergreen in Hollywood.\" Â \"The current safeguards for child safety and well-being in the studio environment are clearly insufficient,\" Kelly Lawler said at USA Today. The former child actors in the documentary \"urge more regulation, tougher laws and other safeguards.\" But many say they would never let their own children act. Profits, after all, too often come before safety in Hollywood. \"Will the documentary change anything? It's hard to be optimistic.\" Statistic of the day 10,000: The number of families that will live in Egypt's uncompleted New Administrative Capital, by the end of 2024, according to the head of the city's project, Khaled Abbas. In addition, 48,000 government employees already work in the developing capital, which is expected to enter its second phase of construction later this year.Â CNN the explainer Citizen science says anyone can be a scientist You can be a scientist! Or at least you can play a crucial part in up-and-coming scientific research. Because citizen science is becoming increasingly accepted by researchers as a way to gather data.Â What is citizen science? Citizen science is a \"field of research in which members of the general public participate in scientific projects, often in collaboration with professional scientists,\" Three O'Clock said. Citizen science has become an \"increasingly acknowledged approach applied in many scientific domains\" and particularly within the environmental and ecological sciences,\" said a 2022 study published in the journal Nature Reviews Methods Primers. Researchers often create citizen science groups to aid in monitoring and data collection without requiring extra funding. For example, bird-watchers can be considered citizen scientists as they help track species and add to existing databases.Â Benefits The largest benefit is the power in numbers. \"Data collection isn't just for researchers,\" said Popular Science. Climate and environmental science can particularly benefit from citizen science.Â \"For issues that affect huge swathes of areas like pollution or radiation, which can only be properly measured at scale, that kind of mass data collection can be vital,\" said Wired. \"Publicly available data gathered by citizens removes the chance of any middleman who may be unable, because of underfunding or political crisis, to gather enough data.\" Pieter Franken, the co-founder of the nonprofit Safecast dedicated to citizen science, said to Wired, \"Citizen science doesn't just let people collect data, it empowers them and gives them a voice.\" Drawbacks Critics of citizen science argue that \"untrained citizens could collect shoddy or even biased data that won't have scientific rigor or reliability,\" Wired said. \"Designing and implementing citizen science projects require a unique set of skills and knowledge outside the research itself,\" the Nature Reviews Methods Primers study said. Without proper oversight and organization, the data collected may not be reliable. Citizen science could also highlight societal inequality. \"Citizen science may engage only certain parts of society, which may potentially fail to include historically underrepresented groups,\" said the study. \"This raises concerns about the relevance of citizen science to diverse communities.\" Poll watch Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans are willing to pay for surge pricing â€” paying more for goods during peak times of demand â€” according to a new Ipsos poll. The poll surveyed 1,120 adults and found that 35% were willing to pay surge pricing for food, while 33% were willing to pay surge pricing for concert tickets and transportation services.Â Good day Â âš–ï¸ â€¦ forÂ WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He dodged the threat of immediate extradition to the U.S., where he faces espionage charges after London's High Court delayed a ruling on his lawyer's request to grant another appeal. The court gave the U.S. government three weeks to send assurances that Assange would have a fair trial and not get the death penalty if convicted. Bad day Â ? â€¦ for Â GameStop employees. The video game retailer said it cut an unspecified number of jobs to reduce costs after a dip in fourth-quarter revenue \"amid rising competition from e-commerce firms and weak consumer spending in an uncertain economy,\" said Reuters. The company's fourth-quarter revenue of $1.79 billion was lower than the $2.23 billion made last year as it \"grappled with stiff competition\" from Amazon and eBay. WORD OF THE DAY psychodrama A therapeutic technique where clients use dramatization and role play to explore issues in their lives. A scathing report from The New Yorker on the state of U.K. politics after 14 years of Conservative Party rule used the term to describe how leaders have been \"climbing and chucking one another off the ladder of British public life\" over the past decade and a half. INSTANT OPINION Today's best commentary 'Biden's EV mandate is an affront to car lovers' Charles C.W. Cooke at National Review There are many reasons to be outraged over the Biden administration's \"ongoing attempt to coerce us into electric vehicles over the next decade,\" says Charles C.W. Cooke. \"I object to the federal government presuming that its role in our lives includes telling us what we may drive.\" Also, \"I like cars.\" I want a gas-powered car, not a \"glorified golf cart,\" and \"you'll take my ability to buy them at will from my cold oil-stained hands.\" 'RFK Jr.'s running mate is young and very rich. That worries Dems.' Greg Sargent at The New Republic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s running mate choice might seem strange, says Greg Sargent. Nicole Shanahan, 38, is a Silicon Valley lawyer with \"no political experience.\" But the former wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin has money he needs, \"shelling out $4 million to fund that 1960s nostalgia-themed\" Super Bowl ad about the Kennedy family, the Democratic dynasty. Democrats fear Shanahan's money could get Kennedy on enough swing-state ballots to \"return Trump to the White House.\" 'Why Netanyahu is deliberately alienating his strongest allies' Fred Kaplan at Slate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Washington's decision not to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a Gaza cease-fire and the release of Hamas hostages by dissing President Joe Biden as \"few U.S. allies had ever done before,\" says Fred Kaplan. He canceled a Washington trip for advisers to discuss \"less destructive\" ways to \"eradicate\" Hamas, pushing U.S.-Israel relations to an \"all-time low\" to please \"far-right\" domestic allies he needs for \"political survival.\" Picture of the day Monkeys in the middle Monkey-masked activists from animal rights group PETA protest outside the Thai embassy in Tokyo against the Thai government allegedly forcing endangered pig-tailed macaques to be used to pick coconuts.Â Philip Fong / AFP via Getty Images The Week recommends Concert tours to see this spring As 2024 enters its second quarter, many top artists are heading out on show-stopping tours. Here are some of the most highly anticipated concerts you can attend this coming spring. Olivia Rodrigo Pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo is building off the continued hype from her 2023 LP, \"Guts,\" and embarking on a world tour. It's the second tour for Rodrigo, who at only 21 already has a slew of Grammy nominations and several wins under her belt. Rodrigo will perform in seven North American cities through the end of April before heading overseas to Europe.Â The Rolling Stones The Rolling Stones, considered one of the greatest rock bands in history, will embark on their \"Hackney Diamonds\" tour this April, playing in 16 North American cities through the end of July. Fans of the Stones should expect to \"experience Mick, Keith and Ronnie play their most popular hits,\" the concert tour's page said, as well as hear \"fan-favorite deep cuts and music from their new album.\" \"Hackney Diamonds\" is the band's first original material in 18 years. MadonnaÂ Fans of Madonna can celebrate the singer on her aptly named \"Celebration\" tour, which will run through the end of April. This outing is not in promotion of a new album; it's described as a \"retrospective tour\" highlighting Madonna's decades-long career. It began in the United Kingdom and made its way through Europe in 2023. It's currently running in the United States and slated to end with a series of five concerts in Mexico City.

    "article_text": "The flow of migrants at the border rose by 15 percent in February after President Joe Biden outsourced U.S. border security to Mexico’s pro-migration president. Biden’s border agents registered 142,000 illegal migrants in February, up from 125,000 in January. That border inflow was in addition to the invited inflow of 114,000 economic migrants through several quasi-legal doorways announced by Biden’s deputies. That 15 percent jump in illegals is not what Biden’s deputies wanted when they asked Mexico in December to slash the northward flow of illegals during the 2024 election year. Officer Catches, Arrests Colorado Driver for Human Smuggling Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety They asked “for us to try and contain the flow of migration,” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, told the 60 Minutes TV show in a March 24 broadcast . But “the flow of migrants will continue” if Biden does not cooperate with Mexico’s ambitions, Obrador told 60 Minutes . “AMLO knows he has Biden over a barrel,” said a tweet from Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. AMLO has Biden over a barrel because Biden fears he will lose left-wing voters — and wealthy donors — if he tries to enforce Americans’ border laws, but will lose even more centrist votes if Obarador allows more migrants over the border. The tempting fix for Biden is to let Obrador’s police guard the U.S. border by arresting and clubbing migrants as they head north through Mexico. In December, Biden’s border deputies agreed to Obrador’s deal — and Mexico began arresting more migrants in January. During December, Obrador let a record-breaking flood of 251,000 illegal migrants cross the U.S. border far from the official border gates. Once the December deal was signed, Obrador suddenly slashed the illegal January inflow by 50 percent. “We were more careful about our southern border,” Obrador told 60 Minutes , adding: We spoke with the presidents of Central America, with the president of Venezuela, and with the president of Cuba. We asked them for help in curbing the flow of migrants. However, that is a short-term solution, not a long term. The sudden Mexican policy shift reveals what has been obvious for decades: The flow of illegal migrants across the U.S. border is protected and concealed by both the U.S. and the Mexican governments. The hidden government approval means the illegal inflow is better described as a government-run, cartel-taxed, off-the-books, unofficial economic and migration policy that works alongside the legal immigration system. The resulting huge inflow of illegal migrant workers, consumers, and renters is mostly used as an economic stimulant for Wall Street’s consumer-economy investments, regardless of the massive harm inflicted on ordinary Americans. Many Wall Street leaders — and many politicians — asked for the consumer-economy inflow in 1990 just as they were outsourcing much of the Midwest’s manufacturing and consumer economies to Asia and Mexico. Everybody Scatter! Illegals Bail as Officers Catch Human Smuggler Who Admits to Trafficking Operation Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety Since 2021, Biden has invited at least 7 million more migrants to pass through the official border gates, often under the claim of having created new “legal pathways.” That quasi-legal inflow of migrants dropped slightly in February, down to 114,000. But Mexico gets a lot from the unofficial migration system. For example, it has moved perhaps 15 million Mexicans into the United States, giving it a growing — but limited — political influence, plus a huge flood of valuable remittances. Biden has made the deal sweeter for Mexico as he relies on Mexico to help bring more global migrants across the southern border. For example, Biden and his deputies rarely comment on Mexico’s massive exports of fentanyl drugs into the United States, despite the huge death toll of roughly 70,000 young Americans each year. “Mexico First — our home comes first,” Obrador said at his March 22 news briefing: We are not going to act as policemen for any foreign government … Of course, we are going to cooperate in fighting drugs, above all because it has become a very sensitive, very sad humanitarian issue, because a lot of young people are dying in the United States because of fentanyl. “The drug cartels provide jobs in regions where the Mexican government can’t provide economic development, they encourage social mobility, and generate revenue through drug sales to balance trade and investment deficits.”David Saucedo, a security analyst, told the Associated Press. Similarly, U.S. government data shows that since April 2023, Biden’s deputies have given migration papers to roughly 15,000 Mexicans a month . But those concessions are not enough for Obrador. He is a Latino nationalist, he favors more Latino migration into the United States, and he wants to create a coalition of Latino states against the United States. Deliberately or not, Obrador let the January inflow rise by 15 percent during February, so reminding Biden that he has the power to damage vulnerable Biden during the 2024 election season. Biden’s staff was silent about the greater inflow — but House Speaker Mike Johnson blasted both Obrador and Biden: “The Marxist President of Mexico blackmails America,” said a tweet from Steve Cortes , a former spokesman for Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. He added: AMLO wants Americans to give $20 billion a year to Latin America PLUS give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens from Mexico who are living in America. Zero respect for the US! When asked by 60 Minutes, if Mexico will continue to curb the migration, AMLO replied, “We do and we want to continue doing it.” 60 Minutes described his price: Obrador proposed his fix: that the United States commit $20 billion a year to four countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, lift, sanctions on Venezuela and the Cuban embargo, and legalize [amnesty] millions of law-abiding Mexicans living in the US. “I’m speaking frankly,” Obrador told 60 Minutes . “We have to say things as they are, and I always say what I feel. I always say what I think.” Editor’s note : This article has been updated."

    "article_text": "Hot Stocks: The 3 Best Opportunities for Investing in REITs InvestorPlace Mar. 24, 2024, 02:59 PM InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Not too long ago, I came across an article about commercial property opportunities and my mind immediately went to REIT stocks or securities tied to real estate investment trusts. It wasn’t so much about the story but the public comments that made the content memorable. Apparently, experts in the field believe that there’s a massive bargain offered right now in commercial real estate. That makes sense because of the residual impact of the Covid-19 crisis. However, internet commenters balked at the price necessary to participate in the deals, which numbered well into the millions. That’s not exactly an amount the average retail investor throws around casually. So yes, there might be viable prospects in commercial real estate but you might not be able to access them. But don’t fret – that’s where these REIT stocks may save the day. EPR Properties (EPR) Source: Shutterstock Based in Kansas City, Missouri, EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR ) represents the leading diversified experiential net lease REIT. Per its public profile , the company specializes in select enduring experiential properties in the commercial property industry. It focuses on venues that create value by facilitating out-of-home leisure and recreation experiences. Since the start of the year, EPR stock incurred a loss of 14%. Granted, that’s not the start that management was looking for. Fundamentally, there are some extenuating circumstances. With the consumer economy suffering multiple headwinds of high inflation, high borrowing costs and tech-sector layoffs, many folks have decided to trim their spending. At the same time, consumers may also be prioritizing experiences and that bodes well for EPR stock. To be fair, for 2024, analysts are forecasting a down year, projecting earnings per share of $2.62 on sales of $617.76 million. Last year, the company posted EPS of $1.97 on sales of $705.67 million. However, the high-side revenue estimate calls for $717 million, which may be more realistic based on travel-related consumer sentiment. Thus, it’s one of the REIT stocks to consider. Welltower (WELL) Source: Shutterstock Headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, Welltower (NYSE: WELL ) in many ways sells itself. According to its corporate profile , the REIT invests with leading senior housing operators, post-acute providers, and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Since the start of the year, WELL gained over 3% of its market value. Fundamentally, senior care service providers are attractive because of demographic realities. Millions of baby boomers will be retiring and many will require care. Yes, it’s true that last fiscal year, Welltower’s earnings performances were shaky. Overall, the average surprise came out to 12.33% below parity. There were some good quarters and some really bad ones. However, for 2024, experts project that EPS will land at $1.27 on sales of $7.46 billion. That’s very favorable to 2023’s print of profits of 66 cents per share on sales of $6.64 billion. Also, the REIT pays a forward dividend yield of 2.62%. Covering experts peg shares a moderate buy with a $99.21 average price target. Realty Income (O) Source: Shutterstock Probably the most famous of REIT stocks, Realty Income (NYSE: O ) is arguably best known for providing a monthly dividend. It’s also a sizable one at a forward yield of 5.88%. Yes, the payout ratio is elevated but here’s the thing about REIT stocks. Generally, these entities run a higher ratio than non-REITs based on their distinct business structure. Fundamentally, what’s really appealing about Realty is the core underlying industry. The company benefits from cash flows from over 15,450 real estate properties. This massive footprint encompasses businesses of all stripes, particularly brands that you shop at every day. Unless you envision a world where people no longer need home-improvement products, for instance, Realty should be a solid idea. Okay, Realty may have incurred a mixed performance in fiscal 2023. However, analysts are looking for a rebound in 2024, projecting EPS of $1.41 on sales of $4.87 billion. That’s much better than last year’s EPS of $1.26 on sales of $4.08 billion. Finally, O stock carries a moderate buy view with a $60.38 price target. It’s easily one of the REIT stocks to buy.

    "article_text": "A government report in Canada forecasted a deep civic breakdown in the once-stable society that now suffers from unprecedented levels of elite-imposed migration. The secret and heavily redacted report was prepared by the country’s version of the FBI — the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The partial copy was extracted from the agency by an academic lawyer and was published in Canada’s National Post newspaper. The report is titled “Whole-of-Government Five-Year Trends for Canada,” and features many progressive-approved concerns about claimed global warming in cold-weather Canada. But the visible sections of the text spotlight several obvious costs of migration — expensive housing, wider wealth gaps, and reduced civic trust caused by the government’s policy of forced diversity: Popular Resentment The coming period of recession will also accelerate the decline in living standards that the younger generations have already witnessed compared to earlier generations. For example, many Canadians under 35 are unlikely ever to be able to buy a place to live. The fallout from this decline in living standards will be exacerbated by the fact that the difference between the extremes of wealth is greater now in developed countries than it has been in any time in several generations. Erosion of Trust The past seven years have seen more social and political polarization in the Western World … Paranoid Populism Capitalizing on the rise of political polarization and conspiracy theories have been populists willing to tailor their messages to appeal to extremist movements. Authoritarian movements have been on the rise in many liberal-democratic nations … “The situation will probably deteriorate further in the next five years,” the report begins. The report repeatedly suggests that Donald Trump’s pro-citizen populism is a danger to Canada’s elite and that Canada’s police forces be beefed up. But it does not mention the likely cause of Canada’s crash — the elite-imposed and revolutionary policy of mass migration, which is rapidly creating civic conflict while also reducing average income, productivity , and birth rates. The vast migration is pushed by Canada’s unpopular prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the request of business groups. His progressive government is importing roughly 1 million people per year — or roughly three migrants for every Canadian birth. That massive inflow is roughly twice the per-person inflow engineered by President Joe Biden and his pro-migration deputies. The policy is boosting the country’s stock market as it suppressing wages , spiking inflation, making homes unaffordable , deterring marriages and births , creating homeless encampments , and spiking civil strife among Canadians who are losing their livelihood, dreams, political clout, and national culture. For example, Canada’s productivity has been declining because Trudeau’s migration allows investors to profit from the consumer economy created by the inflow of poor and uneducated foreign workers , consumers, and renters. However, this growth-by-poverty strategy reduces pressure on investors to focus on the growth-by-productivity strategy that raises wages and wealth through greater use of technology, training, innovation, and trade. The inflow is also importing old ethnic conflicts into what was once a stable, prosperous, and high-trust nation. The resulting chaos helps politicians divorce themselves from the needs of ordinary Canadians, and it divides public opposition amid the government’s policy of high migration and low productivity. The policy is so destructive that top economists are spotlighting the damage to Canada’s productivity and technology . “Lower productivity almost always means lower living standards,” Trevor Tombe, a Canadian economist wrote in 2023: According to the latest data from Statistics Canada, which was released last week, Canada’s labour productivity—that is, how much stuff each hour of work produces on average— fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. As a result, Canadian productivity is now about 2 percent lower at the beginning of 2023 than it was one year earlier. Worse, this has reversed several years of gains. We’re now back to mid-2017 levels. This matters. Had productivity growth in Canada kept pace with the United States over the past five years, I estimate we’d be producing over 8 percent more per hour worked than we do now. That’s enormous. Roughly speaking, it’s equivalent to $5,500 per person in lost economic output. Given how closely wages are tied to productivity, this directly affects our living standards and, in my view, poses a bigger affordability challenge than recent high inflation. … Most Canadian provinces lag far behind almost all U.S. states. Ontario, for example, has a per-person level of economic output that is similar to Alabama (both equivalent to $55,000 USD worth of final goods and services produced annually per person). The Maritimes are below Mississippi, and Quebec and Manitoba lag behind West Virginia. Only Alberta exceeds the U.S. average of $76,000, but even Canada’s strongest economy ranks 14th overall. It’s roughly comparable to New Jersey and Texas, but 13 percent below California and nearly one-quarter below New York. On March 21, Trudeau’s government announced it would trim his catastrophic immigration policy. “We need to ensure the number of temporary residents entering the country is at a sustainable level,” immigration minister Marc Miller told reporters. The government wants to trim the number of so-called “temporary residents” from 6.5 percent down to 5 percent of the population by 2026, according to a Reuters report . “This will help strengthen the alignment between immigration planning, community capacity, and labor market needs and support predictable population growth,” he claimed. Currently, Trudeau’s poll ratings are in the toilet, having fallen from 28 percent in January 2022 to just 21 percent in March 2024. The rival “Progressive Conservative Party of Canada” now stands at 36 percent — even though it also supports more migration — while the pro-Canadian People’s Party of Canada is stuck at 3 percent."

    "article_text": "20 March, 2024 Share this: facebook twitter email print Lesotho, Maseru, 20 March 2024 - The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Sub Regional Office for Southern Africa (ECA SRO SA) provided technical support to the Government of Lesotho to develop the country’s successor national industrial policy through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development (MTIBD). The policy document aims to harness an export driven economic growth trajectory through industrialization, and was validated through a one-day workshop jointly organized by MTIBD and ECA SRO SA. The objective of the workshop was to review and identify gaps in the policy document, obtain feedback from participants and further, provide a platform for stakeholders who were unable to participate in the questionnaire-based data collection process to provide inputs into the draft policy document to enhance collective ownership of the Lesotho National Industrial Policy. In his opening remarks, Mr Thabo Moleko, Principal Secretary of MTIBD said that one of the key priority areas of the Successor Lesotho National Industrial Policy was enhancing inclusive Sustainable economic growth and private sector led job creation. He stated that the National Industrial Policy will among other things take into consideration the changes in the continental operating environment, including the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and ensure alignment with regional frameworks like the Southern Africa Development Community Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap (2015 – 2063), as a regional industrial development blueprint which aims to promote industrialization and deepen economic growth through structural transformation. He applauded ECA’s technical support to review the 2015-2017 Industrial Policy as a way of enhancing the efforts of government in improving the business and investment environment of the country and noted that, “I believe that together we can make Lesotho a responsive and attractive destination for domestic, regional and international investment in order to promote industrialization, enhance competitiveness leading to increased quality manufactured goods and exports”. ECA Sub regional Office for Southern Africa was represented by Ms. Olayinka Bandele, Chief, Inclusive Industrialization Section who reiterated the support of the United Nations to the Industrialization development agenda in the Kingdom of Lesotho in support of Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. She underscored three critical steps that the country must take: • Firstly, a shift from a consumer-based economy to a producer and export-driven economy as the consumer-based economy makes the Lesotho economy vulnerable to price volatilities and external shocks. •Secondly, the role of technological advancements and innovation in industrial development, as this will spur productivity gains and global competitiveness. •Lastly but not the least, the critical role of the private sector with Micro Small and Medium Enterprises at the center of the economy. The official speeches were followed by the presentation of the draft 2024-2028 National Industrial Policy by ECA SRO-SA consultant Dr. Mamello Nchake who guided group discussions on industrial policy priority areas, implementation arrangements, resource mobilization and monitoring and evaluation. She highlighted that one of the Strategic Policy Objectives was to accelerate economic diversification in industrial base as well as enhance energy efficiency and sustainability. The afternoon was dedicated to group discussions on the above thematic areas. The workshop was attended by participants from government ministries, the private sector, development partners, academic and research organizations, and local media houses. The session was closed by Ms. Mart Motebang, Director of Trade on behalf of the Ministry of Trade. She spoke to the government’s commitment to accelerate the implementation process once the industrial policy has been launched. She called on participating stakeholders to play an active role, “ each one of us has a role to play, please go back and interrogate the industrial policy so that key contributions are given to change the narrative so that the successor national industrial policy strengthens Lesotho’s capacity to coordinate industrial policy implementation, mobilize resources for implementation and monitoring progress to deliver on the country’s industrialization milestones.” The meeting ended with a stated ambition to deliver a finalized document as soon as possible in readiness for consideration by the government of Lesotho and thereafter implementation Issued by: Communications Section Economic Commission for Africa PO Box 3001 Addis Ababa Ethiopia Tel: +251 11 551 5826 E-mail: eca-info@un.org"

    "article_text": "Investor Ben Ashkenazy has a history of sparking debate. Now, he’ll be on stage for an exclusive discussion with Mickey Drexler , a retail pioneer who brought Gap around the country and current chairman of fashion start-up Alex Mill, at The Real Deal NYC Real Estate Forum . Five years ago, people said retail was dead. Today, investors have spent billions buying retail properties, renovating and improving existing places, and building spectacular new projects on Fifth Avenue and beyond. Vornado’s Steve Roth even told investors that “the retail apocalypse is passing ” in their last earnings call, and said that he is “convinced that rents are going to rise.” SIGN UP But not everyone survived the storm. And as retail revitalizes, it will look dramatically different than it has in the past. At The Real Deal Real Estate Forum, TRD is bringing together major investor Ashkenazy alongside retailer genius Drexler – who shepherded Apple through the opening of its first retail branches – to give industry insiders unprecedented insights into the future of this market as it rises from the ashes. This conversation will be a rare opportunity to hear firsthand from press-shy Ashkenazy, owner of some of the most iconic retail from coast to coast, as he shares his thoughts about luxury and major retail’s comeback in NYC. Drexler meanwhile was a driving force behind both Gap’s and J. Crew’s meteoric rises in the 1990s and aughts, as well as the brain behind Apple’s retail store concept. He will offer his perspective on what defines a successful retail brand, and what the best days of NYC retail can teach us about new opportunities ahead. Sign up today for The Real Deal NYC Real Estate Forum on May 8 at the Metropolitan Pavilion to get access to this discussion and all panel sessions, along with the Expo Floor and networking with 3,000 NYC professionals."

    "article_text": "Leadership Careers How Immigrants Are Boosting U.S. Economic And Job Growth By Jack Kelly , Former Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Jack Kelly covers career growth, job market and workplace trends. Mar 20, 2024, 03:30pm EDT Share Save Comment Immigration is fueling business and job creation in the U.S. According to MIT research, immigrants are 80% more likely to start a business than native-born U.S. citizens. getty Americans are becoming increasingly more concerned about border enforcement in the United States, with nearly half considering it a “ crisis ,” according to a poll by CBS News. Thirty percent of Americans view the border situation as “very serious.” However, according to economic research, immigration has been a net positive to the U.S. economy, driving job growth and increasing consumer spending. What Economists Are Saying In 2023, “foreign-born” workers comprised nearly 19% of the U.S. labor force, according to analysis by nonpartisan think tank Economic Policy Institute of Current Population Survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is an uptick from 15.3% in 2006 . “The unexpectedly high level of immigration also explains some of the surprising strength in consumer spending and overall economic growth since 2022,” wrote economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson for the Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative within the Brookings Institution. “Moreover, we expect immigration flows to further boost economic growth in 2024.” Immigrants have contributed largely to consumer spending growth by about 0.2 percentage point last year, with a similar boost expected this year, along with an increase in gross domestic product—a measure of all the goods and services produced—by 0.1 percentage point per year since 2022, Edelberg and Watson reported. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The U.S. needs more workers to keep the economy humming. In the absence of foreign-born labor, the U.S. talent pool will continue to decline because of lower birth rates with an accompanying aging workforce of Baby Boomers looking to retire. From 2024 through 2027, 4.1 million Americans will reach the age of 65 each year, estimates the Income Institute at the Alliance for Lifetime Income. The current trends will make it hard to finance social programs such as Social Security. Federal Reserve Bank chair Jerome Powell said to the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month about the flow of immigration’s impact on the U.S. economy , “It's just arithmetic. If you add a couple million people to an economy, a percentage of them work, there will be more output.\" Powell added, “I'm not going to say anything is needed for the future or good policy indirectly or directly. I think it's just reporting the facts to say that immigration and labor force participation both contributed to the very strong economic output growth that we had last year.” Immigration is fueling business and job creation in the U.S. According to MIT research, immigrants are 80% more likely to start a business than native-born U.S. citizens. They are also responsible for 42% more job creation than native-born founders. A 2022 study by the National Foundation for American Policy revealed that 55% of U.S. billion-dollar startups , also referred to as “unicorn” companies, were founded by immigrants. The Challenges Faced Foreign-born workers in the U.S. are not immune to labor challenges. Rebecca Dixon, president and CEO of the National Employment Law Project, said about mass immigration in a press release , “One of the most crucial forces driving the nation’s job growth and economic vitality over the last year has been immigration.” She added that immigrant workers are at the “center of a growing crisis of workplace abuse, with undocumented and temporary visa migrant workers among the most vulnerable to abuses, including wage theft, health and safety risks, child labor violations and retaliation from employers.” Proponents of stronger border enforcement say immigration causes issues of overcrowding, congestion and extra pressure on public services, as well as downward pressure on wages for working-class families that are already having a tough time in a high-cost and inflationary environment.

    "article_text": "ETMarkets.com \"In the largecap space, these three – PSUs, large private sector banks and automobile companies – can do well.\" Nilesh Shah , MD & CEO, Envision Capital , says “manufacturing is becoming meaningful and the low hanging fruit is indigenisation or localisation. So, businesses where we were earlier importing and are now trying to manufacture locally or after meeting domestic demand, are well positioned to export, are very great opportunities. If you are fine with valuations, the EMS space is interesting. Railways, defence are interesting spaces where the spending is going to remain unabated. We also have the traditional auto component companies and the industrial consumables, which are catering to several end-user segments. I also believe the whole area of specialty steel looks very interesting from a medium to long term perspective.” A large part of your portfolio is tilted towards consumption and these are themes that we have talked about many often as well. Still convinced about that theme, still invested in those names? Nilesh Shah: Absolutely. Within consumption, the whole premiumisation opportunity continues to play out really well and we own a couple of companies in the alcoholic beverages space where these individual companies are riding on premiumisation and the increasing penetration and the increasing acceptance or social acceptance of these products so that is a space we continue to be very constructive about. Hospitality is where the average Indian consumer wants to essentially allocate a good amount of time and their consumption wallets towards the leisure side. So, hospitality continues to be a very exciting opportunity that we are positive about. The third area is, of course, luxury items and the luxury space. So, a whole bunch of consumer businesses driven by both premiumisation and the shift towards luxury products is good and we are playing a basket kind of opportunity here in that entire space. What is the best way to look at manufacturing because now everything is getting connected with manufacturing, whether it is EV or TV. Everybody is now buying stocks in the manufacturing space. Nilesh Shah: Yes. It is a very broad term and the reality is that so far, all of us were just looking at two broad opportunities in India. One is essentially the consumer economy and the other is the digital economy. These were the two big economies. In recent times, the physical economy driven by manufacturing, driven by infrastructure, driven by this whole energy transition, decarbonisation, electrification, all put together are becoming an extremely interesting and meaningful part of the overall investment canvas. Live Events You Might Also Like: Bulk of correction in small, midcaps over; days of IT largecaps are numbered: Nilesh Shah, Envision Capital So, yes, I totally agree that manufacturing is becoming meaningful and I believe that the low hanging fruit is indigenisation, localisation. So, businesses where we were earlier importing and we are now trying to manufacture locally or after meeting the domestic demand, are well positioned to exports, are very great opportunities. It still continues to be a combination. If you are fine with valuations, the EMS space is interesting. Railways, defence is an extremely interesting space where the spending is going to remain unabated. We also have the traditional auto component companies and the industrial consumables, which are catering to several end-user segments. Yes, it is a nice mix of different kinds of opportunities which currently are there and I continue to believe that this is going to be India's decade for manufacturing and to that extent, it is a very relevant and meaningful opportunity for long-term investors. What to your mind could be two or three stocks from the largecap space which you would say have scope to outperform the market in a meaningful manner and where there is a possibility of becoming decent wealth creators in next two-three years? Nilesh Shah: I still think the best is to probably look at the PSU side of it. We do not yet own it meaningfully. I believe that PSUs are in for some kind of a more long-term re-rating. They have kind of re-rated meaningfully, but obviously the stock prices have rallied quite significantly. A correction has set in. It is quite possible that over the course of next, maybe a couple of months or so, if there is further correction, even in the largecap space, the PSUs do offer a great opportunity. Post election, if a fresh bout of reforms come in specifically directed at driving more efficiency among the PSUs, I clearly believe that is going to be a great opportunity. The second is private banks. I think private banks have underperformed over the last two or three years or so. I believe private banks again are poised for good growth. The third is the entire auto pack. The automobile pack is essentially still well poised. They seem to be headed for some strong growth over the medium to long term. You Might Also Like: Renu Baid Pugalia’s top 3 capital goods picks keeping valuation in mind I would think that in the largecap space, these three – PSUs, large private sector banks and automobile companies – can do well. We own some of them here as well. Other than that, there is Reliance which continues to be a good place to be inIt is in the right verticals across energy, retail, digital and that continues to be a very interesting play going forward. We own it as well. When you say autos, that is also as large a pool as manufacturing. What do you like within autos? Nilesh Shah: I clearly believe the passenger vehicle segment looks to be very good across both the passenger car as well as the two-wheeler segment. Both are very interesting pockets. The CV space and the tractor space for now is likely to take a breather. But clearly, the passenger vehicle segment including both cars and two wheelers is an interesting place to be in. Maybe along with the market, you could be more opportunistic and let there be some kind of correction there. But once you see a 5% to 10% correction, this is a good place to be in. And anything within the entire metals basket? Nilesh Shah: We own a metals company called Kalyani Steel where we have invested very recently. It is, of course, a traditional steel company, but has now announced some major plans for investments in specialty steel and titanium so that it can start catering to automotive, aerospace and defence businesses. I believe the whole area of specialty steel looks very interesting from a medium to long term perspective. If we believe that we are going to see a lot of investments in the manufacturing space driven by localisation and indigenisation, all those kinds of businesses will require high quality material suppliers. And within that, clearly, speciality steel looks to be an extremely interesting space. So, we just have one play out there, which we believe is interesting.

US consumer spending warmed slightly in February, according to government data released Thursday, with retail sales regaining ground after an earlier hit from cold weather. Retail sales bounced 0.6 percent last month to $700.7 billion, after January's decline was revised to a wider 1.1 percent, said the Commerce Department. The January drop was the biggest in almost a year, causing some concern. A significant spending slowdown could pour cold water on hopes that consumption continues being a key economic driver. From a year ago, retail sales were up 1.5 percent, said the Commerce Department. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers helped to support the uptick, rising 1.6 percent between January and February. Excluding autos, retail sales rose by a smaller magnitude at 0.3 percent.

He added that sales of building materials and autos drove the February rebound after weather disruptions in January. \"We expect consumer spending momentum to cool moderately this year as cost fatigue and softer labor market conditions constrain households' spending power,\" Daco said. Analysts expect consumer spending growth to have slowed in early 2024, with the rate to be lukewarm in the coming quarters as well. \"Only the wealthiest households still have excess pandemic savings, while the cost of credit has jumped and leading indicators point to a rise in layoffs this spring,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added that the latest data and downward revision to January's figures suggest \"consumers are starting to tire.\" But Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics, expects further job gains and \"solid wage gains\" to support disposable income growth and in turn, consumer spending this year.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Thu, Mar 14, 2024 · 09:01 PM US RETAIL sales rebounded in February, driven by increases at auto dealerships and petrol service stations, but consumer spending is slowing as households grapple with inflation and higher borrowing costs. Retail sales rose 0.6 per cent last month, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said on Thursday (Mar 14). Data for January was revised lower to show sales tumbling 1.1 per cent, instead of 0.8 per cent as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, rising 0.8 per cent in February. Sales were held down in January in part by frigid temperatures and difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. With those factors largely out of the way, sales are reverting to a more normal pattern. Retail sales excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services were unchanged in February. This so-called core retail sales measure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product (GDP). Core sales for January were revised to show them decreasing 0.3 per cent, instead of 0.4 per cent as previously reported. Consumer spending is cooling in the first quarter, after helping to fuel economic growth in the October-to-December quarter. Spending, however, remains supported by a fairly tight labour market. Economists see no imminent recession. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP increasing at a 2.5 per cent annualised rate in Q1. The economy grew at a 3.2 per cent pace in Q4. Consumer spending is holding up despite higher inflation, though households are increasingly focusing on essentials and cutting back on discretionary spending. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 525 basis points to the current 5.25 to 5.5 per cent range since March 2022. The US central bank is expected to start cutting rates by June. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Mar 9. Economists had forecast 218,000 claims in the latest week.

    "article_text": "iStock Wall Street's main indexes slipped on Thursday after hotter-than-expected producer prices data likely muddied bets around the timing of the Federal Reserve's first rate cut and high-flying chip stocks extended their losses. Most megacap growth and technology stocks inched higher, but artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia fell 3.6%. Chipmakers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices fell more than 1% each, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index shed 1.6%. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell, with rate-sensitive real estate leading losses, down by 2%. The Russell 2000, tracking small-cap stocks, fell 1.8%, underperforming its Wall Street peers. Live Events A Labor Department report showed the Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.6% month-on-month in February, compared with a 0.3% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters, amid a surge in the cost of goods like gasoline and food. It rose 1.6% in the 12 months to February, versus an estimated growth of 1.1%. U.S. retail sales rebounded in February, rising 0.6% last month, but below expectations of a 0.8% advance. \"In a way, today was the past month in microcosm - sticky inflation, combined with signs of softness elsewhere in the economy,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. \"Retail sales may have come in below estimates, but the PPI was even more of an upside surprise than Tuesday's CPI.\" Traders now see a 62% chance of the Fed cutting rates in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool, down from 67% before the data. Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing for unemployment claims stood at 209,000 for the week ended March 9, compared to an estimated 218,000 claims, according to another Labor Department report. The raft of economic data comes ahead of the Fed's policy meeting next week, where the focus will be on possible cues about how soon the central bank could kick off the rate-easing cycle. At 11:31 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 111.46 points, or 0.29%, at 38,931.86, the S&P 500 was down 18.19 points, or 0.35%, at 5,147.12 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 36.65 points, or 0.23%, at 16,141.12. Tesla slid 3.7% after UBS cut the EV maker's price target and lowered its first-quarter delivery forecast. Shares of Robinhood Markets advanced 6.5% after the trading app operator said its assets under custody rose 16% in February.

    "article_text": "Deliveroo trims annual losses as the cost of ordering a takeaway rises 14 Mar 2024, 08:34 | Updated: 14 Mar 2024 Deliveroo reports annual results. Picture: PA The group posted a £31.8 million loss for the year, significantly smaller than the £294.1 million loss reported for 2022. Takeaway giant Deliveroo has revealed it trimmed its losses over 2023, as it said people paid more money for fewer orders amid a “fragile” consumer spending environment. The group posted a £31.8 million loss for the year, significantly smaller than the £294.1 million loss reported for 2022. This was helped by reducing business costs, including on marketing and making its delivery network more efficient, and as the cost of ordering a takeaway went up. Staff costs rose by 3% compared with 2022, despite the firm axing 9% of its staff, around 350 roles, in the middle of the year as part of a redundancy programme. But wage inflation pushed up the salaries of remaining employees, the group said. Meanwhile, Deliveroo revealed that the number of orders decreased by 3% year-on-year to 290 million, which it said reflects the cost-of-living crisis putting pressure on consumer spending, particularly during the first half of the year. But the annual gross transaction value (GTV), which means the total cost of people’s food baskets plus delivery and consumer fees, rose by 3% to £7.1 billion. And the average cost per takeaway order increased by 6% from £22.90 to £24.30, which was due to price inflation and optimising consumer fees last year. The business reported a slightly stronger performance in the UK and Ireland where the number of orders edged up by 1%, and GTV jumped by 8% year-on-year. Will Shu, founder and chief executive of Deliveroo (Parsons Media/Deliveroo/PA) “Overall, while we see some signs of stabilisation in customer behaviour, we continue to face a fragile consumer spending environment,” the company said. Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: “2023 was a good year for Deliveroo and I am proud of what we have delivered financially, operationally and for our consumers. “Our focus on service and value for money continues to build consumer trust, which are fundamental to unlocking future growth in this industry.” The takeaway giant, which operates in 10 countries and works with around 135,000 riders across the world, has faced court battles over the employment status and rights of its riders. In the UK, the Supreme Court ruled last year that riders are not employees of Deliveroo, and therefore are not workers entitled to trade union rights such as collective bargaining.

EV hype may be over The euphoria around electric vehicles is waning . Ford Motor, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz are some of the major automakers that are scaling back or delaying their EV plans.

The bottom line American consumers started the year on shaky footing but a bounce back could be in sight. February's retail sales data will be in focus today and should bring insight into the state of the U.S. economy. Economists expect consumer spending to rebound strongly after January's sharp retreat. \"Even as we anticipate a moderation in spending this year, we believe the January slowdown somewhat overstates the near-term pullback in consumption. Households are still benefiting from a real income tailwind that should remain supportive of spending in the near term,\" Wells Fargo wrote in a note. \"We expect to see a rebound in February spending and forecast retail sales advanced 0.8%.\" Consumer strength has underpinned overall economic growth and has proven far more resilient than most policymakers and economists predicted. Yet, sticky inflation could take a toll and risk growth prospects ahead. \"The case for a gradual but sustained slowdown in growth in consumers' spending from 2023's robust pace is persuasive,\" wrote Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note. \"Most households have run down the excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, while the cost of credit has jumped and last year's plunge in home sales has depressed demand housing-related retail items like furniture and appliances.\" Investors will also be watching out for February's producer prices print due today, any upside surprises like January's hot print could further complicate the inflation picture for the Fed. The report is the last major piece of economic data to be released prior to the central bank's policy meeting next week.

    "article_text": "Money Banking Challenges With Big Impact On Small Businesses By Luke Billeri , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Finance Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Mar 13, 2024, 07:00am EDT Share Save Luke Billeri is the CEO at Members Choice Credit Union , a full-service member-owned financial cooperative based in Houston, Texas. Getty Banks and credit unions confront numerous challenges that reverberate across every sector of business. Understanding how financial institutions stay ahead of these challenges can affect your business’s ability to grow and impact your bottom line. Three key challenges banks face that should be of primary interest to your business include consumer confidence, the interest rate environment and consumer spending habits. These elements collectively shape the financial climate in which businesses operate, and having a firm grasp of these issues can help business leaders make more informed decisions. The Ripple Effect Of Consumer Confidence Consumer confidence serves as the bedrock for financial stability. For banks and credit unions, nurturing and bolstering this confidence is an ongoing challenge. Economic uncertainties, market volatility and global events can profoundly shape consumer sentiment, which in turn alters consumer behavioral habits and investment choices. When consumer confidence is down, businesses of all sizes may continue to “go” on an operational level, but lose the capacity for growth and reinvestment in their enterprises. Businesses can learn from how banks shift strategies and remain agile based on consumer confidence intelligence. Effective adaptation and a balanced eye on strategic investments are how financial institutions continue to improve during these times. Recent reports indicate that the U.S. consumer sentiment is on the upswing following a multiyear low that resulted from soaring inflation rates. This bodes well for our overall economic picture; however, business leaders must remember that consumer confidence can change on a dime due to various external influences. The Ebb And Flow Of Interest Rates The interest rate environment poses an enduring challenge for banks, with fluctuations influencing borrowing costs, investment returns and overall financial stability. The Federal Reserve System plays a pivotal role in determining interest rates, which is why the recurring mantra of “don’t fight the Fed” still rings true. While future rate probabilities are anything but certain, aligning business decisions with signals from the Fed can be a smart move. Because of the dynamic interest rate landscape, businesses of all sizes need to monitor closely how interest rates impact the cost of capital. When a business’s weighted average cost of capital rises, it becomes more “expensive” for businesses to fund new projects or expand operations. The current interest rate should be of particular interest to businesses borrowing variable-rate loans or lines of credit. When interest rates rise or stay “higher for longer,” companies may find themselves needing to generate more revenue to cover the increased cost of loan repayments. Remember that banks serve as intermediaries—buying and selling money from consumers. Their goal is to maintain margins while balancing term rates for deposits and loans. Business owners who learn to better understand the intricate dance of interest rate demands can better navigate borrowing costs to ensure long-term financial stability and keep growth and expansion on track. Consumer Spending Habits Another challenge banks and businesses face is mounting credit card debt. Consumers, striving to keep pace with a standard of living, often resort to credit cards for their purchases, which can have a cascading effect. When consumers accumulate high levels of credit card debt, they have an increased risk of defaulting on loans. Banks may incur losses on the outstanding balances if borrowers cannot make their credit card payments. This can affect the profitability of credit card issuers and, indirectly, impact other businesses connected with the financial sector. Businesses, especially small ones, may be more vulnerable to the effects of consumer credit card debt. They may rely more heavily on consumer spending. If customers reduce spending due to debt concerns, small businesses can face financial challenges, including shrinking payrolls, layoffs and permanent closures. In terms of the overall economy, high consumer credit card debt rates can contribute to economic instability, affecting business confidence, investment and overall economic growth. Closing Thoughts Banks’ challenges should not be viewed as abstract concerns but as integral elements shaping our economy. As business leaders incorporate the nuances of consumer confidence, the fluctuating interest rate environment and consumer spending patterns into their strategies, they become better at anticipating and navigating the complexities of a dynamic financial world. The key lies not just in reacting to these challenges but in proactively harnessing them for resilience and sustainable growth. Businesses that adapt with agility and insight can lead the charge within their own industries.

Pic: Marc O'Sullivan Wed, 13 Mar, 2024 - 08:37 Cáit Caden       Telecoms company eir posted a small jump in revenue driven by a rise in commercial customers, but earnings also declined slightly in the same period. In its annual results, eir reported a 4% rise in revenue to almost €1.3bn, boosted by strong growth toward the end of the year when consumer spending was also up according to recent Central Statistics Office figures. However, the company also posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of €591m, down 3% on the previous year. The company’s operating costs climbed 3% to €399 following expansion investments. Eir invested €4m into refurbishing 21 stores on high streets and in retail parks throughout Ireland. The rise in operating costs has not deterred Eir from further growth as its chief executive Oliver Loomes said the company “plans to continue to invest in our presence in towns and communities across Ireland to support local employment”. Eir said the rise was due to an increase in labour costs, which increased by around 2% to €1m in the final three months alone, while accommodation prices also increased in that time. Chief financial officer Stephen Tighe said that the large-scale investment by the company into 5G networks has “well-positioned” the company to expand its customer base over the coming years. Total eir fibre broadband base increased by 3% year on year to 869,000 customers, multi-play bundling accounted for 51% of eir fixed households, up 6 percentage points year on year while eir TV customers increased 19% to 101,000. Eir is the largest provider of fixed line telecommunications services in Ireland, offering broadband, voice, TV, and data services to residential, small business, enterprise and government segments.

    "article_text": "KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 — The Retail Group Malaysia has projected an annual growth rate in retail sales of 4 per cent for this year, a hike of a 0.5 per cent point from the projection made in November last year. According to the Malaysia Retail Industry Report released in March, the biggest challenge for the Malaysian retail industry is the rising cost of living. In comparison, the retail industry recorded a growth rate of 2.2 per cent for 2023, which was below market expectations as the projection by Retail Group Malaysia in November was 2.8 per cent. It said the retail industry contracted in the last quarter of 2023 by 0.2 per cent while retail prices, including food prices, continued to rise. “The Israel-Hamas war that started in early October 2023 had led to boycotts of many western brands with alleged links to Israel or that purportedly pledged support to it,” it said. “This prolonged boycott had affected businesses of certain retail brands. At the same time, Malaysians switch to support local and other Asian brands,” it added. The retail sales of different sub-sectors such as the department stores, hypermarkets, supermarkets, fashion, furniture and other specialty retail stores also saw negative growth of between 0.4 per cent to 4.4 per cent last year. Only the mini-market, children and baby products, pharmacy and personal care sub-sectors recorded growths of between 1.1 per cent (children and baby products) to 11.3 per cent (mini-markets). “Members of the two retailers’ association project an average growth rate of 7.1 per cent for the Malaysia retail industry during the first quarter of 2024,” it said. On the projection for 2024, it said the 10 per cent sales tax imposed on imported low-value goods, priced below RM500, sold online had led to higher retail prices on these goods. It also said the increase in service tax rate from six per cent to eight per cent since March has led to higher prices of retail goods and services. “This will affect retail spending on essential items, non-essential goods, personal services, general services, cars as well as travelling,” it said in the report compiled and written by Retail Group Malaysia based on data acquired from members of the Malaysia Retailers Association and Malaysia Retail Chain Association. It also said the weakening ringgit since last year has placed pressure on companies selling imported retail goods or importing raw materials and semi-finished goods. “Many of them are passing the higher costs to end consumers,” it said. However, it noted that the cheaper ringgit boosted domestic and international tourism with a faster recovery of foreign tourist arrival. The industry performance for the first quarter of this year is expected to be a strong 7.1 per cent due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and month-long school holidays as well as the attractive Malaysian currency and visa-free entry for visitors from China. “Malaysia’s retail industry is estimated to grow by 3.5 per cent during the second quarter with contributions mainly from the Hari Raya festival,” it said. It said the retail sector is expected to record a growth of 2.5 per cent by the third quarter of 2024 and hopeful of a 3.2 per cent growth for the last quarter."

    "article_text": "President Joe Biden said he wants a “more orderly flow” of southern migrants into workplaces and jobs around the nation because “they’re the reason our economy is growing.” The statement helps to explain why Biden is not using his White House powers to stop the northward flow of poor economic migrants through Central America and Mexico — despite escalating opposition from ordinary Americans in an election year. So far, Biden has pulled in at least 7 million southern migrants to stimulate the consumer economy as low-wage workers, apartment-sharing renters, and government-funded consumers. He has also pushed up the inflow of legal immigrants, and visa workers for blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Overall, his inflow has imported roughly one migrant for every American born during his three-year tenure. RELATED: Texas DPS Sabotages Big Human Trafficking Operation Video Source: Texas Department of Public Safety This economic policy has grown the number of jobs and the size of the economy — but has also suppressed Americans’ wages, inflated their housing and food costs, and reduced the pressure on investors to buy wage-boosting, labor-saving machines for their U.S. workplaces. The inflow of foreign workers also allows U.S. employers to ignore at least 5 million men who have fallen out of the workforce, often via drugs and criminal records. Jonathan Capehart, a very liberal commentator at MSNBC, asked Biden why he described the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley as an illegal migrant. “I’m not going to treat any any any of these [migrant] people with disrespect,” Biden told Capehart: Look, they built the country, they’re the reason our economy is growing. We have to control the border and [ensure a] more orderly flow. Biden’s administration has many factions, but two of the most important are Wall Street investors and ideological progressives. The investors gain when the federal government extracts workers, consumers, and renters from poor countries, such as Cuba, Senegal, Brazil, India, or Mexico. The migrants grow the economy as they flood into coastal states, push up housing prices, and desperately seek jobs they need to pay off their smuggling debts and aid their separated families back home. The investor lobby appears to be led by West Coast investors, mostly from Silicon Valley, led by Mark Zuckerberg, whose money played a major role in helping Biden in the 2016 election. The investors use a D.C. advocacy group — FWD.us — to fund an army of pro-migration groups , migration lawyers, PR experts , and D.C. influencers . The breadth of investors who founded and funded FWD.us was hidden from casual visitors to the group’s website in early 2021. But copies exist at the other sites . RELATED: GOP Candidate Takes Border Security into Own Hands: Kate Monroe Adds Razor Wire to Infamous San Judas Break Progressives gain from their investor alliance because the inflow of job-seeking migrants allows them to celebrate the weakening of U.S. borders. It also expands their ability to push for a stronger, centralized government over an increasingly diverse, divided, poor, chaotic, unsafe, and unequal society. Since about 2012, the investor class has used its cash to persuade the party’s progressives to endorse mass illegal migration, even though it separates myriad families, kills thousands of migrants, and shifts wealth from workers to investors. Prior Democratic politicians — as well as GOP politicians — downplayed their closed-door support for migration and publicly urged stronger border controls. In Biden’s administration, his border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, is the leader of the more-migration “orderly” alliance. On February 2, the New York Times posted Mayorkas’ recurring demand for a high-migration economy: Wouldn’t it be more orderly, and wouldn’t it be responsible governance to be able to deliver a lawful pathway to fill what we have, which is a labor need, and cut the exploitative smugglers out and give individuals a path to arrive lawfully, safely, in an orderly way, to perform labor that we need? They can send remittances home. They can return home when their work is done. Isn’t that an element of a workable immigration system? But the Cuba-born Mayorkas is firstly a pro-migration zealot who claims that accepting migrants is a core mission of the United States. Mayorkas has repeatedly explained that he supports more migration because of his migrant parents , his sympathy for migrants , his support for “equity” between Americans and foreigners , his willingness to put his priorities above the law. So he is eager to claim that U.S. business “needs” migrants — regardless of the cost to ordinary Americans , the impact on U.S. children , or Americans’ rational opposition . Since 2021, he has created a series of legally contested “legal pathways” for migrants to flow into jobs and homes through the United States. RELATED — Gorka: Biden’s Open Border Is the Greatest Threat to the U.S. Video Source: Matt Perdie / Breitbart News The dominance of the investor class over progressives is spotlighted by Greg Sargent, a progressive writer who is now arguing that Biden should double down on migration. Sargent wrote on March 8: They could say that immigrants are driving our economic boom , that they have helped tackle inflation, and that they have helped make the U.S. post-pandemic economy one of the Western world’s success stories. Biden could say plainly that another Trump presidency, by dramatically slashing legal immigration and unleashing mass deportations that tear up local communities and economies, would kill that golden goose that has delivered for us so spectacularly. “Trump and Republicans rejected the prospect of a more secure border [in the Senate leadership’s February border bill] because the means of achieving it wouldn’t sufficiently slash orderly and legal immigration,” he added. This economic policy of Extraction Migration — orderly or not — imposes vast damage on normal Americans, poor migrants , and their poor home countries , such as Haiti . A new report from the Congressional Budget Office reinforces the vast evidence that the federal policy of Extraction Migration shifts family wages and workplace investment toward Wall Street , real estate , coastal states , and government . The economic policy is very unpopular , in part, because it also diverts politicians’ focus away from American communities and the “ deaths of despair ” among discarded Americans ."

    "article_text": "The EU has always been at the forefront of regulatory reforms aimed at enhancing the financial markets and protecting investors. Among these initiatives, on May 14, 2023, a package of two proposals was put forward to amend existing directives and a regulation with a view to fostering retail investor information transparency and ensuring that investment decisions are best for investors. The EU Retail Investment Strategy Package stands out as a pivotal development designed to empower retail investors across the EU. This package aims to make the European financial market more accessible, transparent and fair for individual investors. In this article I explore the multifaceted benefits of the package for retail investors, underlining its potential to reshape personal finance management within the EU. After its entry into force the changes must be implemented by EU member states within 12 months and be applicable after 18 months. One of the cornerstone benefits of the EU Retail Investment Strategy Package is its emphasis on increasing transparency and fairness in the retail investment market. The package includes measures to ensure that investment products are advertised and sold in a manner that is honest, clear and not misleading. The package includes measures to ensure that investment products are advertised and sold in a manner that is honest, clear and not misleading This commitment to transparency is crucial for retail investors, as it enables them to make informed decisions based on accurate and comprehensible information, reducing the risk of mis-selling and investment fraud. The EU has always been proactive in safeguarding the interests of retail investors, and this package further strengthens investor protection mechanisms. It introduces stricter regulatory requirements for financial advisers, requiring them to act in the best interest of their clients and disclose any potential conflicts of interest. These provisions ensure that retail investors receive advice that truly aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance, contributing to more secure and beneficial investment outcomes. The EU Retail Investment Strategy Package also aims to broaden the spectrum of investment opportunities accessible to retail investors. By harmonising regulatory standards across member states, the package facilitates cross-border offerings of investment products. This not only diversifies investment options but also fosters competition among providers, potentially leading to better returns and lower costs for investors. Recognising the importance of informed decision-making in investing, the package includes initiatives to promote financial literacy and education among EU citizens. By providing resources and tools to understand financial products, market dynamics, and risk management strategies, the EU aims to equip retail investors with the knowledge needed to navigate the investment landscape confidently. This edu­cational focus is instrumental in building a more financially savvy populace, capable of making decisions that best serve their long-term interests. In line with the digital transformation of financial services, the EU Retail Investment Strategy Package supports the integration of technology in the investment process. It encourages the deve­lopment of digital platforms that provide easy access to investment pro­ducts and services, along with enhanced tools for market analysis and portfolio management. This digital leap forward is particularly beneficial for retail investors, offering convenience, efficiency, and enhanced capabilities for tracking and managing investments. The package also introduces mechanisms for collective redress, allowing investors to band together to seek compensation in cases of mass harm. This provision empowers retail investors, who often lack the resources to pursue legal action individually, providing a more level playing field against large financial institutions. In conclusion, the package represents a significant stride towards creating a more inclusive, transparent and secure investment environment for retail investors across the EU. By focusing on transparency, investor protection, access to diverse investment opportunities, financial education and digital innovation, the package addresses key challenges faced by retail investors. As these measures are implemented, they promise to enhance the investment experience, fostering a culture of smart, informed investing within the EU.

    "article_text": "Hungary central bank says government 'attacks' could limit scope for easing rates BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's Central Bank said on Thursday repeated \"attacks\" by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government on its monetary policy could backfire and limit the scope for easing. Published on 03/07/2024 at 08:58 am EST Reuters Share Orban and his former ally, central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy, have been involved in an increasingly bitter policy spat since a 2022 election, with the sides trading blame over a surge in inflation to the highest levels in the European Union. Inflation pushed Hungary's economy into a recession last year, with the recovery facing headwinds from prolonged weakness in Germany and a slow rebound in consumer spending. Economy Minister Marton Nagy, one of Matolcsy's former deputies, has repeatedly criticised the National Bank of Hungary, which has halved its base rate to 9% since May, for keeping borrowing costs too high, stifling the economy. On Thursday, the central bank hit back at a series of government measures, including caps on prices and interest rates as well as other moves it says harmed its independence and curbed the scope of transmitting its measures to the economy. The bank said government remarks calling its inflation-fighting credentials into question shortly before rate decisions were particularly damaging. \"As a consequence, the transmission of central bank decisions can be impaired, the reactions of economic actors to the rate decision can diverge from those expected by the central bank and as a result of an increase in risks, the optimal rate path can move higher, in contrast to government intentions,\" the bank said in a statement. Matolcsy enters his final year at the helm of the NBH with inflation, which topped 25% last year, still above the bank's target and risks of a rebound in the second half. The bank has slashed its base rate by 900 basis points since last May, but with global central banks likely keeping interest rates higher for longer, the scope for further aggressive cuts is narrowing. On Wednesday Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said Orban's government could discuss legislation next week that would widen the central bank supervisory board's controls over activities outside its basic tasks, such as setting monetary policy. The planned amendment to the central bank law, which the government says would boost transparency, has also drawn criticism from Matolcsy on the grounds it could harm the bank's independence.

It employs the latest Wi-Fi, storage, cloud, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to help retail companies increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve consumer experience. Huawei launches Smart Retail Solution The retail industry is closely intertwined with people’s daily lives. Business owners must not only stay abreast of evolving consumer needs but also tackle a range of operational challenges. These challenges include managing inventory, foot traffic, marketing strategies, and costs. Consequently, the retail industry’s digitalization as well as its intelligent upgrade are both gaining momentum. The Smart Retail Solution that Huawei released at MWC 2024 consists of four scenario-specific solutions. First, the smart store solution comes with cloud-network-security integration and the converged deployment of Access Points (APs) and Electronic Shelf Labels (ESLs). It uses Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Wi-Fi 6/7 to deploy high-quality networks, and AP+ESL improves operational efficiency. Second, the intelligent warehousing solution delivers a goods inventory system that combines IoT, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). This facilitates automatic goods sorting and visualized management, and therefore streamlines warehouse logistics. With the energy efficiency solution, IoT sensors can help intelligently adjust air conditioning and lighting in shopping malls, saving energy and cutting emissions. This solution offers the multi-purpose gateway, which integrates six functions and is ideal for slashing energy consumption. Finally, the digital marketing solution allows corporate groups to obtain foot traffic statistics and other management information from every store they operate. They can use this information to optimize store layouts and implement precision marketing based on big data analytics. These solutions have been used by large retail chains in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia Pacific . Looking ahead, Huawei’s Smart Retail Solution will continue to fuel the digitalization and intelligent upgrade of retail companies, ultimately bringing more enjoyable shopping experiences to consumers worldwide.

This decline is attributed to increased price sensitivity among consumers, who are now more inclined to “trade down or shift their spending away from discretionary goods,” according to the Fed. The Beige Book is a qualitative report about economic conditions across Federal Reserve districts, gathering insights through interviews with business contacts, economists and market experts. Overall, eight districts (Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco) reported “slight to modest growth in activity”; three (New York , Kansas City, Atlanta) no change; and one (Philadelphia) saw a worsening in conditions. Labor Market Conditions Improve , Leisure Down, Residential Real Estate Rebounds Labor market conditions further improved, with employment continuing to rise at a slight to modest pace across most districts, and the degree of tightness eased. The leisure and hospitality sector, including restaurants and hotels, has felt the pinch of reduced consumer spending. Despite the robust performance of air travel, these businesses have struggled with softening demand, a situation exacerbated by elevated prices and adverse weather conditions in some areas. The real estate market is witnessing a resurgence in interest, particularly in the residential sector, driven by a recent easing of mortgage rates. Yet this renewed interest is hampered by low inventory levels, limiting actual sales. The commercial real estate sector, especially office space, remains weak, although there is notable demand for data centers, industrial spaces and large infrastructure projects. The loan demand has been stable to declining, but overall, credit quality remains healthy, with only isolated concerns about rising delinquencies. Cautious Optimism For Economic Growth Despite the mixed signals from various sectors of the economy, the outlook for future growth remains generally positive. Business contacts across the board anticipate stronger demand and less restrictive financial conditions in the next six to 12 months, the Fed said.

To download your copy, visit this link . LONDON, March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Retail brokers in Europe are targeting growth in institutional markets and expanding into listed futures and options should restrictions on contract for difference (CFD) markets continue to spread across the continent, a study by Acuiti has found. Last year, Spain became the latest European country to introduce new restrictions on instruments aimed at retail investors banning the promotion and distribution of CFDs as well as restricting leverage on other instruments. The move by the Spanish regulator follows curbs in other European countries on the promotion of certain retail-focused instruments. Retail Revolution: How retail brokers are planning to counter CFD restrictions , released today and produced in association with ION, is based on a survey of retail-focused brokerages across Europe and a separate survey of institutional sell-side and trading firms. The study analyzes the impact on retail brokers of expanded restrictions and how they plan to respond. In addition, we asked institutional firms about attitudes to the crackdowns on retail offerings and how firms view both the threat and the opportunity posed by the potential of retail expansion into listed markets. The study found high levels of concern among retail brokers about the potential for increased curbs on retail instruments. This was particularly evident regarding CFDs, which would have the most significant impact on the business models of the majority of retail brokers that participated in the study. Were widespread restrictions to come into force across Europe, 77% of retail brokers planned to expand in other regions, 69% would seek to grow in institutional markets, and just over half would look to offer futures and options instead of OTC retail instruments, such as CFDs. For incumbent institutional brokers, this presents a competitive challenge.

    "article_text": "Retail Revolution is free to read. To download your copy, visit this link . LONDON , March 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Retail brokers in Europe are targeting growth in institutional markets and expanding into listed futures and options should restrictions on contract for difference (CFD) markets continue to spread across the continent, a study by Acuiti has found. Last year, Spain became the latest European country to introduce new restrictions on instruments aimed at retail investors banning the promotion and distribution of CFDs as well as restricting leverage on other instruments. The move by the Spanish regulator follows curbs in other European countries on the promotion of certain retail-focused instruments. Retail Revolution: How retail brokers are planning to counter CFD restrictions , released today and produced in association with ION , is based on a survey of retail-focused brokerages across Europe and a separate survey of institutional sell-side and trading firms. The study analyzes the impact on retail brokers of expanded restrictions and how they plan to respond. In addition, we asked institutional firms about attitudes to the crackdowns on retail offerings and how firms view both the threat and the opportunity posed by the potential of retail expansion into listed markets. The study found high levels of concern among retail brokers about the potential for increased curbs on retail instruments. This was particularly evident regarding CFDs, which would have the most significant impact on the business models of the majority of retail brokers that participated in the study. Were widespread restrictions to come into force across Europe , 77% of retail brokers planned to expand in other regions, 69% would seek to grow in institutional markets, and just over half would look to offer futures and options instead of OTC retail instruments, such as CFDs. For incumbent institutional brokers, this presents a competitive challenge. However, only around half of the institutional sell-side firms that participated in the survey expected increased competition from retail firms, and none anticipated a significant challenge. \"There are several examples globally of brokers who initially focused on retail and subsequently became major players in institutional markets,\" said Will Mitting , founder of Acuiti . \"In Europe, there is the potential for significant numbers of brokers to enter the institutional market over the next three years.\" \"Should retail trading shift to listed derivatives markets, the overall market available to institutional brokers will grow.

News James Rodger Content Editor 06:33, 06 Mar 2024 View Image February’s 1.9 per cent growth represents the smallest increase since September 2022, when consumer card spending rose 1.8 per cent. Consumer card spending grew just 1.9 per cent in February – the lowest since 2022 - according to Barclays. February’s 1.9 per cent growth represents the smallest increase since September 2022, when consumer card spending rose 1.8 per cent. ‌ A drop in food and fuel prices caused a slowdown, while wet weather contributed to a 2.2 per cent fall in high street spending. Takeaways and digital content grew 6.5 per cent as Brits opted for nights at home, The Barclays Consumer Spend report found. ‌ The report combines hundreds of millions of customer transactions with consumer research to provide an in-depth view of UK spending. Across its issuing and acquiring businesses, Barclays sees nearly half of the nation’s credit and debit card transactions, which provides unique insight into UK consumer spending. ‌ READ MORE Disney Plus crackdown 'coming' and accounts will be deleted 'if you're suspected' Karen Johnson, Head of Retail at Barclays, said: “February’s wet weather meant Brits chose to spend more time indoors, resulting in a slowdown in high-street and hospitality spending. This shift in behaviour meant insperiences enjoyed a boost, as consumers opted to enjoy cosy nights in with a TV show and a takeaway. ‌ “At the supermarket, the majority of shoppers have noticed the impact of supply issues on stock, with tea shortages causing the most concern. Meanwhile, ‘drip pricing’ has topped the list of shopper bugbears, particularly when using food delivery services and buying airline tickets. “With Brits having reined in discretionary spending during the winter months, and as inflationary pressures begin to ease, retailers will be hopeful that the onset of warmer weather lifts spending – particularly if consumer confidence improves in the summer.” Jack Meaning, Chief UK Economist at Barclays, said: “We have continued to see encouraging signs of slowing price growth so far in 2024, particularly in the retail sector. Recent data shows shop price and grocery inflation decelerated significantly in February, as retailers offered shoppers discounts and promotional offers. Article continues below \"This will be a welcome reprieve for consumers, and a probable explanation of last month’s subdued card spending growth: while many people will have taken advantage of recent price promotions, they look to have held back on spending at least some of what they saved elsewhere.”"

Picture: PA The influential S&P Global/CIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 53.8 in February, as growth slowed marginally from 54.3 in January. The UK’s services sector grew again last month amid the fastest rise in new work for nine months, according to new figures. Economists said the data suggests the “UK economy has turned a corner” after entering a recession last year. The influential S&P Global/CIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 53.8 in February, as growth slowed marginally from 54.3 in January. It was the fourth consecutive month of growth for the sector. Any reading above 50 indicates growth for the sector, and below means decline. The reading was nevertheless slightly lower than estimated in a “flash” reading late last month. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Another solid expansion of business activity across the service sector in February adds to signs that the UK economy has turned a corner after entering a technical recession during the second half of 2023. “New business intakes were a particularly bright spot as service providers reported the fastest order book growth since May 2023. “Survey respondents cited rising business and consumer spending, linked to improved optimism towards the broader economic outlook. “A turnaround in customer demand and the prospect of interest cuts on the horizon helped to boost business optimism across the service economy.” The survey showed that business activity was supported by a “solid increase” in new order volumes, which rose at the fastest rate since May 2023. Some firms also highlighted “rising business and consumer spending, linked to more supportive economic conditions”. There was also a “modest” increase in staffing levels across companies in the service sector, with improved recruitment helping to drive higher capacity to serve customers. Expectations for the year ahead also improved further, with the survey showing the highest rate of business optimism for two years. By Press Association"

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now MUMBAI : Retail investors appear to have turned savvier with stock trading, cashing out of small-cap counters while prices ruled high. As a category, retail investors' share in these stocks declined between the March and December quarters, a period when many small-cap stocks generated sky-high returns. In the past, many retail investors used to burn their fingers, buying up overheated shares and selling lower. For instance, stocks like BSE, Birlasoft, Zensar Tech, Sonata Software, and RBL Bank, which rose between 23% and 415% in the nine months through December, saw the share of the retail category falling 4.26-10.8%. The retail category comprises investors who buy shares up to ₹ 2 lakh. In all, out of the 250 stocks comprising the Nifty Smallcap index, retail investors cut their stakes in 139, while increasing them in 108. Against this, mutual funds increased their stakes in 162 out of 250 stocks, while cutting them in only 86. Valuations in some of these companies have gone through the roof. For instance, in BSE, which saw retail stake falling to 34.08% at the end of December from 44.88% at the end of March, price to earnings multiple jumped to 39.54 times from 26.62 times. In software firm Birlasoft, retail stake fell to 13.66% from 19.84% as the P/E multiple surged to 36.32 from 22.21 times and in Zensar, the stake declined to 12.9% from 17.58% amid the PE rising to 26.99 times from 19.09 times. “Retail has been taking more informed decisions, thanks to them being better equipped, educated and more aware of the risks inherent in small and midcap stocks,\" said Kishor Kansagra, chairman of BSE Brokers Forum, comprising over 700 brokers across India. “This is a change from the past when retail, acting largely on hearsay, entered at the peak and exited at a loss and stayed away from the markets, thereafter.\" In the calendar year through December 2018, when BSE Smallcap 250 plunged 24.4% through 2220.6, retail investors on that exchange net purchased shares ₹ 444.8 crore, showing their entry at high levels. Interestingly, retail investors on both NSE and BSE have net sold shares worth ₹ 684 billion in the fiscal year through December, after having net purchased ₹ 11 billion in FY23 and ₹ 1.08 trillion in FY22. In the nine months through December 2023, the Nifty Smallcap 250 rose by 60% to 14,041.29 points. In FY23 and FY22 , when retail net invested, the small cap index fell by 8.65% to 8,787.9 and rose by 33.2% to 9,529.9 points respectively. The relatively huge sales in the current fiscal follow the net buying particularly in FY22. From FY22 end to FY24 (Apr-December), the small cap index has risen 47.33%, which coincides with the retail selling this year. “Retail has become much more mature than earlier and made more money in the past couple of years,\" said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, non -executive director, Inditrade. “In the last three years, after every fall, markets have tended to rise, during which they’ve bought the dip and sold the rise.\" However, there are some who believe that barring a few, retail investors still suffer from a herd mentality. “I don’t think the mindset has changed much from the past,\" said Uttam Bagri, promoter director, BCB group. “Many of them still invest on tips and hearsay rather than through their own research.\" Gift this article Catch all the Business News , Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Generate Key Takeaways Retail crimesters may not be shying away from stealing stock, but law enforcement nationwide has continued to crack down on crime ring participants. Several states’ legislators have expressed their interest in decreasing retail crime rates through legislation , task forces , technology and increased budgets, citing rising crime, fearful retail employees and shoppers turning to online purchases rather than trekking into stores. More from Sourcing Journal California Mall Bans Minors Unless Accompanied by Adult Tech Solution Aims to Streamline Process for Reporting Retail Crime Supreme Court Declines to Review Brandy Melville Trademark Suit Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement As some of the laws begin to go into effect and others make their way through the states’ respective legislative processes, police have ramped up their efforts to splinter retail crime rings’ aspirations. Florida Florida police arrested six Georgia residents accused of stealing about $90,000 of merchandise from various big box retailers in Florida over the course of 18 months. Those arrested have been accused of traveling from Georgia to Florida weekly to steal merchandise using self-checkout systems. Police said the suspects “made only partial payments before leaving stores with additional items.” According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), the six suspects are allegedly part of an organized retail theft ring responsible for over 70 separate retail thefts. Those incidents occurred at stores in eight different counties in Northeast Florida, police said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Two of the suspects—Robert Thad Bryant III, 40, and Kimberly Michelle Thompson, 46, both of Kingsland, Georgia—will be prosecuted by the state of Florida under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act. Bryant also faces 49 counts of grand theft and seven counts of petit theft. The four other arrested suspects each face at least one count of grand theft and at least one count of petit theft. Those suspects are Brian Lee Wallace, 42; Christopher Neal Coats, 41; Mary Lynn Corwin, 50, and Ryan Lee Mullis, 44. Wallace, Corwin and Mullis live in Kingsland, and Coats resides in St. Mary’s, Georgia. FDLE Agent in Charge, Mike Williams, said retail crime continues to negatively impact the state’s economy. “Organized retail theft is becoming increasingly common and impacts consumers with higher prices on the goods they buy. In Florida, FDLE agents fight this trend by making retail theft cases a priority and working to arrest all members of a criminal organization,” Williams said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Ron DeSantis, the state’s governor, recently promised to tighten retail crime-related laws in the state to ensure criminals faced harsher penalties for retail theft, specifically in organized crime rings. California United States Marshals arrested Denayaha Duree, 22, of San Francisco , in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Valentine’s Day , police said. Duree allegedly stole merchandise from a mall in San Francisco in late January. According to the San Francisco Police Department, Duree has previously been arrested in relation to organized retail theft. Police sought her arrest for the Jan. 29 theft, but also for two thefts that occurred at luxury stores in May 2023, the SFPD said. Police said Duree’s charges will be solidified pending her extradition. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement California leaders and politicians have been scrambling to solve the retail crime issue its cities face. One day after Duree’s arrest, several members of the California State Assembly put forth the California Retail Theft Reduction Act, which would punish retail crimesters found with stolen merchandise they intend to sell. In late January, just days prior to the mall theft police allege Duree took part in, legislators introduced a bill into the California State Assembly that would revise the definitions outlined in Prop 47, in turn bringing harsher penalties against those who commit retail crime. Oregon Police in Eugene, Oregon, arrested 44-year-old Jason Weeks for alleged participation in organized retail crime, according to local news station KEZI 9. Police reportedly arrested Weeks on charges of first-degree robbery and first-degree theft. Police said in October 2023, they responded to a Eugene Target after reports of a gas leak. Upon investigation, the officers discovered an explosive device placed in the store as a distraction from the alleged thievery. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Officials continued to investigate that case until the end of February, when Eugene police responded to what KEZI called a “dispute.” Officers identified one of the people in the dispute as Weeks, whom the department had been searching for in connection with an organized retail theft ring, KEZI reported. ​​Police also arrested Bailey Eulene Miller, 25, and Antoine Danaebrown, 38, for their alleged connection to the Target theft, KEZI noted. On Jan. 1, a new law went into effect in Oregon, which pledged harsher punishment for those pilfering from shelves in the state. Like a number of other states, including Washington, California and New York, state legislators expressed concern over the ways in which retail crime continues to affect business owners, retail store associates and consumer safety.

    "article_text": "Nvidia has dethroned Tesla as the most popular stock for day traders Matthew Fox March 1, 2024 2 min read Nvidia stock has taken over Tesla as the most popular stock traded by retail investors. The dethroning comes as Nvidia has surged 60% year-to-date, compared to Tesla's 18% decline. \"NVDA looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment,\" Vanda Research said. Nvidia has dethroned Tesla as the most popular stock traded by retail investors, according to a recent note from Vanda Research. The firm found that retail purchases of Nvidia stock over a ten-day period surpassed Tesla earlier this month amid the AI chipmaker's record run. Cumulative purchases of Nvidia stock are sitting at just under $1 billion over a 10-day period, where as Tesla stock has attracted just under $500 million in flows from retail investors. Shares of Nvidia have surged 60% year-to-date and are up 241% over the past year as the company continues to impress investors with strong earnings growth from the sale of its H100 GPU chips. Those returns dwarf Tesla's, with the EV-maker's stock falling 20% year-to-date and 2% over the past year. \"So long TSLA, there's a new sheriff in retail town. Given recent challenges for Musk's company and lagging shares price performance, retail investors have continued shifting their purchases progressively in favor of NVDA lately,\" Vanda Research said. The dethroning is significant as Tesla has been a darling among retail investors throughout all of 2023, with investors purchasing upwards of $4 billion of the stock over a two-week period in early 2023. The swap between Nvidia and Tesla means the AI chipmaker is now an indicator of overall sentiment among retail traders, according to the note. \"NVDA looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment,\" Vanda Research said. But the stock could still have a long way to go in winning over retail investors, as some may be hesitant to buy a stock that is sitting at all-time highs. \"The 'scary' part is that despite the recent hype around anything AI and semiconductors, current retail flows into NVDA shares have merely matched the lowest point seen in TSLA stocks during 2023,\" Vanda Research said.

    "article_text": "The Republic's domestic economy expanded by just 0.5 per cent last year, far below the 2.2 per cent expected by the Department of Finance following a continued fall in investment in the final quarter, official data showed on Friday. With Ireland's large multinational sector often distorting gross domestic product (GDP), officials prefer to use modified domestic demand (MDD) to gauge the strength of the economy. MDD contracted 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter from October to December. GDP is still the measure used to calculate the State's share of activity across the euro zone. This measure contracted by 3.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter versus an initial estimate of -0.7 per cent, and by 3.2 per cent in 2023 having grown by 9.4 per cent a year earlier, Central Statistics Office data showed. Modified domestic demand grew just as sharply in 2022, up 9.5 per cent, thanks to a post-pandemic rebound in consumer spending and a 15.9 per cent surge in modified investment linked to workers returning to their offices and major manufacturing plant projects. Advertisement The 7.1 per cent fall in modified investment in 2023 was a far worse outcome than the 0.2 decline the Department of Finance had forecast in October. The 3.1 per cent increase in personal consumption last year was broadly in line with the department's estimates. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said the growth in consumer spending together with the strength of the labour market – where employment grew 3.4 per cent year-on-year in 2023 – were \"a good measure of the underlying health of the domestic economy.\" \"That said, today's data show that consumer spending was flat at the tail-end of last year – with the tightening of monetary policy weighing on spending,\" Mr McGrath said in a statement. \"In this context, I would highlight the easing of inflation – to 2.2 per cent in February, its lowest rate since July 2021 – which will help support the purchasing power of households and underpin spending over this year.\" Mr McGrath's department most recently forecast modified domestic demand growth of 2.2 per cent for 2024, supported by a similar rate of consumption growth to 2023 and flat modified investment. It will update those forecasts next month."

    "article_text": "The record rally in the stock market hasn't yet ignited a speculative FOMO mentality among day traders The record rally in the stock market hasn't yet ignited a speculative FOMO mentality among day traders · Business Insider Matthew Fox February 29, 2024 2 min read The record rally in the stock market has yet to ignite a FOMO mentality among retail traders. Vanda Research said that retail traders are cautious about buying declines in the stock market. \"While it may feel like there's significant FOMO in the markets, hard data point to a cautiously optimistic retail cohort,\" Vanda Research said. The stock market's rally to record highs this year has yet to ignite a FOMO mentality among retail traders, according to Vanda Research. The firm said retail traders have been \"uneasy\" about aggressively buying declines in the stock market based on recent fund flow data, which shows that on a trailing week basis, retail purchases dropped to their lowest level since November 2020. \"We suspect many don't want to chance buying the top,\" Vanda Research said in a note on Wednesday. The data from Vanda Research, which includes options trading activity, paints a different picture of current stock market sentiment compared to other indicators. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Index has been hovering in \"Extreme Greed\" territory over the past few weeks, and some market pundits are warning that the stock market is in a meltup that rivals the dot-com bubble seen in 1999 and 2000. But when compared to the speculative trading bubble seen in 2021 when meme stocks like GameStop and AMC exploded higher, the current market sentiment among retail traders seems muted, as measured by options trading data. \"The scale of current speculative retail options activity is only a fraction of the GME & AMC bubble levels,\" Vanda Research said. That's even when considering the surge in trading activity centered around a handful of AI and crypto-related stocks, like Super Micro Computer and MicroStrategy , among others. \"Current pockets of speculative retail activity in popular small caps only amount to <10% of spending compared to what GME and AMC alone attracted three years ago,\" the note said. That suggests to Vanda Research that the \"fear of missing out\" mentality commonly found among retail traders during speculative rallies could eventually see a revival. \"While it may feel like there's significant FOMO in the markets, hard data point to a cautiously optimistic retail cohort instead. Of course, things can change quickly, but there's quite a ways to go before we have to start ringing the alarm on speculative retail activity,\" Vanda Research said.

    "article_text": "Feb 29, 2024 What do falling inflation and rising incomes mean for consumer spending? The January PCE report showed inflation easing further but still significant. Moderation in spending could also continue, analysts say. by Justin Ho Play Listen Now Save Share Download Wage growth was resilient in January, but Social Security and other factors added to income gains. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The big economic news of the day? The personal consumption expenditures price index for January from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It found prices were up 2.4% from the same time in 2023. When you strip out the volatile food and energy categories, the increase was 2.8%. Those year-over-year inflation figures have been falling over the last few months, but they’re still higher than the Federal Reserve would like to see. The same report found that people’s incomes have been rising too — up 1% in January. That’s the biggest monthly gain since 2021. Last month was a little unusual when it comes to incomes. For one thing, Social Security benefits went up. “January is when you see the adjustment to cost-of-living indices from the prior year start to hit Social Security checks,” said George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. Pearkes said another factor pushing up January incomes was the almost $80 billion in dividend payments from stocks. And when you exclude those one-off factors and look at actual wage growth? “That didn’t really move around that much. That basically did what was expected in January,” he said. But even though wage growth didn’t move around that much, it was pretty resilient. Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, said we can thank the strong job market for that. “So even though the labor market is showing some signs of moderation, we continue to see firms hire at a decent clip. And firms cite that they are having trouble filling open positions,” she said. As long as the job market remains tight, Grein said, wages are probably going to keep rising. Just like they have over the last several months. “The trend there has been pretty remarkable, and I think still suggests that you’re going to see a steady pace of consumption this year,” she said. Consumer spending has been decelerating over the last year as inflation has come down, said Michelle Meyer, chief economist of the Mastercard Economics Institute. And this year, the trend is likely to continue. “There’s still more work to be done for many categories in terms of seeing cooling inflationary pressure,” Meyer said, “and that will filter into some moderation in spending as well.” That said, moderation in consumer spending isn’t the same thing as weak consumer spending. In fact, Meyer said she expects the economy to still expand this year. It’ll just feel a little more normal. “A newer normal than we had prior to the pandemic. But certainly not the environment that we were in in ‘21 or ‘22 or even early ‘23, when we had rising and high inflation,” she said. And a more normal economy, Meyer said, is a pretty healthy outcome.

    "article_text": "Feb 29, 2024 In the “girl” era, are women really splurging for fun? Economic disadvantages like the wealth gap persist, despite talk of the “she-conomy.” by Jordan Mangi Save Share Since the pandemic began, single women and other lower-wealth groups saw larger percentage gains in their wealth than their higher-wealth counterparts. Hernández Kent said that’s primarily because it’s easier to double a small amount of money. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Unequivocally, 2023 was the Year of the Girl . The Barbie movie blew up, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift music tours boosted local economies, and girls ruled the internet. By 2028, women will be in charge of 75% of discretionary spending , Nielsen, a media research firm, projected. According to Nielsen, that makes women “the world’s greatest influencers.” As more marketing is done through social media, brands are targeting obscure “girlie” niches: the corporate girlies, the fitness girlies, the ADHD girlies, the IBS girlies, the hot-girl-walk girlies, the tinned-fish girlies. Even the Super Bowl was “ all about the girlies. ” After all, women run this economy , right? Not exactly. Despite all the flashy marketing trends — and the fact that women do make most daily financial decisions in opposite sex couples — women don’t generally outspend men. On top of that, persisting systemic barriers keep women from accumulating wealth at the same rate as men, and many women remain economically disadvantaged. A primary disadvantage women face is the income gap: In the U.S., women earn about 82% of what men make, Pew Research Center found . That hasn’t changed much in the past 20 years, and is worse for Black, Latina and Indigenous women. The gender wealth gap is a bit trickier to measure since wealth in the U.S. is measured by household, but research shows it is even wider than the income gap. For never-married individuals, there’s a gap of 68 cents per dollar between men and women, said Ana Hernández Kent, a senior researcher for the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Income is more transitory. It’s kind of like, ‘How are you doing right now?’” she said. “Versus wealth is, ‘Can you invest in yourself in the future? Can you invest in your kids? Can you help them with a down payment on a house? Can you do that for yourself?’” Since the pandemic began, lower-wealth groups saw larger percentage gains in their wealth than their higher-wealth counterparts. Hernández Kent said that’s primarily because it’s easier to double your money if you only have a small amount saved to begin with. In dollar terms, the gap between low and high wealth groups grew, she said. These gaps are reflected in spending: Unmarried men spent, on average, a bit more than unmarried women in 2022, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Eighteen to 25-year-old men outspent women in the same age group by more than $3,000 per year — those are Gen Zers, who recently coined the term “ doom spending ” to describe their generation’s version of retail therapy. So why aren’t we inundated with articles about the boy-conomy? That same BLS data does show that single women spend a bit more than single men of a similar income level. But often, women bear extra financial burdens. For example, single mothers are much more common than single fathers, and children aren’t cheap — single mothers often have little savings . Women also outspend men on apparel and related services. That also isn’t necessarily by choice. Studies have shown the positive relationship between attractiveness and income, but one 2016 study took it further: Controlling for personal grooming eliminated the beauty wage gap in women, meaning practices like daily makeup and hair maintenance significantly correlate to increased income for women. The same was not true for men, the study found. The past few years have been strong for grooming spending — economic tough times are inversely correlated with cosmetic purchases and other little luxuries , like bows. These affordable splurges during times of economic stress (like, say, the past few years) could be one reason it feels like women are in the driver’s seat of the consumer economy. Emily Mayer owns Bardot Bow Gallery , an Etsy shop that sells bows and other hair accessories with a focus on adult women. She knows better than anyone that a little goes a long way, especially in this economy. Her sales are climbing and bows are in . “They’re like a fresh tube of lipstick. It’s just an easy way to throw your hair back and it doesn’t need to be complicated,” she said. Another area in which women have no choice but to outspend men? Health care. Women with employer insurance spend 18% more than men on out-of-pocket health care costs each year, Deloitte researchers found — that’s excluding maternal health-related services. Health insurance products tend to cater to male health issues and don’t cover female-specific screenings and procedures, the study showed. Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, a former attending physician and now Deloitte’s U.S. chief health equity officer, led the study. She described how this imbalance might play out: For a patient with abdominal pain, the range of possible diagnoses is much narrower for men than for women due to differing anatomy and risk factors. For each additional imaging test a woman needs, there is likely an additional copay. “When we look at the ‘á la carte menu’ in which health care comes, once you get past the preventative costs, it’s designed as an all-you-can-eat for men more than it is designed as an all-you-can-eat for women,” Dr. Gebreyes said. Her team is calling on employers to look at the health benefits they offer and adjust to more equitably cover womens’ health issues — reducing the gap between what men and women spend on their health. “We can all spend a lot of time admiring the problems, or we can figure out in our own lanes what actions we can take,” she said. In addition to structural issues that make wealth accumulation more difficult for women than men, some research shows major differences in how men and women perceive finances: Men are more likely to see money as a form of power, whereas women see spending as an expression of love. Men are often riskier with their money whereas women are more likely to save. That’s according to Giulia Sesini, an economic psychology researcher. Generally speaking, Sesini said, women are more impulsive shoppers than men. Her latest research reveals one reason for this impulsivity is internalized stereotypes. “If for all your life, people keep on telling you that women are no good in finance, women are impulsive, women are so and so, you embody this stereotype — the stereotypical beliefs about yourself — and you act according to this stereotypical beliefs,” she said. Financial advising aimed at breaking down these stereotypes could make a big impact, Sesini said. All sorts of factors like the wage gap, psychology and sexist systems have created the perfect storm for women to maintain less economic power than men. So why all the buzz about the “girl economy”? Hernández Kent with the St. Louis Fed likes to use a different phrase: the she-cession . During the pandemic, women’s unemployment spiked way more than men’s, and it took longer for women to return to the workforce, she said. It was a she-cession. Now, employment levels are roughly where they were pre-pandemic, meaning some women may be in a more stable place economically than they were in 2020 or 2021, and that is being celebrated by advertisers. But being “back” doesn’t necessarily mean women have grown in their careers or are taking jobs that best match their skills. “Women had made really strong growth in that three year period. In some cases, it was record growth. But that does not mean that they’re financially stable,” Hernández Kent said. “The wins should be celebrated. But also it should be with the lens of there’s still more to go, there’s still a long path to take to get to that equity point.” Correction This story has been updated to reflect Giulia Sesini’s role.

    "article_text": "Stocks of some of China's most widely held companies were sinking in unison on Wednesday, with several catalysts sending them lower. One company delivered a disappointing financial report, concerns about China's economy continued, and the country's policymakers announced moves that shook up its stock market. With that as a backdrop, several of China's biggest technology stocks lagged the broader market. Shares of Baidu ( BIDU 0.28% ) slumped 7.2%, Tencent Holdings ( TCEHY +0.24% ) declined 3.9%, and Alibaba ( BABA 3.07% ) fell 3.4%, as of 1:22 p.m. ET today. Image source: Getty Images. Disappointing results Baidu reported its fourth-quarter results, and investors were not pleased. The company generated revenue of $4.9 billion, up 6% year over year, while the diluted earnings per American depositary share (ADS) of $0.95 cratered 50%. To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $4.86 billion and per-ADS earnings of $2.48, so profits fell far short of investor expectations. The news wasn't all bad, as Baidu's ChatGPT-style offering, ERNIE, helped boost revenue, despite an ongoing downturn in advertising, which is the company's bread and butter. On the other hand, steep spending on artificial intelligence (AI) helped erode the bottom line, weighing on profits. The company noted that revenue from its core business, which consists mainly of online advertising, cloud computing, and AI, grew 7% to $3.87 billion, while growth at its streaming platform iQiyi lagged, increasing 2% to $1.1 billion. A weak economic backdrop Baidu is the latest company to report earnings that highlight the current challenges besetting China's economy. The country is suffering from high unemployment among younger citizens, slowing growth, and lower consumer spending. Any economist will tell you that consumer spending is the backbone of an economy, so this could be a bad harbinger. Exacerbating the situation is the crisis in China's real estate market. Just last month, a judge ordered the liquidation of property developer China Evergrande Group, which helps illustrate the ongoing challenges in the country as property transactions have slumped. Last year, home sales in China declined 6.5%, and market commentators suggest the worst isn't over. By some accounts, real estate represents roughly 25% of China's economy, which just makes things worse. Lastly, the country's moves to curb certain investing strategies are not being well received. Chinese securities regulators announced a crackdown on short-selling, going so far as to say that malicious short-sellers would \"lose their shirts and rot in jail,\" according to a report by Reuters. China also announced curbs on quantitative or computer-driven trading. Regulators directed quant funds to stop accepting new cash and discontinue existing \"direct market access\" products. These recent moves have cast a pall on the market, helping send these popular stocks lower. Will investors follow the government's lead? Investors already leery about the worsening economy in China have more reasons to be wary. Furthermore, each of our trio of companies listed above is highly dependent on consumer spending and a strong economy: Baidu is China's leading internet search provider, and like Alphabet 's Google -- its U.S. counterpart -- it relies on digital advertising for the vast majority of its revenue. Weakness in the economy translates to much lower ad sales. Alibaba is one of the country's largest digital retailers. Lower consumer spending equals less sales. Tencent's social media makes much of its money from advertising, while its gaming and ancillary services are highly dependent on consumer discretionary income. In the face of macroeconomic headwinds and high unemployment, consumer spending in China is slowing, which could further weaken an already fragile economy. As a result, the future is uncertain, particularly for companies that depend on consumers for their livelihoods. To be clear, I'm not suggesting investors should avoid these stocks completely. In fact, they are currently trading at compelling valuations, as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are selling for 14 times, 12 times, and 12 times earnings, respectively -- each a significant discount to the broader market. And Baidu and Alibaba are selling for a price-to-sales ratio of less than 2, the benchmark for underpriced stocks. That said, investors should factor China's weakening economic outlook into their thinking and ensure they approach these companies with a long-term outlook. Furthermore, investing in China carries additional risk , and any position should be a modest part of a well-diversified portfolio."

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was slightly revised down to an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the second estimate, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. In the advance estimate released in late January, the increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter was 3.3 percent. The update primarily reflected a downward revision to private inventory investment that was partly offset by upward revisions to state and local government spending and consumer spending, the report showed. The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected rises in consumer spending, exports, state and local government spending, non-residential fixed investment, federal government spending, and residential fixed investment that were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. In the third quarter, real GDP increased 4.9 percent. Real GDP increased 2.5 percent in 2023. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently said that market expectations are too high that the U.S. economy will see a soft landing. Dimon told CNBC that there's a better-than-even chance that the U.S. is heading for a recession, noting that markets probably aren't pricing in a strong enough probability that interest rates could stay higher for longer.

    "article_text": "Updated / Wednesday, 28 Feb 2024 15:06 US GDP growth was revised to an annual rate of 3.2% in the final three months of 2023, from an initial estimate of 3.3% released last month US economic growth was slightly weaker than previously estimated in the fourth quarter last year, according to government data released today, due mainly to a downward revision to business investment. GDP growth in the world's biggest economy was revised to an annual rate of 3.2% in the final three months of 2023, from an initial estimate of 3.3% released last month. \"The update primarily reflected a downward revision to private inventory investment,\" said the Department of Commerce in a report. But it added that this was partially offset by revisions upward to government and consumer spending. Full-year US growth remained at 2.5%, markedly above the 2022 level. While many analysts expected that consumer spending would lose steam as households drew down on savings from the pandemic period and as borrowing costs stayed elevated, consumption has been more resilient than anticipated. The US economy also defied predictions that it would enter a recession, strengthening optimism that it is achieving a soft landing - where inflation cools from higher interest rates without triggering a downturn. While real GDP was revised down, \"consumption was stronger in the second estimate,\" said economist Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics. \"More than the fourth quarter data, the trend in growth and inflation going forward will be important,\" she added in a note. \"We think growth will slow but will remain positive over coming quarters,\" she said.

    "article_text": "Zee will struggle in the absence of the fresh capital that Sony was proposing to infuse. A new suitor is the only other option. The acquisitive tycoon Gautam Adani fits the bill of someone who may relish the competition with arch rival Ambani. Sony Group Corp. dodged a bullet when its lawyers nixed a $10 billion Indian merger that executives had spent two years trying to bring to fruition. The spurned target hasn’t been as lucky. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. has no other suitors on the horizon, and its founders’ mounting legal troubles are threatening to engulf the firm. To foreign investors, the Sony-Zee saga is a reminder of the need to approach Indian deals with an abundance of caution. In 2008, Daiichi Sankyo Co. shelled out $4.6 billion to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., a generic drugmaker, from New Delhi-based brothers Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh. Shortly after, US regulators barred more than 30 drugs made at two of the Indian company's plants and halted reviews of new products at one of the factories because the firm had falsified data. Daiichi got pulled into a rabbit hole to win an arbitration award against the brothers for suppressing facts, and then to get it enforced. Sixteen years later, governance at many Indian family-controlled firms isn’t any better. The market watchdog, which is investigating Zee’s founder Subhash Chandra and his son Punit Goenka , the chief executive officer, for siphoning funds from the publicly traded firm, has found a 20 billion rupee ($241 million) diversion, roughly 10 times bigger than what was revealed to a preliminary probe. The near-15% slump in shares that followed the Bloomberg News report — denied by the company as “incorrect, baseless and false” — puts the onus on the father-son duo. They have an opportunity to tell their side of the story to the Securities and Exchange Board of India before the SEBI finalizes its report on alleged governance lapses by April. Yet, what Zee actually did was to blame the “negative public opinion” on misinformation. On Friday, the board set up an advisory panel to curb “erosion of investor wealth.” The time for fighting words is long past. The very survival of India’s oldest private television franchise is at stake. For one thing, Zee had about $100 million in cash in December. Sony has initiated arbitration proceedings in Singapore against it, seeking a $90 million breakup fee. Live Events You Might Also Like: Zee Entertainment refutes report of Rs 2,000 cr accounting gaffe, says it is 'false' Second, the Mumbai-based firm skipped a $200 million payment to Walt Disney Co. last month, citing a liquidity crunch. This is part of a $1.4 billion license agreement with Disney to telecast some cricket matches for which the US entertainment giant holds the rights. Wriggling out of the arrangement may not be financially painless for Zee. Disney has just entered into a binding pact with Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Industries Ltd. to combine their Indian media operations. Asia’s richest tycoon, who is expected to own at least a 61% stake in the merged entity, might insist that Disney extract as much out of the contract with Zee as possible. The third crucial issue is the control of Zee’s affairs by a shareholder group with less than 4% ownership. Sony wrongly thought that the best way into the marquee asset was to be Chandra’s white knight. Its merger proposal even gave the founding family the option to raise its depleted shareholding to 20%. Luckily for Sony, the SEBI’s preliminary report, alleging that Zee had faked the recovery of loans owed by founder Chandra’s private entities, came before the merger had been concluded. The father and son are contesting the SEBI’s findings, but honoring the agreement to let Goenka helm the merged entity became impossible with the sword of regulatory action hanging over the Zee CEO. The transaction collapsed in January. You Might Also Like: Zee forms an advisory committee following 'rumours' that led to investor wealth erosion But while Sony might have gotten away by the skin of its teeth, Zee’s finances are deteriorating. Annual profit has fallen by 95%, its content inventory is shrinking, and the network's 17% market share is holding up only at the expense of profit margins. And that brings us to a fourth point: The competitive landscape has changed vastly from when Sony and Zee shook hands in 2021. A Disney-Ambani marriage is set to create a formidable No. 1., with a complete lockdown on cricket in a country crazy about the sport. Meanwhile, Zee will struggle in the absence of the fresh capital that Sony was proposing to infuse. A new suitor is the only other option. The acquisitive tycoon Gautam Adani fits the bill of someone who may relish the competition with arch rival Ambani. Now that the infrastructure czar has seen off allegations of governance lapses at his own transportation and energy empire, he may not be averse to establishing a foothold in India’s consumer economy with telecom and media, where Ambani calls the shots. Still, Adani may not want to step into the breach until the legal and accounting dust around Zee has settled. (In that case, Sony, too, may want to return to the negotiating table.) But the chances of a good outcome are fading fast. Investors voted down the reappointment of two directors in December, while another withdrew his nomination. Shareholders, who have seen a franchise worth $9 billion in 2018 collapse to $2 billion, are unlikely to be satisfied with the latest campaign to reestablish credibility by a board that is itself grasping for legitimacy. The company that brought private satellite TV to India may be remembered as another Ranbaxy: a warning to foreign buyers to curb their enthusiasm. Perhaps the only kind of mergers and acquisitions that makes sense is where a multinational such as Disney inherits a good Indian asset from another — like Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. — and flips it over to a prominent local billionaire, keeping a minority stake to ride the upside. Selling control to Indian families may be a whole lot easier than buying it from them. Taking a leaf from Disney CEO Bob Iger’s playbook, it may not be a bad idea for Sony to invite Adani as a majority partner in its local media operations. Otherwise, the Japanese network will find itself fighting Ambani all alone — minus the added heft of a Zee merger.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here . What you need to know today Markets tumble Wall Street closed lower Monday as investors awaited inflation data due later this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell around 62 points, or 0.16%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.38% and 0.13%, respectively. But bitcoin resumed its rally to rise past $54,000 after a week of tepid trading. Zoom surges Zoom shares spiked after the video-chat platform provider's quarterly revenue and profit topped estimates. Revenue rose more than 2.5% from $1.12 billion a year earlier. Growth would have been faster in the fiscal fourth quarter if not for a sales reorganization, the company said. Dimon AI's 'big optimist' JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he doesn't think AI is just a passing fad . \"When we had the internet bubble the first time around … that was hype. This [AI] is not hype. It's real,\" Dimon told CNBC, calling himself a \"big optimist\" on the emerging technology. U.S. to be a chips hub U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the U.S. is set to become a major hub of state-of-the-art semiconductor chips before 2030 to compete on the global market. She added the country is on track to produce roughly 20% of the world's leading-edge logic chips by the end of the decade. [PRO] Hotter than Nvidia There's an even \"hotter\" artificial intelligence stock than Nvidia. That's Super Micro Computer, a Nasdaq-listed company which makes AI systems and graphics processing unit servers, highlighted Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates. The bottom line Forecasters are getting increasingly upbeat about the state of the U.S. economy. Last year, many economists predicted a recession but that never happened. Now, a growing chorus of analysts are sanguine about growth this year. In its latest survey, the National Association for Business Economics \"sharply revised upwards\" its GDP forecast for 2024. NABE now expects the economy to grow by 2.2%, compared with the 1.3% it forecast in December. \"The stronger February growth forecasts for 2024 result from upward revisions to key sectors of the economy,\" including consumer spending, said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley and NABE president. Other experts share the optimism. Bank of America's annual survey of Merrill financial advisors indicated a significant decline in recessionary fears and an uptick in bullish sentiment. Strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a Friday note, just 4% of the survey's 240 respondents expect a recession this year, compared with 85% of the respondents last year. U.S. consumer spending and jobs growth has been holding up remarkably well despite higher borrowing costs and persistent inflation. Still, the NABE noted 41% of respondents cited high rates as the most significant risk to the economy. Investors have reset their expectations for rate cuts this year, given the Fed's cautious tone on lowering rates. Earlier in the year, many had expected an aggressive series of rate cuts starting in March, they now see policy easing not beginning until June or July. Markets are bracing for more key data slated for release in the coming days that will shed further insight into the health of the economy and the lingering inflation threat. — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report CNBC Daily Open: SoftBank doubles down on AI amid warnings from 'Big Short' investor Yeo Boon Ping 2 hours ago CNBC Daily Open: Days of declines won't keep AI trade down Yeo Boon Ping CNBC Daily Open: AI is back — it never really went away Yeo Boon Ping Read More"

    "article_text": "« What is a Christian Nationalist? | California Democrat sponsors bill to make insurers report firearm ownership » XPost Print Email February 25, 2024 The taxman cometh...but for whom? By Mark C. Ross Lurking in plain view is a real monster — a monster so dangerous that it puts even imaginary demons to shame. I’m talking about the repeatedly proposed wealth tax . Early in the Biden administration, our (not) esteemed Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, started the ball rolling by trotting out taxing unrealized capital gains. Most of the immediate criticism of this lame idea was that the asset being taxed could lose value subsequent to assessing the tax. More important, however, is that until the asset is actually sold...there are no money proceeds available with which to pay the tax. To be clear, wealth in the form of real property has always been taxed — mostly at the local level. I suspect that even Abraham, ancestor of both Arabs and Jews, paid tax on his real estate — not necessarily all in shekels, but perhaps in goats and sheep as well. Unlike incomes and back-alley (ahem) transactions, real estate can never be hidden away from the tax collector. Inequities are still in the mix. Back in the 1970s, California voters passed Proposition 13 to put constraints on property tax. Prior to that, people’s homes were constantly being re-assessed to reflect market appreciation...even though the owners’ incomes may have remained fairly constant, especially for retirees on fixed incomes. Needless to say, the villains who feast off of taxpayers have since tacked on various “special” assessments, mostly due to extortion on behalf of the teachers’ unions. A pervasive stealth tax is what we call inflation . Politicians are seriously encouraged to cause inflation. Why? Because it lets them buy their re-election by throwing money at targeted constituencies, without using their own money and without obviously increasing taxes, by increasing the money supply instead, through borrowing and running the printing presses. Government, like other debtors, then gets to pay off its creditors with cheaper money. In this age of weaponized misinformation, we are being told that reducing the rate of inflation is a reversal of the damage that has been done. In actuality, inflation is cumulative , since prices don’t go down — they just might start going up more slowly. Deflation or disinflation, where prices actually go down, is a true reversal. Deflation, however, tends to indicate extremely bad economic conditions. The Great Depression of the 1930s was a period of deflation, because consumers had so little money that prices were forced down...where possible. Where not possible, businesses failed, and unemployment soared as a result. This happened again, to a lesser degree, during the Great Recession of 2008, mostly in Europe. Just recently, Dan Bongino reminded us that government tax policy is not really about harvesting revenue in order to pay the bills. It’s about influencing behavior, AKA asserting control. If the federal government needed more funds to pay off, say, solar panel installers, they could just float a bond or order more paper and ink for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. But taxing various aspects of consumption, such as the use of natural gas and gasoline, would likely lead to the reduction of such behavior — since it would become arbitrarily more expensive . Deficit and inflation hawks, however, hold a balanced budget as their holy grail — and they do what they can to stand in the way of such malfeasance. Just to be clear, the U.S. dollar is still legal tender most everywhere. But it’s not because of the quality of the paper on which it is printed, but rather the well established strength and importance of the United States in comparison to the other nations of the world. We possess an immense capital investment in our military assets, which is way beyond the reach of others. This brings to mind the often neglected importance of capital formation when discussing economic policy. During the Great Depression, corporations were compelled to distribute all of their net profits to their shareholders. This was intended to put more money into circulation and thus prop up a sagging standard of living. It, however, also inhibited corporations from investing in capital improvements, unless they used borrowed money, which would increase the cost of such projects. Then came World War 2. Much of the consumer economy was shut down while just about the entire workforce became employed. Since there was little beyond the bare necessities to spend money on, workers were encouraged to take some of their pay in war bonds. When the war ended, the rulers of the masses expected the Depression to start all over again — so they set up a large-scale unemployment insurance program. Things, however, did not go as expected. Not only did the consumer start catching up for lost time, but the accumulation of war bond wealth let them pay for it with cash. New technologies, such as those developed by the Seabees, allowed subdivisions to spring up like weeds. Ozzie and Harriet moved into their suburban palaces and started giving birth to a baby boom. Had capital formation been better understood back in the early 1930s, the money collected by Social Security (the first paycheck deduction) could’ve been invested in mortgages and other secured forms of high-quality debt. Perhaps, by today, the system wouldn’t be trapped into circling the drain of insolvency. Meanwhile, the forces of evil that sort of dominate public policy are still trying to tax wealth and unrealized capital gains. Such villainy is poised to just plain murder capital formation and plunge what was once the world’s greatest economy into third-world misery. Image via PickPik .

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, released late on Saturday, estimates average rural consumer spending rose to 3,773 rupees ($45.54) a month per person for the 12 months through July from 1,430 rupees in the previous survey in 2011-2012, while urban consumer spending rose to 6,459 rupees ($77.95) from 2,630 rupees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not release a 2017-2018 survey due to what it called \"data quality issues\". The decision prompted controversy over whether the administration was concealing economic data. The government denied suggestions it was withholding the data because they showed weak consumption trends. The new survey will form the basis of a review of India's consumer price inflation index. Food spending fell to 46 per cent of monthly consumption for rural consumers from nearly 53pc in 2011-12, while in urban areas it fell to 39pc from 43%. Indians are spending less on cereals, including wheat and rice, and pulses, but more on beverages, refreshments and processed food. Among non-food items, consumers are spending more on conveyance, consumer services and durable goods, like televisions and fridges. The results come before India goes to the polls in an election to be held by May, with Modi seeking a rare third term. While the Indian economy is forecast to grow at a world-beating 7.3pc in the fiscal year that started in April and 7pc next fiscal year, large parts of the population living in rural areas face stagnant incomes and high inflation."

PwC predicts that 2024 will bring in $68.7 billion in revenue from live events, including sports — this is an increase from 2019’s pre-pandemic $66.6 billion. Bank of America surveyed more than 2,000 people aged 18 or older and found that “stadium events” such as star-studded concerts, sports and festivals have shown material local economic impact. While cities gain revenue through ticket sales, they also receive a boost in spending at local restaurants and bars for pre-show and post-event. Foot traffic back to local cities can also be driven again by memories of memorable major events.

The report found that Phoenix-area restaurants and bars saw an increase of more than 25 percent in visitors and Pittsburgh saw a 13 percent increase from residents in 2023. You May Also Like Notably, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee estimated the Super Bowl LVII generated revenues of “$1.3 billion in total economic activity or gross output for Arizona.” Using the 2022 Arizona GDP as a benchmark, the committee also found $726.1 million in total contribution to Arizona’s GDP (approximately 0.15 percent of overall GDP). Brick-and-mortar in-person retail spending amongst local and non-local active households in Phoenix increased over the 2023 Super Bowl weekend. Non-locals spent 7.5 percent year-over-year — with visitors’ total average retail spend totaling $236 over the weekend, a 10 percent increase versus the average February weekend monthly spending. Meanwhile, Swift’s record-breaking “The Eras” tour had on average 54,000 fans attend each concert on the first leg of her American tour. Northwestern University estimates said that consumer spending could generate up to $4.6 billion for the total U.S. economy. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia noted that Swift’s tour helped stimulate travel and tourism in the region and made May the strongest month for hotel revenue in the city since the pandemic. Some other major live events such as the Chicago Marathon and South by Southwest in Austin also drew in large crowds. The survey found a correlation between increased spending on local leisure activities such as museums and theaters. The report’s authors suggest that with a continued rebound in live events and no shortage of demand, consumer spending at live events will continue to impact local communities moving forward. They continue in the report that the past two years have seen spending on services showcase clear evidence of consumer resilience. Furthermore, surges in out-of-home entertainment bolstered spending throughout 2023. The Bureau of Economic Analysis showed spending (after adjustment for inflation) on categories such as entertainment has continued to gain over the average consumer spending throughout 2023. One possible reason for this surge in spending is the “ revenge spending ” phenomenon — consumers are looking to make up for lost time during the pandemic by spending on experiences and entertainment, with live events benefiting the most.

Read Parkson Retail Asia’s FY2023 net profit falls due to weak consumer spending—S$26.3M down 8.5%y-o-y By Mary Alavanza February 25, 2024 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Telegram SINGAPORE: Department store operator Parkson Retail Asia has disclosed a dip in its net profit for the fiscal year 2023, ending on Dec 31, 2023. The reported net profit stands at S$26.3 million, marking an 8.5% year-on-year decline from the previous fiscal year, The Edge Singapore reports. The company’s profit before tax also experienced a downturn, falling to S$37.6 million compared to S$43.7 million recorded in the corresponding period. This drop can be attributed to a lower store count throughout 2023 and a weak consumer spending power compared to figures from the previous year. Earnings per share for the fiscal year 2023 were noted at 3.91 cents per share, decreasing from the 4.27 cents per share reported in the previous fiscal year. In terms of revenue, Parkson Retail Asia witnessed a 4% year-on-year decline, with figures dropping to S$221.5 million from S$231 million in the same period of the preceding year. Similarly, gross sales proceeds experienced a 9.1% year-on-year decrease, falling to S$535.7 million from S$589 million reported in the previous fiscal year. See also NVIDIA's 10-for-1 stock split: Should you or should you not buy into the illusion According to the group, the decrease in total merchandise sales is also primarily due to a lower store count and weakened consumer spending power compared to the corresponding period. However, amidst these declines, there are some notable highlights. The company reported a 5.5% year-on-year increase in rental income, mainly driven by improved sales achieved by tenants. Additionally, food and beverage operations saw a 6.2% year-on-year increase in sales, which Parkson attributes to consumers’ increased willingness to dine out following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The merchandise gross profit margin stood at 27.7% for the fiscal year 2023. As of Dec 31, 2023, Parkson Retail Asia’s department store network comprised 37 stores spanning approximately 409,000 square metres of gross floor area. Notably, the group did not declare dividends, citing its position of “still being in accumulated losses.” / TISG Read also: SIA Group reports net profit of S$658.7 million, climbing by 4.9% y-o-y in 3Q23/24 - Advertisement - Follow Google News Join us on WhatsApp Follow us on Telegram Tags consumer spending net profit Parkson Retail Asia Hot this week Business Sunway rebrands MCL Land as Sunway MCL after acquisition SINGAPORE: Sunway Group has rebranded MCL Land as Sunway...

Delhi Red Fort blast case suspect arrested from J-K Anunay Sood and Rebel Kid Fallout: What caused rift between former best friends? Here's why travel influencer parted ways with Apoorva Mukhija Mukesh Ambani led Reliance Industries and Tata Group are two of the biggest and most valuable conglomerates in India. Both of the giants are involved in a wide range of businesses through their subsidiaries, creating a strong rivalry. It turns out, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani is also competing with Tata Group when it comes to retail real estate in India’s financial capital Mumbai, a new report by Economic Times reveals. For those who are unaware, Zara, Westside, Titan, Starbuck and other Tata Group companies occupy around 25 million square feet of retail space in the country. Although this number is massive, it is nothing when compared to 73 million square feet of retail space that is occupied by Reliance Industries’ subsidiaries. But when it comes to Mumbai, both of the conglomerates have around 3 million square feet of retail space. Mumbai is believed to be the most expensive city in India when it comes to retail space and as per Economic Times’ report, both Reliance Industries and Tata Group are now chasing marquee properties. According to Economic Times, strategy consulting firm Third Eyesight’s founder Devangshu Dutta said that Tata Group has been in the retail segment for quite a long time now, however aggressive expansion of Reliance in the retail space slowed down the pace of their rivals. Experts suggest that there is a huge demand for retail areas in Mumbai and the supply is significantly low. This is the key reason why commercial developers and mall owners face challenges to lease out space to known retail brands. The article also mentioned that commercial real estate consultants Knight Frank India’s Director (Retail) Abhishek Sharma reveals that although these brands are given preference but the dynamics are very complex. He suggests that developers make a balance between demand for these big brands and a diverse tenant mix. To recall, Tata Group entered the retail biz in late 1980’s with Titan Watch and currently the Group has over 4600 stores in the country. On the other hand, Reliance made its entry in the retail sector in 2006 and it has over 18,774 stores throughout the country. Balenciaga, Armani, Hugo Boss, Versace, Michael Kors and others brands are available in India through Reliance Retail. A source told Economic Times that these brands help Reliance to get an early entry in a project and also the desired retail space.

    "article_text": "Companies, which have around 3m sq ft of retail space each in Mumbai, are on the lookout for more MUMBAI: Tata Group and Reliance Industries, two of India's largest conglomerates, are vying for premium retail real estate in Mumbai as they extend their footprints, creating rivalry in a city starved of marquee properties. From Zara and Starbucks to Westside and Titan , the Tata Group occupies nearly 25 million square feet of retail space in India. That is still no match for Reliance Industries that control three times more at 73 million sq ft for more than 100 local and global brands. But in Mumbai, they are evenly matched, having nearly 3 million sq ft of retail space each. That is a quarter of what is considered the most prime retail real estate in the country, and both the retail giants are looking for more. \"In a modern retail environment, most visible locations contain more successful or larger brands. It just so happens that many of those brands are owned by either Reliance or the Tatas,\" said Devangshu Dutta, founder of Third Eyesight, a strategy consulting firm. \"Tatas have been in retail for longer but also slower to scale up compared to Reliance which had this stated ambition of being the most dominant and put the money behind it,\" he said. In a market where demand is much higher than supply, developers and landlords seek to separate the wheat from the chaff, experts said. Ultimately, success in Mumbai's retail real estate scene hinges on a delicate equilibrium between accommodating industry leaders and fostering a vibrant, varied shopping environment, they said. \"In the competitive landscape of retail real estate in Mumbai, commercial developers and mall owners often face the strategic challenge of accommodating prominent retail brands,\" said Abhishek Sharma, director, retail, at commercial real estate consultants Knight Frank India. Live Events \"These big brands, with a significant market share of 40-45% in the Indian retail sector, can easily be termed as industry giants and possess the potential to command 45-50% of space in any mall,\" he said. According to Sharma, there may be perceptions of preferential treatments, but the dynamics are complex, and developers must balance the demand from these major brands with the need for a diverse tenant mix. Tata Group entered retail in the late 1980s, initially by opening Titan watch stores and a decade later by launching department store Westside. So far, it has about 4,600 stores, including brands such as Tanishq, Starbucks, Westside, Zudio, Zara and Croma. While Reliance Retail started in 2006, it overcompensated for its late entry by aggressively opening stores across formats. Reliance has over 18,774 stores across supermarkets, electronics, jewellery, and apparel space. It has also either partnered or acquired over 80 global brands, from Gap and Superdry to Balenciaga and Jimmy Choo. A diverse portfolio of brands across various segments through strategic partnerships and collaborations helps an entity like Reliance to leverage synergies and enhance retail presence, especially in malls, experts said. \"The array of brands with Reliance bouquet allows it to enter early into the project and set the tone and positioning of the mall,\" said a retail leasing expert who requested not to be identified. \"This positively helps the mall to set its own positioning and future tenant mix. It also helps Reliance place their brands in most relevant zones within the mall. This will emerge as a clear differentiator in a city like Mumbai where brands are already jostling for space, which is the costliest in the country,\" the person added.

What you need to know today Nikkei hits record high Japan's Nikkei hit a record high Thursday, while other markets in the region also advanced. The Nikkei 225 spiked 2% to close at 39,098.68, breaching the previous record high of 38,915.87 reached in 1989. Wall Street ended mixed as investors digested the U.S. Federal Reserve's minutes from the January meeting. The S&P 500 gained 0.13%, while the Dow rose 0.13%. But the Nasdaq Composite slid for a third session in a row. AI and chip stocks rally Artificial intelligence and semiconductor chip stocks rallied after Nvidia's quarterly earnings topped estimates . Shares of Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company soared much as 2% in early trade Thursday. Fed's caution Minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed central bank officials expressed caution about lowering interest rates too quickly. Members also emphasized the importance of \"carefully assessing\" incoming data in judging whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2%. China boosts Asia travel Chinese tourists are driving Asia-Pacific's travel boom, with flight demand set to match pre-pandemic levels this year. Travel demand was at about 83% of 2019 levels in December last year, up from just 57% in January, data from the International Air Transport Association showed. [PRO] Where will yields go? Given the uncertain path of U.S. interest rates, the question of how it will affect yields and the stock market has been investors' top focus. Morgan Stanley Investment Management's Jim Caron weighed in on the issue and noted the 10-year Treasury yield is likely to hover between 5% and 5.5%. The bottom line The January minutes made it pretty clear that Fed officials were wary of cutting rates too soon. While most members believed rates were \"likely at their peak,\" there was still uneasiness over the inflation picture. The Fed remained \"highly attentive\" to inflation risks as officials worried whether progress might stall if consumer spending stayed strong. \"As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that momentum in aggregate demand may be stronger than currently assessed, especially in light of surprisingly resilient consumer spending last year,\" the minutes said. Prior to the meeting, traders had been pricing in a high chance of rate cuts beginning as early as March. That hope has since faded, now most expect the first rate cut to come around the middle of year. It's also important to note the meeting was held before the release of the very strong January jobs report and the surprisingly hot consumer and producer price data. \"After those numbers, policymakers will feel vindicated and in even less of a hurry to start easing,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"The nature of turning points, however, is that things can change quickly, and we expect the labor market and inflation data by the time of the May meeting to signal that the Fed needs to ease.\" Investors further worry if the central bank maintains an overly restrictive stance for too long that could derail the economy and lead to a bumpier landing.

    "article_text": "SINGAPORE - Media OutReach Newswire - 22 February 2024 - In a year that has witnessed a reshuffle of emerging market potentials, global consultancy Kearney 's 2023 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) captures the core of a retail landscape at a crossroads. The report, a bi-yearly survey of the most promising retail markets worldwide, underscores the agility and dynamism of retail economies adapting to a reshaped world. Asia Pacific (APAC) nations make a strong showing in global ranking While the obvious candidates – China and India – continue to show an enduring appeal to global investors due to their market size and rapid consumer base growth, a host of other compelling opportunities emerge among their Asia Pacific neighbors. Across the region, APAC countries have displayed remarkable retail growth trajectories, with five APAC nations (India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh) securing positions among the top 15 economies for retailers to prioritize establishing a presence in, based on the GRDI. In China, innovative technologies, experiential retail concepts and a highly digitized retail market continue to drive consumer spending. India's retail sector thrives from a large working population, rapid urbanization, and government initiatives like Digital India, propelling e-commerce and modern retail formats. Looking at emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, for instance, benefits from a growing middle class, expanding infrastructure, and increasing urbanization, fostering a vibrant market for both traditional and modern retail players. Meanwhile, the Philippines and Cambodia demonstrate significant potential for catching up, fueled again by growing middle-class populations and urbanization, as well as favorable government policies attracting foreign investment. Bangladesh, as another notable example of an emerging market experiencing high growth in the retail sector, has been propelled by its strong ready-made garment export industry, attracting major international brands and contributing significantly to its economic growth. Overall, APAC nations serve as pillars of strength in the growing retail sector. The global retail e-commerce sector is projected to show a strong increase in sales, adding an absolute value of $1.4 trillion from 2022 to 2027. Of this growth, 64% is expected to come from emerging markets. APAC nations, in particular, are expected to lead the digital charge due to rapid growth anticipated in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and India. Six key trends emerge in this year's GRDI Globally, as retail growth extends beyond traditional powerhouses, the GRDI report identifies six pivotal trends shaping the retail landscape in emerging markets: Macroeconomic uncertainty remains high, with global economic recovery being gradual and varying across developing economies. Consumers are trading down to less expensive, local, and private label items due to inflationary pressure. eCommerce growth continues unabated, with expectations to grow at twice the rate of brick & mortar retail by 2027. Omnichannel strategies are becoming increasingly critical, with retailers in developing markets investing in omnichannel capabilities. The rise in e-payments and BNPL options is reshaping consumer behavior, with rapid adoption in the APAC and MEA regions. Retail AI and technological innovations are being leveraged to create new, experiential marketing approaches to attract and service consumers. Siddharth Pathak, Asia Pacific Co-Lead, Consumer and Retail Practice, Kearney said: \" This year's GRDI reflects the diverse retail potential among emerging economies in Asia. From established powerhouses like China and India to rising stars such as Indonesia and Vietnam, each nation offers distinct opportunities and challenges for retail investment in the region .\" \" Success in this dynamic market hinges on retailers' ability to adapt, innovate, and strategically navigate the diverse retail landscapes, \" he added. As global retail players strive to navigate a landscape marked by shifts in consumer behavior, technology adoption, and competitive activity, the 2023 GRDI provides an indispensable roadmap for developing sustainable strategic responses and forging winning value propositions.

    "article_text": "Finance · Economy Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan explains why you’d better ‘get used to mortgage rates of six, seven percent’ By Dylan Sloan By Dylan Sloan Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan predicted that the tension between price increases and wage growth would settle by the end of next year. Hollie Adams—Bloomberg/Getty Images American consumers are being pulled in opposite directions right now—by rising prices that threaten consumption on one side, and by low unemployment and rising wages that are fueling growth on the other. But Bank of America predicts that the two forces, with the help of a push from the Fed, will reach equilibrium in 2025. Just what kind, though, not even CEO Brian Moynihan knows. In an interview with CNBC at the Bank of America Securities Financial Services Conference on Wednesday, Moynihan held forth from the sidelines in Miami on how the pre-pandemic economic equilibrium was upset by inflationary shocks to both consumer prices and wages. But it was the timing of these shocks that sent consumer spending trends especially out of whack. “Pricing went up, and wages went up—they just went up in two different cycles,” said Moynihan. “And so the wage growth had occurred early in the post-pandemic cycle … [and] added a lot to consumers’ firepower. The problem is [that] then, the pricing [increases] caught up with it. And now, we’re trying to get that back in equilibrium.” BofA internal research data shows that consumer spending is leveling off, consistent with the disinflation path the Federal Reserve is targeting as it tries to stick a soft landing. Moynihan noted that BofA customers’ spending growth is currently hovering at between 4% and 5%, lower than the 10% figure this time last year. The dance between consumer price inflation and wage increases is a key factor that’s generated instability in spending trends. While real expenditures have risen overall since the pandemic, they decreased slightly last spring and again last fall as prices continued to rise and the Fed refrained from starting to cut rates . But excitement around potential cuts to come later this year and consistently strong jobs numbers have added fuel to the economy. “Yes, prices are up—but wages are up, unemployment’s down, [and] people are earning money,” said Moynihan. “And so, that’s the tug-of-war that’s going on. And they’ve moved the consumer to a different level of spending and capabilities. Will that hold is going to be an interesting question.” Bank of America is predicting the Fed will start cutting rates later this year, the beginning of a path that would resolve the consumer spending tug-of-war by the end of 2025. But the finish line it sees doesn’t involve getting to the Fed’s 2% target rate. Moynihan said his team’s view is that three cuts this year and four cuts next year would bring the economy “back into sort of equilibrium at the end of 2025, with a Fed funds rate in the … 3-to-3.5-ish [percent range.]” That could spell trouble for the economy. A departure from the Fed’s longtime 2% rate target would send shock waves across the real estate, financial services, and lending sectors. But Moynihan said he was confident that consumers would adapt to a higher-base-rate economy, even though that process might take time. “People [will] get used to mortgage rates of six, seven percent,” said Moynihan, talking to his interviewer, Jim Cramer, another commentator old enough to remember the housing market of the 1980s. “Jim, you well know, because you’re about as old as I am, so we’ve been around awhile, that that was what we used to think was a good mortgage rate.” Mortgage rates soared to over 18% in the mid-1980s as the Federal Reserve ratcheted up interest rates in an effort to contain rampant inflation. Mortgage rates aren’t nearly that high today, but the current housing market—defined by a surge in financing costs after years of low to negative growth— shows some similarities , as both BofA Research and other commentators have flagged. Moynihan then weighed in on the emergency monetary policy of cutting interest rates to near-zero after the Global Financial Crisis, which fueled what many commentators called an “ everything bubble ,” and how that suddenly ended amid Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s series of hikes in 2022. “It’s just that for 15 years, we had no real rate structure—you know, rate structure in the United States and around the world. And so people get used to lower rates. It’ll take time to do that. That’ll work its way through the system as rates normalize.” Fortune Brainstorm AI returns to San Francisco Dec. 8–9 to convene the smartest people we know—technologists, entrepreneurs, Fortune Global 500 executives, investors, policymakers, and the brilliant minds in between—to explore and interrogate the most pressing questions about AI at another pivotal moment.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Gary Drenik is a writer covering AI, analytics and innovation. Follow Author Feb 21, 2024, 10:00am EST Feb 21, 2024, 01:18pm EST Share Save Comment Predictive Analytics AdobeStock_275879779 In the ever-evolving landscape of business, the ability to predict future revenues with unparalleled accuracy has long been an elusive goal. Also, in the realm of predictive analytics, researchers continually seek innovative approaches to anticipate consumer behavior (spending). The central question confronting data analysts revolves around the choice between using a model as the foundation for predictions or relying on the intrinsic patterns of the data. This ongoing dilemma underscores the complexity inherent in the pursuit of accurate forecasting. Amidst these challenges, a groundbreaking insight emerges from New Zealand. Shameek Sinha, a researcher and senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, has harnessed a robust dataset spanning two decades of consumer behavior. Employing this wealth of information, the researcher has developed causal models that forecast revenues for various retail categories, achieving an unprecedented 99% accuracy. These insights, available six to eight weeks prior to government-released data, signify a paradigm shift in predictive analytics, offering businesses an extraordinary tool to navigate the uncertainties of the future. According to Sinha, “ I always strive to find efficient approaches to improve predictions of consumers’ expected behavior based on the available data. Naturally, the behavioral model’s calibration becomes critical. I usually prefer building a model for the data instead of trying to fit the data to a model.” Shameek has been exploring a dynamic machine-learning based forecasting algorithm for consumers’ purchase behavior (spending) across categories. Such tools usually rely on large multivariate datasets and complicated mathematical foundations of optimization methods. But he was not entirely satisfied with the available approaches, especially given their computational complexities, such as tspDB ( Agarwal, Alomar and Shah, 2021 ) that integrates prediction functionality on an existing multiple time-series database. This is where he looked for a causal modeling approach that leverages – a. past consumer expenditure patterns; b. expected spending changes; c. perceptions of macroeconomic fluctuations; d. consumers’ psychological states; e. consumers’ shopping trends in terms of the channels, search processes and payment options. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Even though the importance of a causal model is well understood, there was still some skepticism because prediction accuracies for consumer expenditure depend critically on available individual-level data for long time windows. This once again introduced the issue of dealing with computational challenges. Shameek’s concerns were alleviated when he was able to access the Prosper Insights & Analytics dataset which provided survey data that has been collected continuously for a period of over 20 years using a representative sample of the US population. The survey design is scientifically adapted to evolving market scenarios and the questionnaire is extremely thorough in capturing not only consumers’ behavioral tendencies and shopping patterns, but also their psychological traits, perceptions and expected adaptations. Another important feature of the dataset is its aggregate nature where data was available at the level of consumer segments rather than for individual consumers. Though this kind of aggregation might have some repercussions in modeling, he was confident that a segment-level analysis would provide him with the necessary prediction accuracies, while avoiding the large dimensionality problems of individual-level data. As a proof of concept, causal models for the groceries and electronics categories (covering the range of products between essentials and durables) were estimated, with more than 20 years of estimation data. Further, 5 prediction scenarios were considered starting from the short-term (1-month in advance) to medium term (1-year in advance) to the long-term (2.5-year in advance). In each scenario, the data from the beginning of 2002 till the month before the prediction period is used as the estimation sample. Not surprisingly, in-sample predictions were incredibly accurate for all of the scenarios. For example, in the medium-term (1-year in advance), correlation between predicted and observed values of Groceries spending was 0.9968 whereas for Electronics it was 0.9902. However, the out-of-sample prediction performances were even more compelling because it is usually expected that correlations between predicted and observed values will be lower in this case. For example, for long-term (2.5 years in advance) out-of-sample forecasts, these correlation numbers were 0.9399 for Groceries and 0.9678 for Electronics. When we look at the medium-term (1year in advance), these correlation numbers were 0.8504 and 0.8234, respectively. If the prediction window is extended beyond 2.5 years to incorporate a ‘black-swan’ macroeconomic shock, from the beginning of the COVID-19 induced lockdowns (April 2020 onwards), the correlation between out-of-sample predicted and observed values improves further, 0.9767 for Groceries and 0.9869 for Electronics. In fact, when 1-period advance predictions are considered (e.g., predictions for December 2023 based on data available through November 2023), the margins of errors (percentage differences between actual and predicted consumer spending) were as low as 0.16% for Groceries and 1.43% for Electronics. Out-of-Sample Predictions (long-term) for Groceries : Shameek Sinha, University of Auckland Business School Prosper Insights & Analytics Out-of-Sample Predictions (long-term) for Electronics : Shameek Sinha, University of Auckland Business School Prosper Insighta & Analytics As mentioned earlier, traditional predictive analytic models require data for extended time periods, use sophisticated mathematical programming approaches for their learning mechanisms, are usually computationally intensive and above all constrained by the technical knowledge of the data scientists implementing them. Shameek is confident that – “My causal model for predicting consumer spending is easy to understand and interpret and can be used by managers and decision makers with minimum methodological expertise. Even with aggregated data, predictions can be made for any length of time (both in-sample and out-of-sample), for any product category under consideration.” Of course, across the board it is argued that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide new predictive analytic methods as we move into an era of data-driven business decision making. Research from MIT predicts the rise of “data products” as a key trend in 2024. However, one has to remember that AI involves the development of intelligent machines capable of intelligent decision making. Machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics are sub-areas of AI. Whereas ML enables machines to make accurate predictions through self-guided classification (thereby making the computational algorithms prescriptive), predicate analytics thrives on historical patterns to forecast forthcoming outcomes relying on data and statistics. Shameek’s approach in the causal model for consumer expenditure predictions is less reliant on autonomous learning from the data, but more on the model specification’s ability to guide the data in accurately mimicking consumer spending patterns. Behavioral predictive analytics can help companies to forecast, in advance, the behavioral patterns of consumers. Sometimes, these predictions can be made available 4-6 weeks before the official spending data are available from the government. For example, while the Prosper Insights survey data for January (2024) was available mid-January (and hence Shameek had already predicted the Groceries and Electronics consumer spending for January by the 3 rd week), the observed consumer expenditure numbers for these 2 categories will not be released by the US Govt. agencies till the 4 th week of February (2024). The reliability of these forecasts can be established with historical data, by doing both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions of consumer expenditure. So, corporates, investors and anyone who would want to view the future direction of consumer spending, can access these forecasts. This allows managers to become proactive in decision making regarding resource allocation, versus being reactive to an ever-changing market environment. Shameek reiterates that the predictions exercises undertaken for the Groceries and Electronics categories are simply proofs of concept. These analyses can be extended to any retail category like clothing, automobiles, eating out etc. Not only that, but the causal model can also be customized for individual companies in each product category, in order for them to measure their share of wallet vis-à-vis their competitors. Further, the analyses can focus on specific geographic markets that lend the possibility of exploring potential limitations and opportunities that arise from differences in consumer spending across markets. And finally, though the current predictive model is calibrated using aggregated segment level consumer data, it is certainly feasible to apply it with company-level or store-level consumer data that provides a significantly more granular view of consumer expenditure patterns. What’s new and interesting about this research is the incredible accuracy of the predictions. However, what is fascinating to observe is the importance of certain factors that help in providing this level of perfection. Shameek emphasizes that - “I can certainly identify 3 sets of factors – the respondents’ (consumers) own evaluation of their expected spending patterns (measured through the spending score), their perceptions of the macroeconomic environment and what’s in store for the future and the consumers’ current psychological state” Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Wed, Feb 21, 2024 · 05:36 PM JAPAN’S government downgraded its view on the economy in February for the first time in three months on sluggish consumer spending, suggesting a bumpy path out of a recession in the face of slow wage recovery and lacklustre industrial output. The government also slashed its assessment on consumer spending for the first time in two years, saying a pickup seems to be “stalling”, underlining the challenge for the Bank of Japan as it looks to exit its ultra-easy policy this year. The downbeat assessment comes after data last week showed Japan’s economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the fourth quarter on weak domestic demand, losing its position as the world’s third-largest economy to Germany. “The economy is recovering moderately, though it appears to be stalling recently”, the Cabinet Office said in its report on Wednesday (Feb 21). It was the first downgrade since November 2023. The lower assessment on consumer spending was due to a pause in recovery in service spending and a fall in spending on non-durable goods because of factors such as price hikes. The nation’s real wages fell for 21 straight months in December as inflation outpaced wage recovery and continued to weigh on household spending. The suspension of some auto production and shipments prompted the government to cut its view on industrial output for the first time since March 2023. It said while industrial output was expected to pick up “production activity fell recently”. The production stoppage at Toyota Motor’s small-car unit Daihatsu over safety issues have dented the auto output. Toyota also suspended shipments of some models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by affiliate Toyota Industries. Recovery in capital spending also appears to be “stalling”, the report said, maintaining the same view from the previous month. SEE ALSO BOJ’s Ueda keeps pledge to review stimulus when price goal met Firms’ capital spending plans were solid but their investment has not been realised partly due to labour shortage, an official at the Cabinet Office said. The government repeated it needed to pay “full attention” to an impact from the earthquake that killed about 240 in Japan’s Noto peninsula on New Year’s Day.

Not good for stocks: Yields rallied: Stocks fell: Advertisement Not much in data to report. Goldman checks out DXY. USD: Spinning my wheels. Markets priced out another 2024 Fed rate cut this week, but the Dollar barely budged on net. As we highlighted last week, the same can also be said for the data over the last three months; our economists have revised up their already-above-consensus US growth views significantly (and downgraded Europe) but the Dollar is essentially unchanged over that period on both a broad basis and in the DXY. Advertisement What gives? And what might make the Dollar finally ‘give’? We still think the most plausible explanation is that, while US yields have sold off, the rate differential has barely moved because of cross-market spillovers. This presents some upside risk to the Dollar over the medium term relative to our baseline views. Our analysis of EM ‘early movers’ suggests there is scope for more divergence deeper into the policy rate cycle. If the latest data ultimately lead the Fed to choose a slower path of rate cuts than its peers, then the Dollar would likely prove even more resilient than in our baseline, but this analysis suggests that would only materialize somewhat later his year. Advertisement While our economists expect five Fed cuts this year and six each from the ECB and BoE, we still think that would lead the Dollar gradually lower given its starting point and beta to global growth. But that becomes a closer call if the FOMC only delivers the three cuts it wrote down in the December SEP. In addition, the better growth news is not as positive for the Dollar as a hawkish policy shock would be. Advertisement We think this helps explain more muted overall Dollar returns, especially against high-beta and high-yielding currencies. However, we are somewhat less persuaded by the argument that the Dollar is already ‘well-positioned’ or ‘over-owned’. Advertisement Positioning data suggests that speculative investors are still net short (Exhibit 1), which aligns with what we hear from market participants—the strong assumption is still that the Dollar’s decline is a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’. In our view, the Dollar’s high valuation reflects strong capital return prospects, which we still think will prove a hard bar to beat. In many cases, the Dollar has now reached or slightly overshot our near-term forecasts, but the data clearly suggest we are not yet at the point to start to see that slow erosion that we expect. Advertisement We think the risks to our baseline are tilted towards a Dollar that is ‘stronger for longer’, but it will likely take a clearer divergence in policy intentions than we have seen so far to unlock even more Dollar upside, despite the obvious cyclical divergence. I agree, especially concerning Australia. The local consumer economy is deep in recession, and the RBA is rapidly falling behind the easing curve. The prospects for catch-up cuts in Australia are much stronger than in the US, where the consumer is still flourishing: Advertisement That forward rates curves are still more dovish for the Fed than the RBA is ludicrous mispricing. Hence, more AUD weakness is ahead, but not until we clear the backlog of bears."

Mark Kleinman City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 19 February 2024 09:06, UK Why you can trust Sky News A leading shareholder in Currys is demanding that its board slaps an £800m price tag on the electrical goods retailer amid takeover interest from a former backer of Comet, its defunct rival. Sky News has been told by one of the company's largest investors that they believe Currys' board should hold out for at least 75p-a-share from Elliott Advisors, the private equity firm. Shares in Currys will be in sharp focus when trading opens in London on Monday morning after it confirmed a Sky News report over the weekend that it had received an indicative takeover proposal from Elliott . Elliott, the owner of Waterstones, tabled a 62p-a-share offer for Currys on Friday worth about £700m. It was immediately rejected as \"significantly undervaluing\" the company. One major shareholder said the sum-of-the-parts valuation of Currys led them to believe that its board should not engage in discussions with Elliott unless it said it was prepared to offer 75p-a-share \"at a minimum\". A number of City analysts have highlighted the value of the group's \"Care and Repair\" business in the UK and Ireland as well as the recovery in its Nordic operations to set a target price for the stock in excess of 75p. More from Money Unemployment rate jumps to highest level since late 2020 ahead of budget Former Petrofac chief seeks £40m for offshore wind group Venterra Chancellor's own goals have exacerbated budget challenges Currys employs more than 15,000 people in the UK, trading from about 300 stores. In 2021, the company rebranded under its current name, having absorbed shops operating under brands including PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse. It was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London stock market in 1927. Now led by chief executive Alex Baldock, Currys has been grappling with the same inflationary headwinds which have afflicted the rest of the retail sector and wider consumer economy. Last month, it reported a dip in like-for-like sales during the crucial Christmas trading period but was able to announce a modest upgrade to profit forecasts as a result of cost-cutting measures. The company trades in eight countries, including Denmark, Finland and Sweden under the Elkjop brand. In total, it employs 28,000 people and operates more than 800 stores. A chunk of these are in Greece, where it has announced a £175m sale of its operations to the country's Public Power Corporation. Shares in Currys closed on Friday at 47.08p, giving it a market capitalisation of about £525m. The stock has fallen by more than a third in the last 12 months. On Sunday evening, The Telegraph reported that JD.com, the Chinese online shopping giant, could also be interested in exploring a bid for Currys. Currys declined to comment."

    "article_text": "Exclusive Exclusive Waterstones-owner Elliott plots £700m takeover bid for high street giant Currys Elliott Advisors is plotting a bid for the London-listed electrical goods retailer, which employs more than 15,000 people in Britain, Sky News learns. Mark Kleinman City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 17 February 2024 13:01, UK Why you can trust Sky News Elliott Advisors, the owner of Waterstones, is plotting a £700m takeover of Currys, the London-listed electrical goods retailer. Sky News has learnt that Elliott, best-known for its activist sieges against the boards of some of the world's largest companies, is working on a bid for one of Britain's best-known high street names. This weekend, it was unclear whether Elliott had made a formal proposal to the board of Currys, although a conventional takeover premium of about 30% on the company's current share price would value it at about £700m. Currys employs more than 15,000 people in the UK, trading from about 300 stores. In 2021, the company rebranded under its current name, having absorbed shops operating under brands including PC World, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse. It was founded in 1884 by Henry Curry as a bicycle-building business before diversifying into the sale of toys, gramophones and radios when it listed on the London stock market in 1927.

Shares in Currys closed on Friday at 47.08p, giving it a market capitalisation of about £525m. The stock has fallen by more than a third in the last 12 months. A formal bid from Elliott would make the electrical retailer one of the most prominent London-quoted companies to face being delisted in the last year, amid a slew of so-called public-to-privates. Elliott's portfolio includes Waterstones, which is run by the prominent books retailer James Daunt. Last year, it examined offers for Reiss, the fashion retailer, and The Body Shop, which was instead taken over by the financial investor Aurelius and is now in the hands of administrators in the UK. In Britain, it has recruited the City grandee Sir Mike Rake as a senior adviser in an effort to forge more conciliatory ties with the boards of companies it invests in. In recent years, it has built stakes in FTSE-350 companies including BHP, the mining giant, drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, Hammerson, the shopping centre-owner, and Whitbread, the owner of Premier Inn hotels. At most of them, it has either pushed publicly or behind the scenes for strategic or management changes, and has earned a reputation as one of the most aggressive activist funds in the world. Elliott Management, the US-based parent, was founded in the 1970s by Paul Singer with just over $1m under management. It now manages over $55bn, and its London office is run by Mr Singer's son, Gordon. For several years, it was the controlling shareholder of AC Milan, striking a deal to sell the Italian Serie A club in 2022. It retained a minority stake as part of the agreement with RedBird Capital Partners. Currys declined to comment, while Elliott has been contacted for comment."

    "article_text": "Amid the backdrop of technical recessions in both Japan and the UK, attention now switches to the economic trajectory of the United States, the world's largest economy. While Japan's downturn is intricately attributed to its shrinking population, the UK's recession reflects a decline in consumer spending despite population and wage growth. Conversely, the US economy has showed resilience, buoyed by robust consumer spending driven by substantial pandemic stimulus measures. Moreover, the nation's reduced dependence on Russian energy has protected it from the repercussions of geopolitical events such as the invasion of Ukraine. AFP However, recent data unveiling lower-than-expected retail sales in January raises concerns about a possible slowdown in American consumer activity following a record-breaking holiday season. Nonetheless, the labor market remains strong, with unemployment rates consistently below 4% for an extended period. Despite these indicators, the possibility of a recession looms, contingent upon the determination of the Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research , which evaluates economic contractions retroactively. While two consecutive negative quarters of GDP growth do not always indicate a recession, the risk of an economic downturn has heightened since the Federal Reserve started its tightening cycle in March 2022. However, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remains optimistic, highlighting the absence of current recessionary conditions. Nonetheless, unforeseen economic shocks, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, accentuate the inherent unpredictability of economic forecasting. White House economic adviser Lael Brainard also expresses confidence in the US economy's resilience, linking its strength to factors such as robust consumer spending, infrastructure investment, and clean energy initiatives. Brainard's remarks indicate the Biden administration's commitment to sustaining economic growth and supporting both domestic and global economic stability. Looking ahead, economists like Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak of the Boston Consulting Group forecast a slow-growth trajectory for the US economy rather than an outright recession. Nevertheless, potential risks appear, particularly concerning the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. Failure to match with market expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024 could expedite adverse effects on financial markets, most likely catalyzing a recessionary environment.

    "article_text": "Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 Legendary Stock Picker Eric Fry Reveals 7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever in 2025 January retail sales data came in far worse than expected, falling 0.8% from December compared to an expected 0.3% decline. Economists are abuzz with concern that today’s report may prove to be a worrisome omen for the year ahead. Recession fears are back in style after being hushed by strong spending and jobs data for most of 2023. Source: solarseven / Shutterstock.com Fears of a stock market crash are swirling after advance retails sales data came out notably worse than expected in January. Some are concerned that the economy is finally experiencing the interest rate-fueled slowdown that the country has largely avoided this cycle. What do you need to know about today’s troubling spending data? Well, advance retail sales fell 0.8% in January following December’s revised 0.4% gain, per the U.S. Department of Commerce. This is more than double the expected 0.3% decline. Even excluding the lagging auto sector, which has experienced notably high prices recently, sales fell 0.6%. That’s substantially below forecasts for a 0.2% gain. Sales at building materials and gardening stores fell 4.1% in January, while miscellaneous store sales slid 3%. Motor vehicle parts and gas station sales both experienced a 1.7% decline as well, even as oil prices fell during the month. Spending on restaurants and bars actually increased 0.7%, however — one of the few bright spots of the report. Although economists had expected an overall decrease in sales after the red-hot holiday season, the dramatic drop-off experienced last month has raised concerns that consumer spending may experience a brutal slowdown. Indeed, while spending remained relatively solid despite elevated interest rates for most of last year, some believe today’s report is a troubling sign that households may be hurting more than previously estimated. Retail Sales Spark Stock Market Crash Rumors Recession concerns were rampant for much of 2023, a notion that rock-solid consumer spending seemed to refute each and every month. Spending increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter of last year, contributing to a gross domestic product (GDP) increase of 2.5% for 2023. That said, it’s likely too early to start ringing the recession alarm. The labor market remains red-hot, as shown by initial claims for unemployment insurance, which fell by 8,000 in the first full week of February compared to the week prior. Similarly, manufacturing data recently released by the Philadelphia and New York branches of the Federal Reserve came out better-than-projected in February. Investors seem to not be putting too much weight in today’s spending report, either. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed in the green today, up 0.5% and 0.3% respectively. “It’s a weak report, but not a fundamental shift in consumer spending,” Navy Federal Credit Union Corporate Economist Robert Frick told CNBC . “December was high due to holiday shopping, and January saw drops in those spending categories, plus frigid weather plus an unfavorable seasonal adjustment. Consumer spending likely won’t be great this year, but with real wage gains and increasing employment it should be plenty to help keep the economy expanding.” On the date of publication, Shrey Dua did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

DoorDash sinks as weak spending threatens earnings Published: 06:49 16 Feb 2024 EST DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) fell 8% in pre-market trading after it warned 2024 earnings could be impacted by weaker consumer spending. The delivery company said it expected gross order values (GOV), a key metric in the industry, to reach between US$74 billion and US$78 billion, a healthy jump from the near US$66 billion in 2023. However, DoorDash warned investors “that consumer spending in any of our geographies could deteriorate relative to our outlook, which could drive results below our expectations.” Underlying earnings are predicted to reach between US$1.5 billion and US$1.9 billion, an increase on the US$1.19 billion generated in 2023. In the first quarter, the company said underlying earnings would be between US$320 million and US$380 million, compared with analysts' consensus of US$355 million. DoorDash also warned that its exposure to multiple geographies means it could face negative impacts if there are changes in the international operating environment, particularly if it affects currencies. Total orders reached 574 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 23% year-on-year rise and up on the 561.3 million forecast by Wall Street. Revenue lifted by 27% to reach US$2.3 billion, improving on consensus of US$2.25 billion. Underlying profits in the same period jumped by around US$20 million to US$363 million, meaning 2.1% of GOV fed through to the bottom line in the three months to December 31. “In 2024, our focus will not change. We will invest to build tools that solve problems for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, while expanding the scale , breadth, and profit potential of our business. We look forward to the work,” the company said in a trading update. Continue reading"

    "article_text": "Industry 2 min read US retail sales fall sharply in January Retail sales dropped 0.8% last month, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Thursday, also likely weighed down by winter storms. Data for December was revised lower to show sales rising 0.4% instead of 0.6% as previously reported. Reuters Updated On Feb 16, 2024 at 03:22 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Representative image U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in January, pulled down by declines in receipts at auto dealerships and gasoline service stations. Retail sales dropped 0.8% last month, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Thursday, also likely weighed down by winter storms. Data for December was revised lower to show sales rising 0.4% instead of 0.6% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dipping 0.1%. Retail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation. The fall followed a fairly strong performance over the holiday season . December sales are also partially flattered by generous seasonal factors, the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. Advt Unadjusted retail sales typically fall in January. The seasonal factors were less supportive for this January compared to previous years, resulting in the large drop in adjusted sales last month. Economists had cautioned before the release of the data not to read too much into any sharp drop. \"It is hard to know exactly what the 'right' seasonal factor is for a given month but the seasonal factors associated with December 2023 and January 2024 look unusual relative to the ones associated with these months in earlier years,\" said Daniel Silver , an economist at JP Morgan in New York. \"The individual seasonally adjusted changes for these months likely should be discounted when trying to determine the trend for the data.\" Though momentum is likely to slow this year, consumer spending remains healthy, thanks to a resilient labor market and rising household purchasing power as inflation subsides. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended Feb. 10. Claims are bouncing around low levels despite a recent rush of high-profile layoffs, mostly in the technology and media sectors. Economists had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. With the labor market still tight, some of the laid off workers could be landing new jobs easily. Advt Companies are mostly reluctant to layoff workers after struggling to fill jobs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services decreased 0.4% in January. The so-called core retail sales measure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. Core sales for December were revised down to show them rising 0.6% instead of the previously reported 0.8%. Economists are forecasting strong services spending growth in January, which should keep overall consumer spending afloat. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a brisk clip in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 3.3% annualized growth pace. The economy expanded at a 4.9% rate in the July-September quarter.

Meanwhile, the value of Chinese consumer spending overseas recovered to 82 per cent of the 2019 level, according to Ant. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post. Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, France, Australia and Canada were the top destinations for Chinese tourists, based on Alipay spending. In Hong Kong, 90 per cent of merchants in the city now accept the payment app. Alipay’s use as an international payment app has been facilitated by the Alipay+ campaign, in which 8 million merchants in over 70 countries signed up, while new policies in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia that provide visa-free travel for Chinese passport holders also helped promote cross-border spending.

Feb. 15 The reserve of spending strength that helped consumers hold on through the holiday season weakened last month. Year-over-year retail and food service sales growth slowed to 0.6 percent in January — the worst showing in the Census Bureau’s monthly reading of spending since May 2020. Compared with December, the seasonally adjusted growth rate fell by 0.8 percent, far weaker than the 0.2 percent decline economists projected, according to FactSet.

Some blamed the weather for the sales slowdown. Department stores were hit particularly hard with a 6.7 percent decline from a year earlier while apparel and accessories specialty stores fared better with an increase of 0.4 percent. But January also served as something of a warning and has retail watchers now looking for further signs of consumer weakness headed into the year. “During their recent earnings calls, Visa and Mastercard blamed bad weather for disappointing January sales figures,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, in an analysis. “It’s also possible that consumers are hunkering down after a holiday debt hangover. Americans ran up record-high credit card balances during the fourth quarter, and with record-high credit card rates adding insult to injury, it’s practical to spend less — even if that’s not great news for our consumer-driven economy. More people are carrying more debt at higher rates for longer periods of time.” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, also pointed to debt levels — with households adding $143.1 billion to their credit card balances in the fourth quarter — and called out the continuing impact of inflation. “Essentially, the mini retail boom at the end of 2023 was built on shaky foundations that are not carrying forward into this new year,” Saunders said. “While we do not see reason for alarm, the warning signs of a modest slowdown are present. Many of the problems postponed at the back end of last year are now becoming more significant. This does not mean that 2024 will be a disaster, but it does signal a tougher and bumpier year than 2023.” The good news is that measures of consumer confidence have been on the rise and are showing that — even if they pulled back on spending — shoppers are feeling pretty good about their finances.

    "article_text": "February 15, 2024 – 7:53 AM PST WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. retail sales fell by the most in nearly a year in January, but economists cautioned against reading too much into the decline, noting that winter storms as well as technical factors had distorted the data. The larger-than-expected drop in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday also reflected a sharp fall in receipts at services stations because of lower gasoline prices. Consumer spending remains supported by a fairly healthy labor market, which is keeping wage growth elevated. “It was a weak start to the year for consumers shopping at the malls, but the harsh winter weather effect looms large,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. Retail sales dropped 0.8% last month, the biggest drop since February 2023, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said. Data for December was revised lower to show sales rising 0.4% instead of 0.6% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dipping 0.1%. Retail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation. December sales were partially flattered by generous seasonal factors, the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. Advertisement Unadjusted retail sales typically fall in January. The seasonal factors were less supportive for this January compared to previous years, resulting in the large drop in adjusted sales last month. Economists had cautioned before the release of the data not to read too much into any sharp drop. “It is hard to know exactly what the ‘right’ seasonal factor is for a given month but the seasonal factors associated with December 2023 and January 2024 look unusual relative to the ones associated with these months in earlier years,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. “The individual seasonally adjusted changes for these months likely should be discounted when trying to determine the trend for the data.” BROAD WEAKNESS Receipts at motor vehicles and parts dealers plunged 1.7%. Sales at building material and garden equipment outlets tumbled 4.1%, likely because of winter storms that blanketed much of the country in mid-month. Gasoline station receipts dropped 1.7% as gasoline prices declined. Online sales dropped 0.8% after surging 1.4% in December. Sales at electronics and appliance outlets fell 0.4%, while those at clothing stores declined 0.2%. But sales at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 0.7%. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. Furniture stores receipts surged 1.5%. Though momentum is likely to slow this year, consumer spending remains healthy, thanks to a resilient labor market and rising household purchasing power as inflation subsides. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended Feb. 10. Claims are bouncing around low levels despite a recent rush of high-profile layoffs, mostly in the technology and media sectors. Economists had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. Companies are mostly reluctant to layoff workers after struggling to fill jobs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 30,000 to 1.895 million during the week ending Feb. 3, the claims report showed. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services decreased 0.4% in January. The so-called core retail sales measure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. Core sales for December were revised down to show them rising 0.6% instead of the previously reported 0.8%. Economists are forecasting strong services spending growth in January, which should keep overall consumer spending afloat. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a brisk clip in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy’s 3.3% annualized growth pace. The economy expanded at a 4.9% rate in the July-September quarter. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama What do YOU think? Click here to jump to the comments!

    "article_text": "Consumer spending in the United States experienced a sharp downturn in January, raising concerns about the economy's trajectory, according to a report published by the Commerce Department on Thursday. The drop in retail sales, a key indicator of consumer activity, exhibits a possible early warning sign for economic health. AFP The report unveiled that advance retail sales fell by 0.8% in January, following a downwardly revised 0.4% gain in December. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected a more modest decline of 0.3%, attributing it in part to seasonal distortions that may have inflated December's figures. However, the actual pullback exceeded expectations, with sales declining 0.6% even when excluding auto sales. While the report is adjusted for seasonal factors, it does not account for inflation, projecting that spending has fallen behind the pace of price increases. Year-over-year sales only had a minimal increase of just 0.6%. Sales declines were particularly significant in several sectors, including building materials and garden stores (down 4.1%), miscellaneous stores (down 3%), and motor vehicle parts and retailers (down 1.7%). Gas station sales also had a 1.7% decrease as pump prices dropped during the month. However, restaurants and bars reported an increase of 0.7%. The weakness in consumer spending contrasts with the continuing strength in the labor market, as noted by a separate report from the Labor Department . Initial claims for unemployment insurance amounted 212,000 for the week ended Feb. 10, below the estimated 220,000. However, continuing claims increased slightly to just shy of 1.9 million. Despite concerns over consumer spending, there was some positive news in the manufacturing sector. Regional surveys in the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia and New York districts both surpassed expectations for February, indicating growth in the share of companies reporting expansion. The mixed economic data comes amid uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and interest rates. While most Fed officials have indicated that the rate-hiking cycle initiated in March 2022 is likely over, they remain watchful for signs of sustained inflation and economic growth. Futures market pricing suggests that the first rate reduction may occur in June, with the Fed potentially lowering rates three or four times by the end of 2024.

Act. Photo: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie Thu, 15 Feb, 2024 - 12:05 Emer Walsh       Air fryers, disposable vapes, rib-eye steaks and gin are just some of the items that have been added to the updated basket of goods and services used to determine Ireland's inflation rate, with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) updating its item collection for the first time in eight years to reflect changing consumer spending habits. Some other items that have been added to the basket this time around include milk and meat substitutes, smartwatches, spring onions, non-alcoholic beers and wireless headphones, with other items having their long-standing time in the basket come to an end. Amongst these goods and services include landline telephone services, admission costs to nightclubs, swiss rolls, stockbroker fees and digital cameras, which have all been removed from the basket, joining the growing group of axed items which includes DVD players, deep fat fryers, calculators and loose tea leaves. Using the new and updated basket of goods, the CSO recorded Irish annual inflation to be 4.1% in January, down from an annual increase of 4.6% in the 12 months to December 2023. This is only the third time since September 2021 that the annual growth in the CPI has been below 5% while also being the third consecutive month where the inflation rate was lower than 5%. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as unprocessed foods and energy, rose by 5.3% in the same period. The most significant price growth in the past 12 months was seen in recreation and culture, up 9.3%, followed by restaurants and hotels which rose by 7.2%, with statistician, Anthony Dawson noting that recreation price rises reflect a surge in package holiday prices, up by almost 42%. Clothing & Footwear was the only division to show a decrease when compared with January 2023, falling by 1.3%. Overall, consumer prices fell by 1.3% in the month between December 2023 and January 2024, with alcoholic beverages and tobacco the only division to rise on a monthly basis, increasing by 2.4%. \"The items in the national basket of goods and services have also been updated as have the weights applied to each item,\" Mr Dawson explained, adding that today’s release \"uses the new baseline period of December 2023=100, as will all CPI releases until the next rebase.\" The CSO's list of around 600 products in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is rebased every five years but was postponed due to the covid pandemic. The ‘weights’ or importance of different items in the basket is updated yearly. The CPI differs slightly from the EU’s measure of inflation, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which is not changing. x Unlimited access. Half the price.

    "article_text": "Save Story Save this story Save Story Save this story We’re all familiar with doom scrolling, but what about doom spending? It’s a phenomenon that’s afflicting millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are, unsurprisingly, overwhelmed by the multiple world crises that we’re currently facing. In many ways, it’s similar to the more familiar concept of retail therapy – although the fears that we’re trying to quell are arguably of a much greater scale than in the past. “When we buy something, our brain releases feel-good hormones like dopamine and endorphins,” Iona Bain, founder of Young(ish) Money and author of Own It! , tells Vogue . “Shopping has always been an easy, low effort way to self soothe, and our consumer economy has long been predicated on making us believe new purchases will lift our spirits and solve our problems.” Why is doom spending on the rise? Nowadays, though, the rise of smartphones and social media, along with buy now, pay later schemes, makes it an even more dangerous habit to get into – particularly considering that 43 per cent of millennials and 35 per cent of Gen Z are now doom spending, according to a survey by Credit Karma . “Young people have always been susceptible to overspending as they struggle with peer pressure and identity formation, [but] they are now more vulnerable to commercial forces than ever because of the dire economic situation they find themselves in,” Bain explains. “All too often I’ve seen young people get into debt that blights their credit score, weighs them down mentally and stops them from living full lives.” Buying new clothes is perhaps one of the most common ways that young people are doom spending. But if we’re trying to numb ourselves from fears like the looming climate crisis, isn’t it counterintuitive to continue purchasing new things? After all, isn’t that what got us here in the first place? It’s a paradox explored by sustainability strategist Alec Leach in his aptly titled book, The World Is On Fire But We’re Still Buying Shoes . “Fashion is an optimistic undertaking,” he writes. “It gives us the chance to envision new futures for ourselves, places where our current fears and burdens melt away.” Read More How Many Clothes Should We Own, Exactly? By Emily Chan Considering that saving to buy a house feels so out of reach for so many millennials and Gen Z-ers, investing in luxury items (clearly still a privilege) is also a way of taking back a sense of control. “Doom spending [is] a display of what we call the passive to active flip, with the passive being the many things we may want to change in the world but feel we cannot, and the active being the buying of things,” Dr Dion Terrelonge, otherwise known as The Fashion Psychologist , explains. Of course, doom spending is never going to solve our problems, which is why so many people get trapped in an unhealthy cycle of constantly buying in search of instant gratification. “If buying things truly made us whole, then we’d have stopped by now,” Leach says. “But because consumerism doesn’t really satisfy our needs, we go round and round, chasing trends… sleepwalking into regret purchases again and again.” How to stop doom spending Keep a spending diary Working out why you’re doom spending is crucial for kicking the habit. “You could use an ABC (Antecedent, Behaviour, and Consequence) chart where each time you doom spend, you note down how you felt or what was going on for you beforehand,” Terrelonge advises. “A – what you then did, which is likely shop; B – what happened or how you felt after; and C – examining your responses and seeing if you can identify any patterns in behaviour. Once you do this, you’ll be better positioned to change the behaviour.” Set boundaries with your phone Given that we’re constantly bombarded with shiny new things on social media, reassessing your relationship with your phone can help, too. “Observe which apps, influencers and activities are draining you and pushing you towards spending,” Bain advises. “I don’t have any shopping apps on my phone and I don’t even have social media apps on my phone. If that’s a bridge too far for you, take those commercial influences off your feed and feed yourself with inspirational, mind-expanding content instead.” Read More 8 Simple Ways To Feel More Positive By Hannah Coates Have a list of “decoy activities” It’s easy to be tempted by impulse purchases when you’re feeling down – which is why it’s useful to have a list of (free) activities that can make you feel better instead. “Go for a walk or run, have a bath, phone a friend, do some yoga, write – do something that will take you out of the spending zone,” Bain says. “You might also want to identify your top five priorities in your life – for me, outside work, it’s healthy eating, exercise, rest, connection and creativity. I try to make sure all five are factored into my daily life, and that helps to take me away from mindless spending.” Start saving little by little While saving might seem pointless given the current state of the economy, even setting a little aside when possible can help. “Get informed about what your financial options are,” urges Bain. “If you can start saving even a little in your early twenties, over a decade, it will add up.” The money expert also advises using a credit card for a “limited number of fixed expenses and paying those off in full, ideally by direct debit from your bank account” in order to build your credit score for the future. Engage in altruistic behaviour Instead of doom spending, try investing in your community instead. “Doing things that help others will not only benefit those others, but also help get you out of your own head and generate pleasure in the form of eudaimonic happiness, which is known as the do-good-factor, rather than from spending,” Terrelonge says. “It will also provide an opportunity to see the positive impact you can have on the world and that despite the news we are not powerless to effect change.”"

The firm moved both retailers to its tactical underperform list on Wednesday, saying it expects volatility in the stock in the near term as the companies are likely comment on ongoing inflationary pressures and headwinds to consumer spending. Evercore's cautiousness comes a day after fresh inflation data showed prices ticked up more than expected in January. Housing costs remain high, the analyst said, which could hurt consumer spending. Walmart also could be impacted by changes in SNAP food assistance benefits and tax refunds. In addition, both Target's and Walmart's outlook for the year could be lower due to the U.S. presidental election, which could be a distraction, and a shorter holiday season. Shares of Walmart have ticked up roughly 7% from the start of the year, while Target stock has climbed more than 2%. \"We believe Walmart is likely to meet Street estimates for F4Q, but see potential near term downside of around mid single digits for the stock due to what we believe is likely to be conservative guide/tone on the consumer,\" analyst Greg Melich said. \"With short interest just 2% and most investors positively biased toward the name, we see risk for a mild near term correction for the stock.\" Melich noted that Walmart remains on Evercore's top pick list despite the potential near-term headwinds around quarterly results on Feb. 20. He highlighted the company's ability to boost store traffic, gain market share and grow profit margins. Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate Walmart will earn $1.64 per share on revenue of $170.8 billion. For Target, analysts are expecting earnings of $2.39 per share on revenue of $31.8 billion. \"We see potential near-term downside of mid to high single digits for TGT to $130-$135 (14.5-15x ~$9 CY24 EPS) due to what we believe is likely to be a conservative guide/mixed tone on the consumer,\" Melich said. He still expects Target to at least meet expectations for the quarter on March 5. Evercore maintains an in line rating on Target stock with a $156 per share price target, or about 7% upside.

    "article_text": "Small Business Choosing A Career Path With Creative Integrity: Three Questions To Ask By Elke Sudin , Former Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Feb 14, 2024, 07:00am EST Share Save Founder and CEO of Drawing Booth , an international live event digital sketch company | Fashion designer at Elke NYC, appearing in NYFW 2024. getty In a world of artificial intelligence and what I see as the \"new creative class,\" DIY-influenced, direct-to-consumer economy, more people are bypassing the traditional education institutions offer and going straight into their careers. A survey by Morning Consult on behalf of Samsung Solve for Tomorrow revealed that half of Gen-Zers want to be entrepreneurs. For creatives, this might mean offering a product or service centered around what they want creatively and then growing an audience and refining their craft as they gain more experience. This attitude seems to separate traditionalists from younger entrepreneurs, but I believe it is not so different from attending an old-fashioned trade school. In the 1950s, my father attended a two-year trade school for sales, and today, he still sells fasteners (nuts, bolts and screws) almost door to door with phone calls and relationships built over time. He works his own hours and has been working from home since before it was trending. There are pros and cons to taking a more traditional route of formal education and working for a company vs. jumping into entrepreneurship. For creatives, this can make it challenging to identify their right path or true calling and how they can align their skills and interests with a place in the market. I have found that to participate in the creative economy, many people think they need to create a product, even if they don't necessarily solve a specific need or bring additional value to what is already out there. But this isn't the only path available, and creatives should consider that it is possible to apply a creative take on a pre-existing product or service as well. As the founder of a digital sketch company, here are a few strategies I recommend for young professionals to develop careers with creative integrity and purposeful impact, no matter what path they choose. Considerations For Entrepreneurship From my perspective, here are what seem to be someone's options for starting a business in today's climate. • Sell your skillset: In other words, you teach, but you also run the school. • Entertain others: You might run your own TV network or magazine, for example, and need to look for advertisers. • Create a product: Design something people will want or convince them they want. • Offer a service: You help others do what they do best. These different offering styles can help you understand how potential customers will experience your specialty and whether you even want to take one of these paths. There are many different skills needed to take one idea to market. Asking the right questions can help you figure out what path is going to make the most sense for not only your particular skills but also your lifestyle and life goals. Choosing A Career Path Here are three questions to ask yourself on your creative career journey. 1. Do you want to spend more time in the creative act, or do you want to get credit for your work? Consider your driving factors when choosing a path. If you work for a small or larger company, you might be able to spend more time on your specialty than other administrative tasks, but you might not receive personal credit for your work. It's like working on a film that wins an Oscar: You didn't win it, but the film did. If you are looking for credit so that your genius is attributed to you, and it is your intellectual property, even if you employ others to fulfill your vision, entrepreneurship might be a path worth considering. 2. Are you trying to make life easier for people with your invention, or are you enamored by aesthetics and want to create and see beauty? A functional product that leaves the world a better place has direct value add. But if you are a creative who wants to marvel at the majesty of the creative process, you may consider finding a role that allows you to perform that particular task rather than becoming the head of your own operation. Entrepreneurship means a lot of project management. The sheer amount of time spent documenting rather than participating in the creativity is something that needs to be considered when deciding the career path that's right for you. If you are like many creatives who value process over product, then you might prefer being the quiet deliverer of a product and helping others bring their visions to life. You have less of your own voice working for a company, but you will be needed by others and can receive a consistent revenue stream. 3. How many dimensions of value can you bring with your unique skill set and personality? As a creative, you can bring your creativity into any business by adding influences from other industries, as well as being cognizant of the human experience and your place in society as a whole. Your lived experience, including the challenges you've overcome, plays a vital role in the innovation you offer. When choosing a career path as a creative, don't think you have to have all the answers or bring something completely new to the market to have creative integrity. I believe that's a pitfall of today's culture—a sense that you alone are responsible for coming up with an offering. You can also make a big impact by assisting in someone else's product or purpose. In other words, you can essentially assist someone else's vision and help it come to life. These are strategies meant to enhance what you have to offer the world. Balance comes in finding function and aesthetics. When it comes down to it, whether or not you go into business for yourself, you need a deep understanding of the history and lived experience of your industry. Without this, I believe you'll be limited to having a childlike understanding of your art. It will live on the surface unless you use your talents to solve deep problems for people. Even then, you must ask yourself, what are the most significant problems facing society, and do you have the unique skill set to help solve them?

Published on February 5, 2024, by Fiserv, Inc., a leading provider of payments and financial services technology, the report offers a comprehensive overview of the performance of small businesses at national, state, and industry levels, presenting an optimistic outlook for the year ahead. The Fiserv Small Business Index stood firm at 138, indicating a consistent level of consumer spending. This stability is mirrored in the modest month-over-month sales growth of +0.1% and a more notable year-over-year increase of +1.7%. Although this growth has slightly decelerated from the +2.6% uptick observed in December 2023, the figures represent a healthy demand for consumer goods and services. Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv, highlighted the adaptability of small businesses amidst challenging weather conditions across the country, noting, “Small businesses maintained steady sales in January.” The Retail sector, in particular, showcased its robustness, outperforming the overall small business category with growth fueled by consumer expenditures on building materials, health and personal care, and general merchandise. Retail Sector Shines with Positive Growth The Retail sector’s performance is a testament to the enduring consumer demand post-holiday season, with the January index for Retail climbing to 143. This represents a 1-point increase from December, equating to +0.7% month-over-month sales growth and a +1.9% year-over-year improvement. Notably, foot traffic in retail saw a significant rise of +4.2% year-over-year, underscoring the continued consumer interest in goods expansion beyond the festive period. However, not all sectors fared equally. The Food Services and Drinking Places subsector experienced a downturn, with the January index dropping to 122, a 5-point decline from December. This sector saw month-over-month sales decrease by -4.1% and a year-over-year fall of -1.9%, reflecting a post-holiday adjustment in consumer spending patterns. Diverse Sector Performance Indicates Varied Consumer Priorities The Specialty Trade Contractors and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services subsectors presented mixed outcomes. The former witnessed a slight month-over-month sales dip of -0.5%, settling at a January index of 145, while the latter enjoyed a robust year-over-year sales growth of +6.0%, with a January index of 148. Fiserv Small Business Index: A Tool for Insight The Fiserv Small Business Index distinguishes itself through its reliance on direct consumer spending activity, utilizing data from approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses. This approach, grounded in transactional data rather than surveys, offers a tangible measure of consumer spending and customer traffic, providing valuable insights into the small business ecosystem. For small business owners, the insights from the Fiserv Small Business Index offer a roadmap for navigating the evolving market landscape. The data underscores the importance of flexibility and understanding consumer trends, which are crucial for adapting strategies and seizing opportunities in a competitive environment. As we move further into 2024, small businesses that align with consumer preferences and market dynamics will likely continue to experience growth and success, reinforcing the critical role they play in the broader economy.

Kering's forward price-to-earnings ratio suggests cautious optimism among investors. Gucci's recurring operating margin for the full year was 33.1%, indicating ongoing efforts to stabilize and revitalize the brand. Kering , the parent company of luxury label Gucci, is gearing up to breathe new life into its star brand this year, with the upcoming debut of designs by new creative director Sabato de Sarno . The move comes as Gucci has faced challenges in recent years, lagging behind competitors and experiencing a decline in consumer spending. This prompted a leadership reshuffle, with former chief executive Marco Bizzarri stepping down. Chief Executive Francois Henri Pinault outlined the company's strategy to analysts, emphasizing a commitment to investing in its brands, even if it means sacrificing short-term margins. Pinault stated, \"This will cause some pressure on our result in the short term, and I am absolutely determined to make this short-term pain pay off in the long term.\" The investment plan includes a significant increase in advertising and promotional spend, expected to exceed 8% of sales, particularly to support de Sarno's inaugural designs. Analysts have generally supported Pinault's focus on long-term growth, acknowledging the necessity of sacrificing margins in the short term for reinvention. Following a period of robust sales growth in the luxury fashion sector post-pandemic, consumer spending has moderated, especially among younger and less affluent demographics susceptible to rising inflation. In response, Kering, like other luxury conglomerates, is shifting its focus towards high-end products targeted at discerning clientele rather than aspirational consumers. Despite challenges, Kering reported a 4% decline in sales to 4.97 billion euros ($5.36 billion) in the final quarter of the year, consistent with expectations. Analysts noted a stabilization in recent sales declines, expressing relief that Gucci's performance was not worse than anticipated. Shares in Kering rose by 4.3% in mid-morning trading in Paris, outperforming its peers, including Hermes and LVMH. Kering's forward price-to-earnings ratio, based on projected earnings, lags behind that of LVMH and Hermes but suggests cautious optimism among investors. Nehha Pendse: I love experimenting with all types of skincare products Gucci's performance showed signs of improvement in the fourth quarter, with a 4% year-on-year decline compared to a 7% drop in the previous quarter. The label's recurring operating margin for the full year was 33.1%, slightly lower than the first half's 35.3%, indicating ongoing efforts to stabilize and revitalize the brand.

A housing scheme may hold clues Pragya Srivastava 2 min read 11 Feb 2024, 10:49 pm IST The government will launch a scheme to help deserving sections of the middle class “living in rented houses, or slums, or chawls and unauthorized colonies” to buy or build their own homes. Summary Analysis based on a decade-old data shows many who loosely describe themselves as middle-class may actually fall in the top 1-5% of the population Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a housing scheme for the middle class as part of a ‘housing for all’ policy. This has sparked off a hunt for counting the middle class. Mint explains what this announcement means and who the middle class are in India: What is this middle class housing scheme? After enabling access to affordable housing for low- and moderate-income Indians under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the budget for FY25 proposed housing for the middle class. The government will launch a scheme to help deserving sections of the middle class “living in rented houses, or slums, or chawls and unauthorized colonies\" to buy or build their own homes. While this is a part of the ‘housing for all’ policy, it is not an extension of PMAY. It’s a new scheme, for which the government will specify the income levels, location and types of accommodation to identify beneficiaries. Who are the middle class in India? In the West the term denotes the well-heeled. But there’s no Indian definition. Several surveys have tried to identify the income levels to define this group. According to a 2022 report by People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (Price), households earning between ₹ 5-30 lakh annually are middle class. Analysis based on a decade-old data shows many who loosely describe themselves as middle-class may actually fall in the top 1-5% of the population, meaning that households truly in the “middle\" have meagre earnings. The extent can only be known once updated consumer expenditure and Census data is in. How to define the middle class? Scholars globally have tried to identify the middle class in different ways but nothing universal has emerged yet. A Brookings report says the basis of the definition falls into one of three broad categories: cash, which relates to income; credentials, which include educational achievements and qualifications; and culture, which includes attitudes and mindsets. Does tax returns data throw some light? In recent years, income tax collections have improved, with more people filing returns. According to data released last year, the highest number of tax returns were filed in the income range of ₹ 5.5-9 lakh a year. Until 2018-19, 33% of income tax filers were in up to ₹ 5 lakh bracket, 29% in the ₹ 5-10 lakh bracket, and 38% above ₹ 10 lakh. According to a 2023 SBI study, the weighted mean income among tax filers has increased from ₹ 2.3 lakh in assessment year 2011-12 to ₹ 13 lakh now. How will the scheme help? While the results of the new consumer expenditure survey and the Census are unlikely soon, beneficiaries of the scheme based on income levels, location and accommodation can form the basis for categorizing the middle class in the meantime. are unlikely for a couple of more years, beneficiaries of the scheme based on income levels, location and accommodation can form the basis for categorizing the middle class in the meantime.

    "article_text": "Business Japan's McDonald's Delivers Record Sales TOKYO , Feb 09 ( News On Japan ) - Japan McDonald's Holdings announced on February 8th that its annual sales reached a record 777.7 billion yen last year, marking the highest in the company's history. The final profit also saw a significant increase, rising by 26.2% to 25.1 billion yen compared to the previous year. Despite implementing five rounds of price increases over two years, including selective hikes in metropolitan stores, the company has achieved remarkable results, seemingly unaffected by the price adjustments. Tamotsu Hiiro, President of Japan McDonald's Holdings, expressed confidence in customer understanding of the pricing strategy. \"We believe our customers generally understand our position. Our future pricing policy will continue to carefully consider the overall inflation and rising labor costs, making adjustments as necessary,\" said Hiiro. Experts attribute the success to increased customer spending per visit due to the price hikes. Hiromasa Watanabe, a consumer economy analyst, noted, \"In 2023, the per-customer value increased by 8.5%, which is the basis of the high revenue and profit. However, the number of customers decreased by 1.5%. The key going forward will be how to continue raising prices while creating a menu that retains customer support.\" This analysis underscores the delicate balance between adjusting prices and maintaining customer loyalty, a strategy that has so far yielded impressive results for Japan McDonald's Holdings.

    "article_text": "Business of Brands 2 min read Unilever takes sales hit in Indonesia over anti-Israel boycotts Unilever's fourth-quarter sales in Southeast Asia, specifically in Indonesia, were impacted by boycotts in response to the Middle East geopolitical situation. The company's Ben & Jerry's brand called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and stopped sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem. In 2022, Unilever sold its interest in Ben & Jerry's operations in Israel. Reuters Updated On Feb 9, 2024 at 11:40 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Britain's Unilever said on Thursday that fourth-quarter sales growth in Southeast Asia had been hurt by shoppers in Indonesia boycotting brands of multinational companies \"in response to the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\" The maker of Dove soap, Knorr stock cubes and Ben & Jerry's ice cream is among several Western brands that have seen protests and boycott campaigns against them - particularly in countries with large Muslim populations - over their perceived pro-Israeli stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict. McDonald's this week posted its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years, partly due to the conflict in the Middle East. The company said the war had \"meaningfully impacted\" performance in some overseas markets. Advt In Indonesia , home to more than 200 million Muslims, Unilever 's fourth-quarter sales declined by double-digits, the company said, adding that it has \"since seen some improvement to customer and consumer uptake in January\". Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher said the company was otherwise \"not seeing material impacts to our supply chain\" as a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict and related attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. \"There are some small interruptions obviously for some key ingredients and on shipping and so forth. So there's some delay but I wouldn't call it material,\" Schumacher said on a call with journalists. \"We are working with big forwarders and carriers and I'm aware of them taking longer routes,\" he added, saying that much of Unilever's products and materials are sourced locally and regionally to where they're sold. Unilever's Ben & Jerry's board last month called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The brand announced in July 2021 that it would stop sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem, saying selling ice cream in the occupied Palestinian territories was \"inconsistent with our values\". In 2022, Unilever sold its interest in Ben & Jerry's operations in Israel.

KFC, Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands hurt by choppy spends KFC-parent Yum Brands sales hit by cautious consumer spending. Yum Brands' quarterly sales missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, with weaker growth for all three of its top chains, as fewer customers ordered at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut amid a choppy spending environment in the United States. With their budgets stretched, Americans - particularly low-income households that frequent fast-food chains like KFC and McDonald's - have been increasingly cutting costs, including by switching to home-cooked meals.

    "article_text": "Business Japan's McDonald's Delivers Record Sales TOKYO , Feb 09 ( News On Japan ) - Japan McDonald's Holdings announced on February 8th that its annual sales reached a record 777.7 billion yen last year, marking the highest in the company's history. The final profit also saw a significant increase, rising by 26.2% to 25.1 billion yen compared to the previous year. Despite implementing five rounds of price increases over two years, including selective hikes in metropolitan stores, the company has achieved remarkable results, seemingly unaffected by the price adjustments. Tamotsu Hiiro, President of Japan McDonald's Holdings, expressed confidence in customer understanding of the pricing strategy. \"We believe our customers generally understand our position. Our future pricing policy will continue to carefully consider the overall inflation and rising labor costs, making adjustments as necessary,\" said Hiiro. Experts attribute the success to increased customer spending per visit due to the price hikes. Hiromasa Watanabe, a consumer economy analyst, noted, \"In 2023, the per-customer value increased by 8.5%, which is the basis of the high revenue and profit. However, the number of customers decreased by 1.5%. The key going forward will be how to continue raising prices while creating a menu that retains customer support.\" This analysis underscores the delicate balance between adjusting prices and maintaining customer loyalty, a strategy that has so far yielded impressive results for Japan McDonald's Holdings.

What's Next for Japan Stocls After AI High The Nikkei Average has surged past 50,000, yet many individual investors say their portfolios have barely moved, underscoring how narrowly led the rally has become as the NT ratio—Nikkei divided by TOPIX—climbs to a record, reflecting outsized strength in a handful of high-priced technology names while a broad swath of stocks lags behind, and even within the Nikkei 225 the gap between the strongest and weakest deciles over the past six months has widened to extreme levels, pushing the headline index higher while leaving many constituents flat.

    "article_text": "'YOLO spenders' have created a 'super-duper' credit bubble in the US economy, top economist David Rosenberg says Aruni Soni February 8, 2024 2 min read The US has a \"super-duper\" credit bubble on its hands as \"YOLO spenders\" take on massive debt, David Rosenberg said. US household savings are quite low at 3.7%, while consumer spending bulged by $208 billion last quarter, financed with debt. \"As far as consumer credit is concerned, the default cycle isn't merely looming. It's arrived.\" Today's consumers — or rather, \" YOLO spenders \" — have taken on a massive amount of debt, top economist David Rosenberg said. And it's created a big bubble in a pocket of the US economy. \"There is no acknowledgment today that, yet again, we have a super-duper credit bubble on our hands,\" he wrote in a note on Thursday. \"It isn't just about fiscal recklessness at the government level; the dilemma is that the consumer commands a dominant 70% share of the economy.\" US households today have a savings rate of just 3.7% — way below the historical levels of 9%. Meanwhile, consumer spending exploded by $208 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. A recent New York Fed report showed that households added a whopping $212 billion to their debt load over that same time period. That means over 100% of that increase in consumer spending was financed with debt, Rosenberg said. And if consumers are driving 70% of the US economy, it could mean big trouble if they get crushed by the weight of that debt. The thing is, US consumers don't look like they are buckling. Consumer balance sheets seem to be in \"great shape,\" Rosenberg explained. But he also warned that the cracks are beginning to show. Credit card delinquency rates are on the rise, with 30-day default rates rising to 8.5% compared to 5.9% a year ago. More \"serious\" 90-day defaults are also rising, and delinquency rates for auto loans and mortgage loans have increased as of late. \"One in every twelve holders of credit cards is missing their payments,\" Rosenberg said, adding that the last time this happened was in 2011 when US unemployment was at 9%. Today, it's near historic lows of 3.7%. \"As far as consumer credit is concerned, the default cycle isn't merely looming,\" Rosenberg said. \"It's arrived.\" Read the original article on Business Insider View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

Department of Commerce trade data released on Wednesday showed imports from Mexico rose modestly in 2023, to $476 billion, while Chinese imports slumped 20 percent on the year, to $427 billion. Imports from Canada , America's third-biggest trade partner, were close behind China, totaling $421 billion for the year. After years of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, simmering trade disputes, and political tensions between DC and Beijing , American consumers and businesses appear to be increasingly turning away from China to alternative trading partners. It's a reversal of a 20-year trend that had seen China firmly ensconced as the largest source of US imports, producing everything from clothes and toys to electronics for American consumers. Annual US imports of goods from Mexico surpassed those from China last year for the first time in two decades, according to newly released federal data Post-pandemic shifts in US consumer spending — away from goods such as furniture and electronics, in favor of services such as travel and entertainment — have also been a factor in blunting demand for Chinese imports. The decline in Chinese imports also comes as Washington has been pursuing an approach it calls 'friendshoring.' The move involves diversifying US supply chains across allies and partners, amid heightened concern about competition with China and national security tensions between the world's two largest economies. For all of the 80s and 90s, Canada was the top source of US goods imports by a wide margin, followed by Mexico and then China. China first overtook Mexico for second place in 2003, and then dueled with Canada for the top spot starting in 2007, pulling away into a clear lead following the Great Recession. The US trade deficit with China has been a political focus during the trade war between both countries under former president Donald Trump's administration, which imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. The Biden administration has generally maintained the trade levies, though with a dialed-down rhetoric. 'Our goods trade deficit with China is at a 13-year low—lower than any year under the prior administration—as manufacturing returns to America and we secure our supply chains,' White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'President Biden’s Buy America policies and historic legislation to invest in our infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing are working and the US economy is booming,' he said. Last year, the overall US goods and services trade deficit, which is defined as exports minus imports, shrank considerably to $773.4 billion, from $951.2 billion in 2022. Imports dropped, due partly to a pullback in consumer spending on big-ticket items amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Containers are seen at the Port of Long Beach in a file photo. Last year, the overall US goods and services trade deficit, which is defined as exports minus imports, shrank considerably But US exports also increased by $35 billion, or 1.2 percent, thanks to increases in the travel, financial services, transport and information sectors. In 2022, the country saw the biggest deficit in government data dating back to 1960. Surprisingly resilient consumption last year has helped to support the US economy, but analysts expect higher interest rates to slow consumer spending and add pressure on imports. In December, the deficit grew slightly from November to $62.2 billion, the new data showed. This was up from November's revised $61.9 billion level. With imports and exports both growing in the final month last year, analysts considered the report an encouraging sign for global trade. 'The trade deficit in real terms contributed positively to growth in the quarter,' said Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics. He added that 'exports continue to fare well and will benefit from a weaker dollar as the cost of US goods becomes relatively cheaper abroad,' expecting net trade to be a positive contributor to GDP growth in early 2024 too. But Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note that 'the outlook for trade flows going forward is likely one of moderation.' This is due to 'expectations of slower demand and growth going forward, both domestically and abroad,' she said.

    "article_text": "Investors looking for a strong rate of return may be interested in a high-performing neighbourhood retail scheme being brought to the market by CBRE, guiding in excess of €3.7 million. The retail unit at the popular Millers Glen residential development in Swords , north county Dublin, currently produces a net initial yield of about 7.3 per cent, after standard purchasers’ costs of 9.96 per cent. This equates to a capital value of €212 per sq ft. The recently built scheme boasts a prominent location on the Glen Ellan Road, and comprises of four ground-floor retail units and a creche unit extending to about 1,621sq m (17,448sq ft). Anchored by Centra convenience store (Musgraves), along with McCartan’s Pharmacy, McCartan’s Medical Centre and Just Like Home Childcare, the centre is generating a contracted rent roll of €297,150 a year, with an overall WAULT to break of about 7½ years. The neighbourhood shopping centre is the dominant retail scheme in the catchment area, and is demonstrating strong trading and occupancy levels, with near 100 per cent occupancy. This can be achieved immediately, through successfully leasing the final remaining unit at Millers Glen, thus offering investors strong reversionary potential.

Retail centres have out-performed all other retail sub-sectors in recent years, according to CBRE, who say that the Irish retail subsector is increasingly sought after by domestic and international investors, as it is considered stable and a good prospect in the current interest environment."

And then there’s been obsolescence, too, which makes the supply shrink as well. Related Articles Shoe Features Manebí Presses on Middle East Expansion, Category Extensions Fragrance Baobab Collection Eyes U.S. for Expansion “The importance of brick-and-mortar has never been higher,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, e-commerce is critically important, but all of this stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, et., it all continues to be a challenge. If you’ve looked at the [pure online] marketplaces, they run into problems, so they really need to be connected to a brick-and-mortar for survivability. So all of those things are pointing to a positive picture.” You May Also Like Simon was going over fourth-quarter results and also taking something of a victory lap after the company marked 30 years as a public company in December, having paid, as he noted, $42 billion of dividends along the way. The company started with 115 properties when it went public and over the years bought 300, developed over 50 and sold about 250. That impulse — to have a portfolio and manage it — is alive and well at Simon, which sold off some of its shares of Authentic Brands Group, cutting its stake to just under 10 percent from just under 12 percent. “We will continue to look to monetize these investments,” Simon said. Authentic is a powerhouse acquirer and intellectual property owner that is led by Jamie Salter and operates brands from Barneys New York and David Beckham to Van Heusen and Vince Camuto. The sale of the stake added $117.4 million to Simon’s bottom line, which saw net income rise 10.9 percent to $747.5 million from $673.8 million a year earlier. In the third quarter, Simon logged after-tax gains of $145.5 million, on paper, as it reduced its stake in the Sparc Group joint venture with Authentic that operates Forever 21, Nautica, Reebok and others. Simon’s stake in Authentic was also diluted as fast-fashion giant Shein joined the mix . Over the past decade, Simon ventured somewhat away from its sweet spot of owning and running malls to dabble in being a retailer — an effort that stepped up during the pandemic when so many chains went bankrupt. But retail has largely been a high-profile sideline. Even though brick-and-mortar retail is enjoying a resurgence from the pandemic when consumers stayed in and ordered online, many lower-tier malls are still struggling. Simon, however, has built a portfolio of top properties, including the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia, Roosevelt Field on Long Island and The Galleria in Houston. The company said its occupancy rate at the end of the quarter on Dec. 31 stood at 95.8 percent, up from 94.9 percent a year earlier. Minimum rent per square foot also rose to $56.82, from $55.13. The CEO noted that new leases are coming in at about $75 a foot while renewals are being priced at $65 a foot. Retailers want to be at the mall, but they’re still having to work hard to drive interest in a touchy consumer economy. Annual retail sales per square foot fell 1.3 percent to $743 at Simon malls last year.

Irish GDP which contracted in 2023 will grow this year, but by the less-than-expected rate of 1.5%, as multinationals continue to face sluggish demand across Europe, but Irish-owned firms in the domestic economy will likely fare better, with consumer spending growing by 2.9%, the bank projects. Pay increases will nonetheless outpace the rise in consumer prices for the first time in a while, \"The impact of the fall in GDP last year will reverberate though 2024 and hold back growth to 1.5%,\" said chief economist Conall Mac Coille, in his first major forecast for the lender since he joined Bank of Ireland from Davy last year. \"However, with inflation falling back and real incomes growing, consumer spending should continue to expand, while continued house building should underpin domestic investment growth with both contributing to a solid rise of 2.3% in modified demand,\" said Mr Mac Coille. \"The breakneck pace of jobs growth\" won't continue, and housing output of 34,000 units will still be far short of the required number of 40,000 to 50,000 units to meet demand from a growing workforce and population, and house prices will grow by \"low single-digit territory\", according to the forecasts. \"Bottlenecks, capacity pressures, and labour shortages are now the most pressing issue that could hold back growth in the Irish economy. Hence, effectively implementing the National Development Plan and infrastructural investment is key going forward,\" Mr Mac Coille said. The GDP forecasts, for the most part, reflect the sluggish demand multinationals based here are facing for their exports across Europe. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its new outlook published on Monday pared its 2024 global GDP growth forecast back to 2.9%, confirming a wide gap between strong economic expansion in the US compared with sluggish growth in Europe. The eurozone economy is expected to grow by 0.6% this year, with German economic expansion growing tepidly, and Spain posting robust growth, while both the headline and core inflation eurozone rates are seen at 2.6%. At 0.7%, the British economy is also expected to be sluggish, according to the OECD. Separately, growth in the services part of the Irish economy slowed fairly sharply in January, according to the AIB Irish Services Purchasing Managers' Index. \"Two of the four sub-sectors covered in the survey registered growth overall – led by strong growth in financial services, with business services and transport tourism and leisure seeing monthly declines,\" according to the survey. However, \"employment also continued to rise, and the pace of job creation accelerated on the month. Business sentiment about the prospects for activity over the coming 12 months remained at an elevated level, helped by increasing expectations of a recovery in the wider economy in 2024\", it said.

Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA View image in fullscreen Shoppers walk past sale signs in York city centre. Total sales rose by 1.2% in January compared with a year earlier. Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA This article is more than 1 year old UK’s January sales failed to revive consumer spending, say retailers This article is more than 1 year old Sales growth slowed last month amid cost of living crisis, poor weather and rail strikes The traditional January sales on the high street failed to inspire a revival in consumer spending last month, as households continued to cut back amid the cost of living crisis. Britain’s largest retailers said sales growth slowed last month as higher living costs weighed heavily on consumers, while weather conditions and strikes on the transport network also hit spending. Total sales rose by 1.2% in January compared with a year earlier, below the annual average growth rate of 3.4%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Much of the rise was the result of inflation driving up the value of goods being sold, masking a drop in sales volumes and a collapse in online spending. Tax-free shopping for tourists in UK may return as government eyes rethink Read more “While the January sales helped to boost spending in the first two weeks, this did not sustain throughout the month,” said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Larger purchases, such as furniture, household appliances, and electricals, remained weak as the higher cost of living continued into its third year.” The latest snapshot follows a disappointing Christmas for retailers after official figures showed a 3.2% monthly decline in December , marking the sharpest plunge since shops were forced to close during the Covid pandemic in 2021. Confirming a lacklustre start to 2024 as households continue to face sustained pressure on living costs, separate figures from Barclays showed consumer card spending grew 3.1% year on year in January – below the current headline rate of inflation of 4%. The bank, which processes almost half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said there were some signs of strength amid an increase in consumer confidence. The latest figures showed resilient demand for digital content and takeaway meals as consumers saved money by staying in and watching new TV releases such as Fool Me Once on Netflix and Mean Girls on Amazon Prime. Growth in supermarket spending also increased to 5.2% in January, up from 2.8% in December. In contrasting claims about the health of the retail sector, the BRC suggested warm periods in January had hit spending on winter clothing and footwear, while Barclays blamed the fact consumers stayed away from the shops on cold weather. Separate figures from S&P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed a solid increase in business activity in the UK’s services sector in January. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The purchasing managers index for the sector, which surveys activity in the services industry excluding retail, increased from 53.4 in December to 54.3 in January, the highest level since May 2023. A reading of 50.0 separates growth from contraction. Barclays said its survey of consumer confidence pointed to improving optimism, with confidence in household finances and ability to spend hitting the highest level for more than two years. However, the BRC said increasing confidence was yet to convert into stronger levels of consumer spending. Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer markets, leisure and retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said: “While there are some positive signs that mortgage rates are starting to fall and stabilise, and shop inflation has fallen to its lowest level in over a year, the feelgood factor has yet to materialise at the tills.” Explore more on these topics Retail industry UK cost of living crisis news Share Reuse this content"

    "article_text": "Jamel Smith, PA 5 February 2024 at 4:40 am 1 Copied UK businesses are facing the second-highest level of “deepening” financial distress in Europe due to inflation and high interest rates. The Weil European Distress Index has shown failing profitability as the main driver for business distress across the continent. UK companies are experiencing the second-highest levels of financial distress in Europe, with German firms leading the way. European businesses are struggling to balance increasing expenses with the need for continuous production, the research found. Many companies have indicated they will have to reduce prices in a bid to maintain sales volumes. The European real estate sector is facing challenges such as high interest rates, falling valuations, elevated energy and construction costs, and increasingly expensive financing – cementing it as the “most distressed sector” in the index. Meanwhile, the healthcare sector is the second-most distressed sector due to interest rate burden, poor investment performance, and rising operational expenses. Ranked third, the retail sector faces a “double squeeze” of higher re-mortgage rates and escalating rents. In addition, the cost-of-living crisis has limited consumer spending. The study also found increased conflict in the Red Sea has harmed global trade, which is due to the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, which have disrupted trade routes and caused significant challenges for European retailers. As a result, there is growing concern about profitability in the retail industry. Andrew Wilkinson, senior European restructuring partner and co-head of Weil’s London restructuring practice, said: “As the real estate sector takes the lead in distress within Europe, it’s clear that investment hesitancy and rising costs are symptoms of a larger economic malaise. “High leverage poses a significant vulnerability in an unforgiving market, where companies confront rising costs against a backdrop of falling valuations. “Despite falling inflation, retail and consumer goods companies are still under immense pressure. “A challenging Christmas trading period, lack of consumer spending, and issues around pricing reductions have left retailers feeling less than optimistic about the year ahead. “With escalating tensions in the Red Sea impacting trade routes, businesses will be monitoring what this will mean for distress levels, particularly with regards to issues around profitability.”"

    "article_text": "Home Editors' Picks Jobless rate may rise to 6.3% this year — BMI Editors' Picks One News Top Stories Jobseekers fill out application forms at a mall, Jan. 18, 2024. — PHILIPPINE STAR/EDD GUMBAN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE in the Philippines may pick up to 6.3% this year, which could impact con sumer spending throughout 2024, according to BMI Country Risk & Industry Research. “The Philippine economy is heavily dependent on high employment, especially in the service industry,” BMI said in a report dated Feb. 1. Latest data from the local statistics agency showed the jobless rate dropped to a record low of 3.6% in November 2023, lower than 4.2% in October and 4.2% seen a year earlier. The number of unemployed Filipinos decreased by 12.3% to 1.83 million in November from 2.09 million in October, and by 15.8% from 2.18 million in November 2022. For the first 11 months of 2023, the unemployment rate stood at 4.5%, well below the 5.3%-6.4% target under the Philippine Development Plan. “Over 2024, we forecast unemployment to average 6.3%, as the labor market loosens slightly. While in fl ation continues to increase, the main drivers are elevated food and energy costs as opposed to wages,” BMI said. According to BMI, the strong labor market led to a robust Philippine consumer spending growth in 2022 and 2023, even as elevated in fl ation dampened gains in incomes. “However, as major markets and economies slow in 2024, we expect some uptick in unemployment rates across the board,” BMI said, noting that rising joblessness is a risk to the consumer outlook. “Lower levels of personal savings, previously functioning as an option to support current consumption patterns, will mean that households will have to reorient their purchasing patterns and cut back on their spending (by moving down price points or buying fewer goods at similar spending levels),” it said. BMI forecasts Philippine household spending to grow by 6.3% from the 5.6% growth recorded in 2023. This is also in line with the fi rm’s economic growth forecast of 6.2% this year, up from the 5.6% expansion in 2023 but still below the government’s 6.5-7.5% target. “Spending will remain impacted by the environment of elevated in fl ationary pressures over 2023 as well as high debt levels, and its servicing costs. However, easing in fl ation and a tight labor market will support spending, as real wage growth returns to positive territory, supporting purchasing power over the year,” it said. High levels of household debt may also hurt household spending this year, BMI said. “A high level of household debt remains a risk to our consumer outlook, as it limits the future availability of debt, but also draws on current disposable income levels, especially as debt servicing costs increase on the back of interest rate increases,” it said. The BSP raised key policy rates by 450 basis points (bps) from May 2022 to October 2023 to tame inflation, making it the most aggressive central bank in the region. This brought the key rate to 6.5%, the highest in 16 years. Even though BMI expects policy rate cuts from central banks this year amid easing inflation, borrowing costs may not reach their pre-pandemic lows and households may need to adjust to high interest rates. “Many households took on signi fi cant levels of debt in the previous low interest rate environment,” it said. “The risk to consumer spending is that the cost of servicing this debt at higher interest rates becomes a larger-than-anticipated draw on disposable incomes, to a point where consumers will have to cut back spending, especially in more non-essential segments.” Consumer spending may also be affected by risks to the remittance outlook this year. “There is a particular demand for Filipino workers skilled in jobs related to medical and health services, construction and housekeeping… However, we do highlight several risks to this income over 2024, mostly related to the negative impact from the rising in fl ation across several global markets.” Based on the latest data from the central bank, cash remittances grew by 2.8% to $2.719 billion in November from $2.644 billion a year earlier. The growth in cash remittances was the slowest annual pace since the 2.6% in September. The amount of money sent home to the Philippines was also the lowest since $2.494 billion in May 2023. — Keisha B.

The Weil European Distress Index has shown failing profitability as the main driver for business distress across the continent.

European businesses are struggling to balance increasing expenses with the need for continuous production, the research found. Many companies have indicated they will have to reduce prices in a bid to maintain sales volumes. The European real estate sector is facing challenges such as high interest rates, falling valuations, elevated energy and construction costs, and increasingly expensive financing – cementing it as the “most distressed sector” in the index. Meanwhile, the healthcare sector is the second-most distressed sector due to interest rate burden, poor investment performance, and rising operational expenses. Ranked third, the retail sector faces a “double squeeze” of higher re-mortgage rates and escalating rents. In addition, the cost-of-living crisis has limited consumer spending. The study also found increased conflict in the Red Sea has harmed global trade, which is due to the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, which have disrupted trade routes and caused significant challenges for European retailers. As a result, there is growing concern about profitability in the retail industry. Andrew Wilkinson, senior European restructuring partner and co-head of Weil’s London restructuring practice, said: “As the real estate sector takes the lead in distress within Europe, it’s clear that investment hesitancy and rising costs are symptoms of a larger economic malaise. “High leverage poses a significant vulnerability in an unforgiving market, where companies confront rising costs against a backdrop of falling valuations. “Despite falling inflation, retail and consumer goods companies are still under immense pressure. “A challenging Christmas trading period, lack of consumer spending, and issues around pricing reductions have left retailers feeling less than optimistic about the year ahead. “With escalating tensions in the Red Sea impacting trade routes, businesses will be monitoring what this will mean for distress levels, particularly with regards to issues around profitability.” Share 0 Comments Get involved with the news Send your news & photos"

    "article_text": "Australian house prices are either stalled or falling. The primary reason for this is the worsening job market and the rise in interest rates.: If you want to buy a home, now is the time to do it, while sentiment is weak. In the Australian real estate market, you will never find a deal. However, there are times when prices are falling, and lowballing is a smart move for purchasers. Advertisement That is where we are now. But, by the time we reach the second half, the property market will begin to rise on interest rate reductions. Prices move swiftly to add a premium when mortgages become cheaper. More broadly, there is still a strong case for property. Advertisement The unchecked immigration policies of the Albanese government are the driving force behind demand. On the supply side, construction remains very weak owing, again, to excessive immigration and terrible energy policy driving building costs. Vacancy rates will not return to normal anytime soon and rents will continue to be high enough to attract investors. Advertisement The housing shortage in Australia will persist for years until price gains finally trigger a supply response. Last but not least, interest rate reductions are expected in the second half of 2024. Advertisement Markets have only factored in a small number of cuts through 2025. However, the RBA has overcooked its rate hikes and crashed the consumer economy. It will need to pivot sooner and cut. With China’s economy plodding through an endless structural adjustment, the future is also likely to be more cuts, not less. The prices of oil, gas, coal, and green metals have already plummeted. Next up will be the bulk commodities. Advertisement When that income shock lands on the economy ahead, nominal growth and the budget will buckle. While this bodes poorly for miners and WA, it bodes well for East Coast homeowners as loan rates drop more than anyone expects."

    "article_text": "HALELUYA HADERO February 1, 2024 at 5:48 PM 0 Copied Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the fourth quarter, driven by strong consumer spending during the holiday shopping season. The Seattle-based e-commerce company said it earned $170 billion in revenue and $10.6 billion in profits during the last three months of 2023, beating expectations from analysts surveyed by FactSet. In a statement, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called it a “record-breaking” holiday shopping season for the company, which saw a 14% growth in revenue compared to the same period in 2022. Despite challenges posed from increasing credit card debt and delinquencies, along with higher prices and borrowing costs, U.S. consumer spending was up in November and December, following a slip in October after six straight months of gains. Like other retailers, Amazon aimed to lure holiday shoppers through fast-shipping and discount events, including a prominent sales event for Prime members held in October. The company said its online retail business earned $70.5 billion in revenue during the quarter, a 9% jump compared to $64.53 billion during the same period in 2022. On a call with reporters on Thursday, Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company is seeing more purchases from Prime members who are being lured by better delivery speeds for online orders . He also said revenue is being driven by fees from third-party sellers and the company’s advertising business, which is poised to grow as the tech giant brings ads to Prime Video. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm from advertisers,” Olsavsky said, while noting customers who don't want ads to intrude their streaming experience can pay an additional $2.99 per month to avoid it. Meanwhile, the company’s cloud computing unit AWS earned $24.2 billion during the last quarter. That represented a 13% jump in revenue compared to the same period in 2022, but its growth has slowed down compared to prior years. Olsavsky also said he expects AWS to accelerate this year, saying businesses that use the cloud service are cutting costs less than before and are more interested in generative AI products Amazon has rolled out in the past year, like the chatbot Q . Generative artificial intelligence has been a major area of focus for the company, which initially appeared to be falling behind the AI arms race sparked by San Francisco startup OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022. But since then, it has been making investments to capitalize on the surging public and business interest in new AI tools. Roughly an hour before it released its earnings on Thursday, Amazon announced a new generative AI-powered shopping assistant called Rufus. The company – which has also integrated AI-generated summaries of product reviews into its online shopping site – says Rufus will answer customer questions on products and help them discover new items. Amazon is also pouring up to $4 billion into an artificial intelligence company called Anthropic, an investment that's under scrutiny by federal regulators concerned about the relationship tech companies are forging with AI startups. The company's sway has long been under scrutiny by regulators in the U.S. and abroad. This week, Amazon and iRobot called off an acquisition deal after receiving pushback from regulators in Europe. The Federal Trade Commission is also suing Amazon over allegations it inflates online prices and overcharges sellers. Overall, the company reported it earned $30.4 billion in profits last year after losing $2.7 billion in 2022. In an effort to increase profitability and cut down on costs, Amazon laid off roughly 27,000 corporate employees between late 2022 and early last year. The company and subsidiaries, such as the streaming platform Twitch and the audiobook service Audible, also cut thousands of jobs last month. Amazon’s stock rose as much as 8% in after-hours trading."

Read our privacy notice . London hotel occupancy topped pre-pandemic levels for the first time in December, new data shows, as a number of luxury venues opened their doors in the capital. The RSM Hotels Tracker shows hotels in the capital hit an 80% occupancy rate in the month, up from 78.3% in December of 2019. London’s occupancy rate was well ahead of the 70.1% in the rest of the country. The average rate per occupied room rose slightly as well, to £234.47, which is also ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Chris Tate, head of hotels and accommodation at RSM UK, said a lower level of strike-driven transport disruption played a part in the rise. London's hotel sector saw a number of ultra-high-end openings in the second half of 2023, headlined by the billion-pound Peninsula London. He said: “It was a positive end to 2023 for the hotel industry, with the London market emerging as the winners. Hoteliers were able to make the most of the festive period, without having to navigate the challenges of train strikes as seen last year. “As consumers continue to tighten their purse strings and prioritise experiences over goods, the hotel industry is feeling the benefit of this shift in consumer behaviour. Hoteliers are doing well to maintain profits, despite the higher costs being faced by the sector, and it is hoped that this continues after April when costs will increase again, including national minimum wage and business rates.” Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, added that extra visitors to London “provides hope” that the UK might have avoided an end-of-year recession as strong spending on experiences makes up for weak retail sales. He added: “‘Looking ahead, the first six months of this year are likely to remain tough with high interest rates dragging on economic growth and inflation remaining well above target. However, things look brighter in the second half of this year. The inflation rate will probably fall to about 2.5%, which will allow the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates. At the same time, real earnings growth will continue to rise and there is the distinct possibility of further tax cuts coming in March. All this would mean more consumer spending, which will be a positive for the travel and hotel sector.” MORE ABOUT Hotels London venues Consumer spending Interest Rates Experiences hotel profits Growth"

    "article_text": "'No big drama' is coming for the US economy, but complacency is a rising risk, 'Big Short' traders say Filip De Mott January 31, 2024 2 min read 'Big Short' traders told CNBC that investors are too complacent, although the economy is healthy. Steve Eisman sees little concern over today's economy, with consumer spending still strong. But traders should still keep their eyes on pockets of risk, such as commercial real estate, the others said. There is little reason to be nervous about the US economy, though investors should still keep an eye on pockets of risk, a group of \"Big Short\" investors said in a joint interview with CNBC . \"As long as credit quality is okay, there's no, you know, big drama coming,\" Neuberger Berman's Steve Eisman told the outlet at a financial conference. He was joined by traders Danny Moses, Vincent Daniel, and Porter Collins, who together were made famous by betting against the housing market ahead of the 2008 crash. As to today's economy, Eisman considers it relatively healthy, essentially dismissing Wall Street's concerns that a consumer spending drawdown guarantees a coming slowdown . \"Capital One said that they think delinquencies have peaked. Consumers still have money,\" he said, adding: \"Don't worry, be happy. I mean, that's good until it changes but as of now, it's not changing.\" But Collins, cofounder of Seawolf Capital, countered that investors may be turning too complacent. \"A lot of people are bullish, right? And so that's the one thing that concerns me like, you know, no one's really that scared,\" he said. Commercial real estate is a clear example, said Moses, founder of Moses Ventures. Following the rapid rise of interest rates, trillions of dollars are now due to be refinanced in the next few years, which should limit market euphoria to some degree. Some on Wall Street are nervous this could trigger a massive real estate default wave , with billions at risk. Instead, Moses noted that investors are largely leaning on expectations that the Federal Reserve will bail the sector out. Still, markets shouldn't be too complacent, as the commercial real estate industry has seen \"fits and starts\" crop up, Moses said. In separate comments cited by Bloomberg , Eisman also waved off rising worries about US credit conditions , noting that arguments against the government deficit have been ongoing for four decades.

    "article_text": "Editors' Pick Money Retirement Public And Private Investments Lay The Foundation For U.S. Economic Growth By Christian Weller , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Christian Weller is an economist focused on retirement inequality. Follow Author Jan 30, 2024, 06:00am EST Jan 30, 2024, 04:02pm EST Share Save Comment Public and private investments contribute to growth getty The economy keeps humming along in the face of severe headwinds, most notably the highest interest rates in a generation. Key parts, especially public and private investments in buildings such as manufacturing plants, lay the foundation for faster economic growth and technological advances over the longer term. These added investments follow in part from a range of legislative achievements aimed at rebuilding the country’s infrastructure and boosting the generation and adaptation of renewable energy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the U.S. economy grew by an annualized inflation-adjusted rate of 3.3% in the last three months of 2023, down from an unusually high 4.9% in the third quarter. All parts of the economy contributed to this growth, highlighting broad based momentum of an increasingly competitive economy. Growth followed in part from strong public and private investments. And, data on exports show that the economy is already highly competitive and could become even more so in the near term as a result of those investments. Stable Consumer Spending Is The Bedrock Of A Resilient Economy Consumer spending always makes up the bulk of economic activity. More interesting is what people are spending their money on. At the end of 2023, spending on durable goods such as recreational vehicles and equipment and household appliances was particularly strong. It expanded by an annualized rate of 4.6% at the end of 2023. Recreational goods and vehicles — think skis and snowmobiles — grew by 11% at the end of 2023 after a very strong surge of 17% in the third quarter. In a similar vein, spending on recreation services such as gym memberships grew by 5.6% and going out to restaurants as well as hotel stays increased by 7.6% at that time. A lot of the substantial spending increases happened in areas that are likely not necessities. People have stable jobs , they are earning more, their wage increases outpace inflation and they act as if the economy is doing well for them. This is also reflected in the importance of the three categories — recreational vehicles, recreation services and restaurants and accommodations — to the overall growth of consumption at the end of last year. Consumer spending grew at an annualized inflation adjusted rate of 2.8%. More than 40% of this growth came from these categories . MORE FOR YOU One possible explanation is that people felt good about the economy, in part because the stock market boomed, and they dipped into their savings to pay for goods and services. After all, the personal saving rate — the share of after-tax income that was saved — dipped to 4% from 4.2% in the third quarter. The so-called wealth effect — higher spending as a result of unexpected gains to household wealth — drove some part of total consumer spending. Exports Outpacing Imports Amid Global Headwinds Is A Sign Of U.S. Competitiveness International trade was another important contributor to economic growth, highlighting the U.S. economy’s competitive position. Exports grew at an annual inflation rate of 6.3%, far outpacing imports, which grew at 1.9% at the same time. Exports contributed 0.65 percentage points to the overall growth rate of 3.3%, or 19.7% in relative terms, while imports reduced growth by 0.25 percentage points. Food, feeds, and beverages (+38.3%); petroleum and petroleum products (+47.3%); civilian aircraft, engines and parts (+21.5%); and transport (+27.8%) such as overseas shipping were the fastest-growing exports at the end of 2023. On the other side, computers and peripherals (+58.2%) and travel for all purposes (+43.3%) were the fastest-growing imports. The increase in exports is especially noteworthy since the dollar has been fairly strong against its trading partner currencies for some time, a Federal Reserve table shows. This makes it more expensive for foreigners to buy and good services from U.S. companies. Moreover, The Conference Board notes economic growth in Europe and China as well as other parts of the world slowed and thus could have dampened demand for U.S. products. Still, exports boomed. Put differently, many U.S. goods and services are highly competitive, even under adverse circumstances. Public Investments Rebuild Infrastructure As Foundation For Faster Future Growth Government spending at all levels – federal, state and local – grew at an average rate, largely because of increases in investment spending. Total government spending increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, per BEA data. This was down from 5.8% in the second quarter, but the same as in the second quarter of 2023. More important for future growth is the fact that spending on government investments was especially strong. Investment spending for buildings (+16.5%), equipment such as school buses and computers (+8.8%) and intellectual property such as new educational software (+6.0%) outpaced government consumption spending (+0.7%). In relative terms, investments by state and local governments in structures such as schools and transit stations were the largest contributors, making up more than a quarter of the total growth of government spending at the end of 2023. This type of government spending accounted for similar or larger shares of overall government spending growth since the middle of 2022. That is, state and local governments invested heavily in infrastructure for more than a year, laying the groundwork for faster long-term growth. Private Business Investment Continues To Grow Manufacturing Capacity Business investment — officially called nonresidential fixed investment — grew at a fairly modest rate. It increased at an annual rate of 2.1% in the third quarter, after growing by 10% in the prior quarter. The growth in spending on private industry structures was led by manufacturing structures. This continues a boom that really took off at the end of 2022, according to a FRED chart. In comparison, residential fixed investment spending – new houses and renovations – grew at a meager rate. It increased by 1.1% at the end of 2023, after growing by 6.7% in the third quarter and declining for almost two years in a row. The Fed’s interest rate increases have not resulted in a recession or rising unemployment. But a Center for American Progress report explains how it likely slowed housing investment, exacerbating the lack of affordable housing . The U.S. economy has proven to be remarkably resilient. Consumer spending is still very strong in the face of higher interest rates, boosted by higher inflation-adjusted incomes and stock market gains. More importantly, public and private investments focus on longer-term infrastructures such as new manufacturing plants. Those investments have the potential for workers and businesses to become more innovative over the long term. This is remarkable, given that U.S. businesses are already relatively competitive globally, with export growth outpacing import growth. Past Legislative Efforts Underpin Boom In Public And Private Investments These investments by state and local governments and manufacturing businesses go along with focused policy initiatives. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act all provided more public support for public and private investments and created more planning certainty for private investments. Greater planning certainty, especially in the areas of renewable energy generation and use, translates into more private investments in those areas as well. The result is a resilient and innovative economy that could have substantial momentum going forward. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news ‘No shipping, no shopping': Trade experts warn Congress what more Houthi Red Sea chaos will mean for economy By Lori Ann LaRocco,CNBC • Published January 30, 2024 • Updated on February 1, 2024 at 9:27 am BOOKMARKER Fareed Kotb | Anadolu | Getty Images Dr. Ian Ralby, a maritime consultant, told Congress on Tuesday that the impact from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea will be 'far greater' on consumer prices than on the oil market. A National Retail Federation official told members of a House subcommittee that freight prices are doubling and smaller merchants have already passed on increases to the consumer. \"No shipping, no shopping,\" Ralby, founder and CEO of maritime consulting firm I.R. Consilium, said in his Capitol Hill testimony. The world's largest shipping company, MSC, and several retail and trade experts warned Congress on Tuesday that if the Red Sea chaos caused by Houthi rebel attacks is not stopped, the rise in freight prices will spread further into the global economy and hit consumer wallets. Watch NBC Bay Area News free wherever you are WATCH HERE Charles \"Bud\" Darr, executive vice president of Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), who served in the U.S. Navy, told the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation that the level of sophistication in the Houthi attacks and their use of technology has made the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden not safe enough to protect its most vital asset, seafarers, as well client cargo. \"The shooting has to stop so we can put our sons and daughters back on that trade route,\" Darr told House members. \"They [Houthis] are merchants of chaos and they enjoy being chaotic,\" said Dr. Ian Ralby, founder and CEO of I.R. Consilium, which advises on maritime law, development, security and strategy, and private security regulation. Ralby stressed the crisis in the Red Sea is not just a U.S. problem, but recent attacks by the U.S. military have led to greater targeting of its vessels. Typically, he said, the rebel group \"doesn't care\" if it hits a U.S. vessel or another vessel. \"They are indifferent.\" But he added, \"Since we started striking targets in Yemen there has been an increase in the targeting of U.S. ships. Those (attacks) are aided by Iran.\" He described the increase in U.K. and U.S. vessels as \"problematic.\" The subject of the U.S. Navy prioritizing security for U.S. flagged ships over foreign vessels was posed by Congressman Salud Carbajal (D-CA) to the MSC executive. Four senators from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently sent a letter to President Biden on the topic. MSC does not have any U.S. flagged vessels in its fleet, while other foreign carriers including Maersk and Hapag Lloyd do. \"We are a conduit of world trade,\" Darr said. He added that while MSC is foreign flagged, it does pay U.S. taxes and employs many Americans across its operations. \"Keep the trade lanes open,\" Darr said. \"It comes down to serving the commerce needs of the trading partners and what they need is what we provide.\" MSC was the No. 1 ocean carrier handling U.S. imports, based on 2023 cargo arrivals data. Its ocean alliance partner, Maersk, was No. 1 on the export side. Maersk is also a foreign-flagged ocean carrier. Maersk recently announced two of its American-flagged vessels, the Maersk Detroit and Maersk Chesapeake, were attacked on January 24, during a scheduled U.S. Navy accompaniment for a northbound transit of the Bab el-Mandeb. After those attacks, Maersk announced it would no longer be transiting the Red Sea . Vessel delays and supply chain inflation The attacks on global shipping have created a huge wave of vessel diversions since December and delays in the global supply chain. MSC announced on December 17 that it would divert its services that would typically transit the Red Sea and the Suez Canal around the Cape of Good Hope. Sailing around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Red Sea adds one to two weeks to a one-way shipping journey relative to the Red Sea and Suez Canal. Europe's route is longer than the U.S. in this diversion, which is why air freight usage is up. Maritime advisory firm Sea-Intelligence said the average delay for late vessel arrivals has \"deteriorated,\" increasing by 0.30 days month over month to 5.35 days. The delays in the arrival of containers have led companies including Suzuki Motor, Tesla , Volvo, and Michelin to say they have had to halt manufacturing. Ikea, British retailer Next and Crocs have all warned of product delays. General Electric appliances are also among the top items moved along the Red Sea/Suez Canal route. National Retail Federation companies are seeing container prices double from $1,500- $3,000, Jon Gold, its vice president of supply chain and customs policy, told the House subcommittee. \"This represents a 38%-73% cost increase for directly affected cargo,\" Gold said. \"We are seeing some costs being passed onto the consumer now from the smaller and medium businesses.\" 'No shipping, no shopping' Around 28% of the world's container trade traverses through the Suez Canal/Red Sea. According to Bank of America, almost 30% of the goods in these containers are furniture, household goods and clothing and apparel. Its research indicates that brands with significant European exposure due to the longer transits from Asia to Europe include Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation , Birkenstock , Capri Holdings Limited , Nike , Ralph Lauren , VF Corp , and Levi Strauss & Co. Rising freight costs were a big component of inflation during Covid and the Red Sea crisis has renewed fears that another bout of supply chain-triggered inflation could occur. Gold said in addition to the freight rate hikes, additional surcharges are being applied not only to directly impacted cargo but to additional trade routes, such as Europe to the U.S., due to issues with the availability of containers. The longer transits are creating a dislocation of containers because they are in use longer. Gold said some retailers are taking their products to the air to speed up delivery of their goods, helping to explain why air freight volumes have recently soared . Xeneta data shows that air cargo volumes on the major apparel route from Vietnam to Europe spiked 62% in the week ending January 14, six percent higher than 2023′s peak week in October. The same week 12 months ago showed a 16% increase. Ralby stressed that the crisis in the Red Sea is not just a U.S. problem. \"The U.S. economy is represented but this is global,\" he said. \"No shipping, no shopping,\" he said. He warned that the Houthi attacks will impact prices throughout the consumer economy to a \"far greater\" extent than in the energy markets, citing the roughly 30% of global container traffic that traverses the Red Sea versus 10% of oil supply. \"Oil is fungible. It can be replicated from different shipments from all over the world. These purchases (in containers) you can't make up for,\" Ralby said. Correction: Dr. Ian Ralby, a maritime consultant, told Congress that the impact from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea will be \"far greater\" on consumer prices than on the oil market. Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed the quote in the Key Points section. This story has also been updated to reflect that General Electric appliances are among the top items moved along the Red Sea/Suez Canal route. An earlier version misspelled the company's name.

    "article_text": "ADVERTISEMENT Tough times for workers as incomes decline From the report 37 percent of Kenyans indicated that their income did not change between 2022 and 2023 by JACKTONE LAWI Africa 30 January 2024 - 16:38 ADVERTISEMENT In Summary •The report by ICEA shows that individual spending sub-index fell by 3 percent between July and September 2023. •On the business side, that 48 percent appeared to hold positive sentiments regarding sales trends while 45percent had negative sentiments regarding sales. Audio By Vocalize Kenyans going about their business along Ronald Ngala Street. Rising commodity prices and stagnant incomes eroded Kenyans purchasing power by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of 2023, according to a Consumer Spending Index released on Tuesday. The ICEA report shows that semi and unskilled manual workers were hardest hit, recording the highest decline in expenditure. While all categories (executive, skilled and unskilled workers) witnessed reduced spending levels in the third quarter of 2023, the lower income consumer segment had the largest proportion (9 percent) experiencing reduced personal consumption expenditure in that period. From the report 37 percent of Kenyans indicated that their income did not change between 2022 and 2023, while 38 percent experienced a decline in income and 24 percent saw their income rise between 2022 and 2023. The report by ICEA shows that individual spending sub-index fell by 3 percent between July and September 2023, while the retail business sales sub- index remained broadly flat in the same period. “This resulted in a decline of 1.5percent in the overall consumer spending index (which is weighted 50percent by changes in individual spending and 50percent by changes in retail business sales),” said Head of Research at ICEA LION Asset Management Judd Murigi She said this was a relatively resilient level of consumer spend in the third quarter considering the perception that disposable incomes had reduced. \"However, we note that many consumers attributed the additional spending to an increase in the cost of items purchased rather than higher income per se,\" said Murigi. The official said the spending came in spite of continued slowed private sector credit. The large business segment had the largest improvement (25 percent) in sales trends in the third quarter, followed by the micro businesses segment at 7 percent better sales trends. The medium sized businesses segment recorded a fall of 18 percent in sales trends in the same period, while the small business segment had similar level of sales trends in the third quarter. Various business sectors including retail stores, clothing & apparel, food and drink outlets, as well as house fittings & accessories recorded broadly similar trends in sales between July and September 2023, with no major divergence noted. “Our sentiment analysis on individual spending trends indicated that 44 percent of consumers had a positive mindset regarding their spending while 56 percent had a negative mindset regarding with their spending trends,” added Murigi. On the business side, that 48percent of businesses appeared to hold positive sentiments regarding sales trends while 45percent had negative sentiments regarding sales. The index tracks consumer spending in order to gauge how the real economy is trending. It is based on interviews of 500 consumers and 100 retail businesses in the greater Nairobi area.

    "article_text": "By Hugh Robert | Special to The Republican Restaurants have become increasingly dependent on social media as a way of communicating with their customer base. Many have abandoned traditional advertising and, in some instances, even relegated their web sites to the role of little more than online order pads. But social media doesn’t just offer dining establishments a seemingly cheap and easy pipeline to customers. TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook impact popular culture in ways that might not always prove beneficial to the businesses that attract the eyeballs those channels need to survive. Since the start of 2024 a new social media trend, loud budgeting, has gone viral on TikTok, and financial commentators are already warning that the fad could spell trouble for restaurants along with other segments of the consumer economy. “Loud budgeting” is the posting of social media messages that encourage thrift and budgeting while at the same time proudly promoting a penny-pinching lifestyle. Such messages are in sharp contrast to the “haul videos” and other displays of conspicuous consumption that have previously been a staple of social media feeds. TikTok users posting “loud budgeting” videos unashamedly (and often smugly) reject indulgences like buying new clothes, going out for drinks, or ordering “Instagram-worthy” restaurant meals. Instead this new class of influencers vocally asserts the virtue of self-denial in pursuit of long-term financial security. Loud budgeting, some industry observers have noted, is making it “cool” to be cheap. Whether or not loud budgeting becomes a headwind for the consumer economy remains to be seen, but such anti-consumption messaging does underscore the need for the restaurant industry to emphasize value in the weeks and months ahead. *********** Side Dishes On Saturday, Feb. 3, Flayvors of Cook Farm in Hadley will be celebrating International Ice Cream for Breakfast Day.

U.S. personal spending rose 0.7% in December, according to the Commerce Department. One strategist said the rate of income growth is lagging that of spending, which heightens the stakes for January jobs data due next week. \"Economic data in terms of employment data is extremely important for the market to assess how the economy is, and whether consumer spending can continue at this clip,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at brokerage LPL Financial. JetBlue Airways warned it could terminate its attempted takeover of Spirit Airlines next week after a federal judge's ruling blocked their planned merger. Colgate-Palmolive posted better-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter, led by sales growth in its Latin America division.

New York, Jan 26 (IANS) The last US inflation snapshot for 2023 revealed that the Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred price gauge didnâ€™t budge last month, holding at 2.6 per cent and wrapping up a year in which price hikes slowed while the economy remained strong. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index â€\" the inflation gauge that the Fed uses as its target rate â€\" was up 2.6 per cent annually in December, closing out 2023 with a softer punch than the 5.4 per cent gain a year prior, according to Commerce Department data released Friday, CNN reported. Thatâ€™s 0.6 percentage points from the central bankâ€™s goal of 2 per cent. Excluding energy and food, components that tend to be more volatile, the closely-watched core PCE price index rose 2.9 per cent annually, a slower pace than the 3.2 per cent rate seen in November. The core PCE gauge is at its lowest point since March 2021. On a monthly basis, the headline PCE index rose 0.2 per cent, a slight acceleration from the 0.1 per cent drop seen in November when gas prices were tumbling. The core PCE index also rose by 0.2 per cent from the prior month. Consumer spending finished the year strong and was up 0.7 per cent from November 2023, according to Fridayâ€™s report. Adjusting for inflation, spending was up 0.5 per cent, CNN reported. Economists had projected PCE would rise 2.6 per cent for the 12 months ended December and for consumer spending to grow 0.5 per cent from the month before, according to FactSet estimates, CNN reported."

    "article_text": "Traders keep bets the Fed's rate cuts will start in May louds over the Federal Reserve in Washington · Reuters Ann Saphir January 26, 2024 2 min read By Ann Saphir (Reuters) - Inflation is cooling, but not quite quick enough to allow the U.S. central bank to deliver its first interest-rate reduction by March, with traders betting on Friday that May is the more likely kickoff to a round of Fed rate cuts this year. A Commerce Department report on Friday showed inflation by the Federal Reserve's targeted measure rose 2.6% in December from a year earlier. The Fed aims at 2% by that measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Underlying core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices and which the Fed views as a good gauge for where price pressures are heading, was running at below 2% on a three-month and a six-month basis, the data showed. After the report, futures contracts that settle to the Fed's policy rate reflected about a 48% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's March 19-20 meeting, and a 90% chance of rate cut by the April 30-May 1 meeting. The Fed hasn't touched its policy rate since last July, when it lifted the target range by a quarter-of-a-percentage point to 5.25%-5.5%, but signaled it was not yet convinced policy was tight enough to beat inflation. Since then inflation has dropped faster than Fed officials expected. They will likely need more data to be confident they can ease up, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale. \"The disinflationary trend is continuing,\" she said. But consumer spending and the job market remain strong and that argues \"for the Fed to keep policy on hold for longer.\" Friday's report also showed consumer spending surged at year's end, following on a Thursday report showing the U.S. economy grew at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, far faster than economists had anticipated. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.7% in December, barely above where it was when the Fed began its rate-hike campaign in March 2022. The Labor Department releases January payrolls data next Friday. Fed officials are universally expected to leave the policy rate in its current range at their meeting next week, though many economists do expect them to delete a reference to expected \"additional policy firming\" that was in their post-meeting statement most of last year.

Log In Create Free Account U.S. prices rose marginally in December, keeping the annual increase in inflation below 3 per cent for a third straight month, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates this year. But the timing of the anticipated rate cut is uncertain, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showing consumer spending surging at the end of 2023 as Americans splurged on goods and services over the holidays. Financial markets have pushed the odds of a March rate cut to below 50 per cent in a nod to the economy’s continued resilience. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at the current 5.25-per-cent to 5.5-per-cent range at its meeting next week. “The inflation trajectory is improving, giving the Fed leeway to cut rates this year,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, N.C. “However, the Fed has further work to do and should not be tempted to declare ‘mission accomplished.’ ” The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2 per cent last month after dropping 0.1 per cent in November, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Food prices rose 0.1 per cent and the cost of energy products increased 0.3 per cent. In the 12 months through December, the PCE price index advanced 2.6 per cent, matching November’s gain. The inflation readings were in line with economists’ expectations. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.2 per cent after rising 0.1 per cent in November. The so-called core PCE price index increased 2.9 per cent year-on-year, the smallest gain since March, 2021, after rising 3.2 per cent in November. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2-per-cent inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2 per cent over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. Core services prices excluding housing, the primary concern for policy makers, rose 0.3 per cent. They increased 3.3 per cent year-on-year after advancing 3.5 per cent in November. Some economists argue that core inflation is already on target. Measured on an annualized basis, core inflation rose at a 1.5-per-cent rate over the past three months and increased at a 1.9-per-cent pace in the last six months. The government reported on Thursday that core PCE inflation advanced at a 2.0-per-cent rate in the fourth quarter after a similar rise in the July-September period. Economists said Fed officials were likely to place more weight on the fourth-quarter inflation reading as the quarterly data ironed out month-to-month volatility. “Inflation at 2.0 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, for two quarters in a row, is a good reason to start cutting rates,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. “The year-on-year core CPI at 2.9 per cent gives the Fed cover to wait a few months longer and still fulfill [chair Jerome] Powell’s prediction the Fed will cut rates before inflation reaches 2 per cent.” Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Though prospects of a March rate cut have diminished, a reduction in borrowing costs is still expected by June. Since March, 2022, the Fed has raised its benchmark overnight rate by 525 basis points. Easing inflation along with rising wages from a tight labour market and households tapping their savings combined to boost consumer spending and support the overall economy. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 0.7 per cent after rising 0.4 per cent in November amid gains in both goods and services. Spending on goods surged 0.9 per cent as Americans stepped up purchases of new light trucks, clothing and footwear as well as recreational goods and vehicles. They also spent more on gasoline, furniture and household equipment. Services outlays rose 0.6 per cent, lifted by financial service charges, fees and commissions, housing and utilities, recreation, hospital and outpatient care, and gambling. When adjusted for inflation, overall consumer spending increased 0.5 per cent in December after a similar rise in the prior month. The solid increase in the so-called real consumer spending puts consumption on a higher growth path heading into the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed started its tracking estimate for first-quarter GDP growth at a 3.0-per-cent rate. “It is early to have a precise estimate of what first-quarter GDP will look like at this point, but the trajectory for consumers and across many other economic indicators looks at least decent late last year,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The data was included in the fourth quarter’s advance gross domestic product report published on Thursday. Consumer spending increased at a strong 2.8-per-cent rate last quarter, accounting for the bulk of the economy’s 3.3-per-cent growth pace. The pace of growth in consumer spending is, however, likely to moderate in the months ahead. Personal income increased 0.3 per cent in December after rising 0.4 per cent in November. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose 0.1 per cent after a solid 0.5-per-cent increase in November. As a result, some of the surge in spending was funded from savings. The saving rate dropped to a one-year low of 3.7 per cent, from 4.1 per cent in November. Lower-income households are believed to be using credit cards to finance purchases. But higher borrowing costs are making it harder for some to keep up with their debt payments. A reduction in government money flowing to household is also anticipated. While these factors could slow spending, economists do not expect the economy to slide into recession this year as lower inflation boosts household purchasing power. Rising stock market prices were also seen underpinning spending. “We continue to expect a solid consumer spending performance in 2024, but momentum may be a little more subdued than the robust 2.2 per cent advance in 2023,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon in New York."

Ash Ponders/Bloomberg/Getty Images New York CNN — The last inflation snapshot of 2023 provided some further encouraging news for Americans and the Federal Reserve: This painful period of sharp price increases may be nearing its end. Commerce Department data released Friday showed that although the Federal Reserve’s preferred price gauge didn’t budge from its 2.6% annual rate seen a month before, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation dropped to its lowest level since March 2021. Additionally, the American household closed out 2023 on strong footing: Incomes and wages were up considerably from the year before, and consumers continued to spend heartily to keep the economy growing and casting aside recession fears. “The American household continues to demonstrate resilience in light of these shocks,” said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US. “One can’t help but be somewhat optimistic about the American economy going forward, given the fact that we are at the doorstep of price stability, and the inflation fight has essentially ended.” The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the inflation gauge that the Fed uses as its target rate — was up 2.6% annually in December, closing out 2023 with a softer punch than the 5.4% gain a year prior, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. December’s inflation reading is 0.6 percentage points from the central bank’s goal of 2%. People shop at a supermarket in Foster City, California, the United States, Jan. 11, 2024. U.S. consumer inflation in December 2023 accelerated to 3.4 percent from a year ago, after dropping to 3.1 percent in the previous month, amid rising shelter and energy prices, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday. (Photo by Li Jianguo/Xinhua via Getty Images) Li Jianguo/Xinhua/Getty Images Related article Americans are feeling much better about the economy thanks to slowing inflation Excluding energy and food, components that tend to be more volatile, the closely watched core PCE price index rose 2.9% annually, a slower pace than the 3.2% rate seen in November. The core PCE gauge is at its lowest point since March 2021. While the headline index is the official base for the target rate, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers often highlight core PCE inflation as it’s generally considered a better signal of where inflation is headed. And as of now, “we’re still headed in the right direction,” Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, told CNN in an interview. “Inflation is heading where the Fed wants it to, and I think they’re going to have greater confidence that they can start removing some of the restrictive policies,” she said. The steps to 2% On a monthly basis, the headline PCE index rose 0.2%, a slight acceleration from the 0.1% drop seen in November when gas prices were tumbling. The core PCE index also rose by 0.2% from the prior month. Consumer spending finished the year strong and was up 0.7% from November 2023, according to Friday’s report. Adjusting for inflation, spending was up 0.5%. Economists had projected PCE would rise 2.6% for the 12 months ended in December and for consumer spending to grow 0.5% from the month before, according to FactSet estimates. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times in an aggressive campaign that has brought interest rates to 23-year highs. However, Fed policymakers have held pat during their past three meetings and are expected to take a similar approach next week before cutting back on those rates slowly but surely this year. On the goods side, any inflationary pressures from food, beverages and other non-durable items — like plastics, clothing and rubber — are being essentially canceled out by disinflation (prices rising at a slower pace) or outright deflation (prices falling) for gasoline, recreational goods, furniture and other durables, Peterson noted.

In the wake of Israel's war on Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Houthi rebels in Yemen pledged disruption on all ships destined for Israel through the Red Sea's Suez Canal. The disruption on world trade is evident in the number of companies using this container ship route - a 90 per cent decline compared to figures one year ago. Sayed Hassan/Getty Images Related article Inflation isn’t beaten yet and risks of a new price shock are rising On the services side, the biggest driver remains shelter costs. But those are improving, Peterson said. “What I do is I look at the [S&P CoreLogic] Case-Shiller home price index, and lag it 18 months,” she said. “Case-Shiller tells you that there’s going to be continued slowing and thereby shrinkage in the contribution of shelter costs to inflation. That’s good news; that’s going to take us a long way to getting back to 2%.” Other contributors of inflation within services include home and auto insurance costs that have risen because of weather-related losses, and rising prices in high-demand experiential services businesses like restaurants and hotels that have increased wages to address worker shortages. Geopolitical uncertainty and how that could spill over to energy and transportation costs remain potential risks; however, energy prices are currently down 5.4% on a three-month annualized basis, Brusuelas said. “It’s good to note the risks, but we don’t want to get lost in the forest by focusing on a couple of trees,” he said. Americans are ‘seeing their fortunes improve’ Americans’ personal incomes continued to grow in December, rising 0.3% from the month before. Savings shrank during the key holiday shopping month, landing at 3.7% of disposable income, down 0.4 percentage points from November, according to the report. On an annual basis, income is up 4.7%, compensation up 6.5%, wages and salary are up 6.8% and disposable income is up 6.9%, Brusuelas said. “One cannot escape the fact that it is a rock-solid foundation, and that the American household continues to demonstrate resilience in light of these shocks,” he said. Plus, as households’ disposable income improves, so does their sentiment, he said, noting that “puts a floor underneath the American economy.” He added: “We ain’t having no recession.” (add caption) Halfpoint Images/Moment RF/Getty Images Related article Your 401(k), gas prices and homes: 3 surprising reasons to be happy Brusuelas’ comments about sentiment echoed those of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who on Thursday delivered a major speech about the economy and the administration’s efforts in 2024. “There was a period in which [decades-high inflation] was of great concern, and prices for a while increased more than wages,” Yellen said during a fireside chat following her speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. “Now, the opposite is true: Wages are now increasing at a faster rate than inflation, people are getting ahead, they’re seeing their fortunes improve.” She added: “And I believe that if inflation stays low, they’ll begin to regain their confidence in the economy, and I believe we’re seeing that’s possible.” There’s typically about a six-month lag before improving economic data spills over into consumer confidence measures, Brusuelas said. Recent consumer data from the University of Michigan and the Conference Board have shown a rebound in people’s attitudes about the economy. That should continue, Brusuelas said, not only because of potential easing on the Fed’s side, but the policies put forth by the Biden administration . “We had a supply-driven induced inflation shock, and what was the policy response? Time, and an increase in supply, infrastructure, supply chain resilience and environmental sustainability, all adding supply to the market,” he said. “And look what happened. They do deserve serious credit here.” He added: “The Federal Reserve addressed the demand side of the equation; the administration addressed the supply side.”"

    "article_text": "FILE PHOTO: Shopping during the holiday season in New York By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prices rose marginally in December, keeping the annual increase in inflation below 3% for a third straight month, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates this year. But the timing of the anticipated rate cut is uncertain, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showing consumer spending surging at the end of 2023 as Americans splurged on goods and services over the holidays. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Financial markets have pushed the odds of a March rate cut to below 50% in a nod to the economy's continued resilience. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at the current 5.25%-5.50% range at its meeting next week. \"The inflation trajectory is improving, giving the Fed leeway to cut rates this year,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"However, the Fed has further work to do and should not be tempted to declare 'mission accomplished.'\" The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2% last month after dropping 0.1% in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Food prices rose 0.1% and the cost of energy products increased 0.3%. In the 12 months through December, the PCE price index advanced 2.6%, matching November's gain. The inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.2% after rising 0.1% in November. The so-called core PCE price index increased 2.9% year-on-year, the smallest gain since March 2021, after rising 3.2% in November. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% over time are necessary to bring inflation back to target. Core services prices excluding housing, the primary concern for policymakers, rose 0.3%. They increased 3.3% year-on-year after advancing 3.5% in November. Some economists argue that core inflation is already on target. Measured on an annualized basis, core inflation rose at a 1.5% rate over the past three months and increased at a 1.9% pace in the last six months. The government reported on Thursday that core PCE inflation advanced at a 2.0% rate in the fourth quarter after a similar rise in the July-September period. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Economists said Fed officials were likely to place more weight on the fourth-quarter inflation reading as the quarterly data ironed out month-to-month volatility. \"Inflation at 2.0% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, for two quarters in a row, is a good reason to start cutting rates,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \"The year-on-year core CPI at 2.9% gives the Fed cover to wait a few months longer and still fulfill (Chair Jerome) Powell's prediction the Fed will cut rates before inflation reaches 2%.\" Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.

Visa Inc ( NYSE:V ETR:3V64 ) View Price & Profile Visa boss says earnings show consumer resilience Published: 06:05 26 Jan 2024 EST Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has cited “resilient consumer spending” as aiding an increase in revenue and net income over the first quarter. Reporting on Thursday , the card payment services giant said revenue had climbed 9% to US$8.6 billion during the three months to December compared to a year earlier. Net income increased by 17% to US$4.9 billion meanwhile, with earnings per share jumping by a fifth to US$2.39. “Consumer spending remained resilient,” chief executive Ryan McInerney commented, despite pressures on households on the back of rapid price rises. Earnings were “driven by relatively stable growth in overall payments volume and processed transactions, plus strong growth in cross-border volume,” he said. Payment volumes grew by 8% over the quarter, the company added, with cross-border volumes jumping 16%. Payment volume growth slowed from the fourth quarter of 2023, however, chief financial officer Chris Suh pointed out in an earnings call, which he noted was a matter of time after wider economic uncertainty had built. \"Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable” though, he said, adding “our data does not indicate any meaningful behaviour change across consumer segments”. Shares slipped 3.2% in pre-market trading. Continue reading"

    "article_text": "Apparel 3 min read Retailers forced to write-off inventory due to obsolescence, cut sourcing periods Apparel retailers are facing challenges with unsold inventory, resulting in write-offs and impacting margins. They are reducing sourcing periods to mitigate the risk of obsolescence and adjusting their ordering strategies. The industry was unprepared for the sudden demand slump after the festive season in 2022, leading to stockpile. Retailers are now planning for shorter periods and buying closer to the season. Despite extended discounting, retail sales growth has been negative for like-for-like stores due to a shift in consumer spending towards travel and experiences. Writankar Mukherjee & Faizan Haidar ET Bureau Updated On Jan 26, 2024 at 09:25 AM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Apparel retailers have started to write-off unsold inventory due to product obsolescence, sourcing closer to the season and have reduced their sourcing period of merchandise from 120-150 days earlier to 60-90 days to reduce such risks of obsolescence with demand yet to pick up. The companies said such write-offs are required despite them trying to clear unsold and old inventory with deep discounting for an extended period as a lot of old merchandise is still not sold. Such measures are also going to have an impact on the margins this fiscal, executives said. Shoppers Stop Ltd chief executive Kavindra Mishra told analysts last week that while ordering the spring summer and autumn winter merchandise (for last year), the company didn't anticipate the slowness as is there right now. Advt “We decided to clean up and provide for the obsolescence of inventory which is worth around close to Rs 9 crore. Due to this, our gross margins are impacted by 60 bps (basis points),” he said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Departmental store chain Lifestyle International chief executive Devaranjan Iyer said several retailers are forced to write-off inventory due to obsolescence and have cut sourcing periods to reduce such risks in the future. The company is now placing orders for 2-3 months as compared to 6-7 months earlier. “This will give us the ability to find the shock and then react in a much more agile manner,” said Iyer. “It will also ensure inventory is not stuck for six months and the demand forecast is on a real time basis. Obsolescence has increased for the industry and this will lead to margin erosion for sure,\" he said. Apparel retail business has been impacted for more than five quarters now and the industry was not at all prepared for the sudden demand slump after the festive season in 2022. For three quarters before that, there was a huge surge in demand led by consumers refreshing their wardrobes after the pandemic as restrictions and offices had opened. Hence, all retailers had placed orders for a bullish 2023 leading to stock pile up. Rural and small town focused V-Mart Retail managing director Lalit Agarwal said the company earlier used to plan for 3-4 months, but now due to the stress in the market it has decided that 20% of the inventory should be planned for 45 days. “This will allow us to adjust in case of stress in the market and be in line with the fast fashion trend ,” he said. Shoppers Stop too is now buying closer to the season. Advt Apparel retailers have run extended discounting periods in 2023 and will continue it for the current end of season sale , apart from additional discounts offered in ecommerce marketplaces and the upcoming Republic Day sales this weekend. Retail sales in December showed a growth of 4% as compared to the same period in 2022, according to a just released survey by industry body Retailers Association of India (RAI). Despite the festive season, October and November had also shown growth of 7%. “While the industry showed growth of about 4 % pan-India, it was due to new stores and new geographies of trading. For most offline retailers, like for like stores growth was negative by about 5 %,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO at RAI. Retailers have said there is a shift in the consumer spend with people spending more for the travel or experiences rather than only buying products leading to a slowdown in sales.

    "article_text": "Copper market a ‘powder keg’ ready to explode, says Friedland Jackson Chen | January 25, 2024 | 11:21 am Markets China USA Copper Robert Friedland, founder and chairman of Ivanhoe Mines. ( Image: Screenshot from PENDA Productions video | Vimeo ) The physical market for copper is “very, very tight and now in deficit”, and with the Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, the metal is set to explode this year, said Robert Friedland in an interview with Bloomberg this week. According to the copper mining executive, the dollar-denominated price of the metal is likely to “go up a lot” by the middle of the year. “We think copper is making a bottom. I’d be willing to wager on $9,500/tonne before you go down to $7,500,” he said. The Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN) founder and co-chairman cited a recent report published by Goldman Sachs, which called for prices of $9,000/tonne this year as the global copper market is set to reach its tightest state since 2021. “This year, the shutdown of Panama’s Cobre Panama mine along with lower grades in Chile has left the market prematurely tight,” the investment bank wrote. Bullish view Backing his bullish view on copper, Friedland pointed out that China consumed more copper in 2023 than any other year, signalling that demand remains strong in the world’s top consumer economy. “Everybody talks about their weak real estate market, which is probably 20-25% of their economy, but there’s military demand, national security demand, and so physical offtake is very strong, and inventories are extremely low,” he said. “So, really, this is like a power keg ready to explode as soon as the Fed cuts in the second half,” Friedland told Bloomberg . And the growth, according to Friedland, is not just in China. “India, Europe and the rest of the world is all growing, and the demand for ESG and greening of the world economy remains very high.” However, as he pointed out in a Bloomberg interview late last year, a copper price of $9,000 is far from enough to stimulate the industry: A price of $15,000 will be needed to actually spur new mines. To reach that, the mining executive re-emphasizes the growing military demand as well as the energy transition as the main drivers of copper. Share Comments No comments found.

    "article_text": "A person carries shopping bags at a shopping center on the day after Christmas on Dec. 26, 2023 in Glendale, Calif. Strong consumer spending helped drive better-than-expected economic growth in the final months of 2023. (Mario Tama | Getty Images) The U.S. economy continues to defy expectations. The nation's gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — grew at an annual pace of 3.3% in October, November, and December, according to a report Thursday from the Commerce Department. Business The S&P 500 surges to a record high as hopes about the economy — and Big Tech — grow That was substantially faster than forecasters had expected. It was a fitting end to a year of robust economic growth, defying projections that rising interest rates would tip the economy into recession. Here are five things to know about the economy. Consumers lead the way Consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy, and Americans kept their foot on the gas — eating out in restaurants, buying sporting goods, and paying for travel. Personal spending grew at an annual pace of 1.9% in the fourth quarter, only a modest slowdown from the three months before. That was fueled by a better-than-expected labor market, with solid job growth and rising wages . \"Consumers are hanging tough,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. \"They're spending just enough to keep the economy moving forward but not so much that it would fan inflationary pressures.\" Firing on all cylinders Other parts of the economy are also holding up well. Government spending, business investment and exports all rose in the fourth quarter. Even the housing sector, which has been battered by mortgage rates that neared 8% in October, was not the drag on the economy that one would typically expect. \"Housing usually in a high-rate environment gets crushed,\" Zandi said. \"It's the thing that drives the economy into the ground. And that just didn't happen this time around.\" Instead, new home construction helped make a small positive contribution to GDP. A head scratcher on interest rates All the positive news was particularly striking given how much the Fed has raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation. Economists feared that the central bank's aggressive actions would trigger an economic downturn, as has usually been the case in the past. Instead, the economy ended last year 3.1% larger than it was 12 months earlier, raising hopes for a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation is tamed without a sharp jump in unemployment. The unemployment rate has remained under 4% for nearly two years, while wages are now growing faster than prices and the stock market is hitting record highs. \"Not only was it not a bad year,\" Zandi said. \"It was a really good year.\" People walk past a hiring sign for a restaurant in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 5, 2023. A stronger-than-expected labor market has helped boost consumer spending. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP via Getty Images) Inflation is easing Even though the economy is growing at a rapid clip, it shows no sign of overheating. Price indexes in the GDP report show inflation continued to ease, with core prices rising at an annual rate of just 2% over the last six months. That should be reassuring to the Fed, which is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates later this year. \"Despite the stronger-than-expected GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter, we view today's data as 'Fed friendly,'\" said chief economist Jay Bryson of Wells Fargo Economics. Bryson expects the central bank to begin lowering rates in May, but adds that an earlier rate cut in March is not out of the question. But there are potential setbacks As encouraging as the GDP report is, there are always potential storm clouds on the horizon. Zandi puts geopolitical risks at the top of that list, with the possibility that Middle East tensions trigger a spike in oil prices. \"That would be a mess,\" Zandi said. \"Right now we're paying close to $3 for a gallon of unleaded [gasoline] which is really good. But if we're at $3.50 or $4, that undermines confidence. It undermines purchasing power.\" Business These 5 charts show how life got pricier, but also cheaper, in 2023 So far, forecasters have been pleasantly surprised that the economy has avoided such pitfalls, and Zandi is optimistic that the encouraging trends will continue. \"The risks are not just one-sized,\" Zandi said. \"A year ago, it felt like they were all to the downside. Now you think there could be some upside as well, and you saw that in 2023.\" Transcript: JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: We got some surprisingly good news today about the U.S. economy. It grew faster than expected in October, November and December. That capped off a year in which the economy grew by 3.1%, and that would be strong enough growth at any time, but especially in a year of high interest rates, which many forecasters worried would tip the economy into recession. And what's more, even as the economy is growing rapidly, inflation continues to moderate. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Juana. SUMMERS: So, Scott, the U.S. economy has been consistently outperforming expectations. Tell us what's behind that. HORSLEY: Well, the biggest factor is you and me and all of our friends and relatives who keep on shopping and going out to eat and taking trips and generally just keeping cash registers ringing. Chief economist Mark Zandi, who's at Moody's Analytics, says part of what is fueling all that strong personal spending is a very solid job market. The economy is adding lots of jobs, and paychecks keep getting bigger. MARK ZANDI: Good news on that front is that people's wages are now rising consistently stronger than inflation, so their purchasing power is improving. And of course, that's the fodder for spending. If people's real incomes are improving, they're going to spend, and that's what they're doing. HORSLEY: Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of the overall U.S. economy, and it's proven to be remarkably durable. We saw blockbuster growth in the late summer and early fall, and that only slowed down a little bit as we moved into the winter months. The holiday shopping season turned out to be very strong, and that means the economy entered the new year with pretty good momentum, at least as far as consumers are concerned. SUMMERS: And, Scott, if household spending makes up nearly 70% of the economy, how's the other 30% doing? HORSLEY: It's doing pretty well as well. Government spending rose in the fourth quarter. So did business investment. Exports were also up. Zandi says even the housing market, which has certainly been weighed down by high interest rates, was not as big a drag in the fourth quarter as you might have expected. ZANDI: Housing usually in a high-rate environment gets crushed. It's the thing that drives the economy into the ground, into a recession. And that just didn't happen this go-around. HORSLEY: Mortgage rates did come close to 8% back in October before falling back a little bit. And as a result, a lot of people who already own homes didn't want to sell and give up their cheaper mortgages. But on the flip side, builders have been putting up a lot of new homes, and thanks to all that new construction, housing actually made a small positive contribution to GDP growth at the end of last year. SUMMERS: The reason interest rates are so high is the Federal Reserve is trying to crack down on inflation. How's that going? HORSLEY: You know, the numbers in today's report are actually pretty encouraging on that score. They showed that core prices - that is, the prices for everything but food and energy, which bounce around a lot - rose at an annual rate of just 2% over the last six months. That is right in line with the Fed's inflation target. Inflation has generally been trending down over the last year, and if that continues, then we would expect the central bank to start cutting interest rates sometime later this year. Now, given the strong job market and the very strong GDP growth, I think the Fed's going to be careful not to cut rates too quickly. Policymakers don't want to take their foot off the brake only to have inflation come roaring back. But right now, there doesn't seem to be any sign that the economy is boiling over. Rather, it's on a nice, steady simmer. Inflation's easing up. Unemployment is staying very low. That's kind of the textbook definition of a soft landing. SUMMERS: NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thank you. HORSLEY: You're welcome."

    "article_text": "The US economy ended 2023 with a bang Madison Hoff January 25, 2024 3 min read Real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter. That's above the forecast of 2.0%. After real GDP surged 4.9% in the third quarter, the latest point suggests still strong growth. The US economy was still growing at a robust pace in the last quarter of 2023 but slowed down from earlier in the year, based on new real gross domestic product data released Thursday morning. Real GDP rose at an annualized rate of 3.3% per the news release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That advance estimate is below the third estimate for the third quarter, which was an annualized rate of 4.9%. The latest figure was also above the forecast of 2.0%. \"Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected slowdowns in private inventory investment, federal government spending, residential fixed investment, and consumer spending,\" Thursday's news release said. Many areas saw increases in the last quarter, including exports and government spending. \"The increase in real GDP reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, private inventory investment, and residential fixed investment,\" the news release said. The positive GDP numbers for the past few quarters show that the US has so far avoided a recession — although it's important to note that GDP isn't the only thing to consider when looking at a recession. There are different economic indicators , such as data involving employment, that economists consider when evaluating the business cycle. The NABE (National Association for Business Economics) Business Conditions Survey shows a higher share of respondents are also feeling more optimistic about the country not experiencing a recession soon. The survey was done from December 28, 2023, to January 9, 2024. A post on NABE about it stated 91% of survey \"respondents assign a probability of 50% or less to the U.S. entering a recession over the next 12 months, up from 79% of respondents who held this view in the October survey.\" Steve Rattner, chairman and CEO of Willett Advisors, said in a recent Bloomberg interview that \"I'm not predicting a recession\" but given we're close to the edge, it could go either way. \"There are signs of the economy starting to weaken a little bit,\" Rattner said. \"The jobs market is weakening a little bit. Retail sales are weakening on an inflation-adjusted basis a little bit. You do see signs of stresses and strains, savings rates, credit card usage, subprime auto delinquencies, things like that.\" Story Continues Rattner said \"there's no question\" that last year the economy was robust compared to expectations partly because there was more purchasing power. Nonfarm payroll growth also suggests a strong jobs market last year despite smaller job growth. \"Payroll employment rose by 2.7 million in 2023 (an average monthly gain of 225,000), less than the increase of 4.8 million in 2022 (an average monthly gain of 399,000),\" a Bureau of Labor Statistics news release stated. Overall, real GDP saw a larger increase last year than in 2022 — 2.5% in 2023 compared to 1.9% in 2022. An increase in consumer spending was just one of the areas behind the increase in real GDP last year. \"The increase in real GDP in 2023 primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, state and local government spending, exports, and federal government spending that were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and inventory investment,\" the news release stated.

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news Retail CEO turnover soars, and fewer women hold top jobs in the industry By Courtney Reagan,CNBC • Published January 25, 2024 • Updated on January 25, 2024 at 4:52 pm BOOKMARKER Bess Adler | Bloomberg | Getty Images Turnover in CEO positions spiked in 2023 and jumped in the retail industry in particular. Retail CEO departures were the second-highest they have been since Challenger, Gray & Christmas started tracking them in 2002. Companies are rarely naming women as their new CEOs in the retail industry. Turnover in C-suites spiked across industries last year — and in retail in particular. Next week, new CEOs will take over at both Levi Strauss and Macy's , from their current offices elsewhere in the companies. But turnover in corner offices goes well beyond those big names. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Last year, U.S. companies announced 55% more CEO changes than in 2022, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The 1,914 departures in 2023 set a record since the firm started tracking the data in 2002. The firm tracks public U.S. businesses, along with private, government and nonprofit companies that have CEO positions. \"There was a lot of reticence among CEOs to leave their organizations in the middle of the Covid crisis,\" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \"Covid rocked retail in a really significant way. Boards didn't want to make changes, CEOs themselves didn't want to leave. And now as that storm has passed, I think there's been this pent-up demand for people to leave.\" Challenger said the pandemic accelerated changes in consumer preferences, which has forced companies' boards of directors to look for new strategies and leaders to adapt. The retail industry in 2023 saw 52 CEO departures, its second-highest number since Challenger, Gray & Christmas started tracking them, and more than double the 21 CEO turnovers in 2022, according to the firm's data. It was below 2019's record 63 CEO departures in the industry. \"Retail, probably, has seen the biggest shakeup in its leadership for a long time,\" Challenger said. In Korn Ferry's separate analysis of retail CEO turnover in 2023, the executive recruitment firm found 57% of new chief executives named in the industry last year were already working for the company they will lead. Of the 43% of external hires, 45% came from outside of retail, often in adjacent industries such as consumer packaged goods and hospitality. Women lose corner offices in retail Next week, Michelle Gass will officially take over as the 13th CEO of Levi Strauss in its 171-year history, and its first female chief executive. She's just one of a handful of women named as CEO at a major retailer in 2023. Thirteen women vacated their retail CEO positions last year, and only five women took over top jobs at companies in the sector, said John Long, retail sector lead for Korn Ferry North America. He called the trend \"surprising.\" Gass moves into the C-suite from her current position as president of the denim brand. Prior to joining Levi's in 2022, Gass served as Kohl's CEO and was succeeded by a man, Thomas Kingsbury. That trajectory was common for other women taking over top retail jobs. Four of the five incoming female retail CEOs were internal appointments, according to Korn Ferry. Despite recent progress, there are far fewer women than men in CEO positions across industries. But the percentage of female CEOs is higher across all sectors than it is in the retail industry specifically. \"When we looked at replacement CEOs [in all industries], the highest percentage of new CEOs coming in that we've ever tracked were women,\" said Challenger. \"It's a positive number, but it's only 28%, not even close to equity.\" Just 11% of incoming retail CEOs are women, according to Korn Ferry. Retail and consumer-facing companies are often scrutinized more for gender disparity at the highest levels, since demographic analysis shows the majority of consumers making retail purchases are women. \"A lot of the reasons for why certain CEOs get chosen for their roles has unfortunately less to do with the customer, ultimately, but has more to do with the mandate that the company is pursuing,\" said Long. \"So if they're pursuing a growth mandate, or a turnaround mandate, they're more often to look for folks that have that in their background somewhere.\" The tenure length of exiting retail CEOs is also stark when split by gender. The average tenure of all departing retail CEOs last year was 6.6 years, according to Korn Ferry's analysis. It was 7.7 years for men and just 3.7 years for women. Even when removing two male chief executives whose very long tenures skewed the data, the average male retail CEO tenure falls just slightly, to 6 years, still significantly longer than the average female retail CEO tenure. A few factors may explain why women have shorter tenures as retail CEOs. One reason some experts cite to explain shorter tenures for female CEOs is the \"glass cliff\" phenomenon. The theory suggests women and minorities are often elevated to higher positions when the circumstances are difficult, thereby setting them up for a higher likelihood of faster failure. \"There are systemic barriers that women face. It's improving, but it's nowhere close to parity ... getting to 10% of female CEOs has been a real struggle,\" said Lorraine Hariton, CEO of global nonprofit Catalyst, which works with companies to build better workplaces for women. \"Retail is an industry that is in flex, we know there's a lot of struggle,\" said Hariton. \"When organizations are struggling, they reach out to a broader pool of candidates, but if you are coming into a struggling situation already, your likelihood of success is much lower, especially if you weren't groomed for the job.\" That's one part of the \"glass cliff\" phenomenon, according to Hariton. The other part is that \"unfortunately, unconscious biases still exist.\" \"How are you perceived? Are you given the benefit of the doubt?\" she said. The fact that patience for women CEOs is lower could explain the shorter average tenures. Hariton notes women are \"overpopulated\" in other roles, such as general counsel, chief financial officer, human resources jobs and marketing. But seemingly, fewer companies are grooming women for CEO roles in their succession planning. \"I just look forward to a day when we don't have to talk about this,\" Hariton said.

Brian Cheung January 25, 2024 4 min read Nearly everyone, from the Federal Reserve to big-bank chiefs, thought a recession was likely to hit last year. Instead, 2023 delivered better-than-expected economic growth and falling inflation — welcome news for Wall Street investors and 401(k) holders alike. All three major stock indexes closed higher on Thursday after new federal data showed the United States’ economy grew by an estimated 2.5% over the course of 2023 , defying widespread predictions that gross domestic product would rise by a languid 0.7%. While economic output has slowed in recent months, investors’ growing optimism that the Fed will cut interest rates this year has helped power the stock market to record highs . The S&P 500 is up more than 2% at the start of this year, after jumping 26% last year. Now, many Americans whose only toehold in markets are their retirement accounts are getting in on the good times, too. Global Ocean Shipping Faces First Declines Since COVID-19 Pandemic (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images file) The average 401(k) balance rose to $107,700 by the third quarter of 2023, up 11% from the year before, according to the latest update from Fidelity Investments , one of the largest retirement plan providers in the nation. That growth appears to have encouraged many savers last year to sit back and relax as markets rose, rather than tinker with their allocations. Human resources provider Alight found that net trading activity in 401(k) plans has quieted down, falling to a rate of 0.82% last year from 1.27% in 2022 — and down substantially from 3.51% in 2020, the year the pandemic slammed into markets. The recent gains also lured account holders further into stocks, which comprised an average 70.5% of 401(k) portfolios by year’s end, up from 68.2% at the start of 2023, according to Alight data. Of course, the stock market is hardly a mirror of the economy as a whole, with share prices rising and falling for many reasons unrelated to macroeconomic trends. And personal finance experts caution against checking your 401(k) balance in panic when markets plummet, or in jubilation when they soar. Retirement savings are meant to be held over the long term and typically reward the patient; the S&P 500 has risen 172% over the last decade, despite many short-term swings. But for now, last year’s surprisingly strong economic growth has been a welcome development after a steady drumbeat of gloomy expectations. “The outperformance was really driven by consumer spending that was much stronger than expected, and the main source of support for consumer spending was a resilient labor market,” EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said. Retail spending, a litmus test for households’ budgets for goods (like apparel) and services (like dining out), rose 4.8% between December 2022 and December 2023. Despite worries that Americans had burned through cash built up during the pandemic, Thursday’s data showed personal savings expanding as a percentage of disposable income, to 4.5% in 2023 from 3.3% in 2022, driven by rising wages and a robust job market . Story Continues “If you have a job and if that job is still paying you well, relative to pre-pandemic, then it’s unlikely that you’re going to be seeing any form of recession,” Daco said. Stock markets took off as companies dodged a much-feared nosedive in consumer activity, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. The S&P 500’s massive gains were largely driven by tech-heavy giants like Nvidia, Meta and Tesla, but smaller companies have also been cheered that households are still spending at a healthy clip. While Wall Street analysts still broadly expect the stock market to keep rising, many foresee a softer year ahead. “This does not mean growth will not slow further,” Moody’s Analytics Senior Director Scott Hoyt said in a note after the GDP data landed Thursday. A recent Bloomberg survey found forecasters expect the S&P 500 to rise to 4,950 by year-end, a 3.8% upside from where the index ended last year. Recession risks haven’t evaporated, either. Some analysts warn that 2024 could see things sour for both the economy and the stock market — potentially imperiling those higher 401(k) figures. BCA Research said in December that it expects the S&P to fall as much as 27% this year, predicting that the Fed’s rate hikes haven’t fully sunk in across the economy and will further pressure households as resumed student loan payments continue and high credit card rates bite . “A slowdown in consumer spending is imminent,” the firm said. At the same time, the BCA analysts admitted they had “underestimated the strength of the U.S. consumer coming into 2023.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info"

Strong consumer spending helped drive better-than-expected economic growth in the final months of 2023. Mario Tama/Getty Images The U.S. economy continues to defy expectations. The nation's gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — grew at an annual pace of 3.3% in October, November, and December, according to a report Thursday from the Commerce Department. Business The S&P 500 surges to a record high as hopes about the economy — and Big Tech — grow That was substantially faster than forecasters had expected. It was a fitting end to a year of robust economic growth, defying projections that rising interest rates would tip the economy into recession. Here are five things to know about the economy. Consumers lead the way Consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy, and Americans kept their foot on the gas — eating out in restaurants, buying sporting goods, and paying for travel. Personal spending grew at an annual pace of 1.9% in the fourth quarter, only a modest slowdown from the three months before. That was fueled by a better-than-expected labor market, with solid job growth and rising wages . \"Consumers are hanging tough,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. \"They're spending just enough to keep the economy moving forward but not so much that it would fan inflationary pressures.\" Firing on all cylinders Other parts of the economy are also holding up well. Government spending, business investment and exports all rose in the fourth quarter. Even the housing sector, which has been battered by mortgage rates that neared 8% in October, was not the drag on the economy that one would typically expect. \"Housing usually in a high-rate environment gets crushed,\" Zandi said. \"It's the thing that drives the economy into the ground. And that just didn't happen this time around.\" Instead, new home construction helped make a small positive contribution to GDP. A head scratcher on interest rates All the positive news was particularly striking given how much the Fed has raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation. Economists feared that the central bank's aggressive actions would trigger an economic downturn, as has usually been the case in the past. Instead, the economy ended last year 3.1% larger than it was 12 months earlier, raising hopes for a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation is tamed without a sharp jump in unemployment. The unemployment rate has remained under 4% for nearly two years, while wages are now growing faster than prices and the stock market is hitting record highs. \"Not only was it not a bad year,\" Zandi said. \"It was a really good year.\" Enlarge this image People walk past a hiring sign for a restaurant in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 5, 2023.

A stronger-than-expected labor market has helped boost consumer spending. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Inflation is easing Even though the economy is growing at a rapid clip, it shows no sign of overheating. Price indexes in the GDP report show inflation continued to ease, with core prices rising at an annual rate of just 2% over the last six months. That should be reassuring to the Fed, which is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates later this year. \"Despite the stronger-than-expected GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter, we view today's data as 'Fed friendly,'\" said chief economist Jay Bryson of Wells Fargo Economics. Bryson expects the central bank to begin lowering rates in May, but adds that an earlier rate cut in March is not out of the question. But there are potential setbacks As encouraging as the GDP report is, there are always potential storm clouds on the horizon. Zandi puts geopolitical risks at the top of that list, with the possibility that Middle East tensions trigger a spike in oil prices. \"That would be a mess,\" Zandi said. \"Right now we're paying close to $3 for a gallon of unleaded [gasoline] which is really good. But if we're at $3.50 or $4, that undermines confidence. It undermines purchasing power.\" Business These 5 charts show how life got pricier, but also cheaper, in 2023 So far, forecasters have been pleasantly surprised that the economy has avoided such pitfalls, and Zandi is optimistic that the encouraging trends will continue. \"The risks are not just one-sized,\" Zandi said. \"A year ago, it felt like they were all to the downside. Now you think there could be some upside as well, and you saw that in 2023.\" interest rates GDP inflation U.S. economy Facebook Flipboard Email"

The world’s biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, fueled by a resilient jobs market and consumer spending, the Commerce Department said. This brings full-year growth to 2.5 percent, an acceleration from the 2022 level. The performance will likely be welcome news for the Biden administration, which is pushing to convince voters that it has done a good job reining in costs while spurring investments to support the economy. The latest data also strengthens optimism that the United States is achieving a “soft landing,” where inflation comes down on the back of higher interest rates, without triggering a damaging recession. The fourth quarter GDP jump “reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, state and local government spending” and other areas, said the Commerce Department. At the start of 2023, analysts expected consumer spending to lose steam as households drew down on accumulated savings during the Covid-19 pandemic and as borrowing costs stayed high. Some warned that the country could enter a recession, but growth has been supported by surprising strength in the labor market, with low unemployment even as hiring starts to cool. – Slower growth – “Economic growth has been more resilient than we anticipated going into 2023,” Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic told AFP. “The largest surprise was the ongoing strength in the labor market, which fueled robust job and wage gains,” she added. This in turn bolstered personal incomes that helped to support consumer spending. But the economy is not out of the woods yet, given that employment growth in some sectors has weakened and interest rates remain at a 22-year high. “We still expect the economy to grow in 2024, but at a slower pace,” Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics told AFP. “As long as the labor market holds it together and unemployment drifts only gradually higher, the consumer will continue to power this expansion,” he added. Residential investment is also likely to be a bigger factor behind growth, with the Federal Reserve expected to lower interest rates and homebuilders set to capitalize on lower mortgage rates and a frozen existing-home market, Yaros said. The annual GDP rate is slightly above the Fed’s longer-run projection of 1.8 percent. But this is unlikely to stop policymakers from cutting rates as soon as in May or June, Bostjancic said. “Inflation will be the key determinant of the timing and degree of Fed easing this year,” she added.

    "article_text": "BREAKING: Fourth Quarter Annualized GDP 3.3%, Down From Q3's 4.9% from Bureau of Economic Analysis 8:55 AM | January 25, 2024 Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 (table 1), according to the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the third quarter, real GDP increased 4.9 percent. … Advertisement The increase in real GDP reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, private inventory investment, and residential fixed investment (table 2). Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. [ This looks like a pretty solid result, supported in the details. All of the numbers here are annualized and adjusted for inflation (‘real’): Government spending rose 3.3%, so it’s not a case of numbers getting goosed by the Biden administration. Consumer spending dropped a little to a 2.8% growth level, down from 3.1% in Q4 but still a decent level of movement, although perhaps a little disappointing given the holiday season. Final sales of domestic product grew a nearly identical 3.2%, which means this isn’t an inventory-stocking phenomenon. The biggest boost to GDP appears to be a big gap between exports (+6.3%) and imports (+1.9), which may not last into the next quarter. That’s the biggest positive gap in a year, in fact. — Ed ] Read More From Bureau of Economic Analysis Join the conversation as a VIP Member Login to Leave a Comment Trending on HotAir Videos"

The report said gross domestic product shot up by 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter after surging by 4.9 percent in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to jump by 2.0 percent. The stronger than expected GDP growth partly reflected a continued surge in consumer spending, which shot up by 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter after spiking by 3.1 percent in the third quarter. The Commerce Department said the continued consumer spending growth reflected increases in spending on both services and goods. Within services, the leading contributors were food services and accommodations as well as health care, while pharmaceutical products and computer software helped lead the increase in spending on goods. Increases in exports, government spending, non-residential fixed investment, private inventory investment and residential fixed investment also contributed to the jump in GDP. 'Fourth-quarter 2023 GDP growth beat all expectations thanks to strong consumer and government spending plus a positive contribution from net trade,' said ING Chief International Economist James Knightley. Meanwhile, the report said the slowdown in the pace of GDP growth compared to the previous quarter reflected slowdowns in private inventory investment, federal government spending, residential fixed investment, and consumer spending. On the inflation front, the Commerce Department said the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a 2.6 percent jump in the third quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter, the same as in the third quarter. 'First-quarter GDP growth is expected to be weaker based on business surveys, but the Fed is close to declaring victory on inflation with the second consecutive 2% quarterly core inflation reading,' said Knightley.

Compared to Q2, the acceleration in real GDP in Q3 primarily reflected an upturn in exports and accelerations in consumer spending and private inventory investment that were partly offset by a deceleration in non-residential fixed investment. Imports turned up. Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased by 1.5 per cent in Q3 2023, the same as previously published. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental measure of US economic activity that equally weights GDP and GDI, increased by 3.2 per cent in Q3 2023, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate. Profits from current production increased by $108.7 billion in Q3 2023, an upward revision of $3 billion from the previous estimate.

    "article_text": "The economy grew a faster than expected 3.3% late last year Paul Davidson, USA TODAY Updated January 25, 2024 4 min read The U.S. economy slowed during the final three months of 2023 but still turned in a surprisingly strong showing as a rise in consumer spending offset a more modest gain in business investment. A pullback is likely in 2024 as high interest rates and inflation take a bigger toll on growth and a burst of post-pandemic consumption runs dry. The nation’s gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.3% in the October-December period, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That’s down from sizzling growth of 4.9% in the third quarter but well above the 2% advance predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Holiday sales were strong late last year. How much did the economy grow in 2023? For all of 2023, the economy grew a healthy 2.5%, defying predictions that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rates to fight inflation would tip the nation into a recession. Give credit to consumers whose strong pay increases finally began outpacing inflation. Households also continued to rely on a robust but declining cache of pandemic-related savings. Is consumer spending on the rise? Consumer spending grew a solid 2.8% late last year following a 3.1% increase in the third quarter. Such purchases make up about 70% of economic activity. Besides sturdy wage growth and savings, households have benefited from job gains that have slowed but still increased a solid average of 164,000 in the last three months of the year. Employers are paring back hiring but have been reluctant to lay off workers following widespread pandemic-related worker shortages. Many economists believe something has to give this year. Low- and middle-income households have depleted their pandemic reserves and rung up record credit card debt while pushing delinquencies to a 13-year high as they struggle with high inflation and borrowing costs. As a result, some economists believe that a mild recession will finally happen this year as layoffs spread beyond household names that already have cut jobs in recent weeks, such as Google, Amazon and Wayfair. Broadly, though, the outlook for 2024 has brightened recently. Inflation has eased more swiftly than anticipated even as consumer spending has stayed resilient. The inflation slowdown – to 3.4% last month from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 – has led the Federal Reserve to signal it’s likely done hiking its key interest rate after hoisting it to a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%. The S&P 500 index, in turn, closed at another record high Wednesday, making upper-middle and higher-income Americans feel wealthier and encouraging their increased spending. Story Continues Despite the economy's strong fourth-quarter showing, consumer prices rose at an annualized rate of just 2% last quarter, according to the report. That should keep the Fed on track to start cutting interest rates in early spring, says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, How likely is a recession in 2024? Forecasters expect the economy to grow 1.6% this year, up from their estimate of 1.3% in December and 0.8% as recently as August, according to a survey this month by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators. That kind of growth likely means the Fed will have achieved a coveted \"soft landing\" by restraining the economy enough to tamp down inflation without triggering a recession. Such an outcome could boost President Joe Biden's reelection chances in November while a slump could be a significant blow. The surveyed economists reckon there’s a 42% chance of a downturn in 2024, still historically high but down from 61% in May. Several experts upgraded their outlook after retail sales in December and for the holidays were stronger than expected, giving the economy more momentum heading into the current quarter. Here's how other parts of the economy performed: Business investment rises Business investment grew 1.9% after rising 1.4% the prior quarter. Outlays for computers, delivery trucks, factory machines, and other equipment increased by just 1% as companies faced higher borrowing costs. Spending on buildings, oil rigs and other structures jumped 3.2%. Government spending increases Government outlays rose for the sixth straight quarter, increasing 3.3% after a 5.8% advance in the previous quarter. Federal spending increased by 2.5% and state and local purchases rose by 3.7% amid a wave of infrastructure and clean energy projects spurred by sweeping federal legislation. Trade lifts growth Trade boosted growth as exports outpaced imports. Exports leaped 6.3% while imports edged up 1.9%. That narrowed the trade gap, adding to economic growth. Housing is a slight positive for growth Housing construction and renovation edged up 1.1%, its second increase after nine straight quarterly declines. The Federal Reserve's sharp interest rate hikes have pushed up mortgage rates and dampened existing home sales. Many homeowners aren’t putting their houses up for sale because they don’t want to be socked with a much higher mortgage rate for their new home. But rates have dropped recently from about 8% to less than 7% on the prospect of slowing inflation and Fed rate cuts.

That’s important because consumer spending drives 70% of the U.S. economy. With wage growth outpacing inflation, consumer sentiment spiking, and inflation expectations plunging, the stage is set for continued strength in consumer spending trends in 2024. And last night, Netflix reported its biggest quarterly subscriber growth in years. It added more than 13 million subscribers last quarter, smashing consensus estimates and foretelling more strong earnings to come. Source: xalien / Shutterstock Tech stocks have rocketed to all-time highs in January. And the strong earnings report we just saw from Netflix ( NFLX ) suggests they’ll soar to even higher highs in February. In part, that’s because the recent rally in tech stocks has been fueled by the realization that corporate earnings should be really strong this year. Plus, the data suggests that the economy – which many thought was on the verge of a recession – is actually on the mend right now. Together, these bullish developments should help propel stocks higher over the coming weeks and months. Netflix Earnings Say a Rally’s In the Forecast According to retail sales results, consumer spending broke records this past holiday season. That’s important because consumer spending drives 70% of the U.S. economy . Since consumers have increased their spending recently, the economy is picking up steam, too. And they likely won’t stop spending anytime soon, either. That’s because wage growth has outpaced inflation for several months now. And that’s allowing consumers to rebuild their savings, giving them more real purchasing power. Perhaps that’s why the University of Michigan’s January consumer sentiment index jumped to its highest levels since the summer of 2021. Not to mention, consumer inflation expectations have also dropped to their lowest levels since the pandemic emerged. With wage growth outpacing inflation, consumer sentiment spiking, and inflation expectations plunging, the stage is set for continued strength in consumer spending trends in 2024. At the same time, the world’s largest chipmaker – Taiwan Semiconductor ( TSM ) – said last week that 2024 will be a great year for the semiconductor industry thanks to burgeoning demand for AI chips. And last night, Netflix reported its biggest quarterly subscriber growth in years. It added more than 13 million subscribers last quarter, smashing consensus estimates. These bullish developments bode exceptionally well for the stock market. The Final Word Folks, the economy is back. I know, I know – that’s not what the media headlines are saying. But I’m not ruled by headlines. I listen to the data. And the data is screaming that the economy is on the mend. That means fourth-quarter corporate earnings should be very strong. Over the next month or so, companies across the world will report their results for the final three months of 2023 and deliver their outlooks for 2024. The data suggests that those numbers will be quite good – and that the outlooks could be even better. If so, then this red-hot tech rally is about to get even hotter. That’s why, just this morning, we executed a few new trades to play this rally. We think these tech stocks are particularly well-positioned to soar this earnings season.

As the Commerce Department's report hits Thursday morning, Wall Street's attention almost immediately will turn to what the signs are for growth going into 2024. Two other key elements will take the focus as investors digest the report: the state of consumer spending, which accounted for about two-thirds of all activity in Q3, and inflation. Consumers shop in Rosemead, California, on Dec. 12, 2023. Frederic J. Brown | Afp | Getty Images Economic growth likely slowed to its weakest pace in a year and a half to end 2023, possibly setting the stage for a more pronounced slowdown ahead, according to Wall Street economists. The consensus outlook for the fourth quarter is that gross domestic product grew at a 2% seasonally adjusted annualized pace, sliding downward from the 4.9% in Q3 and the lowest reading since the 0.6% decline in the second quarter of 2022. As the U.S. Department of Commerce's report hits Thursday morning, Wall Street's attention almost immediately will turn to what the signs are for growth going into 2024. The report likely will \"represent a sharp deceleration\" from the previous period, Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a client note. \"Incoming data continue to point to a resilient, but cooling, U.S. economy, led by consumer spending on the back of a tight labor market, higher than expected holiday spending, and moderately strong balance sheets.\" BofA has a below-consensus view that GDP — the sum of all goods and services produced during the period — will slow to a 1.5% pace, largely because parts of the economy not directly related to consumer spending, such as nonresidential business fixed investment and housing, will tail off. In addition, the bank expects a slowdown in inventory restocking to shave close to a full percentage point off the headline number. Looking forward, BofA forecasts the first quarter of 2024 to show growth of just 1%. \"Consumer spending is likely to slow from its current pace due to lagged effects from tighter financial conditions, higher energy prices, and cooling labor market,\" Mishra said. Elsewhere on Wall Street, expectations are mixed. Goldman Sachs earlier this week lifted its Q4 estimate to 2.1%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, taking its full-year GDP outlook to 2.8%. One significant factor Goldman sees is stronger-than-expected state and local government spending, which boosted Q3 growth by nearly a full percentage point and is predicted to show a 4.5% increase in the final three months of the year. The bank's economists also see growth holding up fairly well in 2024, ending the year at 2.1%. Two other key elements will take the focus as investors digest the GDP report: the state of consumer spending , which accounted for about two-thirds of all activity in Q3, and inflation, specifically how the Federal Reserve might react to personal consumption prices that come out of Thursday's report as well as a separate Commerce Department release Friday. \"We do expect the economy to slow … further in 2024 as the impact of monetary tightening continues to weigh on economic activities,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at tax consultancy RSM. \"However, we do not expect the economy to hit a recession.\" watch now VIDEO 6:29 06:29 It does feel like perceptions are changing around the economy, says Brookings' Ben Harris Squawk Box RSM expects the GDP report to show a 2.4% gain on solid growth in consumer spending, though some economists say December's larger-than-expected retail sales increase was fueled by seasonal distortions in the data that will be corrected in January. Citigroup agrees with the consensus call of 2% growth in Q4 but sees tougher times ahead, mainly because of the lagged effect the Fed's previous rate cuts will exert, as well as inflation that could turn out to be more durable than anticipated. \"Data released [Thursday] may in retrospect turn out to document the one quarter of true 'Goldilocks' conditions,\" Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote. \"But we do not share the market and Fed's sanguine assessment of the macroeconomy over the remainder of the year.\" Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO: The S&P 500 is officially in a bull market now.

Retail credit not a worry, but needs monitoring Lenders must differentially price their retail loans so that individuals who display healthy savings behaviour and positive net worth get loans at better terms than those who don’t Updated - January 23, 2024 at 09:44 PM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/retail-credit-not-a-worry-but-needs-monitoring/article67768886.ece Copy Banks’ retail books are well-diversified | Photo Credit: im a photographer and an artist Recent Reserve Bank of India data shows Indian households adding financial liabilities at a faster clip than financial assets. The credit-driven spending spree has been propping up private consumption and GDP growth. Indian banks owe their recent profit improvements to the retail credit boom. All this is perhaps why RBI researchers decided to take a deep-dive to analyse if retail credit is over-heating and flowing to the wrong kinds of borrowers, in the latest Bulletin. The paper, in fact, finds that the expansion in retail loans in recent years is not abnormal. The 16.1 per cent growth in banks’ retail books in the last 12 years is much lower than the scorching 26.4 per cent growth in the previous 12-year block. Banks’ retail books are well-diversified. Home loans now make up less than half of retail credit, while unsecured credit card, durable and other loans make up nearly 35 per cent. A breakdown of trends into pre- and post-Covid periods, shows a distinct spike in personal loans, durable and vehicle loans after the pandemic, even as home loan growth has dipped. But as the increase in unsecured lending has gone hand-in-hand with strict credit scoring and low delinquencies, it concludes that banks are not on a shaky wicket in chasing the retail borrower. While the paper suggests that all is well with retail credit, there are some loose ends. For one, the shift in retail loans away from home loans towards personal, durable and vehicle loans, suggests that consumers are increasingly willing to borrow not to create assets, but to meet the gap between their current income and lifestyle aspirations. The rise of this consumer credit culture could lead to over-stretched household balance sheets. This needs closer monitoring, but household savings data in India is currently reported with a year’s lag. Two, RBI actions show that it is more concerned about NBFCs’ retail lending than banks’, but it has not attempted a deep dive into the former. If lack of data is the issue, it should perhaps get more granular disclosures from NBFCs and credit scoring agencies, to repeat this analysis for non-banks. The paper makes a passing suggestion that policymakers and lenders need to use technology to come up with more holistic measures — such as debt-service ratio and debt-to-income ratio — to assess retail borrowers. This is an excellent suggestion as lenders today rely on blunt instruments such as loan-to-value, multiple of annual income and credit scores to make lending decisions. In fact, with the recent advent of account aggregator services which enable consolidation of an individual’s assets and liabilities at the PAN level, both lenders and retail borrowers can be nudged to periodically access personal balance sheets. Lenders must differentially price their retail loans so that individuals who display healthy savings behaviour and positive net worth get loans at better terms than those who don’t.

    "article_text": "ADVERTISEMENT Low spenders to drive consumption trends this year – projection Report says consumer spending is set to rise in 2024 after suffering a squeeze in 2023 by ALFRED ONYANGO Africa 17 January 2024 - 14:26 ADVERTISEMENT In Summary Entry level consumers, the ones spending between $2−4 (Sh322-650) daily, will be the ones driving the consumption demand. The upper segment's preferences will evolve to include more refined tastes geared toward luxury and convenience. Audio By Vocalize Customers shopping at a supermarket. /FILE Consumer spending will pick up this year, with low spenders expected to be lead drivers of consumption demand in the country and the Africa at large. According to the 2024 economic outlook report by the Nigerian Intelligence firm Stears, consumer spending suffered a squeeze in 2023 on the back of Covid-19 effects, high commodity prices, global monetary tightening and food protectionism. \"These factors occasioned a consumer landscape characterized with unhappy consumers last year,\" the report reads. “This resulted to consumers closing their wallets to non essentials, and exercise budget cuts on their day-to-day living.\" However, the firm says African countries like Kenya will have a likelihood of seeing gradual increase in consumer spending as inflation slows. “Overally, spending will be cautious and value-driven.” The low spenders, also referred to as entry level consumers, are people spending between $2−4 (Sh322-650) daily. On the other hand, upper segment consumers' preferences are projected to evolve to include more refined tastes geared toward luxury and convenience. The upper segment refers to the class of people with annual salaries ranging $10,000 to $1 million, whose spending is unlocked through access to credit, savings, and disposable income. Despite broader economic pressures, the upper income consumer is expected to maintain brand loyalty and continue their consumption of luxury goods, offering opportunities for high-end brands. Rise in individual loans is also projected to propel consumer spending this year, as promotional offers and sales are expected to attract more consumers, especially those who are price sensitive. Generally in Africa, the report says consumers will be distinct from the general global norms, and be more price-conscious. To back this, the study says Sub Sahara’s GDP per capita underscores a consumer market deeply rooted in price consciousness, reflecting heightened focus on affordability. “The purchasing patterns thus favour essential goods and value-for-money products,” it says. Inflation, one of the determining factors of consumption trends in the region, is projected at 13 per cent this year, down from 15.8 per cent in 2023, but still high compared to the global average of (5.8% in 2024). On the global front, the world inflation was projected to average 6.9 per cent in 2023, the highest level since 1996, impacting consumer trends globally. However, the report now says bright spots exist in the consumer landscape this year. “Global inflation is expected to slow to 5.8 per cent in 2024 from the previous 6.9 per cent in 2023, pointing towards reopened consumer wallets.” Last year’s survey by the firm noted about 39 per cent of global respondents said they would spend less money compared to 25 per cent that said they would spend more. As a result, the IPSOS global consumer confidence index remained below 46 through 2023; the first time since 2015. This year, the firm says consumer spending will pick up driven by emerging markets in Asia and Latin America as they are highly optimistic about consumer spending. “Housing, food, transport, restaurants and culture will gulp over 50 per cent of global consumer spending in 2024, largely reflecting bias for essential goods as consumers recover from the 2022−2023 inflation surge that eroded savings,” the report reads. There is also an expected increase in social spending, particularly among older generations (baby boomers), signalling that brand strategies should not solely focus on the younger generation. “Further, there is the projection in rising demand for AI, for instance voice assistants, to enable global consumption decisions.” ADVERTISEMENT Most Popular 1 Wilson flight path to be affected as Bomas constructions take shape News 2 Tragic: Betty Bayo had planned a gateway with son News 3 Gor Mahia Fans March to Kango Kajaramogi to Honour Raila Odinga video 4 How Natembeya’s rise could redraw Ruto’s 2027 game plan News 5 How to nominate your 'Star Person of the Year' 2025 News Premium Articles Museveni warns of future conflicts over Uganda’s access to Indian Ocean News Broke ex-governor desperately begs for help from politicos Corridors-of-power Gachagua to Ruto: Our alliance is to send you home, not share power News How Sulumeti handled delicate Bomas discussion on power sharing News How Natembeya’s rise could redraw Ruto’s 2027 game plan News ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Most Popular 1 Wilson flight path to be affected as Bomas constructions take shape News 2 Tragic: Betty Bayo had planned a gateway with son News 3 Gor Mahia Fans March to Kango Kajaramogi to Honour Raila Odinga video 4 How Natembeya’s rise could redraw Ruto’s 2027 game plan News 5 How to nominate your 'Star Person of the Year' 2025 News 6 State agencies announce jobs across key sectors News 7 Kenya School of Government nullifies certificates News 8 Voting now open for 2025 'Star Person of the Year' award News 9 Cabinet approves dualling of Kiambu Road Realtime 10 Who was gospel musician Betty Bayo? video ADVERTISEMENT News World Africa Corridors-of-power Infographics Podcasts Big-read Fact Checker News Brief Star-farmer Twitter Space Realtime Breakfast-briefing Counties Rift-valley Nairobi North-eastern Coast Central Nyanza Western Eastern Business Kenya Markets Commentary Health Opinion Columnists Leader Star-blogs Cartoon Sports Football Athletics Rugby Tennis Golf Boxing Basketball Siasa Sasa Lifestyle Technology Entertainment Society Fashion Food Travel Books Events Climate Change In-pictures video Partner Sites Mpasho Radio Jambo Songaplay Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © The Star 2024.

    "article_text": "Consumer Cos Climb After Sentiment Data -- Consumer Roundup Published on 01/19/2024 at 05:33 pm EST Dow Jones Share Spirit Airlines, Inc. +0.43% Consumer companies rose as traders bet consumer spending and home sales would rebound from a late 2023 slump. Consumer sentiment leapt 13% in the first half of January from December, the University of Michigan said, as mortgage rates dropped and inflation fears subsided. The reading completed the strongest two-month recovery in the sentiment index since 1991. Strategists at brokerage Jefferies said a brief dip in spending by middle-income consumers has been more than offset by increased spending from wealthier Americans, who are less susceptible to inflation in staples and energy. \"We had thought that consumer spending was going to decelerate sharply during the holiday season after consumers overextended themselves over the summer,\" said the Jefferies strategists. \"However, the \"pullback\", if you could even call it that, was limited to the month of October!\" One realtor who specializes in selling beach homes in Florida said he has seen as many purchase inquiries in the first three weeks of 2024 as he fielded in the last three months of 2023. Used-home sales slid 19% in 2023 from the prior year to 4.09 million, the lowest full-year level since 1995, the National Association of Realtors said. Spirit Airlines rallied after the discount carrier said it was refinancing $1.1 billion in debt, alleviating some of the financial pressure created by the collapse of its merger with rival JetBlue.

In particular, delinquency rates were \"lower than they were in 2019,\" Squeri told CNBC's Scott Wapner. The signs of resilient consumer spending run somewhat counter to persistent inflation. American Express CEO Stephen Squeri on Friday said the credit card company saw \"good consumer spending\" during the holidays and signs of strong overall health for U.S. spending. Stream Connecticut News for free, 24/7, wherever you are. WATCH HERE In particular, delinquency rates were \"lower than they were in 2019,\" Squeri told CNBC's Scott Wapner in an interview at the American Express PGA Tour event in La Quinta, California. \"Our customers are high-spending premium customers, and they are continuing to spend,\" he said. The signs of resilient consumer spending run somewhat counter to persistent inflation. December's consumer price index increased 0.3%, hotter than the 0.2% expected by economists. But Squeri said he's not surprised, adding he's of the opinion that the U.S. is in the middle of a \"soft landing,\" slowing spending and bringing inflation down — without spurring a recession. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said earlier this week that he remains cautious on the U.S. economy, along with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said it's hard to imagine the number of Federal Reserve rate cuts that the market seems to be calling for in 2024. \"I mean look, recessions do happen,\" Squeri said Friday. \"The nice part about recessions is there's always a recovery. … We'll get through whatever we need to get through, and part of that is because of our customer base, and our colleagues that are supporting our customers.\" American Express reports its fourth-quarter earnings Jan 26.

Δ On a call with analysts Friday (Jan. 19) discussing the United Kingdom-based aggregator’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results, CEO Will Shu noted that, while he expects inflation “will decrease,” it nonetheless will still “be happening,” but he contended that it will be “a very good thing” for the business. “If wage inflation is at parity with food inflation, or maybe food inflation is a little bit less, that’s just going to create much more demand, in my view because I think the biggest issue that we’ve seen in our markets in Europe, as food inflation has outpaced wage inflation in some cases 3X, 2.5X, [is that] that just puts the consumer in a really different environment,” Shu said. In the quarter, the number of average monthly active consumers grew by about 400,000 relative to the previous quarter but remained down by about 100,000 year over year, falling 2%. Total orders and revenue held roughly flat year over year. Overall, Shu highlighted “stabilization in customer behavior.” The wage-versus-inflation gap has been a pressing issue for consumers in recent years. In the United States, for instance, the October installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “Consumer Inflation Sentiment” series, “ Consumers’ Economy Concerns and the Price of High Prices ,” which drew from a survey of more than 2,100 U.S. consumers, found that 85% said their wages have not kept pace with inflation. Plus, 97% of consumers expressed worry about economic conditions. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue As consumers face financial strain, many pull back on ordering restaurant delivery. PYMNTS Intelligence’s report “ Connected Dining: Rising Costs Push Consumers Toward Pickup ,” which drew from a survey of more than 2,100 U.S. consumers, found that 48% said inflation has made them more likely to choose pickup over delivery. Additional research from the “Connected Dining” series revealed that among consumers who do not use aggregators, 50% stated that aggregators are too expensive, and 1 in 5 nonusers cited this as the most important reason they do not use the ordering channel. Deliveroo has also been looking to drive adoption, much like its counterparts across the pond, with its subscription program, Deliveroo Plus , offering free delivery options for set monthly rates, among other perks. One way the aggregator has been looking to drive adoption among young consumers is through pushing its student discounts, according to Deliveroo Chief Financial Officer Scilla Grimble , much as DoorDash has done with DashPass for Students in the U.S. Additionally, Grimble noted that in the United Arab Emirates, the British aggregator has offered Amazon Prime members a free yearlong subscription, much as Grubhub has done with Amazon in the U.S. and as DoorDash has done in Canada . “We’re iterating on the different benefits that we can offer consumers, but it’s a key part of our strategy,” Shu added, highlighting that the program has yielded “big differences in retention and frequency” for members versus nonmembers.

    "article_text": "Most Gen X Cardholders Revolve Their Balances, Leading All Generations By PYMNTS | January 19, 2024 | In times of financial hardship, revolving a credit card balance to future months rather than paying it off entirely is a strategy consumers commonly adopt. But despite the oft-held assumption that members of Generation X are more averse to credit use than other generations because of a generally healthier financial lifestyle, a greater share of these consumers turn to revolving their balance than any other generation. Specifically, 57% of consumers from this generation did it at least occasionally in the last year, according to PYMNTS Intelligence data .

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions . Δ This is just one key finding detailed in the most recent edition of “ New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report ,”a PYMNTS Intelligence and LendingClub collaboration. “The Credit Card Use Deep Dive Edition” examines the financial lifestyles of U.S. consumers and explores how they use credit cards to manage their cash flows and get by. Gen Xers’ high propensity to revolve has been building, as the portion of Gen X consumers revolving their credit increased by 7 percentage points since November 2022, also leading all generations. In comparison, the corresponding share of millennial revolvers increased by 5 percentage points, and baby boomers and seniors remained equal. During this time, persistent inflation amid wage stagnation impacted struggling consumers’ economy. In the case of Gen Xers, those with difficulties to make ends meet account for around 64% of this cohort. With such a large share of the population struggling financially, it follows that many of them would turn to credit products to stretch their budget. The average credit limit for a Gen X consumer is nearly $10,200, the second highest of all generations and very close to the leading group, baby boomers and seniors. And nearly 1 in 3 have reached that limit at least occasionally in the last year; for comparison, 15% of baby boomers and seniors have done the same. With high dependence on credit cards for living, financial hardship is typically associated with a higher utilization of installment or split payment plans. In the last year, Gen Xers paid for 3.6 products in installments on average, whereas baby boomers and seniors paid for just 2.2 on average in this way. Sixty-nine percent of consumers from this generation have made credit card installment payments in the last year, while 13% used some form of buy now, pay later (BNPL) scheme. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Whether opting for installment payment plans or revolving credit card balances, Generation X is heavily turning to credit products to better balance their finances. However, their relatively healthy financial position and high credit limit allows them to turn to this practice more often than other generations do.

WATCH HERE \"Despite a positive start to the early part of Q3 FY24, WOSG then experienced a volatile trading performance in the run-up to and beyond Christmas, as the challenging macro-economic conditions impacted consumer spending in the luxury retail sector,\" the company said in a trading update. \"We now expect these challenging conditions to remain for the balance of our fiscal year.\" The company now expects revenue of £1.53-1.55 billion ($1.94-1.97 billion), down from its previous guidance of £1.65-1.7 billion. Constant currency revenue growth — which excludes fluctuations in currency — was revised sharply downwards from 8-11% to 2-3%, while EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin is now projected at 8.7-8.9%. The company said that demand for its key brands remains strong in the U.S., where sales continue to grow by double digits, but the U.K. was \"more challenged\" and impacted a broad range of luxury watch brands and non-branded jewellery. \"The festive period was particularly volatile this year for the luxury sector, with consumers allocating spend to other categories such as fashion, beauty, hospitality and travel. Whilst we are disappointed with this trend, we are encouraged by our market share gains in both the U.S. and U.K.,\" Watches of Switzerland CEO Brian Duffy said in a statement. \"We remain confident in the markets in which we operate, our model and the delivery of our Long Range Plan announced to the market in November 2023.\" Watches of Switzerland is the U.K.'s biggest seller of high-end brands such as Rolex, OMEGA, Cartier, Breitling and TAG Heuer, operating 211 showrooms across the U.K., U.S. and Europe and employing over 2,800 people. Stock still a \"buy,\" analysts say The British-headquartered retailer in November outlined plans to more than double sales and profits by the 2028 fiscal year, as Duffy said there were opportunities in the pre-owned market, particularly in certified pre-owned Rolex watches. Despite the market panic, analysts at both Jefferies and Investec reiterated their \"buy\" ratings on Watches of Switzerland stock in flash notes on Thursday. Jefferies equity analysts said they took \"some comfort in the U.S. operations having continued to grow at a double-digit rate.\" \"Today's unwelcome developments do not detract from WOSG's ongoing ability to grow share in its two key end markets,\" they said. \"However, the extent of the adjustments to the guidance range will be painful to navigate in the near term.\" Investec analysts noted that management reiterated its confidence in the five-year long range plan announced in November. \"Delivery of this is not reflected in valuation, but the market is likely to focus on short term trading in the near term,\" they added.

Retail and food services sales totaled $709.9 billion last month, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That was also up 0.6% from the month before and continued the holiday rebound after a lackluster October . “I thought this report was surprisingly positive,” said Ted Rossman, a credit and personal finance expert with Bankrate . “I think really the entire holiday season came in better than expected. It didn't start out that way. October was pretty weak by comparison.” The National Retail Federation celebrated the new figures and the 3.8% annual growth in what it calls core retail sales. The NRF says Americans spent a record $964.4 billion this holiday season. “Consumer spending was remarkably resilient throughout 2023 and finished the year with a solid pace for the holiday season,” NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a news release. “Although inflation has been the biggest concern for households, the price of goods eased notably and was helped by a healthy labor market, underscoring a successful holiday season for retailers.” Colorado State University economist Stephan Weiler said for all the concerns about inflation, Americans weren’t shy about buying this holiday. “Sometimes it's worth looking at what people do as opposed to what people say,” Weiler said. And Weiler said this new retail report “bodes well for the economy.” Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the economy, he said. We’re unlikely to see a “burner-type of economy” in 2024, but consumer spending, the job market and other important factors look strong enough to give us the soft landing the economic policymakers have been after, Weiler said. “I don't see a recession coming from these numbers,” Rossman also said of the December retail report. But both Rossman and Weiler said the retail figures might be so hot that they throw cold water on the Federal Reserve’s desire to cut interest rates early in the year. The 5.6% annual sales growth beat the 3.4% inflation. Though Rossman and his Bankrate colleagues note that Americans are still largely playing catch-up to the cumulative effect of inflation. Prices are up 20% from where they were three years ago, they said. The Commerce Department on Wednesday also reported that full-year retail and food service sales increased 3.2% from 2022. Comparing this December to the previous one, retail sales, omitting food services, were up 4.8%. Sales were down for furniture stores, home improvement stores, gas stations, and department stores. But sales were up about 10% for e-commerce, on electronics, and at personal care stores. Americans spent a record $222.1 billion online this holiday season, according to another recent report from Adobe Analytics. Sales at restaurants and bars increased over 11%, which Rossman said shows continued demand for services following the pandemic. Rossman said credit card balances were already at record highs even before the holidays. “And I'm sure they grew substantially,” he said. Total household debt reached $17.29 trillion, while credit card balances reached $1.08 trillion nationwide, according to the 2023 third-quarter report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The fourth-quarter report is coming out in a few weeks. What’s good for the overall economy – strong retail spending – might not be for the individual household, he said. “If you're among the half of credit card holders who are lugging around to balance at 20% or more, and you know 60% of these folks have had debt for at least a year, and now you've added to it around the holidays, no shame, a lot of people did, but that adds up,” he said. “And there's a cumulative effect.” Trending LIST: Places offering Veterans Day freebies and discounts to honor those who served Veterans Day is Tuesday, November 11, and many businesses are offering discounts or even freebies to honor those who have served our country.

Retail and food services sales totaled $709.9 billion last month, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. That was also up 0.6% from the month before and continued the holiday rebound after a lackluster October . “I thought this report was surprisingly positive,” said Ted Rossman, a credit and personal finance expert with Bankrate . “I think really the entire holiday season came in better than expected. It didn't start out that way. October was pretty weak by comparison.” The National Retail Federation celebrated the new figures and the 3.8% annual growth in what it calls core retail sales. The NRF says Americans spent a record $964.4 billion this holiday season. “Consumer spending was remarkably resilient throughout 2023 and finished the year with a solid pace for the holiday season,” NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a news release. “Although inflation has been the biggest concern for households, the price of goods eased notably and was helped by a healthy labor market, underscoring a successful holiday season for retailers.” Colorado State University economist Stephan Weiler said for all the concerns about inflation, Americans weren’t shy about buying this holiday. “Sometimes it's worth looking at what people do as opposed to what people say,” Weiler said. And Weiler said this new retail report “bodes well for the economy.” Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the economy, he said. We’re unlikely to see a “burner-type of economy” in 2024, but consumer spending, the job market and other important factors look strong enough to give us the soft landing the economic policymakers have been after, Weiler said. “I don't see a recession coming from these numbers,” Rossman also said of the December retail report. But both Rossman and Weiler said the retail figures might be so hot that they throw cold water on the Federal Reserve’s desire to cut interest rates early in the year. The 5.6% annual sales growth beat the 3.4% inflation. Though Rossman and his Bankrate colleagues note that Americans are still largely playing catch-up to the cumulative effect of inflation. Prices are up 20% from where they were three years ago, they said. The Commerce Department on Wednesday also reported that full-year retail and food service sales increased 3.2% from 2022. Comparing this December to the previous one, retail sales, omitting food services, were up 4.8%. Sales were down for furniture stores, home improvement stores, gas stations, and department stores. But sales were up about 10% for e-commerce, on electronics, and at personal care stores. Americans spent a record $222.1 billion online this holiday season, according to another recent report from Adobe Analytics. Sales at restaurants and bars increased over 11%, which Rossman said shows continued demand for services following the pandemic. Rossman said credit card balances were already at record highs even before the holidays. “And I'm sure they grew substantially,” he said. Total household debt reached $17.29 trillion, while credit card balances reached $1.08 trillion nationwide, according to the 2023 third-quarter report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The fourth-quarter report is coming out in a few weeks. What’s good for the overall economy – strong retail spending – might not be for the individual household, he said. “If you're among the half of credit card holders who are lugging around to balance at 20% or more, and you know 60% of these folks have had debt for at least a year, and now you've added to it around the holidays, no shame, a lot of people did, but that adds up,” he said. “And there's a cumulative effect.” Trending Chick-fil-A says new Rhode Island location to open early next year NBC 10 News confirmed that the chicken chain will open its new location on the Warwick-East Greenwich line in early 2026.

Sayed Hassan/Getty Images A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New York CNN — Investors are eagerly anticipating Wednesday’s US retail sales report. That’s because the strength of the US economy rests on the shoulders of consumers, making this among the most important gauges we have. If people are spending money, companies keep employees in their jobs and the cycle goes on. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of America’s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, so a recession is nearly impossible as long as consumer spending is growing. And so far, American shoppers have continued to shell out cash for purchases, despite stubbornly high (though waning) inflation and interest rates at 23-year highs. Wednesday’s report is expected to be a good one — economists polled by FactSet expect that a strong holiday shopping season boosted consumer spending by 0.4% in December from the month prior. That’s on top of a 0.3% increase in November. But new data from the New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday has soured the mood on Wall Street. The report showed that Americans have slowed some of their spending and that they expect to pull back a little more. The median increase in monthly household spending slowed to 5.01% on an annual basis in December 2023, down from 5.5% in August 2023 and 7.1% in December 2022 , according to the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations Household Spending data. That’s the lowest reading since April 2021, according to my colleague Alicia Wallace. The outlook for consumer spending doesn’t look so bright, either. The median expected growth in monthly spending dropped to 3%, the lowest since December 2020. Survey respondents also said they expected to reduce their spending on essentials like groceries. A confluence of problems: But just as the retail sector was beginning to normalize — having successfully survived Covid-induced supply chain kinks, shutdowns, persistently elevated inflation and unusually high interest rates — it appears that global instability could once again wreak havoc on shipping and throw the sector for a loop. Container vessels are now avoiding both the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, as Iranian-backed Houthi fighters attack ships in what they say is retaliation for Israel’s war against Hamas. The Suez is the main route for shipments from Asia to Europe and to the east coast of the US, and rerouting is causing delays and driving up transportation costs. The World Container Index , a composite index of container freight rates on eight major routes to and from the United States, Europe, and Asia, increased by 15% last week, according to Drewry, a maritime research and consulting firm. It’s doubled since early December. Those increased shipping costs could get passed on to the consumer, just as inflation rates have started to fall and the Federal Reserve appears ready to lower interest rates. Yes, but: Still, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan believes the consumer will remain resilient. “We have people who are making money, who are employed. Unemployment is very low, they are getting paid more,” he told CNN’s Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. “Inflation is still tough on a lot of them, so you can’t discount that, but on the other hand the stock market being up, they’ve got accumulated wealth, they are making a lot more money,” he said. Bob Iger made $31.6 million as Disney’s CEO last year Disney CEO Bob Iger raked in $31.6 million in compensation last year — a multimillion-dollar boost from his income the year before, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya . Iger’s 2023 pay package included a base salary of $865,385, stock awards totaling $16.1 million, $10 million in stock option awards, $2.1 million in performance-based compensation and $2.48 million in other compensation, according to The Walt Disney Company’s annual proxy statement, which was filed Tuesday. Despite Iger’s multimillion-dollar paycheck, Disney has faced growing challenges in the past year, including a string of box office flops, declining linear TV viewership and an uneven transition into a streaming future. In November, Disney said it would slash its expenses by another $2 billion, adding to the $5.5 billion reduction it had previously announced as it looks to rebuild its business in a rapidly changing media environment. China’s population declines for second straight year as economy stumbles China reported a record low birth rate in 2023 as its population shrank for the second year in a row. The trend marked the deepening of a demographic challenge set to have significant implications on the world’s second largest economy, report my colleagues Laura He and Simone McCarthy . The country recorded 6.39 births per 1,000 people, down from 6.77 a year earlier, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Wednesday. The birth rate is the lowest since the founding of Communist China in 1949. The country’s demographic shift comes at a time when its growth is sputtering. The NBS confirmed that China’s economy grew by 5.2% last year , compared to a government target of around 5%. While this expansion marks a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s worst economic performances in over three decades."

Log In Create Free Account The Federal Reserve is still seen beginning interest rate cuts in March, though traders became a shade less confident on that start date and on the extent of further rate cuts this year after a U.S. government report Wednesday showed retail sales in December were stronger than expected. The 0.6 per cent increase in retail sales from the prior month, more than the 0.4 per cent economists had expected in a Reuters poll, suggests upward momentum for household spending and consumer demand that could keep inflation elevated and Fed policy-makers hesitant to let up on their restrictive monetary policy stance. Speaking Tuesday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that recent data had made him more confident that inflation is on track to the Fed’s 2 per cent goal, but that consumer spending would be a critical component as he looked to incoming data to confirm that outlook. Futures that settle to the Fed’s policy rate on Wednesday pointed to a little under a 60 per cent chance of a rate cut in March, versus about a 65 per cent chance seen at the close of business on Tuesday. The Fed has kept its policy rate in the range of 5.25 per cent-5.5 per cent since July. Rate-futures contracts are now pricing in a year-end U.S. policy rate of around 3.88 per cent, up from 3.83 per cent immediately before the retail sales report. Fed policy-makers themselves have signalled they expect the policy rate to end the year around 4.6 per cent, though Waller on Tuesday said that the extent of the Fed’s actual cuts, and the timing of their start, would depend on the data, especially on inflation. The Fed next meets in late January."

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in December, boosted by an increase in motor vehicle and online purchases, keeping the economy on solid ground heading into the new year. The upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, which prompted economists to upgrade their economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter, cast further doubt on financial market expectations that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates in March. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It followed news earlier this month of strong employment and wage gains in December as well as a pickup in consumer prices. Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Tuesday described the economy as \"doing well,\" which he said was giving the U.S. central bank \"the flexibility to move carefully and methodically\" on monetary policy. \"The economy is still flying high enough and economists can take down those recession forecasts this year,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. \"For Fed officials, the economy is not too hot and not too cold, but it is just right perhaps for a few interest rate cuts in 2024.\" Retail sales rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.3% gain in November, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.4%. Retail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation. Sales increased 5.6% on a year-on-year basis in December. Sales were likely partially boosted by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations following distortions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the last couple of years, consumers started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"We recommend averaging the December and January retail sales data, or averaging over the November to February period, to get a more reliable read on the state of the consumer,\" said Aditya Bhave, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities in New York. Nonetheless, households have maintained a healthy pace of spending, thanks to the labor market's resilience. Retailers also have offered discounts to lure holiday shoppers. Online sales advanced 1.5%. Shopping has moved to online vendors and away from the traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic. Receipts at motor vehicles and parts dealers accelerated 1.1% as more stock became available after strikes ended in the fall. Sales at building material and garden equipment outlets rose 0.4%. Receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores gained 0.3%. Clothing store sales jumped 1.5%. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Sales at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, were unchanged. That could be a potential red flag as economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. The unchanged reading, however, followed a 1.7% surge in November. December was also a very wet month, which could have lowered traffic to restaurants and bars. Sales at electronics and appliance outlets fell as did those at furniture stores, likely the result of discounting. Gasoline station receipts dropped 1.3% as gasoline prices declined. Financial markets pared back the odds of a Fed rate cut in March to roughly 53% from about 65% late on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement STRONG CORE SALES Though low-income households are believed to have exhausted excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and debt levels are rising, economists expect consumer spending to hold up this year as long as the labor market does not weaken considerably. A nearly $80 billion bipartisan deal under consideration in Congress that could expand the child tax credit and boost the low-income housing tax credit through 2025 is also seen underpinning spending. \"There is the possibility we'll see some level of pullback in consumer spending in 2024 as consumers reevaluate their budgets and pay down some elevated debt levels,\" said Mike Graziano, a senior consumer products analyst at RSM US. \"However, even if that is the case, consumers are on solid footing entering 2024.\" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.8% last month. The so-called core retail sales measure corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. Core sales for November were revised higher to show them rising 0.5% instead of the previously reported 0.4%. Even with details on spending on services still pending, economists believe consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, likely increased at about a 2.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. That was up from the pace of around 2.0% that most estimated before the report, but below the third quarter's 3.1% rate. The Atlanta Fed raised its growth estimate for gross domestic product in the fourth quarter to a 2.4% rate from a 2.2% pace. The economy grew at a 4.9% pace in the third quarter. The government is due to publish its first estimate of GDP growth for the October-December period next Thursday. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Some of the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth will likely reflect smaller inventory accumulation relative to the third quarter's size. A separate report from the Census Bureau on Wednesday showed business inventories declined for a second straight month in November. With the Fed expected to start cutting rates this year, most economists are confident the economy will avoid a downturn. The U.S. central bank has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range since March 2022. Though strong demand for goods is not boosting manufacturing, economists expected lower borrowing costs to provide support this year. A separate report from the Fed showed production at factories gained 0.1% in December after a rise of 0.2% in November. Factory output fell at a 2.2% rate in the fourth quarter. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"Manufacturing is a relatively rate-sensitive sector that may benefit from recently lower rates and loosening financial conditions,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

    "article_text": "Leadership The Power Of Data In Technology’s Race Against Time By Yassine Zaied , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Business Development Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 17, 2024, 07:15am EST Share Save Yassine Zaied, Chief Strategy Officer at Nexthink . getty In the dynamic tapestry of the consumer economy, the constant surge of innovation has never only been about enhancing convenience; it has also been an industry-wide commitment to reclaiming the consumer's most invaluable asset: time. As various sectors have engaged in this relentless battle to save time, however, each innovation has inevitably introduced its own set of novel interruptions, complexities and challenges. Perhaps the automobile provides the best illustration of the interplay between time-saving and the inadvertent creation of new demands. Reflecting on my first car purchase over three decades ago provides a personal illustration of this dynamic and its rapid recent evolution. This car, when I bought it in Tunisia with my first-ever paycheck, already had 400,000 miles on the clock. Calling its maintenance demands extensive would be an understatement. I had to bring it to an old friend, an exceptionally skilled hometown mechanic, for 5-6 hours a month and drink terrible garage coffee while he tested, rummaged for replacements and gradually restored my vehicle to a state of relative roadworthiness. A few years later, now living in France, I was at last able to buy a better car. Visits to the garage persisted, but their frequency diminished significantly; diagnostics became more transparent, and repairs were executed with greater efficiency. I also couldn’t help but notice how little the mechanic resembled my mental picture of the profession. He was well dressed, carried a laptop instead of a toolbox and never seemed to touch an engine with his own hands. If maintaining my more modern automobile still required significant expense (and it did—in both time and money), things were improving. Fast forward to the present day and my current car. It has, so far—two years after I bought it—required zero maintenance. Instead, it autonomously updates and fixes itself. In addition, the car frequently makes personalized recommendations that help save time. It knows where I’m going on a given day and is ready with suggestions to help me get there quicker. The main game-changer is, of course, data. The company behind my car (which now not only provisions it but manages my driving experience) is constantly receiving and leveraging real-time data about my car—not only the vehicle itself, but how well and how fast I’m driving, my routes and destinations, my media and comfort preferences, and every single other interaction between me, my car and the outside environment. Additionally, the manufacturer is constantly contrasting and assimilating this data with that provided by the many other cars like it on the road worldwide. The Workplace Technology Conundrum The lag between consumer and workplace tech is well known. But while the latter certainly moves much more slowly, its direction of travel remains very much the same. Over the past few decades, computers have transformed work processes, delivering incalculably vast time savings to employees. And once again, these advancements have also ushered in novel disruptions, interruptions and inefficiencies, which IT—the frontline mechanics of the workplace—has been responsible for mitigating. The push toward the provision of a more automated and seamless experience is also evident. How often do you spend waiting for IT today versus five or 10 years ago? The digital employee experience, while far from perfect, is certainly improving. In the background, however, most IT departments are still stuck endlessly addressing tickets and fielding employee complaints. These colleagues are striving to meet their deadlines, while IT professionals are caught in an endless firefighting cycle. I believe that the developments in the automobile industry point the way forward. The key to transforming IT lies in proactivity—stopping incidents before they impede employee productivity. According to new data from Vanson Bourne, it takes up to 27 minutes for IT to fix an average issue after it occurs. The onus is on IT to reclaim and redistribute this valuable time through proactive measures. Data-Powered Transformation: Shaping Digital Workplaces At the forefront of this transformation—as in the automobile industry, once again—is data. Comprehensive data is the key to delivering a truly proactive service, one that not only ensures users never have to tolerate technical downtime but also allows IT to provide nuanced, personalized experiences. Such data must go beyond device models and boot times to encompass every event, connection and interaction shaping the user’s digital experience. The second crucial element is the capability for real-time diagnosis, a far cry from the traditional IT team with the stack of mysteriously faulty laptops. And finally, IT must possess the ability to transform data into actionable insights—automated, remote, and precisely measurable in their impact and effect. Today, an employee should open their laptop confident that their machine will have updated itself, fixed itself and is also further adjusting itself to their own personal requirements, needs and patterns of work. This workplace technology evolution is poised to reshape public perception (and self-conception) regarding the role of IT. Are the individuals responsible for updating my car \"mechanics\"? Yes and no. They are not merely fixers or even orchestrators; they are time creators. IT should have the same aspirations. In this ever-evolving narrative of innovation and time, the increasing power of technology to increasingly correct and transcend its own flaws is undeniable. As data reshapes the landscapes of consumer and workplace technology alike, proactivity is the north star, creating a future where each innovation not only saves but enhances our control over our most precious asset: time.

Mulberry Group ( AIM:MUL ) View Price & Profile Mulberry sales hit by decline in luxury spending Published: 08:32 17 Jan 2024 GMT Mulberry Group (AIM:MUL) , the maker of luxury handbags, said its sales have been impacted by a decline in luxury consumer spending. In a trading update for the 13 weeks that ended 30 December 2023, it said group revenue fell 8.4% compared to the equivalent period a year earlier, as the company maintained its full prices in the days leading up to Christmas. Mulberry said sales were hit by the tough economic climate. \"In the run up to Christmas, the macro-economic environment continued to impact consumer spending in the luxury retail sector, which Mulberry was not immune from,\" said chief executive officer Thierry Andretta. “Despite this, the group maintained its discipline and focus on a full price strategy against an unusually high promotional environment.” Retail sales alone fell 1.5% in the period, while UK sales slumped by 4% compared to 3.9% growth in sales abroad. Mulberry said full-year sales will be “impacted by the additional operational costs of new stores in Sweden and Australia”, as well as the cost of ongoing investments in technology and the future of the business. Group turnover was flat for the 39 weeks to the end of December, rising by 0.1% compared to the year before, with gross margins in line with those in the first half, Mulberry said. Continue reading"

Read our privacy notice . Mulberry Group's chief executive has warned that the lack of VAT-free shopping is hitting businesses, as the bag maker reported a fall in revenue amid challenges in the luxury retail sector. In the run up to Christmas the AIM-listed brand stuck to a full price sales approach. It saw revenue fall 8.4% in the 13 weeks to December 30, with a decline of 4% in the UK. The fall comes at a time when some high end fashion firms face a slowdown in luxury demand as wealthy shoppers look at the impact of rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Last week Burberry warned the slowdown is having an impact on its current trading. At Mulberry, chief executive Thierry Andretta said: \"In the run up to Christmas, the macro-economic environment continued to impact consumer spending in the luxury retail sector, which Mulberry was not immune from. Our international sales remained positive, supported by our strategy to bring in-house ownership of overseas stores.” Read More Upmarket accessories brand Radley London bags Christmas sales growth Luxury sector calls on the Chancellor for 'modern, digital tax-free shopping scheme' FTSE 100 Live 17 January: UK inflation rises to 4%, shares plunge, new BP CEO, Just Eat orders slip He added: “In the UK, we continue to believe the lack of VAT-free shopping is impacting the retail landscape, as well as the hospitality, leisure and tourism sectors. Looking ahead, we are continuing to execute our plans and remain confident that our investments will underpin future sustainable growth.\" VAT-free shopping, which had made UK purchases 20% cheaper for international visitors, was axed in 2021 with the government pointing out the scheme could cost British taxpayers around £2 billion a year and mainly benefits the capital. But Britain's luxury goods industry has called for the return of a tax-free shopping scheme as as some tourists head to rival European cities for shopping sprees. Mulberry said group revenue for the 39 weeks to December 30 edged up slightly at 0.1%. It also said full-year results, as previously highlighted, will be impacted by the additional operational costs of new stores in Sweden and Australia and ongoing investments.

    "article_text": "Oliver Wyman Forum Finds Challenges Remain in Training Current and Future Workforces DAVOS, Switzerland , Jan. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Oliver Wyman, a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC ), announced today findings from a new report entitled \" How Generative AI is Transforming Business and Society ,\" released at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland . The report, from Oliver Wyman's think tank, the Oliver Wyman Forum, found that more than half of employees globally now use generative AI at work and that adoption is far higher in some countries. The Forum also found that adoption has not necessarily translated into higher levels of productivity – yet. \"The adoption rate of generative AI has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said John Romeo , CEO of the Oliver Wyman Forum. \"ChatGPT achieved mass adoption in less than one year -- a stark contrast to the internet, which took 17 years, smartphones 21 years, and electricity which took three decades, but training is not keeping up and we are facing an AI productivity disconnect.\" Forecasting business impact over the next decade, the report shows generative AI-trained junior employees will climb into management ranks faster than ever before. And senior-level leaders express the greatest levels of concern about losing their jobs to generative AI automation, according to the report. Key workplace findings from the report are below: Developing Countries Ahead: India leads 16 countries in employee adoption with 83% surveyed reporting daily or at least weekly use of generative AI. By contrast, weekly use by North American and European employees is below 50%. Explosive Growth Among Pink & Blue Collars: Between June and November 2023 , generative AI use exploded among white-collar knowledge workers as well as pink-collar workers. Doctors, nurses, and life-sciences employees increased weekly use by 264%. Weekly adoption among pink-collar education employees grew 144%, and blue-collar retail worker use increased by 71%. Productivity Gains Are Years Away: As many as 20% of employees who report generative AI has not increased their productivity say they are bogged down by corporate guidelines and \"unsatisfactory output\" which adds review and editing time to projects. The full potential of generative AI's productivity gains is still six to 10 years away, according to the report. Generative AI Training Gap: Lack of productivity may be linked to insufficient training. Employees at all levels seek more upskilling than employers currently provide. Among white-collar employees, 80% want more or better AI training, but only 64% currently say they receive it. This gap is wider among pink-collar employees. Job Loss Concern: Across the 17 industries and job types studied, 60% of employees express increasing concern their jobs will be replaced by generative AI. Globally, 30% of all job seekers say generative AI is motivating their job search. Employees who worry about AI are 57% more likely to feel their productivity is declining and 78% more likely to believe they don't matter to their employer, according to recent data from the American Psychological Association. Consumer findings include: Bias concerns: In all 16 countries studied, most consumers are concerned generative AI is producing biased content. People are most concerned in India (92%) and least concerned in France (73%) while 83% of US respondents report being are concerned. Trust is shaken: When asked if organizations using generative AI are untrustworthy, 29% said \"yes,\" with 18% saying generative AI tools \"are not trustworthy at all\" or \"not very trustworthy.\" Privacy, cybersecurity and more: Privacy, cybersecurity and overreliance on generative AI are the top three concerns for over 30% of consumers, but many cited additional worries, including job loss (29%), environmental impact (15%) and mental health (14%). Ana Kreacic , COO of the Oliver Wyman Forum and Chief Knowledge Officer of the Oliver Wyman Group commented: \"Automation is no longer just a narrative of blue-collar workers. Many white-collar workers fear their roles will become displaced with generative AI, and this anxiety is having a direct impact on productivity. It's a misconception for businesses to wait a year or two and hope to hire a fully generative AI trained workforce. Companies need to reskill the employees they have now by focusing on areas with the most near-term applications.\" About the report Oliver Wyman Forum conducted the survey to enhance its understanding of generative AI, specifically in the context of the workplace, the consumer economy, and risk. The survey was conducted in June and November 2023 among a total of 25,000 respondents across 16 countries including: the United States , Canada , Mexico , Brazil , the United Kingdom , France , Italy , Germany , Spain , China ( Hong Kong ), India , Indonesia , Singapore , the United Arab Emirates , and Australia .

The Indian growth story, especially since 2014, has been dynamic, attracting major attention from businesses and global pundits of finance and economy. The Indian GDP has been one the most bullish in recent years, coasting at above 7 percent in 2022-23, a figure that exceeded the expectations of most, especially in a war-watching global economy that is fraught with geopolitical fault lines getting in the way of international trade. As of the most recent Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) calculations by the World Bank and the International Comparison Programme (ICP), India ranks 3rd in the world in terms of GDP by PPP. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad India now accounts for 6.7 percent ($8,051 billion out of a total of $119,547 billion) of world GDP in terms of PPPs, compared to 16.4 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively, for China and the United States.The PPP figure is what offers a unique, and optimistic trend, for Indians as it shows the relatively strong purchasing power in domestic currency, implying that the average Indian faces a comfortable cost of living, closely comparable to the largest economies of the world. The table below shows the nominal GDP at PPP for India, and in PPP terms, which focuses on the purchasing power of the domestic currency within the economy, India is already the third-largest economy, well above Japan and Germany. Further, at the end of 2027 (FY28 for India), the US economy would be only about 1.7 times that of India in PPP terms. In the next few decades, if India can maintain a real growth of about 6 percent to 7 percent, it would be possible to catch up with the US economy. Table 1: Nominal GDP at PPP International $.

As of 2024, the Indian economy when seen at PPP is 3.6 times that of the UK, 2.1 times that of Japan, and 2.5 times that of Germany. Table 2: Size of the Indian Economy at PPP as of 2024(Illustration: Moneycontrol) While most advanced economies (AEs) are facing an economic slowdown, chronic shortages, high inflation, and ageing populations, the Indian economy is acknowledged to be the fastest-growing large economy by major multilateral organisations, including the IMF. The Expansion of The Indian Consumer: Burgeoning Middle Class Amidst Low Cost of Living The implications of a high PPP nominal GDP can be easily understood in the growing strength of the Indian consumer in recent years. PPP allows us to understand and make comparisons between two countries- in this case, India and other high income countries such as Germany, Japan, etc- about the price of the same goods and services. Thus, a PPP analysis shows the price of the same goods and services in different economies, adjusted for parity. A high PPP implies that a basic set of essential goods and services is cheaper inside India, for an Indian consumer, than the same basket would be for a consumer in Japan, Germany or the UK. To put it simply, India has made significant improvements in public life and economy allowing for a low cost of living, across the population. This has also resulted in India being generally safe against inflation shocks and shocks of the global economy. The Indian middle class, therefore, is increasingly well off, while also expanding significantly. Estimates based on the PRICE's ICE 360 pan-India primary surveys across 2014, 2016 and 2021, suggest that the population of deprived and aspiring people will decrease from almost 1.1 billion to 150 million in the 2040s. The top income segment - the rich - will soar from 30 million to an estimated 310 million, while the huge bulk of the population will comprise a middle class of nearly 1.25 billion. Picture 1: India’s income groups, projected till 2047. Source: People Research on Indian Consumer Economy (PRICE), pan-India surveys. (illustration: Moneycontrol) By 2047, if political and economic reforms have their desired effect, the income pyramid will gradually develop into a 'fat lady' - with a smallish bottom of the deprived and aspirers, a huge bulge in the middle of the middle class and a big head of the rich. Eradication of Extreme Poverty at the Global US $1.9 PPP Poverty Line Along with improvements in general purchasing power of the middle class, and a low cost of living, India has also almost completely eradicated extreme poverty at the global PPP poverty level of US$ 1.9. The World Bank categorises those in ‘extreme poverty’ as those who live on less than US $1.9 PPP per day globally. According to an IMF working paper from 2022, this figure has remained less than 1 percent since pre-pandemic times for India, reaching its lowest in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 with a 0.8 percent. This eradication of extreme poverty has uniquely occurred due to a mix of efficient social security measures and targeted foodgrain distribution by key Union Government schemes. The IMF paper concluded that the food handouts primarily had a substantial impact on keeping the levels of extreme poverty low. This study highlights the effect of food transfer and social security schemes on poverty alleviation and purchasing power of the poor. As a result of robust food grain coverage and distribution, the shocks in food price and income levels were offset by the scheme, allowing beneficiaries to remain above the poverty line in terms of purchasing power. The primary discussion of food transfers in the IMF working paper arises from the results of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), announced in March 2020 to ease the pressures caused by the pandemic. According to PMGKAY, each individual of an impoverished household receives an additional free 5 kilograms of grain over the existing 25 kilograms of subsidised food grains under the prevailing National Food Security Act (NFSA). As of November 2023, this scheme was extended for another 5 years. This will ensure that any future shocks arising from global events and food inflation will not worsen the condition of the poor in India. Picture 2 below shows the expanded coverage as of the extension of the PMGKAY. Picture 2: The Extended Coverage of the PMGKAY Scheme, Starting from 1st January, 2024.

(illustration: Moneycontrol) What Works for India, and Potential Challenges Several global analysts have declared India as the next great economic power: Goldman Sachs predicted it will become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075, and Financial Times has suggested that by 2050, India’s purchasing power will be 30 percent larger than that of the U.S. Several demand and supply factors are crucial in achieving this, most of which show certain positive trends. On the demand side, India is facing a consumer boom, with significant improvements in consumption power being seen in the economy each year. India’s growth will be driven mainly by domestic consumption and investments. Real wages are expected to grow at above 4 percent, and disposable income is expected to grow by about 15 percent. Industries prevalent in the West are fast-growing industries in India, and consumer durables were expected to grow by about 15-18 percent in 2023. On the supply side, by 2030, India’s working-age population is expected to be 1.04 billion. The working-age population bulge is expected to last till 2055. Additionally, India also has the largest pool of English-speaking STEM graduates in the world. Infrastructurally, India is on the right track, in recent years. India has been adding 10,000 km of highways annually. The number of Indian airports has doubled and an upgraded train system will have new high efficiency “freight corridors” connecting the economic centres of India. Additionally, one of the most impressive changes has been in the digital infrastructure. With 881.25 million internet subscribers, India has the second-highest internet-enabled population in the world behind China’s 1.05 billion. As a result, the Digital Payments Infrastructure has seen a huge boom, making India the leading country in the world in terms of digital payments. All of this has helped make public services and credit more easily accessible to a wider swath of the population. India stands in a favourable position today, both in terms of economic growth and domestic cost of living. It remains then, to ensure this robust foundation is effectively steered towards realising the full future potential of the modern Indian economy. Going forward, India should ensure this tradition of good governance continues. Fostering Centre-State cooperation will allow wider coverage and better implementation of Central Schemes, ensuring that improvements in standard of living continue for the foreseeable future.

Cotton-dominant apparel import costs also decreased but remained 6 per cent above 2019 levels. Consumer spending on apparel grew in November, aligning with forecasts for a 3-4 per cent holiday sales increase. In November, retail prices for apparel in the US saw a month-over-month decrease of 1.5 per cent, potentially indicating retailer discounting strategies. Despite this monthly drop, year-over-year prices were 1.3 per cent higher, marking the lowest annual rate increase since the COVID-19 pandemic, as per a report by Cotton Incorporated. Import costs showed a similar trend, with the average price per square metre equivalent (SME) of cotton-dominant apparel falling for the sixth consecutive month. Since reaching a post-COVID peak of $4.26/SME in November 2022, import prices have decreased by 14 per cent. However, the average price in November 2023 remained 6 per cent above the 2019 average, which was $3.65/SME in November and $3.45 on average for the year. In November, US retail apparel prices fell 1.5 per cent month-over-month, the lowest annual rise since the pandemic at 1.3 per cent. Cotton-dominant apparel import costs also decreased but remained 6 per cent above 2019 levels. Consumer spending on apparel grew in November, aligning with forecasts for a 3-4 per cent holiday sales increase. Consumer confidence experienced a significant boost in December, as evidenced by the Conference Board’s Index of Consumer Confidence, which rose by 9.7 points to 110.7. This surge, the largest monthly increase since the stimulus payments in March 2021, was attributed to an improved outlook on current economic conditions and a less pessimistic view of the economy's future, although longer-term perspectives remain cautious, Cotton Inc said in its latest Executive Cotton Update—US Macroeconomic Indicators & the Cotton Supply Chain - January 2024. In terms of overall consumer spending, November saw a 0.3 per cent month-over-month increase in inflation-adjusted terms, with a year-over-year increase of 2.7 per cent. Notably, consumer spending on apparel rebounded in November, growing by 1.7 per cent month-over-month after a 0.7 per cent decrease in October. This marked the largest gain since March 2022 and suggested a strong performance for clothing sales over the holiday period. Year-over-year, November spending on apparel increased by 1.9 per cent, the first such increase in nine months. The holiday shopping season aligned with predictions, with the National Retail Federation forecasting a 3-4 per cent increase in 2023 holiday sales, close to the longer-term growth range. Mastercard SpendingPulse data indicated a 3.1 per cent increase in consumer spending during November and December, though this figure is not adjusted for inflation. With the overall inflation rate also at 3.1 per cent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, aggregate unit volumes of purchases remained flat. Alternative inflation measurements used by the Federal Reserve, sourced and calculated differently from the headline Consumer Price Index, showed a month-over-month decrease of 0.1 per cent between October and November, the first monthly decrease since April 2020. Year-over-year, prices measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis were 2.6 per cent higher in November, with core inflation at 3.2 per cent, both well below the peak rates of 2022. With higher interest rates helping to bring inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's two per cent target for core inflation, and a strong labour market, there is growing optimism about a soft economic landing following the steep interest rate increases. Federal Reserve officials have hinted at the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2024 to support economic growth, which is expected to be modest, the update added. The US labour market added approximately 216,000 new jobs in December, although revisions to previous months were negative. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7 per cent, a historically low level. Wages in December were up 4.1 per cent year-over-year, slightly higher than November's 4.0 per cent but continuing a downward trend from the 5.9 per cent peak in March 2022. Wage growth has consistently outpaced the overall consumer price index since May 2023. Fibre2Fashion News Desk (KD) More Cotton Inc News... More Retail News - United States Of America...

    "article_text": "Despite repeated OPEC plus output cuts and Israel-Hamas conflict, oil prices shed more than 13 percent in 2023 against its previous year's average price. However, prices exhibited a varied move throughout the year driven by multiple factors that affected its fundamentals. US NYMEX oil started at nearly $80 a barrel in 2023 but pushed down to $64 levels by May. There was a brief rally in October, which coincided with the Israel-Hamas conflict and reports of falling US inventories but erased all such gains by the end of the year. The new geopolitical risk in West Asia was speculated to raise global oil prices as the region is one of the most important oil-producing and transporting zones. However, demand concerns due to the moderate global growth outlook, and higher-than-expected supply from non-OPEC countries were the key drivers of oil markets last year. The OPEC plus countries announced voluntary production cuts in May and November last year. The cuts were aimed at stabilizing the market and supporting prices. However, these aggressive moves have failed to lift global oil prices. Rising oil supplies from non-OPEC countries, especially from the US offset the price-boosting efforts taken by OPEC Plus producers’ cartel. Live Events The US is the world's largest oil producer and their production level hit a historic high of over 13 million barrels per day in 2023. As per Energy Information Administration (EIA), US production is expected to rise in the next two years as well. Oil markets have also adjusted to the ban on Russian oil by the European Union and G7 countries faster than initially expected. Russia diverted most of its cargo to destinations in Asia, especially China and India. Russia was the largest supplier of crude oil to India last year, beating the traditional Middle East heavyweight countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq. China was supposed to be the driving force of global oil demand growth last year, but challenges in its economy adversely affected the demand from the world’s second-largest oil consumer. China’s economy has been going through challenges in areas like the property sector, exports, debt, unemployment, and investment affected the overall demand for energy commodities. Oil prices will continue to be driven by demand-supply dynamics in 2024 as well. As the current fundamentals remain unsupportive, there are very few chances for a sharp rise in prices barring a major escalation of tensions in the Middle East, which could negatively affect the global oil supply chain. Though the shortage in output from OPEC-plus countries continues to be replaced by higher US production, further surprise production cuts or supply issues due to the escalating tension in the Middle East would be crucial for the market. A weak global growth outlook, especially from China and Europe may also restrict major upsides. Whereas the US Fed’s stance on inflation and interest rates will significantly influence oil demand. Stable or reduced interest rates could promote economic growth, potentially increasing oil demand and thus the prices of the commodity. On the price side, considering various factors, the US WTI futures may vary inside $64-98 a barrel. At the same time, in the domestic market, in addition to the international prices, volatility in the Indian rupee would have an impact on the price outlook.

    "article_text": "Home Business School for retail professionals launched in Lahore Former CEO, over 200 CAP members will teach students front-end retail management SHAHRAM HAQ January 13, 2024 2 min read facebook twitter whatsup linkded email LAHORE: Stakeholders in the organised retail sector in the country have launched a Retail Business School (RBS) in Lahore to empower excellence in retail management and bridge the gap of retail professionals in this critical sector of the economy. While not the first business school meant for the retail sector, RBS is an initiative spearheaded by a former Chief Executive Officer of a leading brand. Supported by the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP), the school is located in a private shopping mall in Lahore and is not affiliated with any business school. Over 200 CAP members will teach and groom students for front-end retail management. Punjab caretaker minister for Transport, Mines & Minerals, and Livestock Dairy Development, Ibrahim Hasan Murad, at the groundbreaking ceremony on Friday, highlighted the challenges retail professionals face in today’s dynamic and competitive environment. He lauded the initiative, underscoring its dedication to fostering professional development within the retail sector. Murad added that the school would be instrumental in capitalising on emerging trends like technology integration and the impact of evolving consumer behaviours through educational strategies in the retail sector. While Pakistan’s retail sector was expanding at a double-digit growth rate a couple of years ago, recent inflation hikes and export bans have affected this significant sector of the economy. Official statistics indicate that the overall retail sector contributes 18% to the country’s GDP, with a size of approximately Rs3.6 trillion. It contributes 31% to the services sector, which, in turn, makes up 58% of the total economy. Read Taxing retailers CAP Chairman Rana Tariq addressed the future of retail education during his speech, aiming to equip industry professionals with valuable insights to navigate and capitalise on the shifting dynamics of retail education in Pakistan. He stressed the need to train front-end staff in physical retail outlets for a better understanding of modern retail business techniques and consumer behaviour. Tariq mentioned that the CAP members would teach staff, management, and students on product display and other necessary aspects to further transform this industry in Pakistan. Regarding the future of the organised retail sector, Tariq noted that the sector is currently growing at a single-digit rate, between 4-6%, compared to 12-14% a couple of years ago. He said that the growth depends on how the government treats this tax-paying sector in the future, considering the economic squeeze and reduced buying power of the people.

The official verdict is in and shows the UK’s faltering economy is not moving toward full-blown recession, but another weak reading for overall economic growth in November is adding to calls for interest rate cuts to help flatlining growth. Mortgage holders, first-time home buyers, City traders and politicians are all looking toward the Bank of England after gross domestic product data out this morning showed only lacklustre growth for the month, of 0.3% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year, although it defied predictions of another drop. December's data, not yet due , will complete the picture for the fourth quarter. After a contraction in the third quarter, an overall decline for the last part of 2023 will put the UK into the widely accepted technical definition of a recession: at least two consecutive quarters of contraction. But November's growth makes that less likely. Nonetheless, Downing Street will be paying close attention after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made economic growth one of his key pledges when he got the keys to Number 10. And the stubborn lack of growth has been the main feature of the GDP data for months, as it has inched up and down either side of the flatline. Simon French, chief economist at broker Panmure Gordon and also its head of research, recently called UK growth data a “series of random numbers trending around zero.” With the prospect of a technical recession grabbing the headlines, City experts were pointing out that the difference between economic contraction and a lack of meaningful and sustained growth makes little difference. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said: “A second-consecutive 0.1% fall in GDP is still possible in the fourth quarter, but that's hardly much to write home about,” adding: “The broader point is that the economy stagnated through much of last year. And more importantly, there are some reasons to be a little more optimistic about 2024.” Analysis from HSBC pointed out that Friday’s numbers for November come after “a disappointing start to the fourth quarter” in October. But after “a few indicators … including consumer confidence, retail sales, and house prices – perked up in November … we forecast a small increase in GDP in November.” Nonetheless, the UK’s biggest bank also warned that “we still see no growth overall in the fourth quarter”. In Threadneedle Street, Andrew Bailey, the governor of Bank of England, and his fellow members of the Monetary Policy Committee, will also be braced for the November’s numbers. They are due amid growing calls for an interest rate cut to kickstart growth.

The rises were designed to fight double-digit inflation which followed the spike in energy prices after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine stoked the cost-of-living crisis. Since last summer, hopes for a cut have tracked a drop in the Consumer Price Index, now at 3.9% and down from the peak it reached over 11% in October 2022. But the BOE has signalled it expects UK rates to remain higher for longer. And the official target for inflation in 2%. Nonetheless, the plight of UK’s lacklustre economy and has added volume to the calls for a help get it going. A lower base rate cuts the cost of any mortgages or other loans tracking it, boosting consumers’ spending power. The next MPC meeting is due early next month. City forecasters expect action later this year, with consensus forecasts for the first quarter-point in the third quarter of this year, after the BOE has had time to consider the government’s next set of Budget measures due in March. ING’s Smith said: “For the Bank of England, stickiness in wage growth and services inflation, as well as the likelihood of a fiscal boost in March, potentially means rate cuts will come a little later than markets expect.” For the economy, he concluded that 2024 was looking brighter than 2023: “All in, we expect growth of 0.5% for 2024. That implies modest but positive quarterly growth through this year.” MORE ABOUT UK Growth Bank Of England Andrew Bailey Rishi Sunak"

    "article_text": "Economy Economy RMG exports to US continue to decline Thu Jan 11, 2024 07:00 AM Last update on: Thu Jan 11, 2024 01:15 PM Refayet Ullah Mirdha Thu Jan 11, 2024 07:00 AM Last update on: Thu Jan 11, 2024 01:15 PM Photo: Amran Hossain Apparel shipments from Bangladesh to the United States have continued its downward trend for the past several months due to slowdown in the sourcing of garment items by American retailers and brands because of higher inflationary pressure. Consumer spending on non-essential items such as apparel articles decelerated last year, which caused old inventories to pile up in stores in the world's biggest economy, which is Bangladesh's single largest export destination. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The sales finally picked up in the festive months of November and December ahead of the holiday shopping season, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas. Owing to lower consumer spending, garment shipments from Bangladesh to the US declined 24.91 percent year-on-year to $6.79 billion in the January-November period last year, according to data from the Office of the Textile and Apparel (OTEXA) of the US. If textile and apparel are considered together, the export from Bangladesh declined 25.41 percent to $6.95 billion. The shipment of garment items to the US from other countries such as China, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan also declined during the period. It decreased 22.40 percent to $72.40 billion. Of the major supplying nations, garment shipments from China fell 25.85 percent to $15.21 billion and Vietnam's sales declined 22.68 percent to $13.17 billion. The shipment from India was down 21.53 percent to $4.18 billion. It fell 28.05 percent to $1.85 billion for Pakistan. The global consumer spending outlook was gloomy last year due to the higher inflationary pressure stemming from the severe fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. International retailers and brands had to alter their plans in the middle of 2023 as there was political turmoil in the country ahead of the national polls, held on January 7, said Shams Mahmud, managing director of Shasha Denims, which ships 10 percent of its total denims to the US annually. However, as the political cloud dissipates, US-based retailers and brands are sending a lot of inquiries to local suppliers. So, it is expected that the shipment of garment items to the US will rebound soon, he added. The November receipts of garment shipments reflect the shipment of goods sent in August and September, the months when production in local garment factories was disrupted due to political unrest. Production was also hampered at that time as garment workers agitated for increased wages. Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), echoed Mahmud's sentiments, saying the demand for clothing items in the US was low last year. He added that demand was expected to go up from February or March as old inventories were greatly depleted during festive sales late last year. In October and November, consumers showed their ability to spend, with spending on both goods and services growing 5.2 percent year-over-year unadjusted for inflation, according to a statement by Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist of the National Retail Federation (NRF), a platform for American retailers. Households accelerated their spending on services, which returned to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 65 percent of consumption. Disposable personal income was up 7 percent year-over-year, much faster than earlier in the year, and helped boost consumer purchases. Core retail sales as defined by the NRF -- excluding automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants -- were up 3.3 percent unadjusted year-over-year on a three-month moving average as of November and up 3.7 percent in the first 11 months of 2023. \"While we are waiting for the December figures to be released, spending is on track to meet our projection for sound holiday shopping season growth between 3 percent and 4 percent over 2022,\" the NRF said.

Photograph: HS2/PA This article is more than 1 year old Letters How remnants of the past foster understanding and compassion This article is more than 1 year old We are all the poorer if small museums as well as larger public institutions are starved of support, writes Vicky Dawson Your editorial ( The Guardian view on archaeology and writing: the world-building power of small thoughts, 7 January ) struck a chord with me as I am working on an exhibition to be held at Wells & Mendip Museum. Through the lens of a seemingly mundane, though exceptionally large, collection of domestic pottery excavated from the museum garden in the 1990s, it brings to life the people who lived there over the course of 500 years. With a particular focus on the 18th century, the finds reveal their tastes, habits and interests; how fashion, the expanding empire, the impact of slavery and the growth of the consumer economy at home touched real people in Wells. The collection remained untapped and largely unseen until the dedication of volunteers and seed funding from Arts Council England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund instigated a programme of research and community activity, culminating in the exhibition Smashed in the Cellar. We are all the poorer if small, largely volunteer-funded museums such as Wells, as well as our larger public institutions, are starved of the support received from local and national government. Funding from charitable trusts and the agencies that distribute Lottery funding is ever more oversubscribed. It is the nuances of life, past and present, that foster understanding and compassion. The exhibition will run from 16 February to 11 April. Vicky Dawson Museum and heritage consultant Explore more on these topics Museums Archaeology Heritage letters Share Reuse this content"

Experts expect Union Budget 2024 to offer tax breaks and incentives to revive consumer spending and boost retail footfall, including raising personal income tax slabs and introducing temporary tax holidays. Sangeeta Ojha Published 10 Jan 2024, 01:19 PM IST Union Budget 2024: The budget presented will be for vote-on-account, which means that no major announcements will be made. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present Narendra Modi's government interim budget on 1 February 2024, just months before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. What will be the focus of Union Budget 2024? The budget presented will be for vote-on-account, which means that no major announcements will be made. The consolidated budget for 2024 will be announced after the results of the elections are declared. Will the budget offer tax breaks and incentives to revive consumer spending and boost retail footfall? Experts expect Union Budget 2024 to offer tax breaks and incentives to revive consumer spending and boost retail footfall. Suggestions include raising personal income tax slabs , temporary tax holidays, and incentives for automobile purchases, travel bookings, restaurant dining, and housing. What industry experts expect out of Union Budget 2024 “Pent-up demand and legions of revenge shoppers drove brisk recovery in retail and consumer spending so far. However, inflation remains a persistent thorn that threatens to derail the rebound. Raising personal income tax slabs and hiking standard deductions to offset inflation can put more disposable income in the hands of shoppers,” said Ridhima Kansal, director of Rosemoore. Further, temporary tax holidays and incentives around automobile purchases, travel bookings, restaurant dining, and housing can catalyze consumer spending across key sectors, she added. “GST contributed over ₹ 1.5 lakh crore monthly to the kitty last quarter, underscoring consumption resilience. However, we are far from pre-pandemic peaks. Introducing mechanisms like electronic GST invoices can enable quicker refunds to prevent working capital from getting locked up,” said Tejpal Singh Shekhawat, founder & CEO of Kalyanam Furniture . Additionally, rationalizing peak slab rates and bringing petroleum under the GST ambit could make the regime more consumer-friendly, added Tejpal. Retail inflation crossed the 6% mark towards the end of last year. The rapid rise in household budget spending on food, fuel, and EMIs leaves little surplus for discretionary shopping or leisure. Income tax rate cuts seem unlikely given fiscal challenges. However, enhancing standard deduction and leave travel allowance limits can assist middle-class taxpayers. Providing higher tax incentives on first-time home loans and electric vehicles can also spur major purchase decisions and multiplier, said Raghunandan Saraf, Founder and CEO of Saraf Furniture.

Survey impacts and changes Future cessation of the Retail Business Survey and Retail Trade Publication The ABS intends to cease the Retail Business Survey and Retail Trade Publication to balance organisational priorities of producing timely statistics using new data sources and reducing the burden ABS surveys place on the business community. Retail Trade statistics are often used as an early indicator of household consumption. However, retail trade has been declining as a proportion of total household consumption. Retail Trade coverage has fallen from 56.2% of household consumption in 1959-60 to 33.2% in 2022-23. The last release of the Retail Trade Publication is expected to be in August 2025, referencing the June 2025 period. Users will be able to access more comprehensive monthly data on household consumption from the ABS’ Monthly Household Spending Indicator (MHSI). This indicator provides an early read on household spending, covering around 68% of household consumption, compared to the 33% covered by the Retail Trade data. Alongside the MHSI, the Monthly Business Turnover Indicator (MBTI) also provides a frequent and timely indicator of economic activity in important parts of the economy. Both indicators make use of administrative data from the private and public sectors, reducing burden on businesses while continuing to produce important economic indicators. The ABS will be working with data users to enhance the MHSI and MBTI to make sure these indicators provide the information users need before Retail Trade, Australia ceases in August 2025. More Information about this transition can be found on the Future cessation of the Retail Business Survey and Retail Trade Publication webpage or through contacting us at household.spending@abs.gov.au . Annual Seasonal Review The ABS has undertaken an annual review of the seasonally adjusted retail series. The review has changed a range of time series treatments to ensure that the seasonal adjustment process continues to be less influenced by large irregular movements from the COVID-19 pandemic period. The review has also focused on the Black Friday period and evolving seasonality over recent years as noted in the Changes in the seasonality of Retail Turnover article published this month. This review has led to revisions to the affected time series for relevant periods, providing a more accurate estimate of seasonally adjusted time series. Changes in this issue There are no revisions to the original estimates. Revisions to seasonally adjusted estimates are due to changes implemented based on the annual seasonal review and the concurrent methodology for deriving seasonal factors. For information on seasonal adjustment please refer to the explanatory notes of this publication. Trend series The trend series attempts to measure underlying behaviour in retail activity. During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the trend series was significantly affected by larges changes to regular patterns in retail spending. Trend estimates for all series from March 2020 to June 2022 will not be published. The degree of disruption caused by COVID-19 on Retail turnover during this span means that trend estimates are likely to be unhelpful and may be misleading for users thr... [truncated]"

    "article_text": "Money Report In partnership with news The 2023 U.S. economy, in a dozen charts By Gabriel Cortés,CNBC • Published January 7, 2024 • Updated on January 7, 2024 at 7:11 am BOOKMARKER The U.S. labor market ended the year strong, creating more than 200,000 jobs in the last month of the year and nearly 2.7 million jobs in all of 2023, when seasonally adjusted. Consumer spending remained robust throughout the year, with bright spots in travel and entertainment. There were some trouble areas for consumers, however, with mortgage rates high and existing home sales low. Ed Jones | AFP | Getty Images A pedestrian holds an umbrella as they walk along a street in the rain in Times Square, New York, on Sept. 26, 2023. Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE The state of the U.S. economy may be a chief concern among Americans , but 2023 wound up as a pretty good year for the macroenvironment. Spending remained high, markets posted big gains and the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation showed signs of cooling — without freezing. Then there's the almost logic-defying resilience of the job market . Create a free account with NBC 5 DFW to save articles and videos. LEARN MORE The U.S. labor market ended the year strong, creating more than 200,000 jobs in December, according to figures released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . While previous job creation estimates for October and November were revised downward by a combined 75,000, the unemployment rate remained at a low 3.7%, and December marked the 36th consecutive month of job creation for the U.S. economy. In total, the U.S. created nearly 2.7 million jobs in 2023, when seasonally adjusted. That figure came despite concerns that the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight against inflation through interest rate hikes might cool the labor market and put a chill on consumer spending . Neither of those concerns came to fruition, however. In fact, consumer spending remained robust throughout the year, with monthly advanced retail sales staying above the $600 million mark for most of 2023, proving that despite many economic headwinds, U.S. consumers could not be deterred. Here are nine other charts that show how the economy rounded out 2023. Inflation, wages and spending While inflation continues to be top of mind for U.S. consumers, the rate of inflation cooled significantly in 2023. Meanwhile, wages rose throughout the year, eventually outpacing price increases . U.S. consumers were in a mood to spend, particularly on experiences: 2023 was officially the year that travel rebounded, with the Thanksgiving holiday period breaking U.S. records . Nearly 150 million passengers were screened by the Transportation Security Administration across U.S. airports in November and December. Americans spent on entertainment, too. With major hits such as \"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer\" and Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour concert film, the U.S. box office came back in a big way last year from its Covid-19 pandemic lows. Markets All three major U.S. indexes ended the year with considerable growth, with tech stocks leading the way. It was some of the best growth for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 in recent years. Even assets such as crypto saw a rebound in 2023 after hitting a low in November of the previous year. Bitcoin prices ended the year at almost three times that previous low. Interest rates and housing After its historic rate increases in 2022 , the Federal Reserve tempered its war on inflation and only raised rates at four of its eight meetings in 2023. While the central bank's target range for interest rates is the highest it has been since 2006, recent comments from Chair Jerome Powell have Fed watchers optimistic that rate cuts may be coming in 2024 . There were some trouble areas for consumers, however. Mortgage rates continue to be high . The average 30-year fixed rate in October was nearly triple what it was at the end of 2020 — although rates came down significantly by the end of the year — and existing home sales remain low , according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Until more housing inventory comes online, those issues are likely to persist into 2024.

This signals an uptick in consumer spending on technology products and services, according to CTA's One-Year Industry Forecast . Continue Reading CTA chart showing changes in hardware and software/services from 2019 to 2024 (projected). Consumers will spend $14 billion (up 6% over 2023) on audio streaming services and $48 billion (up 4%) on video streaming in 2024. \"Despite inflation in most sectors of the U.S. economy, it's noteworthy that consumer tech products like TVs, smartphones, and gaming hardware are being bought at lower prices by consumers,\" said Richard Kowalski , Sr. Director of Business Intelligence at CTA. \"Technology by nature is deflationary as innovation leads industries to find newer, more efficient ways to compete. Looking ahead to 2024, I expect developments in artificial intelligence will accelerate growth for consumer and enterprise technology companies as they become more efficient and find more ways to meet consumer needs.\" Trends to Watch in 2024: The Year of the Megabundle: Content providers will increase their promotion of \"service bundles\" to draw more consumer interest. Megabundles have the potential to offer consumers discounted rates on their favorite services while also simplifying their payment process. Streaming Up: Consumers will spend $14 billion (up 6% over 2023) on audio streaming services and $48 billion (up 4%) on video streaming in 2024. Gaming Hardware Boom: Product refreshes in tablets, augmented and virtual reality headsets and gaming (Major brand console refresh in 2024/2025) will boost gaming revenues in 2024. Gaming will also be amplified by 12% growth in subscription services (growing to $3.5 billion in 2024). Generative artificial intelligence is expected to improve the gaming experience while also helping developers bring games to market faster. Devices and Services Go Hand-in-Hand: Services continue to be an essential part of product purchase, as seen through growth in the services segment. CTA estimates that 25% of all consumer spending on tech was for various software and subscription services in 2019. In just 5 years to 2024, CTA projects the same services to be just under one-third of all consumer spending. Believe the AI Hype: Over 230 million smartphones and PCs shipping to the U.S. this year will tap the powers of generative AI through mobile apps, browsers and on-device software. AI is being deployed in mobility safety systems, fitness tracking apps on smartwatches and picture quality improvements on televisions. \"I am excited by the breadth of innovation I'm seeing from companies large and small going into CES 2024,\" said Gary Shapiro , president and CEO, CTA. \"By embracing pro-innovation regulatory policies, encouraging investment, reforming immigration to embrace global talent, and enhancing trade partnerships that strengthen innovation, we can drive innovation benefiting all people.

Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The US economy continued to show surprising resiliency as the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that the economy added 216,000 new jobs in December. The unemployment rate remained at a steady 3.7 per cent amid increased consumer spending during the holiday season and as inflation climbs at a much slower rate than in 2022. The report is welcome news for President Joe Biden as he plans to make the economy a major selling point in his 2024 re-election campaign against former president Donald Trump . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Government jobs grew by 52,000, mostly through increases in local government jobs, while the healthcare sector added 38,000 jobs in December. Social assistance added 21,000 jobs while construction employment added 7,000 jobs. But transportation and warehousing shed 23,000 jobs in December. The jobs report surpassed the expectations that markets had. The ADP National Employment report projected that the US economy added only 164,000 jobs. At the same time, the October jobs report was revised down from 150,000 jobs to 105,000 jobs while the bureau revised its November jobs numbers down from 199,000 jobs to 173,000. The report also showed that hourly earnings rose by 0.4 per cent in the past month and by 4.1 per cent in the past year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The positive jobs numbers come as consumer spending increased ahead of the holiday season, according to a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis from November. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced in December that the central bank would not raise interest rates, nor would it cut them just yet. Markets have hoped that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in the new year. “Job growth has now averaged 165K over the last 3 months, just in line with the 2019 average of 164K,” Olu Sonola, head of US regional economics for Fitch, said in a statement. “However, the Fed will likely be paying a lot more attention to the decline in labor participation and the uptick in wage growth. This report does not scream rate cuts, it points more in the direction of curtailing recent market expectations of rate cuts starting as early as March.” The Federal Reserve has sought to ensure that a hot labour market does not contribute to increased inflation. In December, the bureau reported that inflation rose by 0.1 per cent in November and by 3.1 per cent in the past 12 months. The next Consumer Price Index report that shows inflation for December will be released in on Thursday. About Our Ads"

Published Jan. 4, 2024 By Tatiana Walk-Morris post share post print email license A person shopping online during the holidays. Discounts hit record highs this holiday season, according to Adobe. Getty Images Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Setting a “new record for e-commerce,” online consumer spending between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 rose 4.9% year over year to $222.1 billion, according to analysis from Adobe Analytics. Consumer spending was driven in part by discounts that “hit record highs” during the season across categories including electronics, toys and apparel. Consumers spent $16.6 billion online using buy now, pay later services over the holiday season, a 14% jump from last year and an all-time high, per Adobe Analytics. Throughout 2023, consumers spent $75 billion online via BNPL payment platforms, up 14.3% from 2022. Dive Insight: Adobe’s online holiday shopping projection was nearly spot on. In its October forecast for the 2023 holiday sales figures, Adobe Analytics predicted that e-commerce sales between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 would reach $221.8 billion , a 4.8% increase compared to 2022. Online consumer spending increased 6% year over year in November to $123.5 billion, driven in large part by the $38 billion spent online between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The following month, shoppers drove a 3.7% year-over-year bump in online spending to $98.6 billion, according to Adobe. While the overall holiday season drove growth in buy now, pay later sales, Adobe found that Cyber Monday BNPL purchases spiked 42.5% from last year to $940 million, marking the biggest day on record for BNPL purchases. Throughout November, buy now, pay later transactions increased 17.5% from 2022 to $9.2 billion, making it the biggest month on record for the payment method. The rise in 2023 BNPL sales signals a continuing trend of consumers turning to the installment payment method to finance their holiday purchases. “In an uncertain demand environment, retailers leaned on discounting and flexible payment methods to entice shoppers this holiday season,” Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. “The strategy was effective, driving record spend online during big days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday, and a record 11 days that surpassed $4 billion in daily spend this season.” With more consumers turning to installment payment plans to fund their holiday shopping, BNPL providers have seen a boost in orders. Klarna said that U.S. shoppers placed 29.5% more orders on Black Friday this year compared to last year. Adobe also accurately forecast the rise in mobile shopping during this year’s holiday season. More than half (51.1%) of online shoppers transacted via smartphones this holiday season, an increase from 47% a year ago. Consumers spent the most via mobile on Christmas Day, driving 63% of online sales, Adobe found. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Technology, Consumer Trends, Holidays"

    "article_text": "Homepage business Companies JD Sports shares slide 23% as Christmas sales come up short The retailer, which sells Nike, Adidas, and other sports fashion ranges, said softer demand and more promotional activity than expected dented gross margins The sports retailer now expects profit before tax of £915m to £935m for the financial year, down from a previous forecast of over £1bn. Thu, 04 Jan, 2024 - 16:37 Eva Mathews       Nearly £2bn (€2.3bn) was wiped off JD Sports Fashion's market value, after the sportswear giant warned on annual profit, citing tepid consumer spending that bruised Christmas peak season sales and led to heavy discounting. The retailer, which sells Nike, Adidas and other sports fashion ranges, said softer demand and more promotional activity than expected dented gross margins in the peak 22-week period through to the end of December. It now expects profit before tax of £915m to £935m for the year ending at the start of February, down from a previous forecast of over £1bn. Shares in the company, which along with fashion retailer Next was among the first non-food retailers to issue a post-Christmas trading updates, recorded its steepest fall of 23%. The shares had gained about 25% since its half-year results announcement up to year-end, as investors bet on the group's expansion across North America and Europe. JD's warning echoes similar statements from Adidas and Puma, which have been grappling with staggered apparel sales amid warmer weather, while footwear demand has remained steady. Clothes retailers like H&M and Superdry also flagged a slower start to the autumn-winter season as shoppers held off buying knitwear, but Next has reported it had a strong Christmas sales period. Last month, Nike trimmed its annual sales forecast, blaming cautious consumer spending, a weaker online business and more promotions. Shares of sportswear firms Nike, Adidas, Puma, and others were down on Thursday. \"The consumer is cautious and looking for a deal, and with no especially exciting launches, it has been a dullish period,\" Peel Hunt analysts said. JD said its like-for-like organic revenue increased 1.8%, slightly less than expected, for the reported period. The group expects full-year organic revenue growth of about 8%, compared with the 12% growth it posted last year. Meanwhile, JD Sports' Dutch subsidiary Sports Unlimited has been declared bankrupt, Dutch media outlet RTL reported, citing a spokesperson of the Amsterdam District Court. There are 54 stores under Sports Unlimited in the Netherlands, with 1,100 employees. It is not clear if the jobs will be lost. \"We appreciate this is a difficult time for SUR colleagues in the Netherlands and we are doing our utmost to support them,\" the spokesperson for Sports Unlimited Retail said in a statement. • Reuters Read More Retailer Next upgrades profit outlook for fifth time in eight months x Unlimited access.

The numbers, released Thursday , showed online spending between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 spiked by nearly 5 percent to a record high of $222.1 billion on retailer websites and apps. This is an increase of 10.4 billion from the previous year, Adobe noted. Mobile shopping also had a breakthrough this past holiday season, surpassing desktop for the first time and accounting for 51.1 percent of online sales, according to the report. This is up from 47 percent in 2022 and was highest on Christmas Day. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Consumer spending was partly driven by discounts across several categories, including electronics, toys and apparel. Shoppers, according to Adobe, also more often used the “Buy Now, Pay Later,” payment method — which allows them to pay for items in smaller increments over time. This method accounted for $16.6 billion in the season’s online spending, a $2.1 billion jump from the previous season. Spending using the later payment option was highest on Cyber Monday, a marketing campaign involving discounts and deals for shoppers following in-store, and online, Black Friday deals. “In an uncertain demand environment, retailers leaned on discounting and flexible payment methods to entice shoppers this holiday season,” said Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst for Adobe Digital Insights. “The strategy was effective, driving record spend online during big days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday, and a record 11 days that surpassed $4 billion in daily spend this season.” Adobe also found that consumer spending was driven by demand, as opposed to inflation. The company explained in its report that while the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, consumer spending would’ve had an even higher growth if online inflation was factored in.

Unlock Insights: View Full Report Now! https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/ALLI-Auto-0D476/retail-ready-packaging TRENDS INFLUENCING THE GROWTH OF RETAIL READY PACKAGING MARKET Corrugated cardboard boxes are frequently used in retail-ready packaging (RRP) for a variety of purposes including a range of product categories, materials, and uses. Because it is strong, adaptable, and reasonably priced, corrugated cardboard is a popular option for retail packaging. Corrugated boxes are versatile in terms of product kinds, offering appropriate solutions for a variety of commodities. While some RRPs utilize plastic as a material, corrugated cardboard is still widely used since it is sustainable, recyclable, and eco-friendly-all of which are in line with the growing emphasis on packaging that is ecologically beneficial. Corrugated cardboard serves as a robust and protective barrier in applications like food and beverage, guaranteeing the safe transportation and display of goods while also providing branding and marketing opportunities on the packaging surface. The potential of Retail ready packaging to improve shelf presence and brand awareness is one of the main factors propelling the market's expansion. Retail ready packaging is intended to maximize product presentation and increase consumer appeal. Brands are becoming more aware of how appealing packaging influences consumers' decisions to buy, which is driving up demand for RRP solutions that make goods stand out on crowded store shelves. One of the key factors driving the RRP market's growth is supply chain efficiency. Retailers are using RRP to streamline restocking procedures and cut down on handling time. RRP's design makes it easier to quickly replenish inventory and reduces the time and labor needed to get goods ready for the sales floor, which improves supply chain efficiency and lowers costs. Retail Ready Packaging provides benefits for cost savings all along the supply chain. Lower total operating expenses are a result of simple handling, effective shipping, and a decreased need for supplementary packing. Furthermore, as sustainability is becoming a top priority for companies, Retail ready packaging materials are frequently selected for their ecologically beneficial qualities, satisfying the rising need for packaging options that minimize environmental impact. The need for convenience and the rise of mobile lives have driven RRP's expansion. RRP responds to consumer demand for items that are convenient to grab and go by offering packaging that is both aesthetically pleasing and made to be easily accessible. The fast-paced lifestyles of contemporary customers are in line with RRP's emphasis on consumer convenience. Customization and personalization of packaging are major factors propelling the Retail Ready Packaging Industry. Retail Ready Packaging is being used by brands to develop distinctive and customized packaging solutions that appeal to their target markets. In addition to strengthening brand identification, customization makes for a more interesting and memorable customer experience, which increases brand loyalty. In the retail industry, point-of-purchase (POP) marketing has become more popular, and Retail ready packaging is essential to this tactic. The purpose of retail ready packaging is to effectively communicate the characteristics and benefits of a product at the time of sale by acting as a marketing tool. The success of retail ready packaging in promoting POP marketing campaigns, encouraging impulsive purchases, and influencing customer behavior is responsible for its expansion.

    "article_text": "Agencies Representative Image Even as e-commerce has become a buzzword in the retail industry lately and companies are focusing on online channels, physical retail still thrives in big cities where customers are supposed to be more connected and thus supposedly more inclined to shop online . After the Covid lockdowns, retailers had started shutting stores or reducing the size of stores to save on rentals. The trend has reversed with the return of shoppers to the malls and markets. The new supply of retail space in shopping malls increased 72 percent last year to 59.48 lakh square feet across eight major cities to meet rising demand from retailers, according to Cushman & Wakefield. In 2023, as many as 11 shopping malls became operational, covering 59,48,395 square feet of space across the top eight cities. In the previous year, nine malls came into eight markets, totalling 34,49,222 square feet area. Hyderabad witnessed the completion of three shopping malls, while Pune and Chennai had two each. One shopping mall each came up in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Ahmedabad. No fresh supply was seen in Kolkata. A retail real estate boom New supply of retail real estate space is expected to rise 43 per cent across seven major cities by 2027 as developers are expanding their business amid strong revival after the pandemic, according to a JLL India report 'India Retail: Evolving to a new dawn' released last year. \"India's retail sector is on an elevated growth curve where the focus is on creating an innovative built environment, greater connections with the consumers, and curating physical storefronts in untapped regions of the country including tier II and III cities,\" said Rahul Arora, Head of Office Leasing Advisory and Retail Services, India, JLL. Live Events \"Following massive residential development , the retail spaces are now experiencing high tailwinds. The main factors driving this trend are favourable global perception, high growth opportunities, rapid economic progress and optimistic investors' sentiments,\" Gaurs Group CMD Manoj Gaur had said while commenting on the report. Gurugram-based realty firm Ocus Group CEO Vinod Rajpaul said, \"Organised retail is on the high. There has been a substantial increase in the footfalls in malls, particularly post Covid-19 pandemic. The demand for quality retail spaces is surpassing supply across major cities.\" The strong demand had also meant hardening of lease rentals as well, he had said. Out of the total retail stocks in malls of 89 million square feet as of June-end last year, Delhi NCR had the maximum 28 million square feet, followed by Mumbai with 17 million square feet and Bengaluru 14 million square feet. \"The physical retail space segment has an expected supply pipeline of over 38 million sq ft of retail developments between H2 2023 and 2027, across the top seven cities,\" JLL said. Out of the 38 million square feet, new retail supply in malls estimated by 2027, Delhi-NCR will have 11.6 million square feet area, accounting for 31 per cent of the expected supply. Malls are expected to attract investment of more than Rs 20,000 crore over the next 3-4 years as the country's biggest mall developers, DLF, Prestige and Phoenix, have entered the next phase of expansion as almost all top retailers are expanding their store count, industry executives have told ET. This expansion of retail space is largely powered by private equity investments. Almost 60% of malls that commenced in 2023 had private equity participation. Most malls that started in 2023 came with healthy pre-commitments and got immediately occupied upon opening. They include Palladium in Ahmedabad, Pacific Premium in Delhi NCR, Lulu Manjeera in Hyderabad, Mall of Millennium in Pune, and Mall of Asia in Bengaluru - and all of them have occupancy rates of over 90%. Healthy supply is expected for the next few years, with total grade A retail mall supply for the top six markets expected to increase to 116-118 msf by March 2025 from 105 msf now, according to ICRA. The rental income for mall operators is expected to increase by 9-10% on-year in FY24 and by 8-9% in FY25, driven by healthy occupancy levels , estimated growth in trading values, and rental escalations, according to Icra. Segments like jewellery, electronics, apparels, beauty care products of premium brands, and entertainment saw above-average consumption growth in the recent quarters, which is expected to continue in near to medium term with strong consumer demand , ICRA said. More and bigger stores Listed retail players such as Reliance Retail, PVR, Aditya Birla Fashion, and Tata Trent increased their store count significantly last calendar year as their revenues continued to rise. Retailers across categories are opening bigger bricks-and-mortar stores along with expanding their existing stores as consumers are increasingly looking for a better experience in physical retail. According to real estate services firm Anarock, the share of stores smaller than 2,000 square feet declined to 52% in the first half of 2023-24, as against 61% a year ago. The share of stores sized 2,000-5,000 sq ft increased during this period, to 21% from 19%, as did that of those sized 5,000-10,000 sq ft (11% from 9%) and 10,000-15,000 sq ft (13% from 9%). Retailers across categories are adopting a two-pronged approach by expanding and entering newer markets and also increasing their store sizes to capitalize on the growing share of the organised retail market. “Store is now more about experience than merchandising. Brands have realised that and by expanding the store they are expanding the offering,” Pankaj Renjhen, COO and joint MD, Anarock Retail, told ET recently. Retailers in India leased nearly 4.73 million sq ft of space across top cities in the first nine months of 2023, marking a strong rebound from the pandemic-induced slowdown. Leasing activity during the period was higher than the entire 2022, showed data from CBRE. Retail sector leasing increased 46% year-on-year in the January-September period. Total absorption in the country’s top eight cities increased to 4.73 million sq ft from 3.23 million sq ft a year ago. Fashion and apparel, and home and department stores dominated leasing activity with more than 50% share. Bengaluru, Delhi-National Capital Region and Pune collectively accounted for more than 61% share during this period. Supply of fresh retail space soared 577% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2023 to about 2.98 million sq ft. Outlet malls At least half a dozen factory outlet malls are being planned in India, like in the US and UK, as developers of retail facilities attempt to fight ecommerce rivals in a market increasingly driven by deep discounting, ET had reported last year. While such retail spaces, where brands are offered on discount round the year, are popular globally, the segment is unorganised in India. \"We have opened one such mall in Delhi's Jasola where all the premium brands have their factory outlets. Some brands have opened their first such store in the country. It is still at an early stage, but the concept is expected to gain popularity,\" Abhishek Bansal, managing director of Pacific Malls, had told ET last year. The mall houses brands such as The Collective, The Tank, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Lacoste, Skechers, Adidas and Birkenstock at discounted prices. The company intends to explore more such options. Factory outlets for premium brands were not getting the right kind of development in India which has now opened up with these premium outlet malls coming up. These malls will have the right environment including food and beverages and movies making shopping a total experience, said Lacoste India managing director and CEO Rajesh Jain. \"Till now, most factory outlets were located in high street locations which was a hassle for consumers for parking. Our store in the Jasola mall has exceeded our expectations,\" he had said. \"Retail will not be limited to malls and high streets, but move to highways with more infrastructure being built. On highways, factory outlets mall along with F&B and recreational makes sense. In coming years, this is going to be a popular concept,\" Susil S. Dungarwal, founder of Beyond Squarefeet, a shopping mall specialist company, had told ET. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

    "article_text": "RELATED TOPICS SAUDI ARABIA ECONOMY PHOTO Saudi Arabia’s economic outlook will be positive this year on the back of strong non-oil activities, including higher consumer spending, according to a new analysis. The kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP) is on track to expand by 4.4% in 2024 despite lower oil revenues, as the non-oil economy continues to get a boost from the Saudi Vision 2030 programmes, AlJazira Capital said in its report. “Increase in consumer spending, low unemployment levels and expansion in non-oil private sector activity point towards favourable economic conditions for the kingdom,” the Saudi investment firm’s report said. “[The GDP will expand] on the back of growth in the private sector amid implementation of programmes under Saudi Vision 2030. Weak oil revenues would be offset by growth in non-oil revenues.” Saudi’s forecast GDP for the full year is slightly lower than China’s (4.6%), but higher than emerging economies (4%), Euro area (1.2%) and the United States (1.5%). Revenues from oil for the full year 2023 are forecast to fall to SAR752 billion ($200.5 billion) from a year earlier due to output cuts, but non-oil revenues are expected to climb to SAR441 billion from SAR411 billion over the same period. The government’s expansionary spending over the medium term through the Public Investment Fund (PIF) will also support non-oil activity GDP and mitigate the decline in oil income. AlJazira also noted that, compared to other economies, Saudi Arabia’s debt levels are moderate and remain comfortable at 25.9% of the expected GDP. “However, significant funding requirements to meet Vision 2030 targets would result in the budget deficit for FY 23-24 need to be covered with most part by debt and we believe, a comfortable debt profile would help support the government’s spending plans.” (Writing by Cleofe Maceda; editing by Seban Scaria) seban.scaria@lseg.com Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

    "article_text": "LCP named top direct owner of shopping centres LCP, the leading national commercial property and investment company, part of M Core, has been ranked the top direct owner of shopping centres in the country for the third consecutive year. By John Corser Published Jan 2, 2024 The Trevor Woods Going Shopping 2024, The Definitive Guide to Shopping Centres, showed that Kingswinford-based LCP retained the top spot for direct retail centre ownership. The group also features in the top three for leading owners and investment managers for shopping centres in the UK, with 26 of its schemes in the top 200 centres. This includes Cwmbran Centre, which is ranked second in Wales and in the top 50 in the UK. James Buchanan, group managing director of The LCP Group, said: “This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our outstanding asset management team, who have navigated this year with resilience and innovation. They are among the country’s leading retail centre experts and together we’re proud to be at the forefront of the UK property market. “As a group, we continue to focus on the retail sector because it offers significant opportunities – not just as a return on our investment, but also because as an active landlord, we are committed to improving the offer in our retail portfolio. “We own and manage a huge range of retail, from small neighbourhood parades to large dominant schemes and retail parks, and our aim is the same for all: to create a vibrant shopping experience for all, with national brands and local retailers sitting alongside one another. “We’ve had phenomenal success this year with growing our portfolio and we will continue to acquire retail centres next year and beyond, enhancing our reputation as a leading property owner and investment manager in the UK.” The report also named LCP as the leading landlord and second highest managing agent in the West Midlands, and ranked it third in the top owners and investment managers in Yorkshire and Humberside. In Wales, where it owns and manages the Cwmbran Centre, it moved up a place to second as the principality’s top retail landlord. In the north, it was ranked third as highest owner and investment manager. The report pointed out that LCP and Evolve Estates, another company in the M Core collective, did not feature in its shopping reports 10 years ago, highlighting the rapid rise of the companies as they turned their focus to retail. Evolve was also placed fourth in the owner and investment manager ranks in East Anglia and fifth in the south west. In the past 12 months alone, LCP Group has acquired more than £140 million with major acquisitions including Chelmsley Wood Shopping Centre, Central 12 Retail Park, Southport, Weaver’s Wharf, Kidderminster and The Centre Livingston. In total, LCP Group has 191 retail assets in the UK worth £642 million. These comprise more than 2,500 retail units over 5.96 million sq ft. The group also has more than 3,000 tenants, from small, local independent retailers to large national chains. It has £300 million available to invest for assets ranging from £500,000 to £30m and portfolios up to £150m and is actively seeking sites for acquisition."
