File | Photo Credit: K. Pichumani The Tamil Nadu government on Friday (December 20, 2024) said the 660-MW Ennore Thermal Power Station (ETPS) expansion project would help ensure grid stability and increase power generation. The State’s power demand is increasing by 10% every year, and to meet the increasing demand, projects like ETPS and Udangudi Super Critical Thermal Project have been planned, and work is underway. These projects would not impact the environment, the State Electricity department said in a statement. It also said Tamil Nadu was a leading State in terms of green energy. Green energy initiatives With 11,000 MW of wind energy capacity, Tamil Nadu ranks second in the country, and in terms of solar energy capacity, the State ranks third with a capacity of 9,400 MW, the statement noted. The State government has formed the Tamil Nadu Green Energy Company Ltd. to oversee its green energy initiatives, it said. The State has set a target of adding additional green energy capacity of 100 billion units by 2030. This includes wind and solar energy, pumped storage and battery energy storage systems, bio-mass and cogeneration projects, the statement added. It has set a target that 50% of its energy needs should be met by green energy by 2030. Due to the infirm nature of green energy sources, there is a need for the State’s energy mix to have a certain portion of conventional energy sources, according to the Electricity department. In the coming years, along with conventional energy, efforts would be taken to increase generation from green energy sources, which will help the State be self-sufficient and a leader in green energy, it noted. A public hearing on the expansion of ETPS was conducted at Ernavur on Friday.

Sprng Energy, which has 2.3 GW of operational renewable energy capacity, has put some of its assets on the block. For one 125 MW solar asset in Rajasthan, it received multiple bids in which state-run ONGC turned out to be the top bidder, people cited above said. ONGC's bid is learnt to have valued the Sprng's asset at around Rs 500 crore. Sprng Energy has now entered into an exclusive arrangement with ONGC to negotiate the final deal, these people said, adding that a closure may take months. Investment bank HSBC is advising Sprng Energy on the deal. Sprng Energy and ONGC didn't offer comments for the story. Live Events Shell acquired renewable energy platform Sprng Energy from private equity investor Actis in August 2022 for an enterprise value of $1.55 billion. Sprng then operated 2.1 GW of renewable energy assets. Shell aims to stay invested in Sprng Energy while selling out some of its operational and under-construction projects, according to people cited earlier. Several renewable energy projects are on the block in the country today, with some early private equity investors seeking exit and some promoters looking to recycle capital. ONGC, the nation's largest oil and gas producer, seeks to build a green portfolio using a mix of greenfield buildout and acquisitions. The cash-rich oil company, in partnership with NTPC Green, is seeking to buy Ayana Renewable Power, which has a portfolio of 4.6 GW of operational and under-construction renewable energy assets. ONGC, which aims to have a renewable energy portfolio of 10 GW by 2030, acquired PTC Energy Ltd for Rs 925 crore in September. PTC Energy has 288 MW wind generation capacity. Shell, meanwhile, has globally recalibrated its energy transition strategy. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Today I am standing here to share my views on an important topic “Energy Conservation”. Energy is the basis of our life. We fulfill our daily needs by using electricity, petrol, coal, gas and other energy sources. But have you ever thought that these energy sources are not infinite? Importance of Energy Conservation Conservation of energy is not only our responsibility but it is a necessity for our future generations. If we do not adopt measures to save energy today, then there may be a shortage of these resources in the future. This will not only make our life difficult but will also have a serious impact on the environment. Simple Tips to Save Energy Save electricity: Switch off lights and fans when there is no one in the room. Use solar energy: Get solar panels installed at home and make maximum use of natural light. Stop wastage of water: Use water pumps and geysers judiciously. Right use of vehicles: Walk or use a bicycle for short distances. Benefits of energy conservation Saving energy not only benefits the environment but also leads to economic savings. Along with this, it helps in keeping our earth healthy and green. Conclusion Let us all pledge that we will adopt energy conservation measures in our lives. It is not only an individual's responsibility but it is our collective responsibility. Remember, ""Save energy, save future"". Thank you. 5 Minutes Speech On Energy Conservation Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about the importance of energy conservation. Energy Conservation Day is celebrated in India every year on 14 December. The purpose of this day is to motivate people to save energy and use it wisely. Energy is an important part of our lives. We use it daily in our homes, schools, offices and industries. But if we spend it without thinking, it can get exhausted quickly. Saving energy helps us protect the environment. When we save electricity, less coal and petroleum is burnt, which reduces air pollution and global warming. We can take many small steps to save energy. For example, turn off lights and fans when not needed. Use power-saving devices and use renewable energy like solar energy. Energy conservation does not only mean saving electricity but also not wasting water and fuel. With small efforts, we can save our country from the energy crisis and make the environment safe. On this Energy Conservation Day, let us all pledge to use energy wisely and save it for the coming generations. Thank you! 10 Minutes Speech On Energy Conservation Good morning, respected Principal Sir, teachers, and my dear friends. Today I stand in front of you all to share my views on energy conservation. Energy conservation means the proper use of energy and not wasting it. It is our responsibility to save energy so that future generations can also benefit from it. The importance of energy conservation can be understood from the fact that every year ""Energy Conservation Day"" is celebrated on 14 December. The purpose of this day is to make people aware of the importance of saving energy. Energy Conservation Day was first celebrated in India on 14 December 1991. It was organized by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, which aims to ensure that energy is used properly and is not wasted unnecessarily. Saving energy not only reduces the electricity bill but also protects the environment. When we use energy properly, it helps in reducing climate change and pollution. For example, if we switch off unnecessary bulbs, use fans and ACs properly, and adopt energy efficient appliances, we can save a huge amount of energy. Another big aspect of energy conservation is the use of renewable energy. Resources like solar energy, wind energy, and hydro energy provide energy without harming the environment. We should promote these resources. Energy conservation starts from our small habits. Like switching off lights and fans while leaving the room, switching off water motors at the right time, and reducing the use of vehicles and walking or cycling. So friends, let us all pledge that we will make every possible effort to save energy. Saving energy is not only our responsibility, but it is also our duty towards the environment and humanity. Thank you. Hope you liked these suggestions and got thoughts about your speech. Refer to links below for more related information.

CenterPoint wants to remind customers of the benefits of having an energy-efficient home: Check your furnace maintenance, service your furnace annually, and check the air filter monthly; Adjust your temperature: To maximize potential savings, use a smart thermostat to automatically adjust your cooling or heating when you’re asleep or away from home; Seal air leaks: Use caulking and weather stripping around windows and doors to seal air leaks and reduce drafts inside the home; Use the sun: If it’s hot outside, cover the windows for a cooler indoor temperature. When it’s cold outside, open your shade/blinds to capture the warmth from the sun; Choose energy smart appliances: upgrading appliances that are ENERGY STAR certified can potentially qualify for ‘ energy efficient rebates ‘ Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Energy-efficient appliances are more cost-effective because they typically use less natural gas. Gas stoves produce emissions that can harm humans, pets, and the environment. One study conducted by Standford University found that more than three-quarters (one out of 53 stoves) did not leak methane when turned off, exposing families to nitrogen dioxide that can aggravate respiratory conditions (asthma, coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing). Carbon Capture: what is it and is it dangerous? “At CenterPoint, we have tips, tools, and programs to help customers save energy and manage their bills. We encourage our customers to take steps to increase the energy efficiency of their home so that they can continue to stay comfortable inside year-round while reducing their energy use,” said Tony Gardner, Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer at CenterPoint. “By taking some small and easy actions, customers can make a big difference in reducing their monthly energy bills.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Customers can learn more about energy saving and see their monthly costs and emissions on their website .
