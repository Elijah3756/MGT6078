The nation’s central bank had announced the committee on December 6 as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies. While the bank noted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) had the potential to automate complex processes and improve efficiency, it came with risks like algorithmic bias and data privacy. “To harness the benefits, it is critical to address the attendant risks early in the adoption cycle,” said the RBI. Accordingly, the committee was set up to “recommend a robust, comprehensive, and adaptable AI framework for the financial sector.” The committee would include the following members: Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay (Chairperson) Ms. Debjani Ghosh, Distinguished Fellow, NITI Aayog; Independent Director, Reserve Bank Innovation Hub; and Ex-President, NASSCOM Dr. Balaraman Ravindran, Professor and Head, Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI, IIT Madras Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India Rahul Matthan, Partner, Trilegal Member Anjani Rathor, Group Head and Chief Digital Experience Officer, HDFC Bank Ltd. Sree Hari Nagaralu, Head of Security AI Research, Microsoft India (R&D) Suvendu Pati, CGM, FinTech Department, Reserve Bank of India (Member Secretary) The terms of reference for the committee are: To assess the current level of adoption of AI in financial services, globally and in India. To review regulatory and supervisory approaches on AI with focus on financial sector globally. To identify potential risks associated with AI, if any and recommend an evaluation, mitigation and monitoring framework and consequent compliance requirements for financial institutions, including banks, NBFCs, FinTechs, PSOs, etc. To recommend a framework including governance aspects for responsible, ethical adoption of AI models / applications in the Indian financial sector. Any other matter related to AI in the Indian financial sector. Background: This development comes as the government is moving to regulate AI with greater scrutiny, especially in the financial sector. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently informed Regulated Entities (RE) that they would be fully responsible for any AI programs the develop or deploy, including data privacy, compliance with existing laws and even the output of such models. The agency had previously asked Investment Advisers and Research Analysts who used AI tools to reveal the extent of the usage to clients. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has also opened a second round of bids for projects under the “Safe & Trusted AI” pillar of the government’s IndiaAI mission. This is after it selected eight proposals during the first round.

Speaking at the Governor’s Day dinner organised by the Chartered Institute of Bankers, Dr. Addison revealed that the IMF had identified critical weaknesses in the banking system and set specific ""prior actions"" as prerequisites for financial assistance. Among these conditions was the dissolution of the two banks. “The IMF requires certain actions to be completed before even convening a board meeting to discuss a country’s situation or release funds,” Dr. Addison said. “One of these prior actions was the revocation of licenses for UT Bank and Capital Bank. This was unprecedented for many Ghanaians and came as a shock.” The two banks had their licenses revoked in August 2017, the same year Dr. Addison took over as Governor. He explained that the decision, though difficult, was necessary to prevent further destabilization of the financial sector. Dr. Addison further noted that the financial sector cleanup, which included the closure of several distressed institutions, has strengthened Ghana's banking system. He credited these reforms with enabling the sector to withstand external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

This is supported by the prospect of growth in the distribution of financing and the accumulation of third-party funds (DPK) to double digits. It is estimated that next year, the national sharia financial sector will grow to IDR 3,430.9 trillion. Chief Economist of PT Bank Syariah Indonesia Tbk (BSI) Banjaran Surya Indrastomo said that sufficient economic development throughout 2024 could be the basis for maintaining the positive growth of the national economy in 2025.

Aset Perbankan Syariah Segera Capai Rp 1.000 Triliun Although the world economy is still faced with the threat of economic turbulence and geopolitical uncertainty, he believes that the national economy, including the sharia economy in the country, has strong potential to continue the growth trend. “By 2025, the national sharia financial sector is expected to grow to the range of IDR 3,157.9 trillion - IDR 3,430.9 trillion from the asset side,” Banjaran said at the Sharia Economic Outlook 2025 event at BSI The Tower Building on Monday (23/12/2024). For the record, the realization of sharia financial assets in September 2024 was at the level of IDR 2.744 trillion, or up 11.9 percent year-on-year/yoy. Banjaran believes that the sharia financial sector is also expected to continue positive growth, amid the challenges of the domestic economy in 2025, with the sharia banking sector being the main driver. Amid this positive outlook, Banjaran said, BSI as Indonesia's largest sharia bank has strong potential to become a major actor driving the movement of the sharia finance industry and the national halal economy by 2025. Because, he said, since its birth, BSI has consistently performed the functions of more than just a sharia bank with its intermediary function, but rather beyond banking. “During this time, BSI has played an active role in connecting and moving the national halal economic ecosystem. By strengthening its role, as well as innovations that continue to be developed, BSI can further strengthen its role in moving the financial sector and the national economy. This role is increasingly important as that (global) economic turbulence still looms,” he said. On the same occasion, BSI Director of Treasury & International Banking Ari Rizaldi said, 2025 will be the momentum for BSI to continue growing. This is not separate from the uniqueness factor that Indonesia's largest sharia bank has. “One of BSI's greatest opportunities is in the halal business, this which needs to be enhanced and deepened as a form of BSI's active and positive role for economic growth domestically and even globally,” he said.

https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/cybersecurity-financial-sector-regulations-dora-william-fry,,How the cybersecurity landscape affects the financial sector,20241218T184500Z,,siliconrepublic.com,English,Ireland,XLF,Financial,financial sector,"ENTERPRISE How the cybersecurity landscape affects the financial sector by Jenny Darmody 18 Dec 2024 Save article Image: © Deenanath/Stock.adobe.com The team at William Fry take a closer look at upcoming cybersecurity regulations and what they mean for the financial sector. Cyberattacks continue to cause problems for companies in every sector, from tech companies to critical infrastructure. If personal data is affected by a cyberattack, companies must notify the relevant data protection authority and inform those affected under GPDR and these obligations are widening further under the NIS2 Directive and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). So, what does all this mean for the financial sector, which holds significantly valuable personal data and has a reputation for lagging behind when it comes to technical adoption? Claire O’Connor, a senior associate in the technology department of William Fry, says the evolution of cybersecurity laws has forced the financial sector to significantly enhance its capabilities in this space. “The Central Bank of Ireland published a guidance paper in 2016 outlining its expectations on IT and cybersecurity governance, focusing on risk management and resource allocation. The GDPR has been in effect since 2018 and imposes strict data protection requirements for personal data,” she said. “DORA will come into effect on 17 January 2025 and further mandates that financial entities in scope implement comprehensive ICT risk management standards, ensuring preparedness against cyberthreats.” Despite these advancements, O’Connor said challenges remain, especially with the continuous need to adapt and the ongoing training and awareness needed. “Overall, while Ireland’s financial sector’s ability to handle cybersecurity threats is improving through improved systems and procedures as well as these legal and regulatory obligations, ongoing vigilance is essential to sustain resilience in a constantly changing landscape,” she said. “In our experience, organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to hire individuals with the skillsets they need in terms of IT and cybersecurity.” The impact of DORA With DORA coming into effect in January 2025, the financial services sector must raise their standards significantly. Conor Forde, an associate at William Fry, said the current third-party framework consists mainly of regulatory guidelines from the Central Bank of Ireland and the European supervisory authorities. “While non-compliance with such guidelines would cause difficulty in ensuring resilience and mitigating outsourcing risks, such guidelines are not generally mandatory law,” he said. This differs from DORA, which is a sector-specific legislation that covers a wide range of financial entities and mandates that they implement robust ICT risk management frameworks. “The DORA regulation also introduces strict incident reporting obligations, compelling financial entities to report significant ICT-related incidents to national authorities, which fosters greater transparency and quicker regulatory responses,” said Forde. “By aligning with existing regulations like the GDPR and the NIS2 Directive, DORA creates a cohesive framework for cybersecurity across the financial sector.” For financial entities and third-party ICT service providers, this means putting in place comprehensive contractual arrangements that align with DORA’s requirements, including service level agreements, requirements around subcontracting, security standards, audit and incident reporting protocols. “This complexity can be particularly daunting for smaller providers, who may lack the financial and human resources to facilitate these requirements,” said John O’Connor, a partner at William Fry. “It is therefore essential for financial entities to engage with their third-party ICT service providers without delay ahead of the 17 January 2025 deadline.” Forde added that while some of DORA’s requirements may be familiar to financial entities that have had to comply with regulations such as the Central Bank of Ireland cross-industry guidance on outsourcing, and the European Banking Authority guidelines on outsourcing arrangements, it goes much further in its contractual provisions. “Notably, DORA also introduces the requirement to include mandatory contractual provisions for ICT services which do not support critical or important functions, which is a novel aspect of the regulation,” said Forde. “DORA enhances existing standards by mandating a more structured approach to third-party risk management.” O’Connor said that DORA provides a comprehensive framework for managing third-party ICT risks in the financial sector. “By focusing on third-party risk management, DORA not only protects individual institutions but also enhances the stability of the entire financial ecosystem,” he said. “This holistic approach represents a significant evolution in regulatory expectations, compelling financial entities to prioritise operational resilience and cybersecurity in their dealings with third-party services, ultimately seeking to enable a more secure financial services environment.” Don’t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

This system is part of the pioneering initiatives that the QCB is working on to upgrade the payment and financial transfer system in the country, as it represents a qualitative shift in Qatar's financial infrastructure, which increases the flexibility and efficiency of the financial system. The Real-Time Gross Settlement system plays a vital role in Qatar's banking sector, as it is the core banking system that processes and settles financial transactions between banks directly. It complies with the latest international messaging standards ISO 20022 to enhance technical integration between banks. The system also aims to improve the efficiency and speed of financial transfers and liquidity management in Qatar's banks to increase operational efficiency and add more flexibility to the banking system in general in light of technological developments, which have resulted in banking and financial services that require keeping pace with this progress by developing an infrastructure for payment systems that ensure the speed of implementation of financial settlements, transfers and banking transactions, while maintaining the highest standards of financial safety and stability. This system is characterised by providing immediate settlement of transactions between banks, while offering advanced levels of security and transparency at all stages of settlement.

""We do need to make a distinction between regulation with respect to financial sector and regulation with respect to non-financial sector of the economy,"" Nageswaran said at the CII Global Economic Policy Forum 2024. He said in non-financial sector, except in case of natural utilities where one needs a regulator to protect customer interest, competition or market forces will take care of what the regulators do. In financial sector, regulators have the tendency to lean towards excessive regulations, as if things go wrong in this sector the state is expected to bail out and the effects are systemic. "" In financial sector, competition sometimes leads to excessive risk taking and competition can be a source of instability rather than stability, which is not the case for non-financial sector of the economy. And the manifestation or climaxing of that was the 2008 global financial crisis,"" Nageswaran said."

Here Why It May Still Be a Buy for 2025 and Beyond . ,20241204T141500Z,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/799454/atm-deposit-withdrawal-money-bank-1200x730-493f331.jpg,fool.com,English,United States,XLF,Financial,financial sector,"Mutual fund giant Vanguard Group offers over 60 equity-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are ETFs for growth stocks, value stocks, and dividend stocks. Some ETFs focus on small-cap shares, while others focus on mega-caps. Some ETFs invest in momentum and others are more balanced. You may think that Vanguard's best-performing ETF in 2024 holds a lot of Nvidia stock, such as the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF , which has a whopping 12.5% weighting in Nvidia. And while that ETF is up a lot on the year -- 31% at the time of this writing -- an even better-performing ETF has been the Vanguard Financials ETF ( VFH +0.45% ) which invests purely in the financial sector. That's right, and its top holdings are stodgy blue chip stocks like JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway . And yet, the ETF is up some 37% year to date. Here's why the financial sector could still be worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. Meteoric rise The financial sector had a rocky 2023, driven by the March 2023 banking crisis that saw some small to midsize banks fail and pressure the entire sector. The Vanguard Financials ETF was down 2.9% through the first three quarters of 2023. But in the last quarter, it roared 14.9% higher and carried that momentum into 2024. Since Oct. 1, 2023, the ETF is up a staggering 57.2%. It's rare to see a traditionally value- and income-driven sector rally this much in a relatively short period of time. But there's reason to believe the rally is justified and could even carry momentum into the new year. An earnings-driven rally The financial sector is being driven by earnings growth and valuation expansions. Across the sector, price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios have gone from being below their historical levels to being at or above their historical levels. The following table shows the P/E ratios of top payment processors and investment banks -- which are all top 10 holdings in the Vanguard Financials ETF. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio 3-Year Median P/E Ratio 5-Year Median P/E Ratio 7-Year Median P/E Ratio 10-Year Median P/E Ratio Mastercard 40.3 36.8 36.6 38 40 36.8 Visa 32.4 28.1 30.7 32.1 33.2 32.6 American Express 22.4 22.5 17.1 17.8 18 16.4 Goldman Sachs 17.9 16.4 12.2 11.5 11.6 12 Morgan Stanley 20.1 18 14.6 12.6 12.2 12.3 Data source: YCharts. For the most part, the forward P/E ratios of the payment processors are around their historical averages. Still, there has been a noticeable valuation expansion from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have gone from sector laggards to leaders. The new administration could bring lower regulations and encourage more dealmaking, mergers, and acquisitions -- and that could lead to a sustained boom for the investment banking industry. Here's a look at the P/B ratios of top diversified banks and Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway. Company P/B Ratio 3-Year Median P/B Ratio 5-Year Median P/B Ratio 7-Year Median P/B Ratio 10-Year Median P/B Ratio Berkshire Hathaway 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 JPMorgan Chase 2.2 2 12 2.1 1.9 Bank of America 1.3 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.5 Wells Fargo 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.6 Citigroup 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Data source: YCharts. All five companies have P/B ratios right around their historical ranges. A year ago, many of these companies traded at a discount to their averages. In sum, the financial sector was dirt cheap but has since caught up and become more reasonably valued -- but not necessarily overvalued. 2024 was the perfect storm for the financial sector to take off because it was undervalued and entered a period of rapid expansion across multiple industries within the sector. A good value in an otherwise expensive market From diversified banks to payment processors, investment banks, asset managers, insurance companies, and financial services companies, the entire financial sector is thriving right now. With the exception of Bank of America, the top 10 holdings in the Vanguard Financials ETF are all within just 3% of their all-time highs. JPM data by YCharts Buying a stock or an ETF at an all-time high can feel counterintuitive because it goes against our instincts to buy at a discount. And yet, the sector remains a surprisingly good value. The Vanguard Financials ETF sports a P/E ratio of 18.6 and a dividend yield of 1.7%. For context, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500 -- has a P/E ratio of 30.2 and a yield of 1.3%. Other traditionally value-oriented and income-producing pockets of the market have also gotten more expensive. The Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF has seen its P/E ratio soar to 28.4 and its yield drop to 2.6%. Even the Vanguard Utilities ETF now yields under 3% and has a P/E ratio of 25.5. Valuations across virtually every sector have gone up. And since stock prices are outpacing dividend growth rates, sector yields have also fallen . So while the financial sector isn't as cheap as it used to be, it's definitely not overvalued compared to the rest of the market. The Vanguard Financials ETF remains a balanced buy With just a 0.1% expense ratio, the Vanguard Financials ETF offers a fairly inexpensive way to invest in the financials sector. This industry is an excellent way to gain exposure to continued economic growth. But keep in mind that it could also be prone to a sell-off if there is an economic downturn. Credit card companies would be hit hard if transaction volume and frequencies decline. Diversified and investment banks could face declining profits or returns on equity if consumers and companies struggle to afford their expenses or asset values fall. The cyclical nature of the financial sector and a history of noteworthy crashes are the primary reasons it tends to trade at a discount to the broader market. It's a similar dynamic as the energy sector, where oil and gas companies often sport inexpensive valuations because of their dependence on commodity prices and vulnerability to fluctuations in earnings. Still, the Vanguard Financials ETF could be a good buy even at an all-time high because it remains a good value, and many companies are delivering record earnings with few signs of slowing down."

The report was written by the Ministries of Justice and Treasury, the Competition Authority, the Securities Authority, the Capital Market Authority, and the Bank of Israel. The report includes first-of-their-kind recommendations regarding regulation of the use of AI technology in the financial sector. The report is open for comments until December 15th. General Approach and Principles for Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Financial Sector The report centres on encouraging innovation and AI adoption, while addressing associated risks and establishing appropriate regulation as needed. It proposes adopting flexible regulatory tools that can respond to technological developments, such as administrative directives and temporary regulations, alongside granting discretion to supervised entities to implement self-regulation tools. According to the report’s authors, Israeli regulation should adapt to global regulation in the field, while avoiding establishing a local standard. The report advocates for a risk-based approach and removing unnecessary regulatory barriers, with the aim of encouraging a competitive, innovative, and efficient market. Additionally, the report reviews challenges in the field of artificial intelligence generally, unique risks related to the financial sector, and impacts in three activity areas – investment consulting and portfolio management, credit in the banking system, and insurance underwriting. We have previously outlined the general risks of AI use by companies in the legal guide published this year. Artificial Intelligence Challenges in the Financial Sector The report outlines unique challenges of AI in the Financial sector: Financial Stability Risks – Reliance on a limited number of common artificial intelligence models by various players in the financial sector could potentially lead to a situation where many actors operate similarly and potentially impair independent and diverse decision-making capabilities. This also means that during an operational failure in these systems, many actors may be compromised, creating widespread impact on the sector. Report Recommendations : to continuously monitor AU use and map sensitive activities relying on AI, while ensuring relevant regulation. Cyber and Fraud Risks – AI could potentially serve as a tool for spreading disinformation and financial fraud, through the use of deep fakes or other impersonation methods. Report Recommendations : to expand regulatory monitoring and oversight of these risks, guiding financial entities in risk mapping and increasing public awareness. Risk to Competition – Using artificial intelligence systems may enhance market concentration and create entry barriers for new actors, especially in where a few suppliers control base model development. Report Recommendations : Strengthen fair competition practices in accordance with competition laws and improve access to information required for AI model training, to ensure equal opportunities and market concentration reduction. Discrimination and Individual Harm – errors due to AI use could lead to significant damages to customers relying on AI data processing. For example, credit request rejections, incorrect suspicious transaction identification, AI-based trading preferences, and more. The team recommends promoting solutions to examine AI outputs for reducing biases and discriminatory results. Financial Sector recommendations The report focuses on three financial domains: investment consulting and portfolio management, banking system credit, and insurance underwriting. Investment Consulting and Portfolio Management AI can reduce costs and make consulting and portfolio management services accessible to a broader audience. Report Recommendations: Encourage investment consulting and portfolio management license holders to integrate AI technology in their activities to increase accessibility to financial services. Add a chapter in online services guidelines addressing contemporary AI technology and examine chatbots’ activity in investment consulting and portfolio management. Promote research to examine the behavior AI systems users to understand technology’s impact on investor behavior. Banking Credit AI applications in credit are used, among others, for customer needs identification, underwriting, and credit rating. In some cases, this represents an evolution of existing models, however, given AI’s operation, there are concerns about discrimination alongside aggressive credit marketing to customers. Team Recommendations: To minimize risks of discrimination and exclusion, the report recommends clarifying that AI uses are not exempt from existing law, and financial institutions must ensure that before using AI tools, they have the means to strictly adhere to the regulatory requirements. The report recommends that companies include AI issues in their corporate governance process to realize management and board responsibility regarding unique risks. Implementing data review processes used to determine credit risks is essential to ensure data privacy and use of only relevant data in training processes. Insurance Underwriting AI can streamline underwriting processes, premium pricing, and insurance coverage management, but raises transparency, privacy, and bias risks in automatic decisions. The report recommends adhering to general principles of existing regulation and updating it as needed. Next Steps To ensure responsible integration of AI in financial services, the report recommends several important steps: Strengthen explainability for models requiring provision of reasoning, creating significant consumer risks or where reliance on AI in the decision is significant. Ensure human involvement in the decision-making processes where relevant. Ensure notification and disclosure about the use of AI tools and their impact on the consumer services or products. Enhance personal data protection in AI uses. Prevent discrimination in service, credit, and insurance provision. Expand financial entities’ responsibility towards their customers to include activities performed through AI. Develop risk assessment and corporate governance mechanisms that enable fair and transparent AI activity, including establishing oversight mechanisms, creating relevant policy documents, and appropriate vendor assessment. Recommendations for Financial Sector Companies We recommend all financial sector companies to not wait, and take steps to ensure responsible and safe AI use, including: Map and identify AI processes in use within the organization. Conduct a risk assessment regarding these uses. Formulate internal policy for AI use and identify the stakeholders responsible for its implementation. Implement protective measures to ensure responsible and fair system activity.

The eastern and southern regions of Spain were hit by floods on Oct. 29 and the damage caused to the financial sector is estimated to be around €20.5 billion ($21.6 billion), while some 561,210 people were directly affected by the floods. Bank of Spain Governor Jose Luis Escriva said the total cost of the disaster to the financial sector is equivalent to 1.8% of the total loan volume of Spanish banks, noting that the bank has no concerns for the Spanish financial sector. Escriva said that, of the $21.6 billion, $14.2 billion was for homes and $7.4 billion was for businesses. The process of recovering banknotes soaked or damaged by the floods continues, while the first deposit of some 22,700 banknotes is worth $760,100. He mentioned that 9% of ATMs in the flood zones were out of service and 37 of 298 damaged banks were still closed, though the use of credit cards is slowly returning to normal after the cash withdrawal chaos at the beginning of the floods. The Bank noted that the floods are likely to result in a 0.2 percentage point decline in Spain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter. The autonomous Valencian Community’s government requested $33.1 billion in aid for damages in its region alone, while the Spanish central government has decided to provide a total of $14.7 billion in two packages so far. The death toll from the floods reached 226 since Oct. 29, while 13 people are still missing. *Writing by Emir Yildirim Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

They argue that Islamic banking has become unavoidable in the current financial landscape when various countries are forming alliances to safeguard their economic interests, strengthen their currencies, and elevate their economies to new heights. Speaking at the Islamic Banking Seminar, organised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) at the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industries (HCST&SI) Secretariat, BankIslami Pakistan senior Shariah scholar Mufti Noman emphasised that only financially strong Muslims could build a strong Islamic society. ""Islamic banking is necessary for society as it operates free from interest, gambling and unethical practices. In contrast, conventional banking is interest-based and, therefore, incompatible with Islamic ethics,"" he said. He pointed out that according to the Federal Shariat Court's ruling, all commercial banks in Pakistan must switch to the Islamic banking system by December 2027. Mufti Noman urged the alignment of banking practices with Islamic values, adding that the banking sector in Pakistan was swiftly moving towards Islamic banking. The SBP has taken revolutionary steps and this year alone it has received over 1,000 applications for branch conversions into Islamic banking. Islamic banking operates on a profit-and-loss-sharing basis, with mechanisms like Murabaha, Salam and Istisna contracts governing asset and service exchanges, while Mudarabah and Musharakah are used to share both profits and losses. Acknowledging that all the suggestions given by the HCST&SI were valuable, SBP Deputy Director Adil Zahoor said the central bank was working tirelessly to promote Islamic banking through revolutionary initiatives. He noted that the concept of Islamic banking had already been adopted by many Muslim countries, while Pakistan was still in the implementation phase. Speaking on the occasion, HCST&SI President Muhammad Saleem Memon remarked ""as Muslims, conducting interest-free trade is our duty, with no room for compromise. Islamic banking has become an essential need of the time, with its growing trend worldwide."" He stated that Islamic banking could be immensely beneficial for Pakistani traders and industrialists, offering non-interest financial services aligned with Islamic principles, which could enhance trade and allow the business community to expand their activities through Halal means. HCST&SI Vice President Shan Sehgal pointed out that despite the launch of numerous schemes by the SBP and National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) for the welfare of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many bank staff members lacked knowledge of the schemes, preventing traders and the public from accessing them. He said any policy formulated by the central bank had a direct bearing on the business community. Therefore, it is essential to give traders representation in the SBP board of directors to allow them to provide critical recommendations for policy formulation. facebook twitter whatsup linkded email COMMENTS (1) Muhammad Sabir Shaikh | 11 months ago | Reply Still it is difficult for SUE S to get Business loans from Islamic Banks need good and easy excess between Islamic Banks and entrepreneurs for interest free Business loans Replying to X Saved !

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1581169.html,,Global alliance of banks supports fossil fuel treaty at COP29,20241114T091500Z,,prokerala.com,English,India,XLF,Financial,financial sector,"Baku, Nov 14 : As the UN climate conference (COP29) is underway in Baku in Azerbaijan, the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) on Thursday announced that 25 of its member banks have endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty initiative, marking the first collective endorsement of the initiative by financial institutions. The treaty is a proposal for a global binding plan to end the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and manage a global transition away from fossil fuels. Founded in 2009, the GABV is a network of 70 sustainable banks operating across all major world regions, united by a mission to ""finance change and change finance"". By endorsing the proposal for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, these 25 GABV members are urging the financial sector to take meaningful action in the fight against climate change by ending finance for fossil fuel expansion. They collectively manage $117 billion in assets and serve over 11.3 million people worldwide. The GABV's member banks represent some of the most ambitious examples of sustainable finance. For instance, Triodos Bank, the first bank in the world to sign up to the treaty initiative, has been the leading lender for clean energy projects for eight consecutive years. GABV members are setting ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions as early as 2035, demonstrating that sustainable finance is not only possible but essential. Martin Rohner, Executive Director, GABV said, ""Despite frequent and often high-profile commitments, many mainstream banks continue to finance the fossil fuel industry, fuelling further unpredictable climate impacts. If the financial sector is serious about its sustainable commitments, it should support initiatives like the treaty that are creating real solutions to the crisis. ""A treaty will help create a resilient business climate, built on a long-term perspective and a level playing field, which is in the interest of businesses and financial institutions wherever they are in the world."" Tzeporah Berman, Chair and Founder of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: ""The support from a growing number of banks for the Fossil Fuel Treaty reflects true leadership in the financial sector and a recognition that phasing out fossil fuels is not only desirable but achievable. ""These visionary banks are boldly stepping up as leaders in the fight against the climate crisis, recognising their vital role in driving a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels."" The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement recognised the financial sector as an enabler of the most ambitious climate-related goals. Since then, every COP (Conference of Parties) has explicitly referenced the financial system's role in supporting the just transition. Moreover, this COP29 has been dubbed the ""Finance COP,"" marking the critical moment for wealthy countries to fund the fight against climate devastation."

This strategic move aims to leverage technology for business solutions and enhance shareholder value. Genisys, specializing in AI-enabled solutions for various sectors, will operate under BFSL with expanded capabilities. Atmadip Ray ET Bureau Updated On Nov 5, 2024 at 10:51 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Bandhan Financial Services Ltd (BFSL), the promoter of Bandhan Bank, has acquired global information technology and business process services provider Genisys group of companies, which has its origin in London. This marks Bandhan group's strategic foray into the IT sector. It completed the acquisition just ahead of Diwali paying nearly Rs 100 crore in an all-cash deal, two people familiar with the matter said. ""The entry into the technology sector is in confirmation with the applicable guidelines for core investment companies, which are allowed to invest in non-financial sectors,"" BFSL managing director Arvind Agrawal told ET. Advt "" Bandhan Financial Services had surplus cash, which has been deployed to acquire the tech services group with an aim to enhance shareholders' value. Technology is something which integrates everything together. The potential for IT-driven solutions to address business challenges, especially in the banking and financial services sector, is enormous, and we anticipate significant growth in this area.” Agrawal said The IT services group had three separate companies under it -- Genisys Software Ltd (UK), Genisys Software Ltd (US) and Genisys Information Systems India Pvt Ltd. BFSL acquired the all three separately and has now brought them under one entity -- Genisys Information Systems India Pvt Ltd, which is located in Bengaluru and will become the head office. The London and New York units will be turned into subsidiaries of it. The IT group provides AI-enabled solutions to banking and financial services companies as well as to sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, retail & e-commerce, travel & hospitality, media, marketing & advertising. ""With the support of the Bandhan Group, we can now expand extensively and build new capabilities, particularly in AI-driven solutions ,"" Genisys group chief executive Satish Subramaniam said. This is the third acquisition by BFSL but the first one in the non-financial sector. . In the previous two years, it acquired IDFC Asset management Company and Aegon Life Insurance respectively to broaden its interest in the financial services space. Advt Incidentally, the latest acquisition got completed after Bandhan group founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh was back in the fray as the chairman of BFSL about a month back. He retired from Bandhan Bank as managing director on July 9, this year. RBI regulation says that core investment companies would require prior approval from it for investing in the financial sector while there is no such rule for investment in the non-financial sector. The investment in the non-financial sector only needs to be reported to the regulator within a month of making it.

The limited effect is attributed to lower levels of debt holdings among banks and more favourable restructuring terms, with several impairments having already been booked in 2022. Banks also showed a strong recovery in financial performance for 2023. The report highlighted that in August 2023, the Ghanaian government restructured bond holdings of pension funds totalling GH¢30.01 billion in a separate arrangement. However, the review cautioned that ongoing external debt restructuring, especially concerning Eurobonds, could lead to additional impairments for banks and other participating financial institutions. “The regulatory reliefs implemented by financial sector regulators, alongside recapitalisation plans and the establishment of the Ghana Financial Stability Fund, will help cushion the financial sector from the impacts of the government debt operation,” the report noted. Furthermore, the Financial Sector Strengthening Strategy (FSSS), introduced in 2023, coordinates regulatory interventions to promptly address risks in the financial system. While the domestic debt restructuring has created fiscal space and lowered the debt-to-GDP ratio, further adjustments loom. On July 14, 2023, Ghana launched the second phase of its DDEP, which included the restructuring of GH¢8.1 billion in Cocoa Bills and $808.99 million in locally issued U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

As part of the Labour government’s broader goal to bolster the UK’s international competitiveness, Reeves intends to reinforce support for finance firms, pledging concrete steps to make London a more attractive global financial hub.

Δ According to sources close to the Treasury, Reeves will also unveil fresh guidelines for the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) either during her address or shortly thereafter. These guidance documents, known as remit letters, aim to clarify how regulators should navigate their duties under a mandate to elevate the UK’s global financial standing. Insiders familiar with the policy discussions noted that the new instructions are intended to refine regulatory processes, making them less obstructive to business growth and more attuned to the sector’s competitive needs, per Bloomberg. In what promises to be a strategic pivot in Labour’s approach to the financial sector, Reeves’s address is widely seen as a crucial opportunity for the party to reset its relationship with finance leaders. Since taking office in July, Labour has had a mixed rapport with business heads, compounded by a recent Budget announcement that included tax hikes. Reeves’s November speech represents a chance for the government to demonstrate its commitment to fostering a vibrant financial sector. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has hinted at these forthcoming reforms, recently telling attendees at Labour’s international investment summit that his administration would be “marching through the regulators” to eliminate excessive bureaucratic constraints. This approach underscores Labour’s intention to streamline oversight while also creating conditions conducive to sustainable growth.

Her plan is expected to address potential overlaps in regulatory roles, as well as to cut unnecessary rules and costs that are hampering the industry’s expansion, according to sources who declined to be named. This could mark a significant shift from the traditional regulatory approach, emphasizing a more collaborative dynamic between government and financial institutions. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed, “At Mansion House, the chancellor will set out how she will work in partnership with industry and regulators to deliver growth. This will include providing the stability the financial services sector needs to grow and delivering the reform it needs to prosper.” The spokesperson added that Reeves’s vision includes aligning the sector’s expansion with broader investment goals that span the UK. There appears to be considerable support from industry executives for this “competitiveness regime,” as it is being called. However, some advocates are pushing for more aggressive measures, including the possibility of making competitiveness a central consideration in regulatory decision-making. Another proposed reform involves the reinstatement of the so-called “call-in” power—a controversial mechanism that would allow ministers to override regulatory bodies. Although dropped last year, insiders suggest that revisiting this power would require legislative changes and might not be immediately implemented, per Bloomberg. Consideration of Structural Changes Reeves’s speech may also address longer-term considerations, including potential structural shifts in the FCA and PRA. Labour reportedly examined the possibility of restructuring these regulatory bodies before the July general election, a move that could be re-evaluated if regulators are not seen as fully embracing the government’s competitiveness agenda. While opinions in the financial sector differ, with some advocating for a complete overhaul of regulatory structures and others favoring a more measured enhancement of existing rules, the objective remains clear: to support a financial ecosystem that can both compete internationally and fuel domestic economic growth.

In addition, some impairments had already been booked by banks in 2022 while banks generally reported a strong rebound in financial performance in 2023. The report revealed that in separate arrangements, the Government of Ghana negotiated and restructured bond holdings of pension funds totalling GHS30.01 billion in August 2023.

DOI: 10.4236/me.2024.1510049 PDF HTML XML 79 Downloads 653 Views Citations Abstract This paper explores the challenges and opportunities for financial sector development in Sierra Leone, a country with a fragile post-conflict and post-crisis economy. Despite various reforms aimed at strengthening the financial system, it remains underdeveloped, characterized by limited access, shallow financial depth, and inefficiencies. The study employs the IMF’s Financial Development Index to measure financial sector performance and examines key factors hindering progress in the sector, including macroeconomic instability, political fragility, weak institutional frameworks, low levels of financial literacy and large informal sector. Empirical evidence shows that these factors are significant obstacles to the progress of the financial sector. However, opportunities exist for improvement, particularly through sustained financial literacy programs, legal and regulatory reforms, and macroeconomic stabilization efforts. The paper concludes by recommending prioritized interventions by the government and international development partners to address these challenges, with a focus on strengthening institutions and fostering a stable economic environment conducive to long-term financial development.

Introduction A large body of literature has established a strong link between financial sector development and economic growth (see King & Levine, 1993: pp. 717-737 ; Rajan & Zingales, 1998: pp. 559-586 ). This relationship is evident globally, where well-developed financial systems underpin the success of advanced economies, while underdeveloped financial systems often characterize poorer nations. Many developing countries have embarked on financial reforms to enhance sector performance and, in turn, promote economic growth, with mixed results. Financial sector development is typically measured by how effectively the financial system performs its core functions. However, various factors influence its performance. Ngouala, Ghislain and Bongo (2021: pp. 452-468) and Johnson (2011) highlight the importance of the institutional environment, which encompasses contract enforcement and property rights. Legal traditions, as established by La Porta et al. (1997: pp. 1131-1150; 1998: 1113-1155) , may also impact financial development, while Acemoglu et al. (2001: pp. 1369-1401) and Beck et al. (2003: pp. 137-181) point to the role of endowments. Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) and Baltagi et al. (2009: pp. 285-296) suggest that trade and financial openness are crucial to banking sector development, while Ang and Kumar (2013: pp. 43-56) emphasis on cross-border barriers to financial innovation explain differences in financial sector development. The financial system in Sierra Leone has evolved since the establishment of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL, 2018) in 1964, which was tasked with maintaining price stability and ensuring the financial system’s stability. However, the civil war of 1991-2001 disrupted economic activities and damaged financial infrastructure, including bank branches in key cities (see Johnson, 2022: pp. 3500-3517 ; UNDP, 2008 ). Post-war financial reforms, initiated under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), liberalized the financial system to some extent, with market-determined interest rates and a growing presence of foreign banks (see World Bank 2017 ; IMF, 2004 ). The banking sector, dominated by 14 commercial banks (10 foreign and 4 local, including 2 state-owned), comprises over 70 percent of total financial assets ( Bank of Sierra Leone, 2022 ). Non-bank financial institutions, such as pension funds, microfinance, and community banks, represent a smaller share, while the capital market, established in 2007, remains stagnant. Despite the ongoing reforms, Sierra Leone’s financial sector remains shallow and underdeveloped, limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy. Financial innovation, rapidly transforming global financial systems, has had little impact on Sierra Leone’s rudimentary financial services. According to IMF (2008) , the country’s financial development is hindered by physical barriers, weak financial infrastructure, and institutional and legislative challenges. Kargbo and Adamu (2008: pp. 30-61) further argue that poor enforcement of creditor rights and commercial contracts has undermined banks’ ability to recover loans, impairing the financial system’s ability to allocate credit efficiently. This paper seeks to analyze the challenges to financial sector development in Sierra Leone and identify the scope for improvement. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives the theoretical basis of the study; Section 3 outlines the data and methodology; Section 4 provides an overview of the financial sector’s evolution; Section 5 discusses the challenges and opportunities for financial sector development; and Section 6 concludes with policy implications. 2. Theoretical Basis The study is grounded in several key theoretical frameworks and empirical findings from the broader literature on financial development and economic growth. These theories provide a foundation for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing Sierra Leone’s financial sector. A substantial body of literature, including seminal works by King and Levine (1993: pp. 717-737) and Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) , has established a strong link between financial sector development and economic growth. This relationship underscores the importance of a well-functioning financial system for economic progress, particularly relevant for developing countries like Sierra Leone. Similarly, the work of Gurley and Shaw (1960) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983: pp. 401-419) on financial intermediation explains how financial institutions, particularly banks, facilitate the flow of funds from savers to borrowers. This theory is crucial for understanding the role of Sierra Leone’s banking sector, which dominates the country’s financial landscape. La Porta et al. (1997: pp. 1131-1150 ; 1998: pp. 1113-1155) emphasize the importance of institutional factors, including legal traditions and property rights, in shaping financial development. This perspective is particularly pertinent given Sierra Leone’s challenges with weak institutional frameworks and the rule of law. Boyd et al. (2001: pp. 137-181) found a strong negative association between inflation and financial sector development, emphasizing the importance of macroeconomic stability for financial growth. This relationship is evident in Sierra Leone’s experience with high and volatile inflation rates. Gulde et al. (2006) provide evidence that inadequate property rights and poor judicial performance can stifle banking sector development, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings are directly applicable to Sierra Leone’s challenges with weak rule of law and institutional quality. Rajan and Zingales (1998: pp. 559-586) and Baltagi et al. (2009: pp. 285-296) suggest that trade and financial openness are crucial to banking sector development. This perspective is relevant when considering Sierra Leone’s efforts to integrate into regional and global financial systems. Ang and Kumar (2013: pp. 43-56) emphasize the role of cross-border barriers to financial innovation in explaining differences in financial sector development across countries. Their study highlights the significance of these barriers in the context of financial innovation and development. This can help explain Sierra Leone’s challenges in adopting and benefiting from global financial innovations. Overall, these theoretical frameworks provide a comprehensive basis for analyzing the challenges and opportunities in Sierra Leone’s financial sector development. They highlight the complex interplay between institutional factors, macroeconomic conditions, and financial sector performance, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations. 3. Data and Methodology This study relies on secondary data sources. The table in Appendix 1 provides a comprehensive list of the variables used, including their definitions and sources. Given the multifaceted nature of financial development, which encompasses various dimensions such as depth, access, and efficiency, accurately measuring it can be challenging. To address this, the study employs the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Financial Development Index as the primary indicator of financial development. This index offers a robust and comprehensive measure that captures key elements of financial sector performance across different dimensions. In addition to the Financial Development Index, several other variables are examined to identify the key obstacles to financial sector development in Sierra Leone. The inflation rate is used to gauge macroeconomic stability, serving as a proxy for the broader economic environment. Institutional strength is captured through variables such as political stability, the rule of law, and key indicators from the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report. These proxies are crucial for understanding how institutional weaknesses may undermine financial sector development. Furthermore, financial literacy is included in the analysis to assess the extent to which a lack of public knowledge and engagement with financial services may act as a constraint on the growth of the financial sector. Data on the size of the informal sector was taken from the World Bank’s informal economy database. By examining these variables in conjunction with the Financial Development Index, the study aims to provide a holistic view of the barriers and scope for financial development in Sierra Leone. 4. Financial Sector Evolution Sierra Leone’s financial sector underwent significant reforms in the late 1990s following a systemic banking crisis. Key factors that contributed to the crisis include political interference, fiscal indiscipline, institutional weaknesses, poor supervision, judicial inadequacies, and macroeconomic instability ( Gilpin, 1998: pp. 144-155 ). Prior to these reforms, the financial sector operated under direct controls, such as interest rate ceilings and credit allocation policies, which are typical of rudimentary financial systems. These controls severely constrained bank balance sheets and hindered financial sector efficiency. During the 1980s, economic growth averaged only 0.6 percent, while inflation was recorded at an average of 60.8 percent. This combination of stagnant growth and high inflation eroded business activities and led to a significant increase in loan defaults. Compounding the problem was a weak legal system that failed to support banks in recovering non-performing loans (NPLs). By 1990, at the height of the systemic crisis, NPLs had ballooned to 45 percent of gross loans. In response to these challenges, a series of financial sector reforms were introduced, including the liberalization of interest and exchange rates, removal of direct credit controls, adoption of an indirect monetary policy framework, and strengthening of institutions and relevant legislation. However, the onset and intensification of the civil war in 1991 severely hampered the implementation of these reforms, leading to further deterioration of the financial sector. Post-conflict, with the assistance of development partners such as the World Bank and the IMF, the government made attempts to rehabilitate the financial sector. Some progress has been made, but the sector remains shallow and inefficient. As of 2021, the total assets of commercial banks, which dominate the financial system, accounted for only about 21.8 percent of GDP. The inefficiency of financial intermediation is evident in the large spread between lending and deposit rates, which stood at 13.9 percent in 2022 ( Bank of Sierra Leone, 2022 ). Furthermore, commercial banks primarily manage their liquidity through direct interaction with the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL), leading to a limited interbank market. Secondary markets for government securities and long-term capital markets are virtually non-existent, and money market activities are minimal. Despite ongoing reform efforts, Sierra Leone continues to lag behind in financial sector development. According to the IMF Financial Development Index in 2021, the country’s financial sector remains significantly underdeveloped compared to the African average. Figure 1 illustrates the financial development index for Sierra Leone relative to Liberia and Rwanda—two other countries with a history of conflict—as well as the average for Africa.

Challenges and Opportunities for Financial Sector Development in Sierra Leone As outlined in the introduction, various studies have identified factors impeding financial sector development across different contexts, which can broadly be categorized into two main areas: poor macroeconomic fundamentals and weak institutional quality. For example, Boyd et al. (2001: pp. 137-181) found a strong negative association between inflation and financial sector development, citing that inflation increases economic uncertainty and information asymmetry, thereby obstructing financial sector growth. Regarding institutional weaknesses, Gulde et al. (2006) suggested that inadequate property rights are major barriers to banking sector development in Sub-Saharan Africa, while Mlachila et al. (2013) provide evidence that poor judicial performance stifles improvements in banking systems. 5.1. Challenges The challenges hindering financial sector development in Sierra Leone are discussed below, using cross-country data to analyze the link between barriers and the growth of the sector in the country. Figure 2 shows the relationship between inflation and financial development in Sierra Leone from 1980 to 2021. Sierra Leone has experienced persistently high and volatile inflation, especially after hosting the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1980. The scatter plot demonstrates a negative correlation, with a coefficient of 61 percent, indicating that inflation has likely been a significant impediment to financial sector growth. Weak macroeconomic fundamentals, exemplified by unstable inflation rates, appear to be a major challenge to the growth of the country’s financial sector. Source: The inflation data is from the BSL database. The financial development index data is from the IMF Financial Development Index database. Figure 2 . Inflation vs. financial sector development in Sierra Leone 1980-2021. In addition, political stability is a critical prerequisite for capital market development and long-term investments. Although Sierra Leone has made significant progress since the end of the civil war in 2001 and the Ebola crisis of 2014-2015, the country remains politically fragile. Social tensions between supporters of the two main political parties continue to present risks, further exacerbated by the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As seen in Figure 3 , countries with lower levels of political stability generally exhibit less developed financial sectors. This suggests that political instability in Sierra Leone may be contributing to the slow pace of financial sector development. The full sample of countries used in Figure 3 is given in Appendix 2 . Source: World Governance Indicators (WGI), World Bank, and the IMF Financial Development Index database; Note: SLE represents Sierra Leone. Figure 3 . Political stability (−2.5 = weak; 2.5 = strong) and financial development, 2021. The rule of law is fundamental to establishing contracts and ensuring the effectiveness of financial services provision. Figure 4 shows that countries with weak enforcement of the rule of law, such as Sierra Leone, also tend to have underdeveloped financial systems. This indicates that the poor enforcement of legal and contractual obligations in Sierra Leone may be another significant factor hindering financial sector development. The full sample of countries used in Figure 4 is given in Appendix 3 . Data Source: World Governance Indicators (WGI), World Bank, and the IMF Financial Development Index database. Figure 4 . The rule of law (−2.5 = weak; 2.5 = strong) and financial development 2021. The ease with which businesses can operate plays an essential role in financial sector development. In countries with efficient processes for registering properties, enforcing contracts, and paying taxes, financial systems tend to be more developed. Conversely, in settings where these processes are cumbersome, financial development lags. Sierra Leone faces challenges in this regard, as the country’s low ranking (163 out of 190) in ease of doing business indicators poses an obstacle to financial sector advancement ( World Bank, 2020 ). Financial literacy is a crucial factor in the growth of financial systems, as individuals who do not understand financial products and services are less likely to engage with the financial sector. Figure 5 illustrates that countries with higher financial literacy levels also exhibit more developed financial sectors. Despite the Bank of Sierra Leone’s (BSL) efforts to improve financial literacy, the level remains relatively low, limiting the broader population’s ability to participate in and benefit from financial services. The full sample of countries used in Figure 5 is given in Appendix 4 .

Financial literacy (0 = weak and 100 = strong) and financial development 2021. Cross-country analysis shows that countries with smaller informal sectors tend to have more developed financial systems, as a larger portion of the population and businesses engage with formal financial institutions. Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between informal economic activity and financial sector development in selected economies across the world. An inverse relationship emerged when the data was plotted, suggesting that large informality in an economy is associated with low financial development. Hence, the dominance of the informal economy in Sierra Leone may be limiting the growth of the formal financial sector. The full sample of countries used in Figure 6 is given in Appendix 5 .

Opportunities Despite these significant challenges, Sierra Leone has several opportunities to improve its financial sector. The advent of mobile banking and fintech solutions presents a key opportunity to expand financial services in Sierra Leone, particularly in underserved rural areas. The rapid penetration of mobile phones and internet services in the country could enable greater financial inclusion and reduce reliance on traditional banking infrastructure. Strengthening partnerships between the public and private sectors can help address infrastructure deficits, especially in the areas of digital payments and financial literacy programs. Continued collaborations with international development partners such as the World Bank and IMF could accelerate the implementation of innovative financial solutions. Also, expanding microfinance institutions (MFIs) could increase access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are essential drivers of economic growth. Enhancing the regulatory environment for MFIs could help unlock this potential and spur entrepreneurship. Although Sierra Leone’s capital market remains underdeveloped, efforts to revitalize the Sierra Leone Stock Exchange could create opportunities for long-term financing, especially for infrastructure projects. The government could focus on policies that encourage domestic companies to list on the exchange, providing them with new financing avenues. In addition, participation in the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) provides an opportunity for Sierra Leone to deepen financial cooperation with other member countries. Regional integration could facilitate cross-border banking and investment flows, helping to stabilize the financial system and boost overall sector performance. Moreover, continued reforms aimed at strengthening institutional frameworks, improving governance, and enhancing the rule of law will be critical to creating a conducive environment for financial sector growth. Reforms could also focus on improving the legal framework for creditor rights and contract enforcement to attract foreign investment. 6. Conclusion Sierra Leone’s financial system remains weak and underdeveloped, with several critical factors contributing to its slow growth. This study has identified some of the most important barriers, including political instability, weak rule of law, a challenging business environment, low financial literacy, high informal activities, and high inflation, which undermines macroeconomic stability. The country has faced significant external shocks, such as the civil war, the Ebola crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which have compounded the financial sector’s fragility. While some efforts have been made to address these issues—such as financial literacy programs initiated by the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)—more comprehensive and sustained interventions are needed. It is clear that the simultaneous resolution of all challenges may not be feasible, so a prioritization approach is essential. The government, in collaboration with international partners like the World Bank, IMF, and African Development Bank, should focus on stabilizing the macroeconomic environment and strengthening institutional frameworks, particularly the rule of law and property rights. Furthermore, financial sector reforms that have been implemented over the years must be carefully evaluated to determine their effectiveness. Measures that have not yielded the expected outcomes should be revised or replaced with new strategies. The establishment of a capital market, for instance, requires significant attention, but it can only thrive in an environment of economic stability and institutional integrity. Ultimately, a holistic approach that prioritizes stability, governance, and financial education is vital for the financial system’s long-term development in Sierra Leone.

However, there are many potentially novelapplications where AI has the ability to replace roles traditionally performed byhumans.Governments and regulators are concerned with mitigating risks associatedwith AI—for example, ensuring that the use of AI by businesses is safe andtransparent with proper systems and controls. However, approaches indi erent countries have di ered drastically. While the EU has the mostcomprehensive AI-speci c legislative measure in the AI Act with detailedregulatory requirements in particular for high-risk AI systems, the U.S. and U.K.have thus far adopted more of a common law approach of addressing risks asthey arise or become apparent, predominantly using tools under existingtechnology-neutral legislation to issue policy pronouncements, supervise  rmsusing AI and manage any issues.This is the  rst in a series of three publications, in which we will compare thecurrent approaches for regulating AI in the  nancial sector in the United States,the European Union and the United Kingdom.

In some countries there is broad AI-speci clegislation, such as the EU.’s new AI Act, which applies alongside a wide rangeof existing laws, such as on intellectual property, data protection and privacy, nancial services, antitrust, cybersecurity, consumer protection and others mayapply. However, in most countries, there is no AI-speci c legislation and AI-related matters are governed only by these existing laws. Countries around theworld are currently considering if any of these existing laws require changes toaddress the novel questions and challenges raised by AI. Many jurisdictionshave developed general principles for regulating AI, and these enshrine similarrights such as transparency, fairness and human oversight.Some countries have also signed the AI Convention, namely, Andorra, Georgia,Iceland, Israel, Norway, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, the UnitedKingdom, the United States of America and the European Commission. The AIConvention, which is the  rst legally binding international agreement on AI, willenter into force once there are  ve rati cations. It sets fundamental principlesfor activities within the lifecycle of AI systems, prescribes remedies, proceduralrights and safeguards and requires risk and impact management. Many of theprinciples align with those in the EU’s AI Act, such as transparency, oversight,accountability, data privacy, reliability and safe innovation. The AI Conventionapples to both public authorities and public actors. In its application to theprivate sector, parties to the AI Convention may opt for it to apply directly orimplement their own measures. U.S. In the United States, there are currently no comprehensive AI-speci c laws atthe federal level, though there have been more limited laws passed in thisspace, including laws to coordinate the U.S. government’s use of AI and state AIlaws. As a result, and consistent with the  nancial regulatory approach in theU.S., there are e orts at the federal and state levels to both apply and enforceexisting laws and regulations to AI and to develop new rules where there aregaps in the existing regulatory landscape. U.S. agencies have already begunenforcement e orts, including related to so-called “AI washing” and AI10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asses…8/24disgorgement for improperly collected data, and indicated an increasedenforcement focus on AI and other emerging technologies. We discussenforcement and  nes in the third part of this series. The federal and state governments are focused on mitigating risks arising fromboth the public and private sector’s use of AI, including those related to privacy,fair use and ensuring appropriate disclosures to the public. In addition,re ective of geopolitical pressures, a core emphasis is national security andensuring that AI technology is not weaponized against the U.S. in either amilitary or commercial sense—both as regards outbound investment andexports through restrictions on sensitive technologies, including AI, and in-bound investment from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Wediscuss the latest developments in our August note, “Sanctions and exportcontrols expand further.” A plethora of bills have been introduced in various Congressional committeeswith bi-partisan support, and the House and Senate have set up bipartisan taskforces, working groups, and congressional hearings to better understand AIpolicy priorities and further coordinate legislative e orts.Most recently, on May 15, 2024, a bipartisan Senate working group issued areport entitled Roadmap for Arti cial Intelligence Policy (the “Roadmap”), whichaddressed eight key policy areas: (1) supporting U.S. innovation in AI; (2) AI andthe workforce; (3) high impact uses of AI; (4) elections and democracy; (5)privacy and liability; (6) transparency and explainability; (7) intellectual propertyand copyright; and (8) safeguarding against AI risks.Notably for the  nancial services sector, the Roadmap calls for the creation of acomprehensive federal data privacy framework related to AI that can beapplied across multiple sectors. The Roadmap speci es that this data privacyframework should include provisions addressing data minimization, datasecurity, consumer data rights, consent and disclosure, and data brokers. TheRoadmap encourages relevant Senate committees to develop legislation thatensures  nancial service providers are using accurate and representative datain their AI models. The Roadmap also supports a regulatory gap analysis in the10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asses…9/24 nancial sector—which was also proposed by the bipartisan Arti cialIntelligence Advancement Act introduced in the Senate in October 2023. In the absence of comprehensive Congressional action on AI, the BidenAdministration has sought to take the lead by issuing a broad-rangingExecutive Order on AI in October 2023—Executive Order 14110, entitled “Safe,Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Arti cial Intelligence.”Executive Order 14110 directs over 50 federal entities to engage in more than100 speci c actions to implement the guidance set forth across eightoverarching policy areas: (1) safety and security; (2) innovation and competition;(3) worker support; (4) AI bias and civil rights; (5) consumer protection; (6)privacy; (7) federal government’s usage of AI; and (8) international leadership.Executive Order 14110 highlights areas of focus for the enforcement of existingregulations and directs agencies to conduct studies, publish reports anddevelop guidance around AI. See A&O Shearman on Tech, “BidenAdministration Issues Broad Executive Order to Regulate and AdvanceArti cial Intelligence.”Under the direction of Executive Order 14110, the U.S. Department of theTreasury issued a public report on best practices for  nancial institutions tomanage AI-speci c cybersecurity risks (the “Treasury Report”). The TreasuryReport is a digest of AI use cases, threat and risk trends, governance andcybersecurity best practice recommendations, and challenges andopportunities for  nancial institutions, incorporating 42 in-depth interviews withvarious industry stakeholders. The Treasury Report outlines the currentregulatory landscape applicable to the use of AI in cybersecurity and fraudmanagement by  nancial services  rms. These regulatory expectations, in turn,closely track best practices shared by participating  nancial institutions formitigating AI-related cyber and fraud risks. These best practices includeincorporating AI risk management within existing enterprise risk managementprograms; mapping data supply chains; proper due diligence of vendors;maintaining high levels of cybersecurity, especially around data; and having theright risk tolerance for both the speci c use case and the overall risk appetite ofthe  rm. 10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asse…10/24Other U.S. federal agencies have also begun to interpret and provide guidanceon how existing laws and regulations apply to AI and consider new rules for AIwithin their respective jurisdiction. Such agency e orts to address AI may beforestalled in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2024 decision in LoperBright Enterprises v. Raimondo to overturn a long-standing doctrine thatinstructed courts to defer to reasonable interpretations made by administrativeagencies. It is likely that any agency rulemaking on AI will be closely scrutinizedboth by the public and by courts. These agency e orts include: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler, the Chair of the SEC, made public statements concerningthe use and potential risks of AI technologies in the securities industry, andspeci cally identi ed four key areas of concern: (i) the potential forcon icts of interest; (ii) the potential for fraud and deception; (iii) the impacton privacy and intellectual property issues; and (iv) the impact on  nancialstability. This speech was soon followed by the SEC’s new proposedrulemaking on “predictive data analytics” that would among other things,require broker-dealers and investment advisers to eliminate or neutralizethe e ect of certain con icts of interest associated with their use of AI andother technologies. It seems unlikely to be  nalized in the near future, asthe SEC has announced that it is likely to re-propose the rule. The SEC has also proposed rules addressing outsourcing of certaincovered functions by investment advisers and cybersecurity riskmanagement rules for investment advisers and broker-dealers. Forexample, in May 2024, the SEC  nalized amendments to Regulation S-P,which governs how certain  nancial institutions treat consumers’ non-public personal information. The amendments were intended to helpprotect investors’ privacy from the “expanded use of technology andcorresponding risks.” In the absence of  nal AI-speci c rules, the SEC’s e orts indicate that it isconsidering using existing regulatory provisions to address risks the SECperceives with respect to AI.

Furthermore, under SEC rulessuch as Regulation S-P and Regulation S-ID, broker-dealers, investmentadvisers and investment companies must take certain steps to safeguardcustomer information and appropriately respond to red  ags related topossible identity theft.Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) The CFTC issued a request for public comment on a wide range of AI-related questions in January 2024. In May 2024, the CFTC’s TechnicalAdvisory Committee recommended that the CFTC develop an AI RiskManagement Framework governing the use of AI in  nancial markets. Indeveloping the framework, the committee said the CFTC should holdpublic roundtables, conduct a “gap analysis” of existing regulations, andgenerally aim to align with other  nancial regulators and the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology. The committee highlighted usecases and related risks for AI concerning trading and investment;customer communications, advice and service; risk management;regulatory compliance; and back o ce and operations.In accompanying statements, Commissioners Kristin Johnson andCaroline Pham emphasized identifying existing CFTC regulations that mayaddress AI-related risks, for example by looking at the existing approach torisks and controls in algorithmic trading. The CFTC has not proposed anyAI-speci c rulemaking. In June 2023, the CFTC formed the new Cybersecurity and EmergingTechnologies Task Force within the CFTC Division of Enforcement, whichwill address “cybersecurity issues and other concerns related to emergingtechnologies (including arti cial intelligence).”Banking Regulators On June 6, 2023, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation and O ce of the Comptroller of the Currency released  nalInteragency Guidance on banking organizations’ management of risks10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asse…12/24associated with third-party relationships which, while not speci c to AI, ishighly relevant, and is discussed further in part two of this series. Thefederal banking regulators have not otherwise released any guidance orrulemaking speci c to AI. However, general principles of safety andsoundness apply to any use of AI.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) The CFPB has produced guidance, reports, and proposed rules related tothe use of AI in certain contexts, mostly related to consumer credit. Forexample, it has issued guidance noting that creditors that use AI orcomplex algorithms in aspects of the credit decisioning must still provide anotice to consumers that discloses the speci c reasons for taking adverseaction, and that creditors must be able to explain the speci c reasons fortheir credit decisions, including when using AI. The CFPB has alsopublished a report highlighting the potential issues and consumer harmarising from the use of AI chatbots. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Where companies do not collect personal data in accordance with the law,and they use illegally-collected personal data to train AI, the FTC has insome cases required not just the deletion of the ill-gotten data but also thedestruction of the AI that was trained using this data. This penalty hasbeen imposed in six cases to date. The FTC has not issued guidanceregarding when it may impose this disgorgement remedy.Additionally, numerous individual states have passed or are considering stand-alone AI laws as well as comprehensive privacy laws which apply to automatedprocessing via AI. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures,at least 45 states and Washington D.C. introduced AI bills this year, and over 30states have adopted resolutions or enacted legislation pertaining to AI. Statestand-alone AI laws (such as in Colorado or Utah) include regulations ongenerative AI decisioning (without meaningful human oversight in decision-making), in critical areas such as provision of health care services, provision ofinsurance, education admissions, employment decisions, and provision of10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asse…13/24loans and other  nancial services. Notably, California is considering an AIregulation bill, which—if signed into law—would require powerful AI models toundergo safety testing prior to being released to the public and wouldauthorize the state’s attorney general to hold developers liable for seriousharms caused by their AI models. We discuss California’s draft Safe and SecureInnovation for Frontier Arti cial Intelligence Models Act in “Zooming in on AI –#3: California SB 1047 – The potential new frontier of more stringent AIregulation?”. Furthermore, many states now have some type of data protection law orprivacy law. Comprehensive state privacy laws regulate automated processingand require notice and, in certain cases, consent. If sensitive information isprocessed by AI or if sensitive information is used to train AI, some statesrequire data privacy impact assessments prior to commencing use of the AItool. Given the current ad hoc approach of addressing AI risks as they arise, theevolving landscape may make compliance for  rms with U.S. operations or aU.S. nexus particularly challenging, and  rms should closely monitordevelopments in this area and take into consideration the recommendations inthe Action Plan laid out below. EU The EU has been the  rst to develop AI-speci c legislation, with the AI Actsetting legal requirements speci cally for AI systems, focusing on high-risk AIsystems. The AI Act is the most comprehensive attempt at regulating thetechnology undertaken by any legislature globally. The AI Act de nes four mainplayers in the AI sector—deployers, providers, importers and distributors. Asingle entity in this sector might fall within several of these categories. The AIAct also de nes di erent types of AI systems according to the level of riskinvolved in the use of those systems. How practical this approach is remains tobe seen.

We setout more details on when various aspects of the AI Act will apply in, “Zooming inon AI: When will the AI Act apply?”In the meantime, the European Commission has launched the AI Pact, whichencourages industry to voluntarily start implementing the requirements of theAI Act before they are legally applicable. The Commission has conducted atargeted consultation on the use of AI in the  nancial services sector.The approach of the AI Act to mitigating AI risks is discussed in, “Seizing the AIopportunity in Europe” and “EU AI Act: Key changes in the recently leaked text.” U.K. The U.K. has not yet adopted any AI-speci c legislation. However, that maychange under the new Labour government whose manifesto committed tointroducing binding requirements on developers of the most powerful AImodels (equivalent to what the EU AI Act de nes as highly capable GPAI). Thiswas reiterated in the post-election King’s Speech, which sets the legislativeagenda for the next 12 months. In the meantime, the U.K. continues to rely onexisting laws, which are generally technology-neutral, and regulatorypronouncements or guidance in some sectors. Matters are largely left tosector-based regulators, who must interpret and apply to their sectors thegovernment’s AI principles. Regulators are encouraged to be transparent aboutthe actions that they are taking. The previous government’s strategy, set out in “A pro-innovation approach to AIregulation,” was presented as a “context-based” approach that focused onwhere and how AI is used. The approach is founded on common law principlesof only imposing legal and regulatory obligations where necessary to addressidenti able risks. It was also based on the  ve principles (set out in the above10/17/24, 12:01 PMZooming in on AI - #5: AI under financial regulations in the U.S., EU and U.K. – a comparative assessment of the current state of …https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/ao-shearman-on-tech/zooming-in-5-ai-under-financial-regulations-in-the-us-eu-and-uk-a-comparative-asse…15/24summary table), with a preferred approach of initially not putting those intostatute. Certain regulators were requested to update their strategic approachto AI, including the  nancial services regulators. Regulators are alsoencouraged to develop their policy approach as needed, to issue guidelinesand to use technical standards to assist AI developers and deployers toimplement the principles. There is no indication that policy will change on thesematters with the change of government. The previous government had alsoestablished an AI Safety Institute to carry out research on AI safety anddevelop and conduct evaluations on advanced AI systems. The House of Lordshas indicated that it wishes the AI Safety Institute to be put on a statutoryfooting, although no bill has been proposed for this. The  nancial services regulators’ approach to regulating AI used or intended tobe used in the  nancial services sector is technology-agnostic, principles-based and outcomes-focused. Before the change in government, the U.K. nancial services regulators described how the previous government’s AIprinciples  t with their rules, high-level principles and expectations, and howthose apply to regulated  rms using AI. These include:Safety, security and robustness The Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) Principles for Business apply.For example,  rms must conduct their business with due skill, care anddiligence (Principle 2) and take reasonable care to organise and controltheir a airs responsibly, e ectively and with adequate risk managementsystems (Principle 3). Some of the Threshold Conditions apply – these arethe minimum conditions a licenced  rm must satisfy to obtain and maintainits licenced status. For example, a  rm’s business model must be suitable,compatible with the  rm’s a airs being conducted in a sound and prudentmanner and consider the interests of consumers and the integrity of U.K. nancial system.

Action PlanA signi cant concern for companies adopting AI systems is how to controlagainst unwanted outcomes, since the AI has the potential to operateunexpectedly in future or unknown factual situations. Linked to that is thequestion of where responsibility lies for AI and the actions required byregistered individuals in senior management positions and legal entities.Companies can take steps to promote appropriate use of AI, including thefollowing measures, which are broadly consistent with regulatory guidance andthe EU.’s AI Act.

Prepare and socialise internally an AI policy, that embeds the core principles of fairnessand transparency with concepts of human oversight, explainability, security and safety. AnAI policy should be modular with multiple layers to ensure accessibility and usefulnessacross the wide range of audiences. . Develop an AI framework and governance structure that sets out clearly roles andresponsibilities across the lifecycle of each AI system.

Undertake a mapping exercise of the AI systems in use and intended to be used (i.e., an AIinventory), and where it will be used and or placed, including third-party systems. Assessthe potential risks involved for each AI system, including the level of risk, and map thoseagainst the relevant regulatory and legal requirements. This will include determining the rm’s role, taking into account a jurisdiction’s de nitions and requirements. Document howeach risk from an AI system will be controlled and mitigated. U.K.-incorporated banks,building societies and PRA-regulated investment  rms approved to use an internal modelfor calculating their regulatory capital requirements must satisfy the Prudential RegulationAuthority’s (PRA’s) Model Risk Management (MRM) Principles. The PRA is clear that theMRM Principles, which came into e ect in May 2024, apply to AI models, including therequirement to provide a comprehensive model inventory. All U.S. companies, includingthose operating in the  nancial services sector, should consider enhancements to theircompliance program to address the risks associated with the risks of AI. . Adopt and implement measures to manage the risks. It may be helpful to do so thematicallyin the following three risk management pillars.Use Case +Clearly de ne the use case because it will drive the risks. For example, a system that isinvolved in pricing brings additional risks relating to price collusion that will not be relevantin other use cases, whereas a customer-facing chatbot that directly interacts withcustomers about  nancial products raises privacy and ethical issues that will not berelevant to, say, using AI to generate software. Assess whether using AI will result in a betteroutcome than the existing solution, taking into account relevant factors such as e ciency,cost, accuracy and security.OperationalImplement operational steps to align and integrate AI into a business. This includessecurity measures (e.g. BYOK/encryption), con guration of the model and user pro les,and privacy enhancing technologies. The interdependencies between legal, operationaland security stakeholders is greater than in non-AI based technology deployment.ContractualContract terms help to mitigate legal risk, both in the contract between the organisationdeploying an AI model and the model provider, as well as in contracts between anorganisation and its customers. In negotiations with foundation model providers, there arelikely to be red lines for each organisation, such as risk allocation or customer data/tradesecrets not being exposed or used to train the models for others. . This note generally assumes that you are deploying AI in your business, but not developingmodels. Where businesses develop (e.g. training or customising, via  ne-tuning or retrievalaugmented generated (or RAG)) the risks change—and, in most cases, increase. . Assess how AI is used by third-party service providers, and the impact of its use on therecipient’s business and clients.

The Governor was speaking at the 90th High-Level Conference organized by the Reserve Bank of India in New Delhi. He noted that the increasing use of AI might allow a few technology providers to dominate the market, which could pose systemic risks. ""The heavy reliance on AI can lead to concentration risks, especially when a small number of tech providers dominate the market,"" said Governor Das. The Governor also pointed out that AI introduces new vulnerabilities, including increased susceptibility to cyberattacks and data breaches. The opacity of AI systems further complicates matters, making it difficult to audit or interpret the algorithms driving financial decisions. ""Additionally, AI 's opacity makes it difficult to audit or interpret the algorithms which drive decisions. This could amplify systemic risks, as failures or disruptions in these systems may cascade across the entire financial sector"" Das added. Governor Das emphasized the importance of banks and financial institutions implementing strong risk mitigation strategies to address these risks. He noted that while AI and Big Tech offer significant advantages, financial institutions must ensure they do not become overly dependent on these technologies. ""In the ultimate analysis, banks have to ride on the advantages of AI and Big Tech and not allow the latter to ride on them,"" Das warned. He urged financial institutions to remain vigilant, highlighting the need for a balanced approach in leveraging AI 's potential while addressing its inherent risks. The Governor 's remarks come at a time when AI and machine learning are increasingly being integrated into financial services, enhancing efficiency but also raising concerns about cybersecurity, transparency, and regulatory oversight. With the rapid advancements in technology, the RBI is focused on ensuring that the financial sector remains resilient to both traditional risks and the emerging risks posed by AI and Big Tech. (ANI)"

""Fan Yifei accepted bribes of an extremely large amount, the circumstances of his crimes were extremely serious, the social impact was extremely bad, and the interests of the state and the people suffered extremely heavy losses,"" the court was quoted as saying. Fan, 60, is the highest-ranking official at the People's Bank of China to be arrested under President Xi Jinping's anti-graft drive in the past decade, in a campaign aimed at weeding out corrupt officials in the financial sector. Fan was placed under investigation by Chinese authorities in late 2022, and was expelled from the Communist Party in 2023. Reuters was not able to contact Fan for comment. China's anti-graft watchdog has in recent months launched a sweeping crackdown on the financial sector that has ensnared some of the country’s biggest names, including Liu Liange, former chairman of state-owned Bank of China, and Wang Bin, former head of state-owned China Life Insurance. In April, Liu, who stepped down in March 2023, pled guilty to accepting bribes totaling more than 121 million yuan, according to state media.

The bank has become a trailblazer in the digital banking revolution, providing a wide range of innovative solutions that have reshaped the financial experiences of Ghanaians, particularly in underserved and remote areas. UBA Ghana has taken bold steps to integrate technology into its core operations, focusing on mobile banking, internet banking, and strategic partnerships with fintech firms to deliver seamless banking services. These efforts have not only enhanced customer convenience but have also expanded access to financial services across the country. Pioneering Mobile and Internet Banking UBA Ghana has been at the forefront of mobile banking, recognizing the crucial role mobile technology plays in expanding financial inclusion. With the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile networks in even the most remote parts of Ghana, UBA seized the opportunity to launch UBA Mobile Banking. Through its user-friendly mobile app, the bank provides customers with an extensive range of services—from balance checks and money transfers to bill payments and airtime purchases—all at their fingertips. Customers no longer need to visit physical branches to conduct transactions, a game-changer in rural and remote areas where banking infrastructure is limited. The UBA Mobile App is designed to cater to both smartphone users and feature phone users, ensuring that a large segment of the population can access banking services regardless of the type of device they own. This innovation has proven particularly valuable in areas with minimal banking facilities, empowering people to participate in the financial ecosystem without the need for brick-and-mortar branches. In addition to mobile banking, UBA Ghana has introduced robust Internet banking services, which allow customers to manage their accounts online securely. Through UBA’s Internet banking platform, customers can perform transactions, make investments, and track their finances from the comfort of their homes or offices, further reducing the need to visit a bank in person. Fintech Partnerships and Financial Innovation UBA Ghana's focus on financial innovation has also seen the bank engage in strategic partnerships with fintech companies. These collaborations are designed to tap into the technological expertise of fintech firms to develop customized products and services for specific market segments. One such partnership is UBA’s integration with various mobile money services, making it easier for customers to transfer funds between their bank accounts and mobile wallets. In a country where mobile money has become a preferred method of transacting, this integration has made UBA a vital player in driving financial inclusion. Additionally, UBA Ghana has rolled out chat banking services, such as Leo, an AI-powered chatbot that enables customers to perform banking transactions through social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. This service has garnered attention for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly among tech-savvy customers who prefer the convenience of digital interaction. Leo allows users to transfer money, check balances, and even open new accounts—all via a simple chat, reducing barriers to accessing banking services. Reaching Remote Areas and Enhancing Financial Inclusion One of the most remarkable impacts of UBA Ghana’s digital banking efforts has been its ability to reach remote areas where traditional banking services are scarce. By leveraging mobile technology and internet-based solutions, UBA has successfully brought banking to people in rural communities who previously lacked access to financial services. This digital shift is helping to bridge the financial gap in Ghana, where a significant portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked. UBA's mobile and internet banking platforms allow customers in remote areas to receive remittances, pay for goods and services, and save money securely. This not only empowers individuals and households but also contributes to the broader goal of national economic development by facilitating commerce and entrepreneurship in underserved regions. Innovating for the Future As the digital banking landscape continues to evolve, UBA Ghana remains committed to staying ahead of the curve. The bank is continuously exploring new technologies, including blockchain and artificial intelligence, to enhance its service offerings and improve operational efficiency. These advancements, coupled with UBA’s dedication to customer-centric innovation, are positioning the bank as a leader in the future of banking in Ghana. Through its various initiatives, UBA Ghana has demonstrated how a forward-thinking approach to digital banking and financial innovation can transform the banking experience, foster financial inclusion, and drive economic growth. Whether through mobile banking, fintech partnerships, or internet banking, UBA is ensuring that all Ghanaians—regardless of location—have access to modern financial services that meet their needs. In a rapidly changing digital world, UBA Ghana’s role in promoting digital banking serves as a blueprint for the future of banking in Ghana and beyond.

Islamic Coin on X/Screenshot KEY POINTS Firoza Finance's pilot program will feature three investment pools holding a TVL of over $2 million Investors can pool their crypto assets and generate diverse returns with varying levels of risk The Mudarabah smart contract is a Shariah-compliant microfinancing solution backed by ethical blockchain On-chain microfinancing platform Firoza Finance, a joint venture between pioneering financial services and technology company Liberty Finance and EVM-equivalent ethical blockchain HAQQ Network , on Wednesday announced the launch of its pilot program that introduces ""the world's first real-world Mudarabah smart contract."" What is a Mudarabah Smart Contract? In Islamic traditional finance, a Mudarabah is a profit-sharing agreement between a business manager and a capital provider. With Dubai-based Firoza Finance , the decentralized finance (DeFi) world now has its first-ever Mudarabah smart contract that will allow consumers to invest with confidence across diverse risk profiles. Aside from delivering the world's first-ever Mudarabah smart contract, the platform empowers the global Muslim community by providing ethical, Shariah-compliant investment opportunities through its DeFi solutions, including private credit funds and customizable investments. Pilot Program for First Movers Firoza Finance has opened a join waitlist for investors who want to pool their crypto assets and generate a diverse range of returns with varying risk levels. The pilot program will feature three distinct investment pools, collectively holding a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $2 million. The pools are expected to deliver a significant Annual Percentage Yield (APY) while contributing revenue to Liberty Finance's Amana Vaults, which facilitate the delivery of Islamic lending services to traditional financiers, Islamic banks, and peer-to-peer lenders. A New Era of Shariah-Compliant Crypto Investments The collaboration between Liberty Finance and HAQQ Network marks a significant milestone in the Islamic Finance and DeFi spaces, as Firoza Finance addresses the inherent limitations within existing DeFi platforms. The Mudarabah smart contract offers a Shariah-compliant microfinancing solution that merges ethical finance principles with the many advanced benefits of blockchain technology. Aside from helping resolve the ethical dilemmas of DeFi offerings that often do not align with some consumers' religious and ethical beliefs, Firoza Finance also tackles some key issues within conventional financing, including high borrowing costs due to intermediaries and administrative overheads. ""We are excited to offer this unique investment opportunity through our collaboration with HAQQ Network and their esteemed Shariah scholars. The development and deployment of the Mudarabah smart contract represent a significant advancement in combining traditional Islamic financial principles with modern blockchain technology,"" Patric Devereaux, CFO at Liberty Finance, said in a press release shared with International Business Times . Capital Accessibility for Smaller Businesses Small business owners have had struggles with capital due to the various limitations in traditional finance. By eliminating the unnecessary intermediaries and automating processes through smart contracts, Firoza Finance significantly reduces borrowing costs, allowing smaller players and entrepreneurs around the world to have access to capital. Furthermore, by utilizing Liberty Finance's innovative technology engine and capitalizing on HAQQ Network's robust blockchain infrastructure , Firoza Finance has opened a door for transparent, secure transactions with reduced overhead costs.
