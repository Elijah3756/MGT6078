By Emily Kwong , Avery Keatley , Rebecca Ramirez , Megan Lim Published March 30, 2025 at 5:03 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 11:14 EMILY KWONG, HOST: Perhaps you have played around with artificial intelligence or have seen AI woven into your favorite apps. AI infrastructure is a big priority under the Trump administration, and tech companies are investing heavily. It's an exciting field, one that captured Sasha Luccioni. In 2018, she started a new job - AI researcher at Morgan Stanley. She was excited to learn something new in the field of AI but couldn't shake this worry. SASHA LUCCIONI: I, essentially, was getting more and more climate anxiety. I was really feeling this profound disconnect between my job and my values and the things that I cared about. And so, essentially, I was like, oh, I should quit my job and go plant trees. I should - you know, I should do something that's really making a difference in the world. And then my partner was like, well, you have a Ph.D. in AI. Maybe you can use that to make a difference in the world. KWONG: So Luccioni quit her job and joined a growing movement to make AI more sustainable. Since 2022, AI has boomed, and it's caused a surge in energy consumption. Tech companies are racing to build data centers to keep up - these huge buildings filled with hundreds of thousands of computers that require a lot of energy. By 2028, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecasts the data centers could consume as much as 12% of the nation's electricity. And AI is also leading a surge in water consumption. It's a concern echoed all over social media. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The amount of water that AI uses is astonishing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: AI needs water. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: A lot of people are saying that every time you use ChatGPT... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: ChatGPT uses this much water for 100-word emails. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: And where will that water come from? KWONG: And the four big data center operators with a growing water and carbon footprint are Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta. And to be clear, all four of those are among NPR's financial supporters and pay to distribute some of our content. BENJAMIN LEE: Before generative AI came along in late 2022, there was hope among these data center operators that they could go to net-zero. KWONG: Benjamin Lee studies computer architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. Generative AI refers to the AI that uses large language models. LEE: So I don't see how you can - under current infrastructure investment plans, you could possibly achieve those net-zero goals. KWONG: And data center construction is only going to increase. On January 21, the day after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a private joint venture to build 20 large data centers across the country, as heard here on NBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A new American company that will invest $500 billion at least in AI infrastructure in the United States and very quickly, moving very rapidly. KWONG: This new project, known as Stargate, would together consume 15 gigawatts of power. That would be like 15 new Philadelphia-sized cities consuming energy. So how is the industry thinking about its future and its environmental footprint? The four cloud giants - Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon - all have climate goals, goals for hitting net-zero carbon emissions - most by 2030, Amazon by 2040. And there's a few ways they can get there. Let's start with a very popular energy source for big tech, nuclear, because Amazon, Meta and Alphabet, which runs Google, just signed an agreement, along with other companies, that supports tripling the global nuclear supply by 2050. And along with Microsoft, these four companies have signed agreements to purchase nuclear energy, an industry that has been stagnant for years. Microsoft has committed to buying power from an old nuclear plant on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. You may remember that was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979, and NPR's Nina Totenberg talked to kids in the Harrisburg area right after. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) NINA TOTENBERG: You know what evacuation is? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: That everybody has to go. NINA TOTENBERG: Do you know why? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Because of radioactivity. KWONG: While some radioactive gas was released, thankfully it wasn't enough to cause serious health effects. And Microsoft now wants to build this nuclear site back. In a way, AI companies are turning into energy brokers. But my science desk colleague, Geoff Brumfiel, sees a discrepancy in this between the AI people and the nuclear energy people. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: These are just two super different engineering cultures, you know? And the way I've come to think about it is Silicon Valley loves to go fast and break things. The nuclear industry has to move very, very, very slowly because nothing can ever break. KWONG: Because of accidents like Three Mile Island, Geoff says that nothing in the nuclear industry ever happens quickly. It's also extremely expensive. And while solar and wind energy, combined with batteries, is quicker to build and more inexpensive than nuclear or gas-power plants, it still takes time to build, and there are problems hooking up new energy sources to the grid. So in the meantime, many data centers will continue to use fossil fuels. But there's another solution here, and that's to make data centers themselves more efficient through better hardware, better chips and more efficient cooling systems. One of the most innovative methods on the rise is liquid cooling - basically, running a synthetic fluid through the hottest parts of the server to take the heat away or immersing whole servers in a cool bath. It's the same idea as running coolant through your car engine and a much faster way to cool off a hot computer. Here's Benjamin Lee again, at UPenn. LEE: And as you can imagine, it's much more efficient because now you're just cooling the surface of whatever the cold plate is covering rather than just blowing air through the entire machine. KWONG: One of the biggest providers of liquid cooling is Iceotope. David Craig is their recently retired CEO and based in the U.K. DAVID CRAIG: I definitely come from the point of view that, you know, we literally have just one planet, and I cannot understand why anybody would want to do anything other than care for it. KWONG: Craig says that the older way of cooling data centers - basically, there's lots of methods, but it's a daisy chain of moving heat with air and water - is consumptive. With liquid cooling, a lot of the heat stays in the system, and computers don't have these massive swings in temperature. CRAIG: It's not got a constant thermal shock. It's got less vibration from fans and stuff like that, so things last longer. And then, what we're doing is we're capturing that heat in a closed water loop. KWONG: Liquid cooling, however, is expensive, which makes it hard to scale. But Iceotope has announced public partnerships with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, and a spokesperson at Meta told me they anticipate some of the company's liquid cooling-enabled data centers will be up and running by 2026. Throughout my many emails and seven hours of phone conversations with spokespersons at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, too, there was one innovation they were quiet about, and it's the one that scientists and engineers outside of big tech were most excited about. And that is smaller AI models, ones good enough to complete a lot of the tasks we care about but in a much less energy-intensive way. Basically, a third and final solution to AI's climate problem is using less AI. One major disruptor in this space is DeepSeek, the chatbot out of a company in China claiming to use less energy. We reached out to them for comment, but they did not reply. You see, large language models, like ChatGPT, are often trained using large datasets, say, by feeding the model over a million hours of YouTube content. But DeepSeek was trained by data from other language models. Benjamin Lee at UPenn says this is called a mixture of experts. LEE: The whole idea behind a mixture of expert is, you don't need a single, huge model with a trillion parameters to answer every possible question under the sun. But rather, you would like to have a collection of experts, smaller models, and then you just sort of route the request to the right expert. And because each expert is so much smaller, it's going to cost less energy to invoke. KWONG: Even though DeepSeek was trained more efficiently this way, other scientists I spoke to pointed out it's still a big model, and Sasha Luccioni at Hugging Face wants to walk away from those entirely. LUCCIONI: Since ChatGPT came out, people were like, oh, we want general purpose models. We want models that can do everything at once - answer questions and write recipes and poetry and whatever. But nowadays, more and more, I think companies especially are like, well, actually, for our intents and purposes, we want to do X, like - whatever - summarize PDFs. KWONG: What Sasha is talking about are small language models, which have far fewer parameters and are trained for a specific task. And some tech companies are experimenting with this. Last year, Meta announced a smaller quantized version of some of their models. Microsoft announced a family of small models called Phi-3. A spokesperson for Amazon said they're open to considering a number of models that can meet their customers' needs. And a spokesperson for Google said they did not have a comment about small language models at this time. So meanwhile, the race to build infrastructure for large language models is very much underway. Here's Kevin Miller, who runs global infrastructure at Amazon Web Services. KEVIN MILLER: I think you have to look at the world around us and say we're moving towards a more digital economy overall, and that is ultimately kind of the biggest driver for the need for data centers and cloud computing. KWONG: If that is the level of computing we're headed for, Luccioni has one last idea, an industry-wide score for AI models, just like Energy Star became a widely recognized program for ranking the energy efficiency of appliances. She says that tech companies, however, are far from embracing something similar. LUCCIONI: So we're having a lot of trouble getting buy-in from companies. There's, like, such a blanket ban on any kind of transparency because it could either, like, make you look bad, open you up for whatever legal action or just kind of give people a sneak peek behind the curtain. KWONG: So as a science reporter for NPR, my main question is - do we really need all of this computing power when we know it could imperil climate goals? And David Craig, the recently retired CEO of Iceotope, chuckled when I asked this. He said, Emily, you know, human nature is against us. CRAIG: We are always that kid who does touch the very hot ring on the cooker when our mum said don't, you know? We are always the people who touch the wet paint sign and stuff, right? That's human beings. And the truth is, with data, you know, this stuff has just grown up in the background. People just haven't known about it. KWONG: But here's something I think we can all think about. The AI revolution is still fairly new. Google CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI to the discovery of electricity. Except, unlike the people during the Industrial Revolution, we know AI has a big climate cost, and there's still time to adjust how and how much of it we use.

Advertisement The all-stock deal announced on Friday consolidates two of Musk’s multiple portfolio companies, which also include Tesla and SpaceX, and potentially eases the billionaire’s ability to train his AI model known as Grok. Including US$12 billion in debt, the deal is valued at US$45 billion. “The choice of US$45 billion is not a coincidence,” said D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Gil Luria. “It is US$1 billion higher than the take-private transaction for Twitter in 2022” and he can share the value of the xAI business with Twitter co-investors. Musk announced the transaction in a post on social media, saying that the combined entity would be valued at US$80 billion. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.” 01:18 Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Neither X nor xAI spokespersons immediately responded to a request for comment.

It is often said that one's daily habits have a profound effect on one's success in life, and rightly so. Our habits often shape us into the person we become in the long run. Similarly, successful billionaires like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others have distinct patterns in their habits that set them apart from others. While luck and opportunity play a role, their daily practices, decision-making approaches, and resilience have been key to their success. If you too, want to be successful like them, then here we share some of their common habits that you can follow: 2 / 6 Lifelong learning One of the most common habits among most billionaires is their eagerness to learn. Be it Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos-- they all are known to be voracious readers. Bill Gates reads roughly 50 books a year, while Warren Buffett spends 80% of his day reading. Elon Musk, who is largely self-taught in rocket science, also credits books for much of his knowledge. Reading has many benefits-- like expanding one's knowledge, thinking, creativity, and enhancing decision-making. 3 / 6 Taking calculated risks Successful billionaires don’t shy away from taking calculated risks in life. For example, Jeff Bezos took a huge risk when he left his stable job to start Amazon, but he assessed the market potential before taking a leap of faith. Similarly, Elon Musk is known for taking risks by implementing different work ethics at his companies. In the case of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, Musk took a risk of investing nearly all his money into the companies at a time when they were on the brink of failure. So, one can learn to step out of their comfort zone if they want extraordinary success in life. 4 / 6 Work ethics and discipline Success doesn’t come to any without relentless effort. And successful billionaires are known for their incredible work ethic. While Elon Musk is known to work around 80-100 hours a week to push his companies forward, Bill Gates, too, spent his years working tirelessly in Microsoft during its early days. While work-life balance is important, successful people often prioritise their goals above everything else, ensuring they outwork and outperform others. They are focused, hardworking, disciplined, and resilient-- qualities that make them stand apart from others. 5 / 6 Resilience and learning from mistakes For most people, achieving success is not a straight graph. Making mistakes and failure are inevitable parts of success; however, what matters most is how you bounce back and stay committed to your goal. Billionaires understand this better than anyone, and that's what makes them so successful. For instance, Steve Jobs was once fired from Apple, only to return stronger and revolutionise the tech industry. Elon Musk’s early SpaceX launches were failures, but with consistent efforts and improvisation, it achieved historic success. Successful billionaires don't let their failures define them. Instead, they learn from their mistakes and move on in life. 6 / 6 Thinking big Instead of focusing on short-term goals, successful billionaires make long-term plans and work on them. For example, Elon Musk envisions a future where humans colonise Mars, Jeff Bezos aims to expand beyond Earth with Blue Origin, and Bill Gates continues to tackle global health challenges through his philanthropic work. These billionaires know that long-term goals and patience are the keys to success. Follow Us On Social Media Photostories What happens if you cut sugar for two weeks?

Reddit took action after Musk messaged CEO Steve Huffman about users blocking X links and threatening DOGE staffers. by Alex Heath Mar 27, 2025, 3:12 PM UTC Link Share Elon Musk and Steve Huffman. Image: Getty Images / The Verge Alex Heath is a contributing writer and author of the Sources newsletter. Nearly two months ago, Elon Musk went on a public crusade against Reddit. On X, he said it was “insane” that subreddits were blocking links to the platform in protest of him appearing to give a Nazi salute. A few days later, he posted that Reddit users advocating for violence against Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees had “broken the law.” As it turns out, Musk wasn’t only using his X platform to call out content on Reddit. He was also privately messaging Reddit CEO Steve Huffman , according to people familiar with the matter. Shortly after the two CEOs exchanged text messages, Reddit enacted a 72-hour ban on the “WhitePeopleTwitter” subreddit that hosted the thread about DOGE employees, citing the “prevalence of violent content.” The specific thread Musk shared on X was also deleted, including hundreds of comments that didn’t call for violence or doxxing. (So far, Reddit doesn’t appear to have intervened in any moderator decisions to ban X links from the subreddits they oversee.) When asked about Musk and Huffman’s correspondence, Reddit spokesperson Gina Antonini sent the following statement: “We take any report of Reddit policy violations seriously, whether on Reddit directly or through other public or private means. We will evaluate content reported to us and take action if violating.” Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment. The news of Musk’s outreach to Huffman quickly made its way to some of Reddit’s moderators, who discussed it together on Discord. After one wrote, “Musk is coming for /r/Comics,” which was one of the subreddits that was banning links to X, another responded by calling him a “giant baby,” according to screenshots of the conversation that were shared with me. (Since he bought Twitter, Musk has blocked links to competitors multiple times , including as recently as last month .) “Elon called out death threats,” wrote another Reddit moderator. “He should not be able to influence Reddit, but if what he calls out is death threats then of course they need to come down.” Yet another responded: “Oh, I don’t have any problem with removing rule-breaking content (and taking the respective admin action on said accounts), but I find it a bit problematic that he’s able to exert influence on both public and private institutions.” Elsewhere AI’s Wild West era: ChatGPT’s upgraded image generation feels like an important milestone in the AI industry’s shift toward a more Wild West, hands-off style of moderation. OpenAI’s stance that public figures should opt out of having their likeness replicated — not to mention ChatGPT’s willingness to replicate specific brands — feels inherently problematic. It also gives other players cover to do the same. TikTok is losing Blake Chandlee , the ex-Facebook leader who essentially built its ads business from scratch, with the deadline for it to be saved from a US ban or not hitting next Saturday . Chandlee’s departure is notable, though I’m more interested in TikTok chief Shou Chew’s internal memo about his replacement. TikTok’s ad sales org, which Chandlee oversaw, will be merged with the revenue product org led by Will Liu , a seven-year ByteDance veteran. And according to Chew’s memo, Liu will now report to him with a “dotted line” to Lidong Zhang , the chair of the company’s business in mainland China. If I’m ByteDance, that’s a strange org chart change to make if you think you’re about to lose control of TikTok… More headlines: 23andMe filed for bankruptcy … More layoffs hit Block … Robinhood moved into banking… Google tried to upstage OpenAI with a Gemini update … Apple’s WWDC keynote will be on June 9th. Job board Some noteworthy job changes in the tech world: Another personnel change at TikTok, per Chew’s internal note: Khartoon Weiss is now overseeing the entire North American business. Jun Young-hyun is now the sole CEO of Samsung after Han Jong-hee tragically died of a heart attack. OpenAI promoted Mark Chen to chief research officer and Julia Villagra to chief people officer. COO Brad Lightcap will now “oversee OpenAI’s business and day-to-day operations,” which suggests that Sam Altman is focusing on some big-picture swings. X’s head of engineering and product, Haofei Wang , has left without explanation. Dan Neary , Meta’s head of Asia Pacific, is leaving the company after 12 years.

No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter ""A"". We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same. A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector. Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls. Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run. ""If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,"" says Prof Dimson. ""But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying."" Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares. Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits. As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: ""Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements."" But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on ""not jam today but jam tomorrow"". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future. So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse. Susannah Streeter Susannah Streeter says that tech stocks are always a gamble for investors On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends. That means as Prof Dimson puts it, ""that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value"", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time. ""You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,"" he says. ""This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared."" Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the ""magnificent seven"" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla. So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq? Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals. There is simply no guarantee that today's ""magnificent seven"" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms. Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors. Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek. This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals. The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing. Getty Images Tesla's share price has been hit by both protests against the brand, and increased competition from Chinese rivals AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right. Or as Prof Dimon puts it: ""At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough."" And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. ""AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on."" That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead. Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the ""booming"" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks. In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last. It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.

Answer: 40 percent. March 25, 2025 • News Staff Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Print Email The tech sector has been hit with more return-to-office mandates and other stringent requirements, such as asking employees to work longer hours. But nearly half of them are just not having it. According to data from Randstad, a recruitment company based in Amsterdam, 2 in 5 workers in the technology sector said they left their positions in the last year due to their employers’ working requirements. The survey queried more than 26,000 staff in 35 markets, 2,548 of whom worked in technology. Those who reported leaving over inflexible work policies cited return-to-office mandates, increased time requirements and increased “intensity of work” as reasons for leaving. Additionally, 56 percent said they threatened to seek alternatives if their company ignored or denied their requests for more flexibility. Nearly three-quarters of tech-sector respondents answered that they believe remote work increases a “sense of community” with colleagues. This is higher than the average of 58 percent who said the same in other sectors, suggesting remote work is valued highly among tech workers. And 68 percent of tech employees said they trust their employer more if they’re more easygoing on working hours, intensity of work and where employees work.

(Image: KnowBe4) Preliminary results from the Red Ribbon Insights Africa-wide Human Risk Management Survey have already highlighted very unexpected realities faced by cyber security decision-makers on the continent. Yet, the real take-away is how valuable targeted, industry-specific surveying is for identifying how trends differ across regions. Red Ribbon Insights, the newly launched surveying and market research division of Red Ribbon Communications, recently started gathering responses from top cyber security decision-makers in Africa to understand the unique human risk landscape they face. The Africa Human Risk Management Survey 2025 is sponsored by KnowBe4 Africa, the renowned cyber security platform that addresses comprehensive human risk management. The value of putting Africa first One of the most striking trends emerging from responses so far is how much faith CISOs and security awareness leads are placing in the tech professionals they employ, without hedging against potential issues. Senior cyber security managers across Africa have submitted survey responses that show something unexpected: the tech industry itself seems to be where the biggest disconnect between cyber security awareness and responsible practices lies. Respondents in the tech industry report the second lowest rate of having defined processes for employees to report security incidents within their organisations – a rate topped by seven out of eight other surveyed industries. However, these same tech industry respondents report that their employees have very high levels of awareness about their organisations’ cyber security policies and procedures. This may indicate a trend where tech employees have very high levels of awareness of cyber security policies, procedures and threats, but aren’t subjected to as much formal reporting or device management processes as in other industries. The importance of catering to uniqueness Africa’s tech industry is burgeoning, but key traits of the cyber security environment these organisations operate in remain unexplored due to many generalisations or unspecific focuses on the distinct factors at play in the unique space organisations operate in on the continent. It is only through inputs from targeted respondents in targeted industries that are in a targeted area or environment where actionable insights can be sourced that add new dynamics to conventional understandings. Red Ribbon Insights is the industry research division of Red Ribbon Communications . Red Ribbon Insights helps companies unlock exclusive, high-quality data they can use to fuel powerful PR and marketing campaigns .

Graduates of these courses can take up technical roles that offer flexibility, teamwork, and the chance to develop innovative ideas, services, and products,” she said. “Now is the time to nurture the next generation of female tech talent to ensure a more balanced pipeline of professionals. Achieving gender equality in technology is essential—not just for the industry, but for society as a whole,” added Ms Freeman-Gater. The event not only challenged perceptions about careers in technology but also showcased the diverse opportunities available in computing, physics, and engineering.

The industry has taken a severe downturn in recent years, specifically the past two years, wherein a quarter of all computer programming jobs have disappeared. There are currently fewer programmers in the United States today than at any point since 1980, reports The Washington Post . Videos by VICE What’s especially odd is that software developers, a cousin of computer programming , are doing just fine. Programming jobs have declined by 27.5 percent, at the same time software developer roles only dropped by 0.3 percent. People often use the two terms interchangeably though they are different fields. This begs the question: what meaningful differences are there between the two jobs that can account for the eradication of one and the relative stability of the other? AI Chatbots Are Taking Computer Programming Jobs AI chatbots. The decline in computer programming roles almost perfectly lines up with the rise of AI chatbots entering the American workforce. AI systems like ChatGPT can generate code with minimal input and can perform a lot of the routine tasks traditionally performed by programmers, and a fraction of the time and for significantly less money. Automation comes for us all, though The Washington Post’s Andrew Van Dam argues that more often than not AI is used to augment and supplement the human worker rather than fully replace them. Another factor that can be seen across careers throughout the tech industry regardless of the specific field is the broader economic factors affecting the entire tech industry. The tech job market has cooled quite a bit after the pandemic boom, and high interest rates have convinced executives that they need to cut jobs to maintain overhead. It doesn’t seem like AI is going to fully replace computer programming soon, and it may never, but computer programming was the kind of job people who needed a lucrative career shift could quickly learn how to get themselves moving in a new direction in life. And now AI is encroaching on that territory, slowly chipping away at a once reliable offramp.

Key sectors such as Technology and Industrials are making waves with contrasting movements. 📉 Technology Sector: The technology sector is dominated by a wave of red, indicating underperformance. Notably, Nvidia (NVDA) has plunged by 1.74%, reflecting ongoing struggles within the semiconductor space. 🚀 Industrials: In contrast, the industrial sector is showing robust performance, driven by defense stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT) , which has soared by 2.53%. This sector appears to be benefitting from increased government contracts and strategic defense acquisitions. 🏦 Financials: The financial sector displays mixed fortunes with major players such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slightly down by 0.20%. This signals caution among investors amidst lingering economic uncertainties. Market Mood and Trends The broader market sentiment is veering towards caution, primarily influenced by the tech sector's underperformance. Bearish trends in prominent semiconductor companies are contributing to uncertainties. However, the resilience in industrials, particularly in defense, is creating a buffer for the overall market. This behavioral divergence signifies an ongoing strategic shift among investors, who may be transitioning from high-risk tech stocks to more stable industrials and defensive plays, anticipating macroeconomic developments. Strategic Recommendations Given current trends, investors and traders at ForexLive might contemplate reassessing their portfolio allocations. Here are some actionable suggestions: Diversification: Consider expanding into sectors like Industrials and Healthcare , which show resilience amidst broader market volatility. Keeping an eye on defense stocks could prove beneficial. Watch for Catalysts: Stay alert for any positive news from the tech sector that could stimulate a rebound, especially in semiconductors. Upcoming earnings reports will be critical in gauging future trajectories. Risk Management: Be cautious with heavily tech-weighted portfolios unless there is a compelling reason to anticipate a sector recovery. Diversifying risk across sectors remains a prudent strategy. The current market environment highlights the importance of staying informed and agile. Regularly checking real-time data and continuing to visit ForexLive.com for comprehensive market analyses will aid in navigating these uncertain times effectively."

A pro-tech shift from Beijing is spurring confidence in markets. While economic challenges persist, sources say the government is correcting course. China looks investible again. The country's stocks are rallying, countering the notion that investors should avoid the world's second-biggest economy. Though many on Wall Street have been bearish on China since 2023, its stock market is suddenly looking good relative to flagging US peers. Just a year ago, investors fled China in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, and the exodus quickly back an ongoing problem for Beijing. Amid fear that China would buckle from deflation, unemployment, or its high debt environment, foreign direct investment last year hit its lowest level since 1992 . The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of mainland shares, dropped over 45% from a 2021 peak to the end of last year. But now, while US stock leaders have suffered big declines since mid-February, Chinese large-caps have achieved their best annual start since 2002 . While the S&P 500 is down almost 10% from its February all-time high, the CSI 300 has topped a mid-December high and is up about 5% year-to-date. The moves are causing analysts to start paying attention. Citi recently upgraded China stocks to ""Overweight,"" while dropping its view of US stocks to ""Neutral."" Meanwhile, Bank of America has said that the country will outperform this year , predicting that the previously ""unloved"" tech stocks will gain ground on sagging US peers . Pro-tech turnaround Before this year, many were skeptical about China's tech environment, which was weighed down by disapproval from Beijing officials. Since 2020, many of the nation's leading tech names have been caught in a regulatory ""crackdown ,"" making investors hesitant to put money to work. But the government's changing approach toward the industry has been on full display in the past month, starting with President Xi Jinping's supportive remarks at a top tech symposium in February. Pro-business undertones continued in this week's ""two sessions,"" a set of concurrent policy meetings that outline the country's economic goals. Ben Harburg, founder of Core Values Alpha, cited Beijing's recent embrace of its tech sector as one of several catalysts behind his firm's upside thesis. Eighteen months ago, his company created the CoreValues Alpha Greater China Growth ETF on the idea that investors have become too pessimistic about China's economy and its tech sector. Story Continues ""[Beijing] very clearly said: 'Our national growth will be driven by technology,'"" Harburg told Business Insider. ""So it is unequivocal now they will lean in on technology, they will be supportive of technology, will do everything in their power to stimulate, subsidize, de-regulate — whatever is necessary to help technology kind of win."" That's an alluring notion for stocks beaten down by an anti-tech narrative in recent years. As of late February, Chinese equities were trading at around a 50% discount compared to the US market. But the perceptions of China's negative view of the space might have been exagerrated, Harburg noted. ""I don't think the Chinese government was ever an anti-tech as we were led to believe,"" he said, adding: ""The world perceives it very differently, because [regulation] happens without any warning, and it and it kind of like just shocks people and throws them off."" The crackdown narrative has given Chinese equities room to run higher this year, as it's helped lower valuations which are now moving upward. But it also helped catch US investors by surprise. Starting with China's DeepSeek tool , a flurry of competitive Chinese AI tools have debuted this year, upending confidence in America's leadership in the space and sparking a reevaluation of Beijing's market, Harburg said. As the AI trade has waned in the US this year, China's AI-linked stocks have soared on the back of the latest announcements. ""Clearly, China is much further along than we were told,"" Harburg said. An economic turnaround? There are still challenges though, and, so far, Beijing's focus on tech is only a sentiment shift, said Tianlei Huang, a researcher for the Peterson Institute for International Economics. While positive signals were given, this remains a symbolic gesture without new policies. China's private sector—including tech— continues to face the same challenges that have pushed investors away since COVID, while confidence among entrepreneurs and consumers is at post-pandemic lows ""The reaction in the stock market to this [tech] symposium is, I think, actually a very sad thing,"" he said. ""Nothing in substance has really changed in terms of policy, regulations, right? It's just an attitude change."" Many of the broader issues that have plagued China's economy are still in play. That includes a highly indebted real-estate sector and downbeat consumers, creating a deflationary environment from which investors have fled since 2023. But Beijing might finally be waking up to this as well. Over the past year, many of its stimulus measures have fallen short as they failed to target domestic consumers , which analysts agree are the linchpin to growth. Yet, during the two sessions, there was a new-found emphasis on domestic demand and private consumption. By Friday, stocks rose as the government urged financial lenders to ease loan terms for consumer borrowers. The shift toward domestic growth comes as China realizes it cannot reach this year's 5% GDP target by depending on trade, Huang said. This was the case last year, as net exports accounted for 30% of GDP. It's not a sustainable number, and it's largely driven by product stockpiling from buyers worried about Washington's trade war. It remains to be seen whether the 5% target is realistic, Huang said, though the sentiment shift is significant and should shape future policy. But Harburg sees things in a much brighter light. Aside from the positive mood in tech, he noted that investor fears about China haven not been realized. There's been no major real-estate crash and improvements are beginning to show in first-tier cities. ""It doesn't happen for two years, three years, four years.

Courtesy Intel Intel on Wednesday announced tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive, boosting shares of the US computer chipmaker struggling to catch up in the AI race. Tan told the Intel team his focus would be on engineering, saying it ""won't be easy"" to overcome challenges faced by the company. Tan, who was born in Malaysia, will start as Intel chief on March 18, according to the company. Shares were up more than 10 percent in after market trade. Intel is one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been eclipsed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung, which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business. Live Events The company was also caught by surprise with the emergence of Nvidia, a graphics chip maker, as the world's preeminent AI chip provider. Nvidia's strength is in chips for powering AI, which are coveted by tech companies competing in that technology. Intel's niche has been in chips used in traditional computing processes being eclipsed by the AI rage. Tan's predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was forced out as Intel chief in December after the board lost confidence in his plans to turn the company around. Gelsinger's abrupt departure came just months after the company vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost reduction plan and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities. ""I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win,"" Tan said in a message to his team, vowing that Intel will be an engineering-focused company. ""In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog."" While chief of Cadence Design Systems from 2009 to 2021, Tan transformed the company and more than doubled its revenue, according to the Intel board. Former US president Joe Biden's administration last year finalized a $7.9 billion award to Intel as part of an effort to bring semiconductor production to US shores. But Intel in February extended the timeline for completing two new fabrication plants in Ohio, saying it is taking a prudent approach to the $28 billion project. ""We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants,"" Intel Foundry Manufacturing general manager Naga Chandrasekaran told Intel employees at the time. For the full year 2024, Intel recorded a net loss of $18.8 billion as the US chip giant continues to struggle to stake its place in the artificial intelligence revolution. In Europe, Intel late last year said it was delaying its plans to build two mega chip-making factories in Germany and Poland as the company faces lower demand than anticipated. Intel also said at the time that it would pull back on its projects in Malaysia. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Wed, 12 Mar, 2025 - 00:31 Elaine Loughlin       “My decision to be here in Texas this week is an intentional one,” Micheál Martin told the gathered crowd in Austin. The Taoiseach explained that Austin, with its substantial tech sector and creative industry, represents the opportunities to deepen the economic relationship between Ireland and the US. But crucially, the Texas visit provided Mr Martin with the nearest thing to a dry run with Donald Trump he was going to get ahead of the actual meeting today. It was a balmy 24C when Mr Martin arrived at the governor’s mansion, a colonial style property straight out of Hollywood film, The Patriot . Crystal glasses of cold ice water were produced as the Taoiseach and his traveling party were left waiting in a reception room for Republican governor Greg Abbott, a man who during the meeting was keen to stress that he had been on the phone to Donald Trump, with whom is he very close, the night before. Texas is a truly red state and Mr Abbott, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the US, who also acted as Texas attorney general between 2002 to 2015, is a true MAGA Republican. Since entering the governor's office a decade ago, he has promoted an increasingly conservative agenda, including measures against abortion such as the Texas Heartbeat Act, lenient gun laws, and of course a tough stance on immigration. What's your view on this issue? You can tell us here During the pandemic Mr Abbott was vehemently against implementing face mask and vaccine mandates and went as far as blocking local governments, businesses, and other organisations from implementing their own. With many shunning vaccines, the west of the state is currently battling a measles outbreak , which has so far killed two. Last week, Mr Abbott accompanied vice president JD Vance and other Trump administration officials to Eagle Pass, Texas, along the US-Mexico border. It came after a visit to the Oval Office last month, during which the governor offered up a number of state facilities to help Mr Trump secure the border. ""Texas has completed more than 50 miles of border wall,"" Mr Abbott said afterwards. We're going to be adding another 20 miles of border wall here in the coming days. It's under construction right now, and we've acquired more than 100 miles of easement. I let the president know that all of that is available for the USA. When Mr Abbott arrived into the room to a waiting Taoiseach on Monday, it was all smiles and pleasantries, his wife Cecilia keen to explain her Irish roots. But within moments, the Irish media pack were ushered out of the room and back onto the shaded white veranda. It is understood the meeting, which lasted around 40 minutes, covered Mr Martin's visit to Dell earlier that morning and Ireland's pro-enterprise model as well as infrastructure investment in the years ahead. Liquified national gas Mr Trump is a transactional politician who looks for business opportunities everywhere, and a hint on what message Mr Martin might be wise to take into the Oval office came from the governor. A readout hinted to what could be bartered in a potential tariff trade-off: ""The governor touted Texas as the leading state for liquified national gas (LNG) exports and noted the importance of continued collaboration between Texas and Ireland in the energy industry."" Increasing imports of LNG from the US has already been raised as a potential way to avoid a threatened 25% tariff on EU goods. Speaking before making his way to Washington for his much-anticipated tête-à-tête with Mr Trump, Mr Martin stressed Ireland’s need to invest in LNG, which the Government has confirmed is now firmly on the table. ""It has been very clear to us by officials how serious the vulnerability is for Ireland. If anything was to happen to gas connectors, in terms of the Irish economy we would not survive a week without some back-up, with some energy security. It's very stark, actually. “So it's a fundamental responsibility, nothing to do with timing or just visit or anything like that. We have to have energy security. "" While the Taoiseach was remaining brief in his description of discussions with the governor, it is understood Mr Abbott did advise him that Trump is a very personable man, easy to get along with. But that advice of course came from someone who very much speaks Mr Trump's language. Mr Martin can only hope today’s Oval Office encounter goes as well as his discussions with Mr Abbott, who has now been invited to visit Ireland.

When they tabled their budget last spring, the federal Liberals presented the plan to change capital gains as a way to get wealthy Canadians and corporations to pay more — but the plan has faced a series of delays ever since. Tax expert Jamie Golombek of CIBC says the capital gains changes are still causing “confusion” during this tax season, even though the higher inclusion rate won’t be in play. Carney confirmed in his victory speech on Sunday that he would kill the planned capital gains hike."

He returned as a Stanford graduate student and a budding entrepreneur, to a country trying to jumpstart its tech industry. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Syria is still struggling three months after its revolution. There are glimmers of hope. At one hotel, hundreds of people recently gathered to talk about jump-starting the country's tech industry, which was virtually nonexistent during Syria's civil war. One young man fled that war as a teenager. He returned as a Stanford grad student and a budding entrepreneur. NPR's Greg Myre has the story from the capital, Damascus. And a warning - this piece does include descriptions of torture and abuse. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Some 700 people - most from Syria and some from the U.S. - filled a ballroom at the Sheraton Hotel in Damascus for the tech conference dubbed Silicon Valley in Syria. ABDULWAHAB OMIRA: Everyone was here, and everyone is excited. Everyone, like - you know, this excitement of like, hey, we want to build. We want to do something for our country. We're so happy. MYRE: Abdulwahab Omira is a young Syrian American who took a break from his master's program at Stanford to attend. Like everyone at the conference, he acknowledged the staggering challenges after 14 years of civil war. OMIRA: There's no infrastructure. There is no electricity. There is no water. There's no internet. Showering is an event. MYRE: Omira says his own experience taught him resilience, and he believes many Syrians have learned the same lesson. As a teenager in Damascus, he studied the high cancer rates in an area where the Syrian government disposed of nuclear waste. He proposed a new method and was awarded a patent at age 14 and was supposed to be honored at the presidential palace. But before that happened, he was stopped one day by the security forces. They found documents related to the nuclear program, and Omira was tossed in prison. The experience was harrowing. OMIRA: They start bringing people in, killing them under torture, showing me how they killed them. And each room has a different theme of killing - so many horrible stuff. Like, room No. 3, for example, they killed people with, like, a chainsaw. MYRE: Omira was not physically harmed, but he was warned that if he was arrested again... OMIRA: You will choose one of those rooms to die in. MYRE: Omira was released after two months, and his family decided it was time to leave Syria. They went from a prosperous life in Damascus to a tent in a refugee camp in neighboring Turkey. Eventually, they made it to the U.S., landing in Chicago. But Omira didn't speak English or have a valid high school diploma. He kept studying until he got a perfect score on the college entrance exam and admission to Stanford University. He graduated with a computer science degree last year. He's now in the masters program, working on artificial intelligence. He also runs a tech startup designed to help farmers in Syria. And he's meeting with tech students throughout the country. OMIRA: We went to seven universities across Syria where we give workshops for the students. MYRE: Still, the obstacles in Syria can seem endless. U.S. sanctions remain. They were imposed against Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and though he was ousted three months ago, the sanctions have not been lifted. This was a recurring theme at the tech conference. Organizer Rama Chakaki is a Syrian American and a tech investor from California. RAMA CHAKAKI: Absolutely. So the sanctions now are quite prohibitive. I mean, the banking system is disconnected from the rest of the world. And so folks like me can never invest in Syria until these sanctions are lifted. MYRE: For now, the goal is to connect Syria's tech community, which was so isolated during the war. CHAKAKI: One thing about Syrians is we're very socially interconnected. All of us having been in the diaspora, feeling very displaced, couldn't wait for that chance to get together. So my 12,000 connections on LinkedIn worked really well for me. MYRE: When Abdulwahab Omira returned to Syria, he visited his old family home. OMIRA: I went to my room. I was digging out my memories, and then I found my first CS book - computer science book - that I got in seventh grade. They were explaining what the internet is, how to use the keyboard, how to turn off the PC. MYRE: Omira has come a long way since then. He summed up his journey from refugee to Stanford student to tech entrepreneur this way. OMIRA: The U.S. was definitely the land of opportunity because if you put, like, 100%, you get 100%. In Turkey, if you put 100%, you get probably, like, get 10%. Here if you put 100%, you get in prison. MYRE: He's hoping to write a new formula for a new Syria. Greg Myre, NPR News, Damascus.

In that time, tech companies have fundamentally shifted their hiring strategies, said Russell Hancock, president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a San Jose think tank. “Silicon Valley has entered a state of uncertainty and flux,” he said. “It’s driven employers to focus on efficiency and sustainable profits.” The contrast between the boom and the subsequent bust in the Bay Area is stark, according to seasonally adjusted industry totals that Beacon Economics culled from the Employment Development Department. “Tech employment has been on a roller coaster since the pandemic started in 2020,” said Scott Anderson, BMO Capital Markets’ chief U.S. economist and managing director. The plunge has affected the jobs of tens of thousands of workers, including employees at a slew of industry icons. In 2020, Bay Area tech companies added workers when the world abruptly shifted to remote work and distance learning. Tech extended the gains into 2021 and 2022. The tech sector scrambled to hire people quickly enough to meet the fevered demand for working from home. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs, Beacon’s compilation shows. But in 2023 and 2024, employers slashed a net total of 80,200 tech jobs in the region. “The tech employment resurgence was short-lived,” Anderson said. “Tech industry overhiring earlier in the pandemic likely aggravated the tech job losses.” Despite shedding jobs, tech companies are seeking to fine-tune hiring as they scout for fertile new fields in artificial intelligence, said Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Creative Strategies in Campbell. “Demand for tech workers is still strong, but more focused and targeted toward AI, high-speed computing and integration of AI into business processes,” Bajarin said. For now, however, the tech industry must cope with more immediate challenges, such as the region’s brutal housing problems and uncertain federal policies. “Deportations, tariffs and continuing lack of enough new housing will present challenges,” said Steven Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. “We must come together to overcome and preserve our unique advantages as an innovative economy.” The first warning signs for tech surfaced in late 2022, when Facebook app owner Meta Platforms encountered a rare event in its corporate history: a decline in revenue. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s top boss, pursued ways to streamline the social media network’s operations. Layoffs quickly became a prime solution. In November 2022, Meta announced it would eliminate 11,000 jobs worldwide, including 2,565 jobs in the Bay Area, state notices showed. Before long, it became clear that the tech industry’s woes weren’t confined to Facebook. Amazon, Cisco, Salesforce and Tesla followed suit, turning a trickle of cuts into a stream and then a flood of layoffs. Still, it took one more significant event to make it clear that the tech’s bust wouldn’t immediately yield to yet another boom. In January 2023, Google chopped 1,600 Bay Area jobs. Suddenly, efficiency and streamlining became industry watchwords as AI beckoned from the horizon. “We think the last two years are the result of more than the economic cycle,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “The region and the state need to do more to attract and retain all types of employers.” By the end of 2024, the tech industry in the Bay Area had shriveled to 880,200 jobs, far below the peak level of 960,400 that it had reached by the end of 2022. The Bay Area tech sector is even smaller than it was in 2019, when it accounted for 885,700 jobs. The tech industry’s job losses are particularly pronounced in the South Bay and the San Francisco-San Mateo metro area, sometimes touted as a trendy spot for fledgling tech firms. The tech downturn has hammered the San Francisco metro area the hardest, with a loss of 39,600 tech jobs in 2023 and 2024, or an 11% plunge in that urban center’s tech jobs. The South Bay hasn’t fared much better. Over the same two years, the area lost 33,300 tech jobs for a decline of 8.1%. The tech industry’s fading fortunes have also jolted the East Bay, but to a much lesser extent. The East Bay lost 6,500 tech jobs over the last two years, a 3.9% decline. While the Bay Area remains a primary hub for the worldwide tech industry despite recent job losses, the sector’s faltering job market could erode some of the region’s dominance. “It’s hard to say anything for certain, but we may be looking at a tectonic shift, where Silicon Valley becomes one node in a more dispersed innovation ecosystem,” Hancock said. One thing seems certain: The once high-flying tech industry has come back to Earth. “The past two years, economic reality has set in,” Bernick said.

""When women are at the forefront of decision-making in organisations, whether as creators, innovators, or leaders, business results follow,"" Dasgupta stated. However, she pointed out the stark reality of India's workforce participation rate for women, which remains at a mere 40.3%. ""The challenge isn’t a lack of talent—it’s the systemic barriers that limit access and opportunities."" Dasgupta's comments come at a time when the tech industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. She stressed the need for concrete actions beyond mere acknowledgment. ""As an industry, tech leaders need to continue to elevate and invest in women by creating leadership opportunities, mentorship, and support systems that enable them to thrive."" HP India , under Dasgupta's leadership, is taking significant strides in this direction. ""At HP India, one of our key strategies has been to focus on hiring, retaining, and investing in women,"" she revealed. This commitment has resulted in women now comprising one-third of their workforce, a substantial increase from ""the low double digits not long ago."" A key initiative driving this change is HP India's ""Disha"" program, which focuses on enhancing leadership skills for high-potential women, empowering them to advance in their careers. Dasgupta highlighted the tangible results of this investment, stating, ""I’m especially proud that our Supplies product team, Growth, and Strategy teams are led by women – proof that when you invest in women, they rise."" Beyond internal initiatives, Dasgupta believes in the power of advocacy. ""It’s incumbent on us to actively advocate and champion female talent, encourage them to take risks and be vocal for opportunities,"" she asserted. She emphasized that the future of technology is inextricably linked to the inclusion of women's diverse perspectives and leadership. ""The future of technology needs women’s ideas, perspectives, and leadership, and it’s on all of us to make that future a reality.” Dasgupta's message resonates with a growing understanding that empowering women in tech is not just a matter of social justice, but a strategic imperative for innovation and economic growth.

Britain and space exploration hardly sound like natural bedfellows. In fact, many may be surprised to hear that Britain has a space programme at all: the UK Space Agency, who, led by CEO Dr Paul Bate, have ambitions of making the country one of the world’s leading space economies. Despite the public’s perception, Will Whitehorn, the former president of Virgin Galactic , is truly optimistic about this mission. “The UK space tech industry makes up 7 percent of the global market,” Whitehorn says, “but far more importantly, we have some of the greatest minds in the industry and a fantastic technological heritage. You would be hard-pressed to find a space mission that hasn’t got a bit of tech invented by a British company.” Take the Artemis mission for example, where Thales Alenia Space UK is making the refuelling module for the Lunar Gateway–a space station that will orbit the moon. Since Donald Trump’s re-election in November, space exploration has been thrust back to the top of the global agenda, with the president announcing at his inauguration that planting flags on the planet Mars was part of their “manifest destiny”. President Donald Trump speaks at an indoor Presidential Inauguration parade event in Washington (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) AP Investment in the UK’s space sector–an industry that employs 60,000 people–is a practical imperative for the growth of the country’s economy, Whitehorn says. A staggering 16 percent of the UK’s GDP is dependent on space technology , the UK Space Agency say. Of course that doesn’t mean we’re spending that much money on space travel. Rather, it shows just how reliant we are on satellites for crucial technologies such as weather monitoring, mobile connectivity, TV broadcasting, and even WIFI. Clearly space technology is more than just exploration: it’s the backbone of our global technological revolution. The UK in space The UK’s first involvement in the space race came in 1952. By 1962, the UK had launched it’s first satellite - the Ariel 1. The first British astronaut, Helen Sharman, went into space in 1991 when she visited the Mir Space Station. The UK Space Agency was founded in 2010. Britain still remains part of the European Space Agency (ESA), with Brexit not impacting its position. It drives advancements in AI infrastructure, with data centres in space to power artificial intelligence expected within ten years; climate solutions, including plans for off-planet solar panels that bypass cloud interference; and defence systems, where satellites are crucial for GPS and surveillance. The UK’s role in these industries demands that we grow our space technology sector, Doug Liddle, chairman of UKSpace, says. “With the groundbreaking success of private companies like SpaceX , we’re on the brink of a full-scale space economy,” says Liddle.

After nine months in power, the government’s plans for public investment into Britain’s space industry are still vague. In the meantime, it’s up to events like the Space-Comm Expo at the Excel Centre (11-12 March) to stir public interest and boost private investment. Space-Comm Expo Hayley Bray Photography With America moving towards isolationist policies, Whitehorn thinks conferences like Space-Comm exemplify the UK’s unique position as a bridge between Europe and the US’ space missions: “Where else will you find a conference where the head of ESA and senior members of NASA attend?” Liddle agrees, saying, “By having one foot in the European Space Agency–as its fourth biggest contributing nation–and the other in the US–with a close defence budget relationship that shares data and resources with our friends across the pond–the UK is in a strong position and the future looks bright.” “There’s an industrial revolution happening in space,” Whitehorn adds, “and with increased investment, Britain can be a key player.” The Space-Comm Expo is free to attend.

For years, the tech industry has faced a gap in representation, missing out on the unique insights and problem-solving abilities that diversity brings. As we acknowledge International Women’s Day on 8 March, we recognise the vital role of inclusive teams in shaping smarter, more impactful software solutions. When we open doors to different perspectives, we don’t just build better technology – we build a stronger, more connected world. Author: Hasina Sayed, software delivery lead for BET Software According to the World Economic Forum, at the current rate of progress, it will take until 2158 to achieve full gender parity. This staggering statistic highlights the importance of accelerating change and driving diversity in every industry, especially in tech. As a woman who has spent over a decade in the tech gambling industry, I’ve seen how much impact diverse teams can have – not only on fostering innovation but on creating better software solutions that serve a wide range of users. In an industry that thrives on creativity and constant evolution, gender diversity is not just beneficial, it’s essential. From my personal experience, the difference diversity makes is evident in how we approach problem solving and decision making. As women, we often bring unique perspectives to the table, shaped by our distinct life experiences. These different viewpoints challenge the status quo and spark new ideas. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed that my colleagues and I often think about problems from angles that may not have been considered before, leading to solutions that are more inclusive and innovative. In the fast-paced world of tech, this creative thinking is key to staying ahead of the curve and building software that addresses a wide variety of needs. Gender diversity also plays a vital role in ensuring the software we create is truly reflective of the people who use it. In the gambling tech industry, for example, our user base is diverse, and understanding both male and female perspectives is essential to building products that resonate with everyone. As a woman in this field, I’ve seen how including more female voices in development teams leads to a deeper understanding of user needs. This diversity enables teams to design products that are not only functional but also accessible, engaging, and more likely to meet the needs of a broader audience. Moreover, inclusive teams foster a culture of collaboration and respect, where all voices are valued. Over the years, I’ve found that the best decisions often come when different perspectives are considered. When women feel empowered to share their ideas and challenge assumptions, it creates an environment where innovation can flourish. In turn, this results in higher-quality software, as diverse teams work together to find solutions that are well-rounded and thoughtful. Lastly, companies that prioritise gender equality and inclusivity in tech are more likely to attract top talent. A diverse and inclusive environment is not only more welcoming but also offers better opportunities for growth and career advancement. As more women enter the tech industry, it’s crucial that we continue to build environments where everyone, regardless of gender, feels respected and empowered to contribute their best ideas. In conclusion, achieving gender parity in tech will take time, but by building inclusive teams and embracing diversity, we can accelerate progress. Diversity isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a driving force behind innovation and better software delivery. As a woman in tech, I’ve seen first-hand that when we foster diverse teams, we not only create better products but also pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable industry.

https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-tumble-again-donald-trump-waffles-tariffs-2040893,,Stocks Nosedive to the Worst Level of 2025 as Trump Waffles on Tariffs,20250306T213000Z,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2450666/breaking-news.jpg,newsweek.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"By Gabe Whisnant and Sonam Sheth Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member ​Another sharp sell-off on Wall Street sent the Nasdaq into correction territory—meaning it was 10 percent below its recent peak—on Thursday, while the S&P 500 had its worst trading day of the year. The Context It was the fourth day in a row that stocks plunged amid the market turmoil related to President Donald Trump 's whiplash on the U.S.'s tariffs on its biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. When asked whether his delays on tariffs reflected the slump for the stock market, Trump said Thursday, ""I'm not even looking at the market."" He earlier in the Oval Office blamed the falling prices on ""globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago."" What To Know The S&P 500 dropped 1.8 percent, while the Nasdaq plunged 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1 percent. The S&P 500's second-worst trading day of the year occurred just three days ago, with a decline of 1.76 percent, as Trump's trade war loomed. ... Trump granted another temporary reprieve to Mexico and Canada on Thursday, saying he would delay imposing tariffs on products from the two countries that are covered under the USMCA trade agreement. But the market remained volatile as concerns grew that an escalating global trade war could slow economic growth and worsen inflation. The tech sector was hit particularly hard as AI companies saw significant losses that dragged the market as a whole down. Trump made tariffs a key pillar of his economic platform during the 2024 election and made good on his threat to impose steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Tuesday. He also raised an initial 10 percent tariff on China that went into effect in February. Canada and China responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own, while Mexico said it would issue its response by Sunday. The market immediately reacted to the tariffs; the Dow dropped 1.55 percent, or 670 points, adding to a 650-point plummet on Monday. The Nasdaq closed 0.35 percent down and at its lowest was down 2 percent, briefly entering correction territory before recovering. Trump, for his part, has previously acknowledged that Americans could feel ""some pain"" associated with tariffs but insisted it would ""all be worth the price that must be paid."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't mince words when responding on Tuesday to the tariffs. ""A fight with Canada will have no winners,"" he said, adding that the trade was ""very dumb."" Trump started backtracking on tariffs on Wednesday, saying there would be a carveout for U.S. automakers who could be hit hardest by a trade war. On Thursday, the president announced that Mexican goods that fall under the USMCA would not be subject to tariffs until next month, adding that he made the accommodation ""out of respect for [Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum]."" ""Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,"" Trump added. Later in the day, Trump signed an executive order saying that Canadian goods covered by USMCA would also be granted a reprieve for another month and added a carveout for Canadian potash. What People Are Saying Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, told the Associated Press: ""These exemptions don't do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty. Businesses will still be cautious in the current environment until a lot more of the tariff picture is clear."" Strategists at BNP Paribas told the AP: ""Much will depend on whether these new tariffs prove temporary or are toned down. But even if they are ultimately removed, we anticipate lasting damage to global economic activity."" What Happens Next Wall Street will be looking at the U.S. Labor Department's jobs report, set for release on Friday, which will reveal how many workers U.S. employers hired last month. A strong job market, coupled with robust consumer spending, has played a critical role in preventing a recession so far. Economists anticipate an acceleration in hiring for February, signaling continued resilience in the labor market. Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this article.

An ASML representative said that the repair centre mentioned in the plan is “an upgrade to our existing repair centre in China. It is not an addition, it replaces the older repair centre.” It has been previously reported that the Dutch government could limit ASML’s ability to repair and maintain its semiconductor equipment on the mainland.

The White House slapped a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports on Tuesday, increasing fears of a major trade war between the two countries. This follows the 10% levy imposed in early February, taking the total US tariffs to 20% since Trump re-entered the White House. The move comes at a difficult time for Beijing, with the government grappling with a number of economic woes. Low consumption, a property crisis and youth unemployment have dampened confidence in the overall economy despite strong exports over the past two years, giving China an almost trillion-dollar trade surplus.

The government is also looking to attract investment into its high tech industries, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) and green energy. Both sectors are seen as vital to government plans to grow and diversify the economy. The success of DeepSeek sparked an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors.

President Donald Trump has threatened to hit semiconductor imports with a 25% tariff in an effort to incentivize chipmakers to manufacture chips in the United States instead of importing them. This ignores the reality that there aren’t enough fabrication plants in the US to make all these chips begin with, and building them will not be accomplished overnight. Potential impacts to businesses are likely to be minimal, according to Scott Almassy, US semiconductor lead for PwC. “In their purest sense, for a majority of the higher end [companies] in the semiconductor industry, it’s not as big a deal. It’s more just a nuisance that needs to be assessed, managed and obviously monitored,” Almassy said. “But I don’t think it’s upsetting the fundamental medium- or long-range plans of most companies.” Almassy’s argument is that the cost will not be fully passed on to the customer and instead will be absorbed by the OEM that buys the chips. Chipmakers like TSMC and GlobalFoundries don’t sell directly to end users but rather to OEMs like HPE and Supermicro, and they can absorb some of the cost. “I think it will vary by industry,” Almassy said. “Obviously the middle ground would be splitting it 50% with the supplier, 50% to the consumer. I think it’s going to be a calculus that’s going to have to be done by each individual company with where they feel like they are in the value chain, and what kind of pricing power they have.” Almassy says tariffs will definitely be felt by consumers more than IT organizations because there are “fewer levers consumers can pull” and fewer actions that consumers can take than enterprises, which are constantly on edge about what they need to do to maintain and grow their business, and what’s around the corner. The idea behind tariffs is to increase domestic manufacturing, but Almassy notes the United Stated doesn’t have the manufacturing capacity or capability that Taiwan does. TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries have some fabs here, but they are not building the most leading edge technologies. “Those are all in Taiwan at the moment. Those fabs take years to ramp up right. And then you need the workforce to be able to turn them into profitable factories. That doesn’t happen overnight either,” he said. Almassy said it’s not possible to predict when the tariffs will hit because they haven’t been implemented yet. “The magnitude of it remains to be seen, based on the duration and the overall macro connection and how things play out more broadly,” he said. Still, others say tariffs would harm the industry. “The tech industry is a global industry, and as we saw during Trump’s first term, if you place restrictions on any part of the value chain, you impact the entire value chain in one way or another. Between Trump’s threats and [China president Xi Jinping’s] threats [referring to the restriction of rare earth materials], the tech industry could be in for a very rough ride, not to mention the US and global economies,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst with Tirias Research, in a recent Network World article SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

The sector is clearly underperforming, as major names such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) see drops of 1.92% and 1.84% respectively. On the other hand, consumer defensive stocks display a measure of resilience. Companies like Procter & Gamble ( PG ) are up by 1.06% , reflecting investor interest in traditionally stable industries amid market volatility. Market Mood and Trends The overall mood in the market today is tentative, witnessing varying investor confidence across sectors. The downturn in technology stocks suggests growing concerns possibly linked to geopolitical tensions or industry-specific challenges. Meanwhile, the modest performances in consumer defensive sectors hint at a cautious yet strategic shift by investors towards more reliable havens. Moreover, declines in the consumer cyclical sector, with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) down 2.88% and 4.55% respectively, point to broader worries affecting discretionary spending and economic outlook. Strategic Recommendations With today's tech sector turbulence, investors might consider a hedging strategy by diversifying into consumer defensive stocks that show relative strength. Additionally, keeping an eye on upcoming earnings reports and economic updates will be crucial in navigating future market shifts. Tech-savvy investors should weigh potential opportunities for buying at a discount amidst tech sector declines, provided they carry out a comprehensive risk assessment. As always, staying attuned to real-time updates and having a balanced portfolio could offer a viable path through this uncertain market landscape.

This has real costs for Georgia’s economy. Start-ups create jobs and new products and services, strengthen local and regional value chains, and drive innovation. Competing on an unequal playing field deprives the country of new enterprises that could boost economic growth and help reduce poverty. Empowering women in tech is essential to unlock Georgia’s full economic potential and remain competitive globally. Addressing this gender gap was central to the World Bank’s Georgia National Innovation Ecosystem (GENIE) Project , which, since 2016 to 2023, has played a critical role in boosting the country’s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem through trainings, grants, technical assistance, and setting up infrastructure like incubators and regional hubs. Over half of GENIE beneficiaries have been women, many of whom have not only turned their innovative ideas into successful startups but have also become role models for other aspiring female entrepreneurs—helping lay the foundations for a more inclusive, competitive tech sector. Supporting Women-Led Start-Ups: Nato and Ana One of these GENIE success stories is Nato Toronjadze, the founder and CEO of Bizon, one of the leading online Georgian marketplaces for connecting buyers and sellers of heavy machinery and agricultural equipment. Building upon the diverse experience of her team members and seeing the need for digital solutions in the leasing of construction and transport equipment, Nato has led her company to survive and thrive. That has not been easy. “Our success story was overloaded with hardships. We encountered challenges every step of the way, including the pandemic… as well as some biases you face when you are a female start-upper,” she recalled, reflecting on getting involved in the male-dominated world of machinery leasing. “However, we managed to overcome all the obstacles and now we enjoy the results of our success.” Bizon now employs 19 people and even won the Best Tech Startup category of the Grace Hopper Award, which celebrates contributions in technology and women’s empowerment."

Indiaintroduced a new deal value threshold in September 2024.Elsewhere, antitrust authorities are using powers to review non-notifiable techM&A, particularly in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm/Autotalks was oneof these, although ultimately the EC’s review would have fallen away after acourt ruling overturned the EC’s ability to accept referrals in such cases (seeour article Rising review risk for deals not meeting merger control thresholds).In China, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has used itsbelow-threshold call-in powers to request the notification of Synopsys/Ansys.We expect to see similar cases in future.Deals involving AI activities are also grabbing attention, although interventionlevels so far have been low. Part of the challenge for antitrust authorities, as wediscuss below, is whether certain AI arrangements even fall within the scope ofthe merger control rules.Finally, new digital market regimes emerge and bed down with some (e.g., theEU and the U.K.) imposing additional notification obligations on in-scope firms.This adds an extra layer of disclosure for tech dealmakers.Looking ahead, the U.S., EU and U.K. agencies (among others) have mandatesto crack down on the market power of Big Tech. Scrutiny of digital deals mayfurther intensify.AI partnerships in the merger controlnet?Partnerships between Big Tech firms and AI providers are fast becoming anantitrust target. These often include IP licenses, distribution arrangements,provision of computing infrastructure and sometimes control, consultationrights, board representation or exclusivity rights. They also encompass “acqui-hires” of talent.However, authorities are grappling with whether these non-traditional dealstructures amount to “mergers” within the scope of their rules.2/28/25, 9:34 AMStormy skies for tech deals as antitrust scrutiny grows - A&O Shearmanhttps://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/global-trends-in-merger-control-enforcement/stormy-skies-for-tech-deals-as-antitrust-scrutiny-intensifies4/8The U.K. CMA is a frontrunner here and is building a body of precedent that willhelp participants assess merger control risk. Minor (e.g., less than 1%) votingrights are unlikely to be enough to trigger CMA jurisdiction. Nor are non-exclusive arrangements. But the CMA has looked at the hiring of coreemployees teamed with IP licenses (Microsoft/Inflection). It has also indicatedthat exclusive supply/distribution agreements or situations where the acquirerhas consultation rights or particular expertise may fall in its purview. So far,however, the CMA has had no cause to intervene.The CMA is well-known for its long jurisdictional reach. Other authorities mightnot be able to take a similarly wide approach, at least under existing rules. Butthey may well give it a go:In a policy brief, the EC said it is on the watch for acquisition strategiesaimed at eliminating nascent competitors or absorbing key employeesand critical know how. It concluded that Microsoft/Inflection was a“concentration” under the EU Merger Regulation, although the turnoverthresholds were not met. In contrast, it found that Microsoft’s partnershipwith OpenAI was not a concentration on the basis that Microsoft had notacquired control on a lasting basis.In Germany, too, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) concluded thatMicrosoft/Inflection was a merger for the purposes of the German rulesbut could not take jurisdiction due to a lack of local nexus. The FCO headwants to enable AI partnership scrutiny by lowering the country’s dealvalue filing threshold and expanding it to include possible or future (andnot just actual) activities.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released a report on thepotential antitrust implications of partnerships between the largest cloudservice providers and AI developers. It says they could impact access toinputs, increase switching costs for AI developers and give cloud serviceproviders access to sensitive business information.Brazil’s antitrust agency is investigating several instances of failures tonotify AI partnerships.2/28/25, 9:34 AMStormy skies for tech deals as antitrust scrutiny grows - A&O Shearmanhttps://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/global-trends-in-merger-control-enforcement/stormy-skies-for-tech-deals-as-antitrust-scrutiny-intensifies5/8The Korean antitrust authority has pledged to strengthen oversight of theAI sector and will review the need to update merger control rules toaddress new forms of business partnership.More turbulence for airline mergersAntitrust intervention in transport M&A (12%) was six times higher than theproportion of global M&A in 2024.

The EC did, however, accept remedy packages inKorean Air/Asiana and Lufthansa/MEF/ITA.

He emphasized the fund's crucial role in developing the country’s tech sector. Arshakyan expressed satisfaction with the fund's expansion into its second phase, which will allocate tens of millions of dollars to fuel the growth of Armenian startups. He stressed that a key component of venture capital is encouraging innovation while supporting entrepreneurs with financial backing and risk mitigation. ""This initiative also demonstrates leadership, as individuals from Armenia and the diaspora involved in the venture fund will extend their expertise, experience, and international connections to both emerging and established companies. This creates significant opportunities for these companies to enter global markets,"" Arshakyan stated. He expressed confidence that institutional and creative thinking, a willingness to launch new businesses and attract investments in the tech industry, along with the establishment of a supportive venture fund, will drive growth not only in high-tech but also in other sectors. During the launch event, Armenia’s Minister of High-Tech Industry, Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, also delivered remarks, congratulating the fund on its initiation and highlighting its significance for the country's tech ecosystem. Citing data from the State Revenue Committee (SRC), Hayrapetyan noted that in 2024, the IT sector’s turnover reached 915 billion drams, while including certain high-tech industries, the figure surpassed 1.15 trillion drams. The sector’s continued growth indicates a competitive tech environment that attracts new investments, top talent, and innovative ideas. ""Public and private sector investments in technology have led to tangible success. Today, the technology component of the economy accounts for around 7-8% of GDP, but we are confident that the existing potential will allow us to double this figure in the coming years.

Eoin Mac Raghnaill Wicklow People Fri 28 Feb 2025 at 01:00 As part of his wider campaign to help SMEs in his home county and across Ireland, Wicklow Deputy Edward Timmins recently met with the country’s most influential business organisation representing the tech sector to glean some insights on “how our government can help small businesses”. After attending a positive meeting with the executive team from IBEC’s Technology Ireland in Dublin’s Buswells Hotel, the Fine Gael TD and chartered accountant said the informative discussion only deepened his support for the Irish tech sector and Garden County SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). “As an experienced business person and chartered accountant who has now been elected as a TD, I understand the difficulties that small businesses in Wicklow face and also the challenges of the broader Irish tech sector,” he said. “I was delighted to meet with the Executive Team of IBEC’s Technology Ireland to discuss how our government can help small businesses, including fair access to tenders, where small Irish companies are often currently excluded. “Additionally, ISME’s Q3 24 Business Trends showed 9 out of 14 indicators yielding declining results. For example, economic uncertainty is high as current sales dropped 3pc from Q1. I am hopeful we can reverse some of these indicators”. On priorities for the tech sector, Timmins noted that he fully supports the priorities of Technology Ireland, as outlined in their Policy Priorities Roadmap for 2025 - ‘Unlocking the Future’. “I will endeavour to work tirelessly to ensure the implementation of these key pillars, which include regulatory stability and coherence, strategic growth and business development, global leadership through robust digital policy and open digital trade, digital entrepreneurship, development, creation and management, new emerging and transformative technologies and of course future-proofing the tech sector by prioritising and funding digital literacy and skills,” he added. “Both I and Fine Gael fully support the Irish tech sector and small businesses. We will continue to advocate for small businesses both in Wicklow and across Ireland. According to figures from the CSO in 2022, SMEs account for more than 99pc of all businesses in this country. “As a TD, I look forward to further engaging with the tech sector and, most importantly, small businesses in the Wicklow constituency on how government can further support them with the challenges they often encounter. “As a TD with international business experience, and as someone who had helped SMEs establish and expand, I will champion the needs of small business owners so enterprises in this county and country can truly flourish.” Why you can Trust the Irish Independent: Learn about Editorial Guidelines and AI Use"

A call with CEO Jensen Huang is set for 5:00PM ET. The chipmaker’s results will serve as a crucial test for both the tech sector and the broader market amid worries over the faltering AI trade. A stellar performance could quiet skeptics who fear an AI bubble, while a disappointing report or conservative guidance could serve as a fresh catalyst for a more severe market correction.

As Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) gears up to release its Q4 earnings report after the close on Wednesday, the tech sector and the broader market are on edge. Past earnings surprises from Nvidia have been market-moving events, and this quarter is unlikely to be an exception. The report arrives at a critical juncture, with the once-unstoppable tech rally showing signs of fatigue amid growing fears that the AI bubble may be on the verge of bursting. The Nasdaq Composite has slumped roughly 6% from recent highs, growth stocks are tumbling, and skepticism is mounting over whether the AI boom can justify sky-high valuations. Source: Investing.com As the bellwether of artificial intelligence, Nvidia’s results won’t just reflect its own performance—they’ll signal whether the AI narrative has legs or is unraveling beneath investor's feet. Here’s what to expect and what it could mean for investors and beyond. What to Expect from Nvidia’s Q4 Report Analysts are forecasting a blockbuster quarter. Profit estimates have been revised upward 33 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just five downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Nvidia’s earnings potential. Source: InvestingPro Consensus estimates call for revenue at approximately $38.1 billion, a staggering 73% increase year-over-year. This figure edges out Nvidia’s own guidance of $37.5 billion (plus or minus 2%), issued during its Q3 earnings call in November 2024. Net income is projected to soar to $21.08 billion, up from $12.84 billion in the same quarter last year, while earnings per share (EPS) are expected to hit $0.85, a 63% jump from $0.52 in Q4 FY2024. These numbers reflect Nvidia’s unrelenting dominance in AI and graphics processing units (GPUs), fueled by robust demand from major tech players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Meta (NASDAQ: META ), who are collectively pouring over $200 billion into AI infrastructure in 2025. Beyond the numbers, Nvidia’s forward guidance for the current quarter will be critical. Analysts are projecting revenue of nearly $42 billion, and anything less—or hints of cooling demand—could rattle markets. The company’s track record is impeccable, having beaten estimates in 16 of its last 18 quarters. However, whispers of emerging competition, notably from China’s DeepSeek, which claims to train competitive AI models with less compute power, have sparked debate about Nvidia’s long-term growth runway. Investor Scenarios: Preparing for the Aftermath NVDA stock, trading at $126.63 as of Wednesday morning, has climbed 61% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 ’s 17% gain. Shares are sitting right at their 200-day moving average. Source: Investing.com With options markets pricing in a roughly 8% swing post-earnings, volatility is all but guaranteed. As such, investors should prepare for multiple outcomes: 1. A Blowout Quarter and Strong Guidance: If Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could surge to a new record above $150, boosting sentiment across the tech sector. That would help lift semiconductor peers like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ), as well as AI software stocks like Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI ). 2. An In-Line Report with Conservative Guidance: While Nvidia has a track record of exceeding expectations, conservative guidance could trigger short-term selling. This scenario might signal caution about overestimating the pace of AI adoption. 3. A Miss or Soft Guidance: Given Nvidia’s high valuation, any disappointment could lead to a sharp selloff, impacting not just Nvidia but also other high-growth tech stocks. Investors may consider hedging through options or rotating into defensive sectors of the market. Those with long-term confidence in Nvidia might use any post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity. Broader Market Implications Nvidia’s earnings have evolved into a market-moving event, given its outsized influence on the tech sector and the S&P 500. A beat-and-raise scenario, particularly with robust Q1 guidance, could reignite investor enthusiasm for AI-related investments, potentially reversing the recent pullback in growth stocks. Conversely, a miss could ripple through the tech sector, dragging down risk assets and raising questions about the sustainability of the AI-driven rally that has fueled markets since 2023. Final Thoughts Nvidia’s earnings will either inject adrenaline into the AI trade or confirm fears of a speculative bubble. For the broader market, the stakes couldn’t be higher. A strong report could salvage the tech rally, while a miss could accelerate the ongoing rotation toward value stocks. Investors should brace for fireworks and position accordingly.

Israel needs 13,000 engineers to sustain innovation growth Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv says it has doubled enrollment to help meet the demand Maayan Hoffman , ILTV | Add a comment Print Find an error? Report us Related Topics Maayan Hoffman Technology Science Genetic engineering Business ILTV The world is advancing at an incredible pace. As technology evolves and industries become more high-tech, the demand for skilled engineers continues to grow. “The entire IT industry has been disrupted in the past, maybe 10 years, with new waves of innovation, disruptive technologies, from networking to the cloud,"" said Oren Sagi, managing director at Cisco Israel and chairperson of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce. ""They started security challenges, and now with AI. And when we refer to AI, it's not only the LLM models, but how can we build the AI factory, the infrastructure that supports AI, the application security level.” ENGINEERING ISRAEL’S FUTURE ( ILTV ) To develop future engineers, a continuous education plan and essential skill-building are crucial. At Afeka Academic College of Engineering in Tel Aviv, education goes beyond academics. The institution has transformed the learning process to ensure students not only gain essential knowledge but also develop the skills needed to apply it effectively. This includes solving complex problems, working in or leading multidisciplinary teams, communicating ideas concisely, and continuing to self-learn throughout their careers. “We discovered that everybody agreed that there is a need for the skills, but each institute has developed its own unique model to instill the skills for the graduates,"" said Prof. Ami Moyal, president of Afeka College. ""We need to think strategically on a multi-year basis—what are the engines of growth that will make Israel secure and strong? And with this aspect, the economy, the high-tech industry, and the engineers are a major trajectory, with engineers as the only resource that we have. You know, in Israel, we don't have resources; we have only human capital. So, the investment in growing and improving the quality of engineers will flourish the economy."" Israel is currently facing a shortage of 13,000 engineers and software developers. Afeka College has stepped up to meet this demand. While it once enrolled around 500 students per year, that number has now doubled to 1,000. Today, more than 700 graduates enter the workforce annually, supplying the country with approximately 10% of the new engineers joining the high-tech industry. “But I think our main role is to be an example of the need to change the educational process from the aspect of quality, specifically instilling skills in the educational process, because academia needs to change,"" Moyal added. Israel is currently at war, and the country has urgent needs. Many donors have stepped up to help. But as Oren Sagi explains, long-term success requires a strategic focus on Israel’s future engines of growth—and that engine is its engineers. “Eventually, the entire secret of Israel is talent,"" said Sagi. ""This is the main source of innovation. This is the main source of success. And talent comes from the Academy and the Academy, and the connection between the academia, the Israeli academia, and the tech sector.” He said, ""We see so much rapid change within the tech industry, in the economy. So what I ask people, when I interview young engineers, they need to have the knife between the teeth. They need to have the energy in their eyes. They need to work very strong with the team and keep on being curious and to learn all the time.” Comments New comment The commenter agrees to the privacy policy of Ynet News and agrees not to submit comments that violate the terms of use , including incitement, libel and expressions that exceed the accepted norms of freedom of speech. send comment "" """

With this addition, about 58 lakh employees are now employed in the sector. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The development comes when the IT industry is seeing a turnaround in demand after 1.5 years, coming out of the pressure triggered by a macroeconomic slowdown in the key markets of the United States and Europe. However, Nasscom has revised its previous projection of hiring in FY24 by almost 2.50 lakh employees. It had projected the tech sector to employ 54.30 lakh in FY24, but has now revised it to 56.74 lakh, according to the new numbers. India's technology industry's revenue is expected to reach $300 billion at the end of the 2026 fiscal year. For FY25, Nasscom estimates growth of 5.1 percent for the tech industry in India, taking the total industry revenue to over $282.6 billion.

She is an IT expert with a strong career path in the nation’s tech industry. Before joining the carmaker in 2021, she served as NHN’s former chief technology officer and supervised the overall tech operations at the global IT firm. Jin is the first woman executive to be included as a director of the automaker after winning a possible approval from its upcoming shareholders’ meeting slated for March 20. Hyundai Motor spoke highly of her ICT expertise with a broad range of experiences in the industry. “Jin has diverse experiences and strong expertise in the ICT industry, so we expect her to contribute to enhancing our competitiveness as a new internal director and strengthening gender diversity across our board,” an official from the carmaker said. She is widely expected to help the carmaker speed up its ongoing transition into a software-defined vehicle manufacturer. Jin studied statistics at Seoul National University. She has since developed her career path with a focus on data processing, cloud and IT services. Hyundai Motor scouted her in December 2021 in recognition of her proven track record across the nation’s tech industry. She has focused on spearheading Hyundai Motor’s innovation in the IT and software infrastructure after joining the automaker. The executive has also dedicated herself to building a developer-focused corporate culture in an era of smart mobility. Go to Top"

Lyu Ming/China News Service/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN — Chinese leader Xi Jinping hosted Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and the country’s top tech executives in Beijing on Monday, in a meeting that signals officials could be steering the country in a more business-friendly direction after a yearslong regulatory crackdown. Besides Ma, the other tycoons in attendance included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu, CATL CEO Zeng Yuqun, Tencent CEO Pony Ma, Meituan CEO Wang Xing, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, according to a video report from state broadcaster CCTV. According to official news agency Xinhua, the Chinese leader told the tycoons that they had “immense potential and promising prospects.” He said the country’s economic challenges were only temporary and also promised to remove barriers to fair market competition. “Now is the perfect time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to thrive,” he said at the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, where he chaired a similar symposium with leaders of privately owned businesses in 2018. The meeting came just weeks after Chinese startup DeepSeek’s latest AI model roiled global stock markets and AI players by delivering comparable performance to US-based industry behemoths at significantly lower cost. Its success has also brought optimism to China’s tech sector, which is still recovering after a severe regulatory crackdown lasting more than three years. That campaign was sparked in late 2020 after Ma blasted Chinese financial regulators and banks in a landmark speech. His blistering criticism set off the most widespread regulatory crackdown in the history of corporate China, which affected the fortunes of other tech giants including Tencent, ride-hailing Didi and food-delivery Meituan. Since then, Ma, the formerly outspoken founder, has largely vanished from public view. His high-profile attendance at the meeting with Xi suggests authorities are finally moving past its crackdown as concerns about his business empire have largely been resolved, according to Angela Huyue Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California who wrote a book about China’s regulation of tech firms. “With the domestic economy slowing and geopolitical pressures escalating, the government is making it clear that it values and relies on the private sector to drive innovation and stimulate growth,” she told CNN. An Alibaba Group sign is seen at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, on July 6, 2023. Aly Song/Reuters/File Related article Apple picks Alibaba to launch AI features in China The timing of this meeting is significant as it signals “renewed effort to support private enterprise, especially in the tech sector, and to restore entrepreneurial confidence,” she added. On Friday, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks key Chinese companies, rose to its highest-level since early 2022, after news about the upcoming symposium was first reported by Reuters. It was last trading about 1% lower on Monday. A powerful group The world’s second-largest economy is struggling against the backdrop of an increasingly hawkish international environment amid growing US-China trade tensions. Instead of a quick recovery after Beijing relaxed its stringent pandemic restrictions in late 2022, the economy has floundered, weighed down by its ailing property sector and low consumer confidence. Since then, the authorities have repeatedly sought to fire up the private sector, a group that has grown concerned about Beijing’s increasingly statist approach. Private businesses contribute more than 60% to China’s gross domestic product and over 80% of employment, despite being dwarfed by the state sector in size. Xi’s meeting with private entrepreneurs “clearly represents a major course correction” in China’s policies towards private businesses, Fred Hu, chairman of investment firm Primavera Capital, told Reuters. “The private sector, long the backbone of the Chinese economy and the most important growth engine, has been battered in recent years by mounting policy and regulatory uncertainties, with dire consequences to China’s economy, and worse, to its labor market with rising youth unemployment,” he said. China’s crackdown on private enterprise had wiped out more than $1 trillion in market value for many powerful Chinese companies and stoked fears about the future of innovation . In the summer of 2021, regulators announced curbs on the for-profit education industry and its food delivery sector. Even though the campaign appeared to have come to an end more than a year ago, some tycoons were still rattled and not expanding their businesses with their previous flourish.

Reuters | Published on: Feb 17, 2025 10:32 am IST Read this news in brief form Share Via Copy Link CHINA-TECH/XI (QUOTES):QUOTES-What's the significance of Xi's meeting with private enterprises? Feb 17 - China's President Xi Jinping has delivered a speech at a symposium on private enterprises attended by tech entrepreneurs including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, official media reported on Monday. What's the significance of Xi's meeting with private enterprises? There were no specific details about the symposium. Reuters reported last week that the symposium is aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage executives to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid a deepening China-U.S. technology war. Here's what people are saying about the meeting: GARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR NATIXIS, HONG KONG: ""Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S. ""The market reads it as a positive signal to include Jack Ma in such a meeting and hope for the end of the tech crackdown. Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now."" CHRISTOPHER BEDDOR, DEPUTY CHINA RESEARCH DIRECTOR, GAVECAL DRAGONOMICS, HONG KONG: ""I think it’s a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S. Policymakers would probably prefer if industrial-policy planning and state-owned enterprises were able to make innovative breakthroughs at the technological frontier. ""But the disruptive innovations are coming from private-sector companies. The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S. His presence would be hugely symbolic of how the government’s stance towards the tech sector has changed. If there’s one person associated with the tech crackdown, it’s Jack Ma. ""As for the signal – we’ve seen Xi run this playbook before. He clearly wants to send a message that the government is now supportive of the tech sector, and in turn instill confidence among tech entrepreneurs. It’s more or less a total reversal of the policy stance from a few years ago, when officials vowed to curb the “disorderly"" expansion of capital. ""But we know that Xi is concerned about the tech sector, based on his striking public remark last year about the declining number of unicorns."" ALFREDO MONTUFAR-HELU, HEAD OF THINK TANK THE CONFERENCE BOARD'S CHINA CENTER: ""After DeepSeek, Beijing is showing it understands that innovation and growth from the private sector, especially tech companies, is the best way forward for economic growth.""

He added that China must ""unify our thinking, strengthen our confidence and promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private economy,"" while downplaying the sector's current financial challenges as temporary, local, in the process of being reformed. ""We must focus on solving the problem of arrears of accounts owed to private enterprises. We must strengthen law enforcement supervision, focus on rectifying random charges, fines, inspections, and seizures, and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of private enterprises and private entrepreneurs in accordance with the law,"" he said, according to the report, calling for a ""clean relationship between government and business."" It comes amid concerns over the impact of the Beijing administration on Chinese businesses and their relative autonomy. The government has also been instrumental in supporting growth in recent months, through a spate of stimulus steps undertaken to revive the lethargy of an economy internally weighed down by lackluster domestic consumption and an extensive real estate slump. The Monday call to strengthen ""confidence in development"" also takes place at a time of looming U.S. tariffs and rising tech rivalry with the world's largest economy. The tech battle came into spotlight after Chinese startup DeepSeek's late-January release of its revolutionary AI that claims to compete with current models for a substantively smaller training cost. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng was one of the businessmen in attendance at the event. During his Monday address, Xi stressed that China must ""strive to promote scientific and technological innovation,"" among other goals. The Chinese leader's presence at the symposium sends a ""very clear signal of top-level support"" to entrepreneurs, Peiqian Liu, Asia economist at Fidelity International told CNBC, ""this will likely reignite the animal spirit and optimism about renewed growth momentum in China."" ""It could potentially be even more powerful than fiscal stimulus, should policymakers show more decisive support towards the development of tech sector in China,"" Liu added. The meeting could mark ""a symbolic turning point for Chinese tech sector after years of heightened scrutiny,"" said Lynn Song, chief economist at ING, emphasizing the timing of this meeting underscored Beijing's urgency to cheer up the private sector amid economic malaise and external tariff risks. It could mean that ""the regulatory overhang that we have had for the past two years or so is at an end,"" said Andy Maynard, managing director and head of equities at China Renaissance. Separately, state media CGTN reported that Chinese lawmakers were ""deliberating a draft of the country's first basic law focused on private sector growth."" ""The law will be of great significance for further optimizing the development environment for the private sector and driving high-quality growth,"" according to the report. It stressed that the private sector contributed for more than 60% of China's GDP, 48.6% of foreign trade, 56.5% of fixed-asset investment, 59.6% of tax revenue and more than 80% of urban employment. ""The fast-growing sector has played a significant role in promoting technological innovations and stabilizing economic growth,"" the report said. Alibaba's founder Jack Ma was among the entrepreneurs present at the meeting, according to a video clip released by Chinese state media. The outspoken businessman has mostly stayed out of the public eye since Chinese authorities scuttled a blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba Group affiliate Ant Group in November 2020, after his public criticism of the country's regulatory system enraged Beijing. Other entrepreneurs who attended the meeting included Ren Zhengfei, founder and chief executive officer of Huawei Technologies, Lei Jun, founder and CEO of consumer electronics maker Xiaomi Corp, Wang Xing, founder of food delivery giant Meituan, along with heads of automaker BYD and battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. ""You can never underestimate the power of such a meeting"" in simply restoring the confidence of Chinese entrepreneurs, who had been treading cautiously to not ""step on the wrong foot or head down a path that may be something that [Beijing] doesn't like,"" said Sam Radwan, founder of consultancy firm Enhance International. Beijing kicked off a regulatory storm against the country's large technology companies in late 2020 over concerns that they were growing too large and powerful. While the symposium may not signify ""a 180-degree turn"" in China's control over the direction of its economic policy, it does reflect Beijing's recognition of the significant role that China's private sector can play in supporting growth and boosting technological capabilities amid tightening restrictions by Western nations, Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of China Center at think tank The Conference Board, told CNBC. Mainland China's CSI 300 index was little changed following the news.

The tech battle came into spotlight after Chinese startup DeepSeek's late-January release of its revolutionary AI that claims to compete with current models for a substantively smaller training cost. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng was one of the businessmen in attendance at the event. During his Monday address, Xi stressed that China must ""strive to promote scientific and technological innovation,"" among other goals. The Chinese leader's presence at the symposium sends a ""very clear signal of top-level support"" to entrepreneurs, Peiqian Liu, Asia economist at Fidelity International told CNBC, ""this will likely reignite the animal spirit and optimism about renewed growth momentum in China."" watch now VIDEO 6:32 06:32 Xi Jinping is signaling China is here to win and lead in emerging technology, says Michelle Giuda Squawk Box ""It could potentially be even more powerful than fiscal stimulus, should policymakers show more decisive support towards the development of tech sector in China,"" Liu added. The meeting could mark ""a symbolic turning point for Chinese tech sector after years of heightened scrutiny,"" said Lynn Song, chief economist at ING, emphasizing the timing of this meeting underscored Beijing's urgency to cheer up the private sector amid economic malaise and external tariff risks. It could mean that ""the regulatory overhang that we have had for the past two years or so is at an end,"" said Andy Maynard, managing director and head of equities at China Renaissance. Separately, state media CGTN reported that Chinese lawmakers were ""deliberating a draft of the country's first basic law focused on private sector growth."" ""The law will be of great significance for further optimizing the development environment for the private sector and driving high-quality growth,"" according to the report. It stressed that the private sector contributed for more than 60% of China's GDP, 48.6% of foreign trade, 56.5% of fixed-asset investment, 59.6% of tax revenue and more than 80% of urban employment. ""The fast-growing sector has played a significant role in promoting technological innovations and stabilizing economic growth,"" the report said. watch now VIDEO 3:57 03:57 The Chinese economy's future is dependent on the private sector, strategist says Street Signs Asia Alibaba's founder Jack Ma was among the entrepreneurs present at the meeting, according to a video clip released by Chinese state media. The outspoken businessman has mostly stayed out of the public eye since Chinese authorities scuttled a blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba Group affiliate Ant Group in November 2020, after his public criticism of the country's regulatory system enraged Beijing. Other entrepreneurs who attended the meeting included Ren Zhengfei, founder and chief executive officer of Huawei Technologies, Lei Jun, founder and CEO of consumer electronics maker Xiaomi Corp, Wang Xing, founder of food delivery giant Meituan, along with heads of automaker BYD and battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. ""You can never underestimate the power of such a meeting"" in simply restoring the confidence of Chinese entrepreneurs, who had been treading cautiously to not ""step on the wrong foot or head down a path that may be something that [Beijing] doesn't like,"" said Sam Radwan, founder of consultancy firm Enhance International. Beijing kicked off a regulatory storm against the country's large technology companies in late 2020 over concerns that they were growing too large and powerful. While the symposium may not signify ""a 180-degree turn"" in China's control over the direction of its economic policy, it does reflect Beijing's recognition of the significant role that China's private sector can play in supporting growth and boosting technological capabilities amid tightening restrictions by Western nations, Alfredo Montufar-Helu, head of China Center at think tank The Conference Board, told CNBC. Mainland China's CSI 300 index was little changed following the news. The Hang Seng tech index, which had jumped over 5% Friday on media reports of the meeting, widened losses to drop over 2% following the meeting."

A potential encounter this week between President Xi Jinping and e-commerce icon Jack Ma, coming after a blistering run by tech shares, could be the next catalyst to extend the rally in China’s stocks. Prominent entrepreneurs including Ma have been invited to meet the nation’s top leaders, people familiar with the matter said last week. The potential show of support for the private sector coincides with the recent surge in equities in Hong Kong, driven by growing capabilities in artificial intelligence. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 4.1% on Friday to its highest since February 2022, exceeding an October peak spurred by a stimulus blitz. A tech gauge in Hong Kong entered a bull market earlier this month, fueled by Chinese startup DeepSeek’s AI model that’s hailed as a game-changer. “Such a high-profile endorsement sends a clear message of support from China’s government, which views the tech sector as a future driver of economic growth,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea. One major driver of the rally is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., whose Hong Kong-listed shares gained 6.3% on Friday, contributing to a surge of almost 60% since Jan. 13. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. The options market is pricing in a 7.6% move in Alibaba shares after the results, compared with an average 4.8% after the last eight quarterly reports.

It would also send a powerful signal that China’s Communist Party is adopting a more supportive stance toward private-sector companies. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Crystal-Clear Message “Having Jack Ma in particular would provide a symbolic end to the tech-sector crackdown, which essentially started with him back in 2020,” said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “In practice, the crackdown has been over for a while now. But the optics of Xi telling Ma and other tech leaders to go forth and prosper would send a crystal-clear message that the government’s stance has been completely reversed.” China is well aware that innovation is the key driver for productivity growth. Xi has continuously pushed for “new productive forces” amid the US curbs on high-end chips to China. That’s only prompted Beijing to redouble efforts at self-sufficiency in cutting-edge technology. The valuation of the tech index doesn’t appear frothy, given that the Hang Seng Tech gauge is trading at 18.2 times forward earnings, compared to 44.9 times four years ago. “Chinese equities have been trading at extremely depressed valuations with most risks well discussed and reflected in the prices,” said Sandy Pei, a senior portfolio manager for China equities at Federated Hermes. “The DeepSeek event has acted as a catalyst, boosting sentiment around Chinese equities. Despite recent performance, the market remains attractively valued.” DeepSeek has effectively boosted investor sentiment in China’s tech sector, and the rally has been spreading beyond just tech into other sectors, including electric vehicle makers and health-care companies. That’s quite the opposite from what many Chinese investors have experienced in recent years, waiting for the government to boost the stock market, whether through stimulus roll-out or via trading purchases by ETFs known to be favored by the so-called “national team.” first published: Feb 17, 2025 07:15 am Discover the latest Business News , Sensex , and Nifty updates.

A Bengaluru techie has made a desperate appeal for help in his job search, his Reddit post highlighting the urban unemployment crisis. In his Reddit post, the Bengaluru-based software engineer said that he had graduated in 2023 but, nearly two years later, he has still not managed to land a full-time job. A Bengaluru man, unable to land a job, says he is ready to work for free (Representational image) In his desperation to find employment, he said he was even ready to work for free in order to gain experience. The Reddit user shared his CV, with details like his name and college redacted, in hopes of landing a job through Reddit . “Burn my resume but please help” “Burn my resume but please help. Desperate & Ready to Work for Free Remotely – 23' Grad Looking for a Job ASAP,” the Bengaluru -based college graduate wrote on Reddit. He gave some information about his background and skills, writing: “I’m a 2023 graduate with a B.E. in Information Science and Engineering, and I’m currently struggling to land a job. “I specialize in Java, Python, DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning and have experience working with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and API development.” The Bengaluru man explained that since graduating from college, he had been unable to land a full-time job. However, he did work as an intern at two companies. Both internships lasted a month each. “At this point, I’m willing to work remotely for free to gain experience and prove my skills. If anyone knows of any opportunities—internships, freelance gigs, or even open-source projects—please reach out. I’m desperate but eager to contribute and learn,” he said. Burn my resume but please help.

Some asked him to rework his CV and highlight his experience more. Others asked him to reach out over email for possible openings. The Reddit post has grabbed attention amid a slump in the once-booming tech sector. The tech industry has recently faced significant challenges, leading to a notable reduction in hiring and employment opportunities. This downturn is influenced by various factors, including global economic uncertainties, shifts in client spending, and the integration of automation and artificial intelligence. As a result, many companies have scaled back recruitment efforts, particularly affecting entry-level positions and fresh graduates. This trend has reshaped the employment landscape within the tech sector, prompting both employers and job seekers to adapt to the evolving market conditions.

""Maybe we can go figure out how to get good at semiconductor fab again, get good at robotic factories, to make data centers again, get good at building new energy,"" he said. Altman is part of a group of tech leaders who have significantly softened their stance on Trump. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Nine years ago, Altman publicly criticized Trump for promoting ""casual racism, misogyny, and conspiracy theories."" However, last month, Altman officially declared he had ""changed his perspective"" on the U.S. president. In a post on X, he said: “Watching @potus more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him. I wish I had done more of my own thinking and definitely fell into the npc [non-playable character] trap. I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!” Representatives for Altman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune. Silicon Valley's shift to the right The tech sector has traditionally leaned left, but years of frustration around the Democrats' approach to the industry appear to have prompted some major figures to switch allegiances. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Many leading CEOs, including Altman, have publicly embraced Trump and his VP, JD Vance, a former Silicon Valley VC. The U.S. president was flanked by some of the industry's most influential people in the industry during his January inauguration. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, and Sam Altman appeared alongside ""first buddy"" Elon Musk. In some cases, the tech sector's shift to the right has gone beyond politics and begun to infiltrate some of the leading tech companies' culture and products—most notably at Meta , where Zuckerberg has announced plans to scrap third-party fact-checkers, scale back DEI initiatives, and reintroduce "" masculine energy."" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The reforms have been largely seen as an attempt to improve ties with the Trump administration. Tech leaders have also made appearances inside the White House. Musk, one of Trump's main cheerleaders during his presidential campaign, has been given a major role in the new administration's mission to cut costs and revamp the federal government. The Tesla CEO's Department of Government Eficiency (DOGE) team has been tearing through government agencies and, in some cases, gaining access to classified information. Altman has also been seen in the White House. The CEO met with Trump to announce the OpenAI- and SoftBank-backed Stargate, an AI infrastructure project, on Trump's first full day in office.

Musk's move came as privately held OpenAI appeared close to getting more funding from Japan's SoftBank. Microsoft stock wavered amid the developments. A consortium of investors led by Elon Musk is offering $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report. OpenAI's board of directors, which has been in flux, would mull the offer. OpenAI last week was finalizing a deal with SoftBank, according to reports. SoftBank would invest $40 billion in OpenAI at a $260 billion valuation. Tesla ( TSLA ) founder Musk, an advisor to President Donald Trump, has had a long-running legal dispute with OpenAI. Musk has filed a federal lawsuit aiming to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company. Musk left the OpenAI board in 2018. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman told CNBC that Musk aims to ""slow down a competitor"" with the $97.4 billion offer. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been the biggest investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has provided over $13 billion in funding to OpenAI. But SoftBank could be OpenAI's new sugar daddy in a new funding round. Microsoft Stock: OpenAI Relationship Meanwhile, Microsoft recently has moved away from being the exclusive provider of cloud computing infrastructure to OpenAI, which has turned to Oracle ( ORCL ), Coreweave and others. OpenAI recently raised $6.6 billion in new funding, valuing the startup at $157 billion. New investors included SoftBank and Nvidia ( NVDA ). Also, OpenAI said it plans to create a Delaware public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups are scrambling for cash infusions from well-capitalized tech industry giants in order to continue operating. OpenAI released generative AI-based ChatGPT in late 2022 and has been adding new AI models to its family. On the stock market today , Microsoft stock wavered in early trading. Microsoft closed up 0.6% to 412.22 in Monday's regular session. Further, Musk on Monday said he is not interested in buying China-based, social media platform TikTok.

Dominik Bindl/Getty Images Reid Hoffman , the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn , isn’t on board with Silicon Valley’s shift away from fact-checking—an approach most recently adopted by Meta , which last month decided to relax its fact-checking policies in favor of user-driven warnings. “What I’d like to see more from the tech industry is less of a rollback where freedom of speech might mean anti-vax misinformation or other kinds of things,” said Hoffman while speaking at the AI Action Summit in Paris today (Feb. 10).

You can opt out anytime. See all of our newsletters In January, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta’s nine-year-old fact-checking system, which relied in part on third-party organizations, would come to an end . The tech company is instead set to adopt a “community notes” model reminiscent of what is used by Elon Musk ’s X, which relies on users instead of experts to flag misinformation. When asked about Zuckerberg’s recent pivot, Hoffman said, “LinkedIn more reflects my point of view on these things.” The career-focused social networking site, acquired by Microsoft in 2016, maintains a policy banning false and misleading content. Regardless of “however you get to the equivalent of fact-checking,” it’s important to continuously innovate in that direction, said Hoffman. “I think having civil dialogue, and a space for that, is incredibly important,” he added. Reid Hoffman’s Silicon Valley ties Hoffman, who currently has an estimated net worth of $2.6 billion , is deeply interconnected to the tech industry. An early PayPal executive and member of the original “PayPal Mafia,” Hoffman has been a board member at companies like Microsoft, Airbnb and OpenAI , in which he was an early investor. Hoffman has backed dozens of other A.I. startups through the venture capital firm Greylock Partners . In 2022, he co-founded Inflection AI , a company known for its chatbot Pi. Earlier this year, he launched Manas AI, a startup focusing on drug discovery . While his Silicon Valley peers have largely cozied up to the Trump administration, Hoffman, a prominent supporter of Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, has been more reluctant to embrace the new government. That said, he lauded the President’s efforts to support A.I., notably the Stargate project , a $500 billion joint venture among OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle. “It is extremely important for all governments to be in dialogue with the tech industry,” Hoffman said. Collaborations of such scale is necessary given the potential impact of A.I. advancement, which Hoffman called the “cognitive industrial revolution.” In addition to major productivity increases, A.I.’s challenges will include overseeing a societal transition to the new technology, he added. Unlike some tech leaders, however, Hoffman isn’t advocating for a halt in A.I. development but instead believes the right regulation will form as the technology progresses. “Some people say: pause, stop until we can figure out all these possible invisible harms,” said Hoffman. “There are millions and millions of possible negatives, and you don’t get the future you want by just trying to wipe out all the negative ones.”"

The best-performing fund in India in 2024 wasn’t one with exposure to Indian stocks. In fact, it was the Mirae Asset NYSE FANG+ ETF Fund of Fund (FoF), which delivered an astonishing 88% return for the year, earning the top spot among mutual funds. This remarkable performance was driven primarily by the impressive growth of FAANG stocks —Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. However, in response to SEBI's recent directive, Mirae Asset has paused new investments into this fund, leaving many investors wondering how they can continue benefiting from the ongoing FAANG rally. So, what’s next? How can investors keep capturing the momentum of these tech giants? The Continued Appeal of FAANG Stocks When you think of global tech innovation, FAANG stocks are often the first to come to mind. These companies have consistently led the charge in shaping the digital and tech landscape. Despite market fluctuations, FAANG stocks have shown resilience, strong growth, and an uncanny ability to adapt to new trends. Here’s a quick snapshot of their recent performance: Meta (formerly Facebook): In 2024, Meta’s stock surged by an impressive 72%. The company’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse via its Reality Labs division have paid off, boosting investor confidence and positioning Meta as a leading player in the future of tech. Apple: Apple’s stock rose by 36% in 2024, buoyed by the successful launch of the iPhone 15 and its expansion into emerging markets. With a market cap nearing $4 trillion and innovations like the M4 chip in MacBook Airs, Apple shows no signs of slowing down. Live Events Amazon: Amazon’s 48% stock surge in 2024 highlights its continued dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company’s AI-driven services and expansion into international markets have solidified its position as a tech powerhouse. Netflix: With a 92% jump in stock value in 2024, Netflix continues to thrive, largely due to its ad-supported subscription model and rising active users. The company’s moves into live sports and gaming content are expected to fuel further growth in 2025. Alphabet: As the parent company of Google, Alphabet continues to lead in digital advertising and AI. Its Google Cloud division has expanded significantly, and its AI advancements keep it at the forefront of the tech sector. These companies are not just household names; they are integral to the digital infrastructure that powers global economies. As long as they remain leaders in their respective fields, FAANG stocks are likely to continue attracting investor attention. Leveraging FAANG Stocks: Insights for Indian Investors in 2025 The Mirae Asset NYSE FANG+ ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) gained popularity by offering Indian investors exposure to the NYSE FANG+ Index, which tracks 10 major technology and consumer companies, including the FAANG stocks. The fund’s concentrated exposure to these global tech giants, along with the depreciation of the rupee, contributed significantly to its exceptional performance in 2024. What is the FANG+™ Index? The NYSE® FANG+™ Index includes 10 of the most influential technology and media companies, and it is equally weighted to prevent any single company from having too much influence. This structure provides balanced exposure, making it an attractive investment vehicle for those looking to tap into the future of technology. ETMarkets.com Here are the components of the FANG+™ Index (as of January 14, 2025): -NVIDIA: 10.50% -Meta: 10.35% -Alphabet: 10.30% -Broadcom: 10.24% -Amazon: 10.06% -Crowdstrike: 9.94% -ServiceNow: 9.73% -Microsoft: 9.69% -Apple: 9.60% -Netflix: 9.60% This index offers a diverse selection of companies that are at the forefront of the tech revolution, making it a compelling choice for investors. How Indians Can Invest in FAANG Stocks Investing in FAANG stocks directly can be a bit tricky for Indian investors since these companies are listed on US stock exchanges. However, there are several ways to gain exposure to these stocks: 1. Direct Investment in US Stocks Indian investors can directly purchase shares of FAANG companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq. This can be done through platforms like Vested, which facilitate international stock trading for Indian residents. 2. ETFs and Mutual Funds with Global Exposure As demonstrated by Mirae Asset’s NYSE FANG+ ETF FoF, Indian investors can gain exposure to FAANG stocks through ETFs or mutual funds that track global tech stocks. These funds typically track indices like the NYSE FANG+ Index, offering an easy way to access FAANG stocks without needing to buy individual shares. The tracking error in US ETFs tracking these indices is also much lower compared to Indian FoFs investing in US ETFs. While traditional ETFs offer exposure to the FANG+™ Index, leveraged ETFs take things up a notch by amplifying returns (and risks). These ETFs use derivatives to multiply the returns of the underlying index by a set multiple, usually 2x or 3x. Leveraged ETFs are designed for experienced investors who are comfortable with higher volatility and the potential for greater rewards—or losses. Here are some prominent leveraged ETFs that track the FANG+™ Index: - Direxion Daily NYSE FANG+ Bull 2X Shares (FNGU) AUM: $6.60B Expense Ratio: 0.95% 1-Year Return: 50.10% What it is: FNGU is a 2x leveraged ETF designed to double the performance of the FANG+™ Index. If the index increases by 1%, FNGU aims for a 2% return. This product is ideal for traders looking to take advantage of short-term movements in the tech sector. - MicroSectors FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGO) AUM: $417.18M Expense Ratio: 0.95% 1-Year Return: 36.04% What it is: FNGO offers 3x leveraged exposure to the FANG+™ Index, aiming to triple the index's daily performance. It is suited for those with a strong risk appetite who want to capitalize on high volatility. - Direxion Daily NYSE FANG+ Bull 2X Shares (FNGG) AUM: $62.17M Expense Ratio: 0.98% 1-Year Return: 33.72% What it is: FNGG is another 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the FANG+™ Index. It’s a smaller fund but still a powerful way to gain amplified exposure to the index. - MicroSectors FANG+™ Index 2X Leveraged ETN (FNGS) AUM: $403.06M Expense Ratio: 0.58% 1-Year Return: 17.70% What it is: FNGS offers 2x leverage but at a lower expense ratio, providing investors with a more cost-effective way to gain exposure to the FANG+™ Index. - MicroSectors FANG+™ Index -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN (FNGD) AUM: $82.29M Expense Ratio: 0.95% 1-Year Return: -41.61% What it is: FNGD is an inverse leveraged product that gives you the opposite performance of the FANG+™ Index. If the index falls, FNGD rises by three times that amount. Other ETFs for FAANG Exposure In addition to the leveraged ETFs specifically designed for the FANG+™ Index, there are also other ETFs that provide exposure to FAANG stocks and the broader tech sector. These ETFs are more suitable for investors seeking diversified exposure to the tech sector without the amplified risk of leveraged products. Here are some notable ETFs for Indian investors looking to gain exposure to FAANG stocks: - MicroSectors FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGU) 1-Year Return: A staggering 132.89% 3-Year CAGR: 17.80% 5-Year CAGR: 48.13% What it is: FNGU provides triple leveraged exposure to the FANG+™ Index. It’s perfect for investors seeking high-reward potential but should be approached with caution due to its leveraged nature. - Granite Shares 2x Long META Daily ETF (FBL) 1-Year Return: 101.06% What it is: Focused exclusively on Meta, this ETF offers twice the daily performance of Meta's stock. While it offers high growth potential, investors should be mindful of the concentration risk involved. - ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) 1-Year Return: 52.60% 5-Year CAGR: 26.54% What it is: TQQQ offers 3x leveraged exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which includes many tech leaders like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. It’s a popular choice for investors looking for diversified tech exposure with higher risk. - ProShares Ultra QQQ (QLD) 1-Year Return: 39.36% 5-Year CAGR: 26.48% What it is: Offering 2x leverage on the Nasdaq-100, QLD is a slightly less aggressive alternative to TQQQ, making it more suitable for investors who want high exposure to the tech sector but with slightly lower volatility. - First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY) 1-Year Return: 35.53% 5-Year CAGR: 13.33% What it is: SKYY focuses on cloud computing companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking exposure to the growing cloud sector. - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) 1-Year Return: 34.10% 5-Year CAGR: 19.41% What it is: IGM provides exposure to the broader tech sector, including FAANG stocks and other major tech leaders. It’s ideal for investors looking to diversify within the tech space. If you're looking to invest in FAANG stocks or ETFs tracking the FANG+™ Index, buying them directly through a US broker can help reduce tracking error and lower the expense ratio compared to investing through Indian mutual funds. With SEBI restricting fresh inflows into certain international mutual funds, direct investments provide a more efficient way to gain exposure to global tech without the added costs of intermediaries. Key Takeaways Investing in FAANG-focused ETFs provides a straightforward way to ride the tech wave. However, these investments come with varying levels of risk depending on their leverage and focus. Leveraged ETFs like FNGU and TQQQ can deliver extraordinary returns, but they also amplify losses during downturns. More diversified options like SKYY and IGM offer steadier growth, though they may lag during bull markets. Diversification is Crucial While FAANG stocks and related ETFs are attractive for their growth potential, they should be part of a diversified portfolio. Over-concentration in tech stocks can expose investors to heightened risks, particularly during market corrections. Diversifying across sectors, geographies, and asset classes can help mitigate these risks and ensure sustainable portfolio growth. In conclusion, FAANG stocks and their corresponding ETFs remain a compelling investment avenue for 2025. By understanding the nuances of these funds and aligning them with your risk tolerance and financial goals, you can make the most of this ongoing growth story.

DeepSeek has shown that AI innovation is not limited to big tech players with billion-dollar budgets, and as models get better, expect to see more flux, say industry experts. CNA's weekly news podcast takes a deep dive into issues that people talk about at dining tables and along the office corridors. Hosted by Steven Chia and Crispina Robert.

Why was there a big reaction to DeepSeek and what are the implications for Singapore? Dr Leslie Teo, senior director of AI products at AI Singapore and Jianggan Li, founder and CEO of venture outfit Momentum Works break it down for Steven Chia and Crispina Robert. (From left) Deep Dive hosts Crispina Robert and Steven Chia with guests Jianggan Li and Dr Leslie Teo. (Photo: CNA/Tiffany Ang) Here is an excerpt of the conversation: Crispina Robert, host: We can't talk about this without talking about how it will impact us, right? In terms of jobs, professionally, for example, we're all deep into this. Every company I know is experimenting: How is it making your work more efficient? How can you do things better? And some people are saying it's even displacing some very junior-level jobs which ChatGPT can do. How worried are you on a scale of one to 10 (about the potential impact of AI on jobs)? Jianggan Li, founder of Momentum Works: Two. Dr Leslie Teo, senior director at AI Singapore: I'm at 10. Steven Chia, host: Okay, now tell us why? Jianggan: I think Leslie kind of answered my question, right? Because if you have people like Leslie who worry at the level of 10, then I don't have to worry. Crispina: (But) you're optimistic that humans will adapt? Jianggan: I'm optimistic for the long term. I'm a little bit cautious about the short term, because I (did) see that when ChatGPT came out, when Midjourney came out, I (did) see (that) ... gaming studios started laying off people because graphic design and certain functions, they could do it more efficiently, and they (needed) fewer people. And we can always say that, okay, the skills can be retained. I mean, you open new opportunities, but there's always a gap between the time that jobs get displaced versus the time that new jobs get created, and it's painful for people. Especially people who have been trained as (specialists). Steven: But you're still confident that, overall, humans will prevail. Jianggan: I'm kind of a technology optimist. I look at global warming. I don't like it, but I'm not terribly worried about it. I'm hoping that someone (will) find the technology to solve it. Leslie: Technology is generally a positive thing. Economists are really positive about it, but this speed is very fast, so it's a timing problem. For me, it's good to be at 10, because I want to make sure the technology is used for human good. Policymakers will say AI is to augment not replace. Unfortunately, the profit motive is: ""What are you talking about?"" Let's be truthful about this – it's to replace. And this is happening so fast, right? I am worried we can't absorb this actually. So it's better to be more alarmist in that situation. Crispina: So in other words ... we'll be forced to figure out how to protect ... the transition (to using AI more in workplaces) right? Leslie: I think the transition is important. People say the Industrial Revolution was a good thing. Yes, it was, but two generations of workers suffered before the good thing happened. Find more episodes of Deep Dive here .

At the same time, the broader Hang Seng Index climbed about 6%. According to Bloomberg data, the 30 companies in the Hang Seng Tech Index had an average price-to-earnings ratio of 20.5 times. In comparison, the Mag. 7 giants— Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )—traded at an average of 41.4 times. Alibaba’s stock price doubled during the same period after its cloud computing division integrated DeepSeek’s AI model into its offerings. At the same time, Xiaomi’s market value surpassed HK$1 trillion ($128.4 billion). Investors also made significant investments in Shenzhen-based data service provider Merit Interactive, leading to a 20% daily-limit increase since China’s onshore markets reopened after the Lunar New Year holiday, reported the South China Morning Post on Thursday. This rebound may indicate a change in the sentiment of the tech sector, which has been impacted by weak spending and increased scrutiny of fintech practices over the past four years. Some investors think the current rise in Chinese tech stocks could persist, driven by their attractive valuations and innovation, even with ongoing U.S. restrictions. ""Chinese equities, and especially technology companies, are priced at a steep discount compared to their American counterparts,"" a strategist at US money manager Invesco, David Chao, told the publication. ""Similar to the AI development gap narrowing, so too is the [stock] valuation gap."" SEE ALSO : Cathie Wood Sells Palantir Shares As Rally Cools Down, Ark Invest Also Dumps Nearly $7 Million Worth Of Robinhood Stock Why It Matters : The surge in Chinese tech stocks comes in the wake of concerns raised by billionaire Ray Dalio about valuation dynamics in the tech sector , particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and global economic shifts. Dalio’s comments were made as companies like DeepSeek began to make significant waves in the tech sector. Moreover, Warren Buffett has been reportedly reducing his holdings in growth-focused tech stocks in search of better valuations in other sectors. Furthermore, a recent Benzinga reader poll questioned the valuations of artificial intelligence companies with the surge of interest in DeepSeek, hinting at potential impacts on the ‘Magnificent Seven stocks. Even President Donald Trump describes the rise of DeepSeek as a “wake-up call” in light of concerns over the long-term viability of the Western artificial intelligence boom. On the day of the launch of the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, NASDAQ dropped 3%, while Nvidia stock plummeted 17% on a single day, marking the biggest fall in U.S. stock market history.

As first reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Bay Area tech titan is eliminating its goal to hire more employees from historically underrepresented groups. Google, according to the WSJ , is also “reviewing some diversity, equity and inclusion programs.” “In an email to employees Wednesday,” the WSJ said, “Google said it would no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Workday layoffs: Company to cut 1,750 jobs A Google spokesperson confirmed to KRON4 that the search giant had told employees it was reevaluating certain programs and initiatives and that it was doing away with aspirational hiring goals based on representation. “We’re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we’ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ve updated our 10-k language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.” Initially, Google set a hiring goal to raise its proportion of leadership by underrepresented groups back in the summer of 2020, during the height of the George Floyd protests, targeting a 30% increase by 2025.

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Senators Advance Bill Banning Children From Social Media by Wendy Davis , February 5, 2025 The Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday approved a controversial bill that would prohibit social media platforms from allowing children under 13 to create accounts, and prohibit platforms from algorithmically recommending content to teens under 18. The Kids Off Social Media Act, introduced last week by Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), and Katie Britt (R-Alabama), also would require schools to limit social media use on their networks as a condition of receiving broadband funds. The bill's sponsors stated the bill would help “protect kids from the harmful impacts of social media,” and “stop taxpayers from funding tools that allow kids to doomscroll in their classrooms.” advertisement advertisement Sponsors also contend t here is “a strong relationship between social media use and poor mental health, especially among children.” But critics argue the measure would violate the First Amendment and could, counterproductively, expose young users to harassment. “Algorithmically curated feeds can protect users from harassment and cyberbullying,” the tech industry funded Chamber of Progress says in a letter to Schatz. “Content curation allows platforms to downrank or even remove unwanted interactions like coordinated racial or gender-based harassment,” the letter continues. Digital rights groups including the Center for Democracy & Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union, said in a letter to Cruz and Cantwell -- chair and ranking member of the Commerce Committee -- that the measure would violate the First Amendment. “All U.S. residents, including minors, have First Amendment rights to access information and express themselves,” the organiations said. “Banning kids from creating an account, including ones with appropriate safeguards, would cut them off from online expression, political engagement, news and even essential educational resources on platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, and GroupMe.” The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act already prohibits operators of websites and apps from knowingly collecting data from users under 13, without parental consent, but doesn't require companies to ban those users. Lawmakers in California and New York have passed laws restricting platforms from recommending content to minors, but those statutes might not survive court challenges. The tech industry group NetChoice recently sued to strike down the California law, arguing it violates teens' First Amendment right to receive information and web publishers' right to curate posts. A federal appellate court has temporarily blocked enforcement of that law. children , digital , facebook , instagram , policy , politics , social media , teens , youtube Comment Next story loading advertisement More from MediaDailyNews Cox Presses SCOTUS To Throw Out Piracy Verdict Roblox Expands Creator Access To IP-Licensed Game Creation Meta's AI Goal: Commits To Spending $600B On U.S. Projects By 2028 Amazon Fights Prime Video User Bid To Revive Privacy Suit Amazon Reboots Ads System, Agents For Advertising SPONSOR CONTENT Join QSR Marketers in Santa Barbara!

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Google has removed ethics guidelines that previously barred its artificial intelligence systems from being used in weapons and surveillance. As recently as January 30, the tech giant said its AI wouldn’t be used for weapons, surveillance, and other technologies that “cause or are likely to cause overall harm”. The Independent has contacted Google for comment. In a blog post Tuesday from senior company officials involved in AI, the company argued there’s “a global competition taking place for AI leadership within an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights,” the post reads. “And we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.” In 2018, the company banned the use of its AI in weapons , after it faced internal protests over a Defense Department contract to use Google tech to analyze drone video. Google faced employee protests over its past work for Pentagon analyzing drone videos (AP) The reported changes at Google align with a larger shift underway in the tech industry, which is showing increasing willingness to partner with U.S. defense and surveillance authorities, at the same time as many tech leaders like Elon Musk are shifting rightward politically . In December, ChatGPT maker OpenAI announced a partnership with fellow tech company Anduril to develop technology for use in military defense against drones. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement OpenAI had previously barred its technology from military use but changed its policies last year allow some collaborations. OpenAI told The Wall Street Journal in a statement the technology developed with Anduril will only be used in defensive applications, and CEO Sam Altman said his company seeks to “ensure the technology upholds democratic values.” Another major AI company, Anthropic, has a collaboration with tech company Palantir and Amazon Web Services to serve defense agencies. And Palantir, Anduril, OpenAI, Saronic, and Scale AI are reportedly in talks with Musk’s aerospace firm SpaceX to form a consortium to bid on prime Pentagon contracts, in an attempt to challenge legacy contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Marin. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Despite its past alignment with Democratic candidates, the tech industry has made a concerted effort to work with the new administration , with tech companies lavishing Trump’s inaugural fund with million-dollar donations, and the CEOs of Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Google attending the swearing-in ceremony last month. No one represents this shift more than Musk, who bucked his past support for Democrats and spent more than $290 million backing Trump and is now exercising unprecedented influence over the federal government’s spending priorities through his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency initiative, raising ethics alarms given the millions of dollars of contracts his companies have with the federal government. The tech industry argues closer collaboration with the defense establishment is necessary given China’s rapid advances in AI, including the launch of DeepSeek , an AI assistant from a Chinese company that matches up against its U.S. competitors but was developed for a fraction of the cost, sending U.S. stocks tumbling.

Companies in export-oriented sectors such as textiles, home appliances, electronics and chemicals could take a beating, they added. Investors may prefer to sit on the sidelines as they wait for the outcome of a call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, as the world’s two largest economies seek to avert a full-blown trade war. “Technology firms will be greeted with fanfare by investors because of the emergence of DeepSeek, but a rally in tech stocks will not be enough to ensure a roaring start for the overall market after the holiday,” said Ivan Li, a fund manager at Loyal Wealth Management in Shanghai, on Tuesday. 01:18 Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Trump: Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s strong showing a ‘wake-up call’ for US tech sector Last month, the Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released two powerful new large language models built at a fraction of the cost and computing power used by American firms.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The US and Ukraine appear to have settled on a way to keep American military aid flowing to the nation—Ukraine will provide rare earth minerals vital to the high-tech industry. Trump: ""We're telling Ukraine they have very valuable rare earths,"" Trump said Monday. ""We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earths and other things."" Ukraine: It welcomes the deal, reports the Washington Post . In fact, President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed the idea to Trump when the two met in November ahead of the election, according to the newspaper. Russia not thrilled: Not surprisingly, a Kremlin spokesperson criticized the plan, saying it would be better if the US provided no aid whatsoever to Ukraine. ""If we call things as they are, this is a proposal to buy help—in other words, not to give it unconditionally, or for some other reasons, but specifically to provide it on a commercial basis,"" said Dmitry Peskov, per Reuters . (The Post story points out that Ukraine officials figured a businesslike idea like this would appeal to Trump.) Rare earths: It appears that Trump isn't using a strict definition of rare earths, ""a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion for electric vehicles, cellphones, and other electronics,"" per Reuters. Trump may be more interested in minerals such as lithium, titanium, and uranium, which aren't rare earth metals. Read These Next Merchants could slap new surcharges on certain credit card purchases.

Salesforce (CRM) stands out with an impressive rise of 2.01%, indicating investor confidence in software solutions. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) leads in software - infrastructure, increasing by 0.78%. These gains suggest a strategic consolidation within tech, driven by software growth. 📉 Semiconductor Sector: Subdued Performance In contrast, the semiconductor sector sees lackluster movements. Nvidia (NVDA) inches up by 0.38%, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shows a stronger uptick of 1.84%. Overall, semiconductors struggle to generate momentum, reflecting cautious investor sentiment towards hardware manufacturing. 💼 Financial Sector: Mixed Reactions The financial sector shows varied outcomes. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lifts the mood with a 0.70% gain. However, significant declines such as PayPal (PYPL), down by 7.63%, weigh heavily on the sector. The mixed financial sector performance could be indicative of broader market volatility and interest rate speculations. 🩺 Healthcare Sector: Notable Declines The healthcare sector faces challenges, with Merck (MRK) taking a sharp downturn of 10.41%. Diversified drug manufacturers like AbbVie (ABBV) also drop by 1.02%, contributing to a sector-wide bearish sentiment potentially linked to regulatory or earnings concerns. 🚀 Overall Market Analysis Despite mixed signals, the tech sector, particularly software stocks, shows pockets of strength, offering investors potential long-term growth opportunities. The semiconductor sector's subdued performance calls for caution, possibly affecting related tech stocks. Investor focus might shift towards companies demonstrating robust software innovation. Financial stocks mirror broader economic uncertainties, with varying results impacting investment strategies. Health sector downturns highlight potential regulatory influences or negative earnings surprises, necessitating careful monitoring by investors. Investors should keep a close eye on the technology sector's evolving dynamics, particularly in software, and consider adjusting portfolios to leverage these trends. Additionally, the mixed performance in financials underscores the importance of diversification.

Inflation was 3.2% over the same period so that wages are increasing faster than prices are rising, and the average monthly wage has reached a record high. This is a particularly dramatic increase compared with November 2024, when the average wage was only NIS 13,068. However, December is typically considered a strong month in wage data, and November 2024 was considered weak compared with Novembers in previous years. Now, wage data is catching up, creating an especially large gap between the months. This figure also comes after several months of decline in the average wage, when in September 2024 the average wage was NIS 13,505. According to the preliminary figures for December 2024, the number of salaried employees in Israel was 4,059,000 in Israel, up 1.1% from 4,013,000 in November 2024, and substantially higher than the 3,888,000 in December 2023. In the tech sector, where the latest data refers to November 2024, the average monthly wage was NIS 29,736, up just 1% from November 2023, below the inflation rate of 3.4% over this period. It is possible that wages in the tech sector were also unusually low in November and rose sharply in December, as with the average wage in the economy, so that next month will see an increase here too. The number of salaried jobs in the tech industry increased by 1.1% during that period, and as of November there were 395,300 tech jobs in Israel, which was about 10% of all jobs in the economy that month.

DeepSeek shakes the US tech industry The Chinese AI model DeepSeek has shaken the US tech industry after the launch of its R1 model. This model is cost-effective and much faster than various AI models available in the US. DeepSeek provides access to the technology at a fraction of the cost, creating pressure on other AI companies to improve their models and reduce prices. AI war between China and US This has sparked an AI war between China and the US. It became the most downloaded app within a month of its launch in the US. Moreover, it led to a crash in the benchmark Nasdaq index, and Nvidia’s stock also saw a significant decline in price. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump met with the CEO of Nvidia on Friday and announced a new project to invest up to $500 billion in building AI infrastructure.

In particular, he is threatening to place tariffs on chips made by TSMC, the world’s largest chip manufacturer. “In the very near future, we’re going to be placing tariffs on foreign production of computer chips, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals to return production of these essential goods to the United States,” Trump said in a speech to Republicans last week. “They left us and went to Taiwan and we want them to come back,” Trump stated. But in many cases, TSMC’s largest customers never made their own chips in the first place, most notably Nvidia and Apple. TSMC is building a factory in Arizona, but that factory will take time to complete and will not use TSMC’s most cutting-edge manufacturing process. Its best manufacturing equipment will remain in Taiwan. The impact of tariffs on the industry would be negative, experts say “The tech industry is a global industry, and as we saw during Trump’s first term, if you place restrictions on any part of the value chain, you impact the entire value chain in one way or another. Between Trump’s threats and [Xi Jinping, China’s president] threats [referring to the restriction of rare earth materials], the tech industry could be in for a very rough ride, not to mention the US and global economies,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst with Tirias Research. The problem with tariffs is that in the end, the tariffed company passes the cost of them along and the customer ultimately pays them. Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategies, said the tariffs would more than likely mean that AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Apple, Broadcom and Marvell costs would increase. “They would attempt to pass that onto their customers like AWS, Microsoft, Google, Dell, HPE, HP, Cisco, Apple, and Lenovo. This would likely lead to in a price increase of the end product,” he said. Moorhead thinks there will be ”severe pushback” on the part of TSMC customers and adds that based on how Trump operated in his last term, that there will be a negotiation, and it will go away. “Trump wants more leading-edge chips manufactured in the US. The goal is to add jobs and tax revenue and also limit risk of a possible Taiwan invasion by China. Diversified supply chains are smart and motivating TSMC to invest in more US manufacturing via tariffs could be effective. I do believe that Intel will see a lot of business from this as they are making the biggest US investments,” he said. Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst with TECHnalysis, echoes this sentiment. “Because of this massive negative impact, I seriously doubt that the Trump administration would really enforce these. Instead, I hope we’ll see encouragements to build more chips in the US, but that’s a multi-year process,” he said.

CEOs were asked about its significance on earnings calls, and OpenAI's Sam Altman addressed the matter on X and at a public speaking event. ""We have to run harder, run faster, have an all-country effort,"" Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC, in an interview that aired on Friday. Dado Ruvic | Reuters Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella commented on its ""real innovations."" OpenAI's Sam Altman described it as ""clearly a great model."" Apple CEO Tim Cook said ""innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing."" And Palantir's Alex Karp said it shows the importance of ""an all-country effort."" The tech CEOs were all talking about China's DeepSeek, which burst out of obscurity and into the center of the tech universe this week. In the past few days, those execs and many of their peers have addressed questions about the startup lab's new artificial intelligence model, which has stunned experts and was reportedly much more cost effective to create than competitive models in the U.S. DeepSeek's mobile app shot up to the top of the charts on Apple's App Store early in the week and remained in the lead spot as of Friday, ahead of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reports that its new R1 model, which rivals OpenAI's o1, cost just $6 million to create sent shares of chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom down 17% on Monday, wiping out a combined $800 billion in market cap. The timing was stark. DeepSeek's rollout landed just as tech earnings season was about to begin, with Meta , Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all reporting between Wednesday and Thursday, and a week into President Donald Trump's second term in office. Trump has emphasized the importance of the U.S. winning in AI, particularly against China, and in his first week back in the White House announced a project called Stargate that calls on OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to invest billions dollars to boost domestic AI infrastructure. Read more CNBC reporting on AI This Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centers AI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us' Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague' Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’ There's been plenty of debate online about the significance of DeepSeek's rollout and whether the financial achievement is real. A new report from research firm SemiAnalysis estimated DeepSeek's costs at ""well higher than $500M over the company history."" But it was an inescapable topic this week across the industry. AI is every company's focus right now, particularly in technology, where industry leaders are spending tens of billions of dollars building out data centers and buying advanced chips to develop more powerful models. For leaders of U.S. tech companies, the unifying aspect is the need to beat chief adversary China in the defining technology of the future. ""Technology is not inherently good,"" and could pose threats in the wrong hands, Karp, the CEO of Palantir, told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview that aired Friday. ""We have to acknowledge that, but that also just means we have to run harder, run faster, have an all-country effort."" Cook was asked by an analyst on Apple's earnings call if the DeepSeek developments had changed his views on the company's margins and the potential for computing costs to come down. Cook, whose company had just reported a record gross margin , offered a vague response. ""In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,"" he said. ""And, you know, that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well."" A day earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that the overall situation is nuanced and that early reports and results from a single model don't fundamentally change the equation. Meta said last week that it would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025 to expand its computing infrastructure related to artificial intelligence. ""It's probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around infrastructure and capex,"" Zuckerberg said about DeepSeek, on his company's fourth-quarter earnings call . ""There are a bunch of trends that are happening here all at once."" 'Bending the curve' On Microsoft's call , Nadella said in his introductory remarks that people who want to run DeepSeek R1 will ""soon be able to"" on the company's Copilot+ PCs and on graphics processing units (GPUs) on Windows. Later on the call, Nadella was asked by an analyst if we're ""seeing AI scale now at lower cost."" ""What's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle,"" Nadella responded, adding that ""it's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve."" He said DeepSeek is showing some ""real innovations,"" and that OpenAI, which Microsoft backs, is seeing similar improvements. Ultimately, he said, ""it all gets commoditized,"" with customers as the major beneficiaries. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, an early investor in OpenAI and a Microsoft board member who also co-founded Inflection AI, told CNBC that this is no time to panic. Hoffman unveiled his latest AI startup this week, called Manas AI, backed by almost $25 million, with a mission to try and accelerate the drug discovery process. watch now VIDEO 6:12 06:12 LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman: DeepSeek AI proves this is now a 'game-on competition' with China Squawk Box Hoffman said that while DeepSeek might encourage American companies to pick up the pace and share their plans sooner, the new revelations don't suggest that large models are a bad investment. ""The competition game is on,"" he said. ""But I don't think it's the 'Oh my God, we're losing!' as American technology."" OpenAI is perhaps the most direct competitor, and CEO Altman called R1 ""clearly a great model"" at an event in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. He also echoed sentiment expressed by President Trump, who said that DeepSeek should be a ""wake-up call"" to U.S. tech. ""This is a reminder of the level of competition and the need for democratic AI to win,"" Altman said. ""This is a strong model and I think it's a reminder also of the level of interest in reasoning, the level of interest in open source."" Earlier in the week, Altman took to X to assert OpenAI's intentions to keep pushing forward. ""We will obviously deliver much better models,"" he wrote in a post on Jan. 27. ""And also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!"" — CNBCs Jordan Novet, Hayden Field, Kif Leswing, Ashley Capoot and Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.

In the U.S. alone, 267 companies reduced their workforce with a combined 157,950 job losses. As new rounds of mass layoffs at major technology companies are being announced in 2025, a new latest report examines the workforce reductions that occurred around the world in 2024. The report has discovered at least 11,000 employees in the technology sector have lost their jobs since the beginning of the year . The analysis comes from the firm RationalFX , who aggregated layoff announcements sourced from U.S. WARN notices, the job portal TrueUp, TechCrunch and the Layoffs.fyi layoff tracker for the entirety of 2024. The report also looked into the latest layoffs since the beginning of January 2025, focusing on companies in the technology sector. According to the research, at least 280,991 employees in tech companies were laid off last year, while January brought another 11,299 job reductions from major companies, including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. The tech company with the most significant layoffs in 2024 was U.S. PC maker Dell, which reduced its headcount by 18,500, followed by Intel (15,100 layoffs), and Amazon (14,968 layoffs). The electric vehicle (EV) sector also experienced layoffs, despite its growth potential. Industry leader Tesla laid off 14,000 employees as it sought to reduce operational costs amid increasing production expenses. Together, the 21 companies with the largest layoffs in 2024 announced a total of 156,654 job reductions. The wave of layoffs continues as companies focus on cutting costs, downsizing, and streamlining operations following significant hiring sprees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investments in artificial intelligence have also pushed the number of layoffs high as simpler, repetitive tasks are assigned to AI systems, while human workers are either transferred to other departments or laid off. U.S. dominates layoff patterns More than half of all layoffs in the tech sector were initiated by U.S.-based companies (157,950 or 56.21% of all), followed by 19,495 job cuts in German companies, 14,740 layoffs in South Korean firms, 14,675 layoffs in Chinese ones, and 12,608 job cuts in companies based in Japan. Anotherfactor in Germany has been the economic stagnation with 2024 being the second year in a row of contraction in the economy. Returning to North America, California is the U.S. state with the most tech sector layoffs, accounting for 40.4% of all job cuts in the U.S. and roughly 22.7% of all tech layoffs in the world. In 2024, 126 California-based tech firms laid off a combined 63,791 employees.

User Score Be the first to review this phone Add Review In our rating, the Moto G (2025) scores a bit below the competition. The software update situation brings it down the most, but it also loses in display quality. The photo and video quality are two other areas that are not on par with rivals. On the other hand, its battery life outclasses the average score for this price tier and its design also beats the competition.

Moto G (2025) Specs Let's kick this off with an overview of the Moto G (2025) specs : Moto G (2025) Moto G 5G (2024) Size and Weight 167 x 76.3 x 8.2 mm 193 g Size and Weight 164.4 x 75 x 8.2 mm 194 g Display 6.7-inch LCD 120Hz 720p Display 6.6-inch LCD 120Hz 720 x 1612 px Processor MediaTek Dimensity 6300 (6nm) Processor Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 (6nm) Cameras 50 MP, f/1.8 main 2 MP macro 16 MP front Cameras 50 MP, f/1.8 main 2 MP macro 8 MP front Battery Size 5,000 mAh Battery Size 5,000 mAh Charging Speeds 30W wired Charging Speeds 18W wired Prices 4/64GB 4/128GB Prices 4/128GB for $200 Moto G (2025) Design and Display Soft vegan leather and a bigger screen One thing this new Moto G has going for itself is the look. The vegan leather back is soft to the touch and pleasant, and the phone feels solidly constructed. It comes in just one color, but a rather universal one — forest gray. Overall, it is on the larger side, with a bigger screen than before, growing to a 6.7-inch display, up from a 6.6-inch one on the outgoing model. That has resulted in a slight increase of the physical size too — the phone is a bit taller and wider, but the thickness (8.2mm) and weight (193 g) remain unchanged. You have your physical buttons on the right side. The power button doubles as a fingerprint reader, and above it you have two separate volume keys. It's nice to see a 3.5mm headphone jack, that's one thing that rival Galaxy A16 5G lacks. The unboxing experience, however, is barebones with just a cable, a SIM tool and some manuals included in the box. Our big letdown is that Motorola sticks with an LCD screen for the new Moto G. The older LCD technology does not give you the deep contrast or vibrant colors of AMOLED, and you get all of that on the Galaxy A16 5G. Adding insult to injury, the screen resolution is only 720p, so the display is not as crisp as you might hope.

The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x:CIE31' and 'y:CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal. These measurements are made using Portrait Displays' CalMAN calibration software. Motorola Moto G(2025) Samsung Galaxy A16 5G The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values. The first line holds the measured (actual) colors, while the second line holds the reference (target) colors. The closer the actual colors are to the target ones, the better. These measurements are made using Portrait Displays' CalMAN calibration software. Motorola Moto G(2025) Samsung Galaxy A16 5G The Grayscale accuracy chart shows whether a display has a correct white balance(balance between red,green and blue)across different levels of grey(from dark to bright).The closer the Actual colors are to the Target ones,the better. These measurements are made using Portrait Displays' CalMAN calibration software. Motorola Moto G (2025) Samsung Galaxy A16 5G View all On the positive side, the new Moto G supports 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling around feels smooth (when the processor doesn't lag that is). Moto G (2025) Camera A main camera coupled with a much less useful 2MP macro camera The new Moto G has the same rear cameras as before: a 50MP, f/1.8 main snapper coupled with a barely useful 2MP macro camera. No ultra-wide camera or a telephoto one is present. Receive the latest mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . The only upgrade is a new 16MP front camera. Moto G (2025) Camera Photo Samples So how do photos look in real life? Like most phones, the main camera captures pixel-binned photos in a 12.5-megapixel resolution by default. You get a decent amount of detail and colors look quite natural and pleasing during the day. Nothing extraordinary here, but nothing too bad either. White balance is mostly good, but we did notice a couple of images turned out a bit underexposed. You can also capture Portrait mode photos, but only at 1X, and we usually prefer having a 2X option for portraits as it looks more flattering. We are not in love with the 2 MP macro camera, though. While we appreciate having the option to capture macro photos, the resolution is too low and we wish images were more detailed. It's also disappointing not having an ultra-wide camera on board. Video Quality The new Moto G records 1080p video with good video stabilization (usually, a weak spot for cheaper phones). The lack of 4K video is expected at this price, so we cannot be too disappointed. You can zoom up 6X, but there is not much detail, so we would recommend not going beyond 3X zoom. Moto G (2025) Performance & Benchmarks Running in place The Moto G (2025) runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset, which is supposed to be an upgrade from the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in the previous generation. However, the change in speed is so tiny, you probably won't even notice it. That's a problem for a $200 phone, where one of the main concerns is the slow, laggy interface. The new Moto G does not seem to improve on that in a meaningful way, so unfortunately you have to get used to its often sluggish performance. The 4 GB of RAM are common in this price range, but it doesn't help the cause. CPU Performance: Geekbench 6 Single Higher is better Motorola Moto G(2025) 790 Motorola Moto G 5G(2024) 843 Samsung Galaxy A16 5G 965 Geekbench 6 Multi Higher is better Motorola Moto G(2025) 2067 Motorola Moto G 5G(2024) 1868 Samsung Galaxy A16 5G 1875 View all As you can see, the new Moto G (2025) has barely improved its CPU speeds compared to previous models, and we even see a drop in single-core speeds (but multi-core performance is a bit faster). This is disappointing as the slow CPU is the biggest bottle-neck for cheap phones like this one. GPU / Graphics Performance: 3DMark Extreme(High) Higher is better Motorola Moto G(2025) 384 Motorola Moto G 5G(2024) 311 Samsung Galaxy A16 5G 367 3DMark Extreme(Low) Higher is better Motorola Moto G(2025) 383 Motorola Moto G 5G(2024) 304 Samsung Galaxy A16 5G 360 View all Gaming performance is also mostly the same, which is to say not great at all. Recommended For You Basic games will play fine, but if you like to run Genshin Impact or similar titles that demand more performance, you are in for slow frame rates (if the games run at all). You do get 128 GB of built-in storage, which seems sufficient for most people. Some users might miss not having a 256 GB storage version, but hey, at least you have a microSD card slot, so that's an option. Moto G (2025) Software The phone runs on Android 15 , the latest version of Google's software, so that's good to see. You have your usual Motorola tricks like the chop-chop gesture to start the camera, and those are nice little touches. Otherwise, it's a lightweight interface with only a few Motorola widgets added on top, and we like it this way. Don't hold your breath for many software updates here. Motorola only promises two years of OS updates and three years of security updates. This is much shorter than the four years of Android updates and five years of security updates that you get with the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G. Moto G (2025) Battery The Moto G features a 5,000 mAh battery, same as the previous model. This ensures solid battery life and with the frugal chip, you can expect more than a day's worth of use.

Overall, we estimate that you can get an average of 8 hours and 15 minutes of total screen time, quite a bit above the average phone. Motorola has also bumped the charging speeds to 30 W, which is a nice upgrade. There is no wireless charging on board, but we don't really expect it from a $200 phone. Moto G (2025) Audio Quality and Haptics You get stereo speakers on this new Moto G and the quality is decent. The phone gets quite loud and the sound is not too muddy. The haptics (aka the vibration motor) are typical of these cheaper phones: they are a bit ""buzzy"" and not as tight as on flagship phones. Should you buy it? The Moto G (2025) is not exactly an inspiring phone and we are let down by Motorola's slow progress with the series. At $200, it's a cheap phone, there is no denying that, but we feel that rivals like the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G give you more bang for the buck. The Galaxy has a more vibrant screen, longer software support, and a slightly better camera, all while having roughly the same performance. Motorola is relying more on its brand name with the Moto G and its software tricks and solid battery life. The phone will get the job done for basic tasks, so we cannot recommend against it entirely. You should consider it if you find a great deal, knocking the price further down, but ultimately, the Galaxy A16 5G seems like the more sensible option.

Themed “Innovating for Impact: Bridging the Gap Between Tech and Industry,” the event featured three expert panelists from Enterprise Computing Ltd. (ECL), each delivering thought-provoking talks on key aspects of the tech industry. Kicking off the session, Marius Kuyipua, Infrastructure Manager at ECL, discussed strategies for building scalable, secure, and efficient IT infrastructures. His presentation delved into strategies for achieving scalability, security, and efficiency in IT systems, backed by real-world examples from his career. Marius emphasized the importance of aligning IT strategies with overarching business goals, while also staying ahead of emerging threats in the digital space. Building on the momentum, Steven Nnuro, ECL’s seasoned software developer, delivered a compelling presentation on the phases of software development. Recalling his first project—a car hailing app —he highlighted the importance of having a proper project structure and shared practical frameworks to help developers turn ideas into functional solutions. Rounding out the panel, Frank Asamoah, Automation Manager, explored automation trends such as AI-powered processes and robotics. He reframed automation as an enabler of innovation rather than a disruptor, encouraging attendees to embrace opportunities in this dynamic field. ""Automation is not about replacing jobs but about amplifying human creativity and innovation,"" he explained. More than just a batch of presentations, the talk was an impactful experience for the attendees, who were predominantly students from Computer Science, Engineering, and IT disciplines. Michael Agyei, Vice President of the Computer Science Society at KNUST, expressed his excitement, saying, “I appreciated the warm approach and punctuality of the ECL team. This experience has given me a better understanding of the diverse roles in the tech industry. As a software developer, I now feel inspired to achieve more and improve my skills significantly.” To end the day, the participants enjoyed a networking session, where they interacted with the panelists and their peers. For ECL, this event solidifies its commitment to nurturing the next generation of tech innovators. By bridging the gap between academia and industry, ECL continues to position itself as a leader in driving impactful conversations and empowering young talents in the tech space.

Nvidia experiences a record one-day market-cap loss of nearly $593 billion, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index to fall 3.1%. DeepSeek’s R1 model, cheaper and more efficient than rivals, sparks debate about the sustainability of AI infrastructure investments in the U.S. Silicon Valley and Wall Street question the future of major AI investments, with some viewing the market selloff as an overreaction. Analysts see the downturn as a buying opportunity, with Nvidia and other chip stocks showing signs of recovery post-selloff. A surge in popularity for the new, cost-effective artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot from Chinese startup DeepSeek prompted a dramatic sell-off in U.S. tech stocks on Monday, with chipmaker Nvidia suffering a record one-day market-cap loss of nearly $593 billion. The free AI assistant from DeepSeek, which launched last week, quickly overtook U.S. rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store, raising concerns about the U.S.’s tech dominance and the future of AI infrastructure investments. DeepSeek's rise and market impact DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, released its latest AI model , R1, last week, claiming it was cheaper and more efficient than similar models from U.S. companies like OpenAI. The model's rapid ascent to the top of Apple's free app downloads chart sent shockwaves through the tech industry, leading to a 17% drop in Nvidia's stock , the largest single-day percentage decline in the company's history. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.1%, with Nvidia being the biggest drag on the index. Other tech giants like Broadcom, which fell 17.4%, and Microsoft, which dropped 2.1%, also felt the impact. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks the performance of semiconductor companies, tumbled 9.2%, its biggest drop since March 2020. Wall Street and Silicon Valley react The sudden rise of DeepSeek has sparked a debate on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley about the sustainability of the current AI investment model. Analysts and investors are questioning whether the massive investments in AI infrastructure, particularly in data centers and high-performance chips, are justified if a cost-effective alternative is available. Marc Andreessen, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, described DeepSeek's R1 model as ""AI’s Sputnik moment,"" drawing a parallel to the Soviet Union's satellite launch that initiated the space race of the 1950s. Andreessen praised the model as a ""profound gift to the world,"" but the market's reaction was less enthusiastic. Some analysts , however, are counseling caution. Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor industry analyst at Bernstein, called the market's reaction ""overblown,"" noting that DeepSeek's advancements, while impressive, are not based on unknown or secret technologies. Rasgon and other analysts argue that the current AI investment landscape is still robust, and that U.S. companies will continue to lead in AI development. long-term outlook and market recovery The immediate impact of DeepSeek's success on the market was significant, but some analysts see the selloff as an opportunity to buy high-quality tech stocks at a discount. Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns almost a million Nvidia shares, views the decline as a ""wakeup call"" but not a long-term threat. Morgan believes the real money in AI is in providing the high-performance chips needed for data centers, a market still dominated by Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. Nvidia's stock showed signs of recovery on Tuesday, rising 2.5% in after-hours trading. The company, in a statement, commended DeepSeek's work as ""an excellent AI advancement"" that leveraged widely-available models, suggesting that the market's concerns may be premature. The broader market also showed signs of stabilization, with some chip stocks, including Broadcom, regaining some of their lost ground. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain as the tech industry grapples with the implications of DeepSeek's success and the potential for a more cost-effective AI future. DeepSeek's rapid rise has undeniably shaken the tech industry, raising questions about the future of AI investments and the U.S.'s global tech dominance. While the immediate market reaction was severe, many analysts believe the selloff was overblown and see the current downturn as an opportunity for investors to buy into high-quality tech stocks at more reasonable valuations. As the dust settles, the tech industry will continue to watch DeepSeek closely, with the potential for a new era of cost-effective AI solutions on the horizon.

(Image credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images) Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek unveiled a new image generator soon after its hit chatbot sent shock waves through the tech industry and stock market. DeepSeek has made headlines for its semi-open-source AI models that rival OpenAI's ChatGPT despite being made at a fraction of the cost. On Monday (Jan. 27), DeepSeek claimed that the latest model of its free Janus image generator, Janus-Pro-7B , beat OpenAI's DALL-E 3 and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion in benchmark tests, Reuters reported. However, Artificial Analysis, which compares the performance of different AI models, has yet to independently rank DeepSeek's Janus-Pro-7B among its competitors. The image generator announcement came at a significant time for DeepSeek and the AI tech industry at large. First, DeepSeek's free AI assistant chatbot overtook ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app in Apple's U.S. App Store. Later that same day, the company announced it was limiting user registrations because of a large-scale cyberattack, though existing users could continue to log in, CNBC reported. The stock market also reacted to DeepSeek's low-cost chatbot stardom on Monday. Leading AI chipmaker Nvidia lost $589 billion in stock market value — the biggest one-day market loss in U.S. history (though the company is still worth trillions of dollars). Related: Scientists propose making AI suffer to see if it's sentient DeepSeek's AI models have taken the tech industry by storm because they use less computing power than typical algorithms and are therefore cheaper to run. The U.S. restricts the number of the best AI computing chips China can import, so DeepSeek's team developed smarter, more-energy-efficient algorithms that aren't as power-hungry as competitors, Live Science previously reported.

As with other image generators, users describe in text what image they want, and the image generator creates it. The model's improvements come from newer training processes, improved data quality and a larger model size, according to a technical report seen by Reuters. DeepSeek fed the model 72 million high-quality synthetic images and balanced them with real-world data, which reportedly allows Janus-Pro-7B to create more visually appealing and stable images than competing image generators. DeepSeek runs ""open-weight"" models, which means users can look at and modify the algorithms, although they don't have access to its training data.

The downturn was triggered by the emergence of a new Chinese Artificial Intelligence (AI) firm, which sent tech shares plunging on Monday, raising concerns about a potential knock-on effect on pensions heavily tied to the sector. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT Nigel Green, CEO of the financial advisory and asset management company deVere Group, warned: “The sharp declines in the S&P 500 and other tech-heavy indices present a significant challenge for UK pension funds, many of which have considerable exposure to US equities - particularly in the tech sector.” The Chinese firm, DeepSeek, claimed to have developed a low-cost AI model for just $6million (£4.8million). This significantly undercuts the billions spent by competitors like OpenAI, which rely on advanced Nvidia computer chips to train its systems. The announcement triggered a dramatic sell-off in US tech stocks, with Nvidia losing 17% of its value. This wiped a staggering $500billion (£473billion) from its market capitalisation, marking the largest single-day loss in Wall Street history. Other tech giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, also suffered sharp declines, amplifying fears of instability in the sector. READ MORE: UK's oldest state pensioners hit with 'hidden £1,000 cost' as millions struggle The emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek rocked US tech giants' stocks on Monday night (Image: Getty) Mr Green said: “The sector has long been a key driver of returns, with pension funds benefiting from the dominance of US giants such as Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT “However, with mounting pressure from new competitors like DeepSeek and broader market uncertainty, these stocks are now facing volatility that could impact long-term pension growth.” UK pension funds are generally diversified to minimise exposure to sector-specific risks, which helps protect against shocks. However, the scale of the impact on tech stocks raises concerns. Nvidia, the market leader in AI chip manufacturing, bore the brunt of the downturn, but the broader tech sector, including the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices, saw declines of 3% and 1.5%, respectively.

Yes, there is likely to be further pricing correction across the wider technology sector, particularly in the US.” Mr Heath urged pension savers to review their portfolios. He said: “Any pension savers that are concerned around recent events in the US stock market should speak with their pension provider or IFA to understand how exposed they are to the technology sector and evaluate their risk profile to this sector given the bull market can’t last forever.” SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Liang had kept an extremely low profile until Jan. 20, when he was one of nine individuals asked to give a speech at a closed-door symposium hosted by China's Premier Li Qiang. He gave two rare media interviews to Chinese media outlet Waves last year and in 2023, but apart from that has stayed mostly out of the public eye. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for an interview. At the symposium, the millennial's youthful appearance contrasted with the grey-haired academics, officials and state-owned conglomerate heads sat around him, pictures and video published by Chinese broadcaster CCTV showed. But the fact Liang was invited to share his opinions on Chinese government policy highlights Beijing's recognition of DeepSeek's role in potentially upending the global AI order, in China's favour. DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant last week that the firm says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of current services, triggering a global selloff in tech stocks. Last year, Baidu CEO Robin Li spoke at a similar symposium chaired by the Chinese premier. Li, who announced China's first ChatGPT rival in March 2023, said in an interview that same year China would never recreate Microsoft-backed OpenAI's success and that Chinese firms should focus on applying existing AI models for commercial purposes. Under Liang's leadership, DeepSeek deliberately avoided app-building. Instead, it concentrated research talent and resources on creating a model that could match, or better OpenAI, and it hopes in the future to continue focusing on cutting-edge models that will be used by other companies to build consumer and enterprise-facing AI products. Liang's approach stood out in a Chinese tech industry that was used to taking innovations from abroad, from smartphone apps to electric vehicles, and quickly scaling them up, often much faster than the countries where the inventions were first made. ""China's AI can't be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between China's AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,"" Liang said in an interview with Waves in July last year. Liang's interviews reveal a belief that China's tech industry had reached a crossroads where it lacked the confidence but not the capital needed to engage in fundamental R&D breakthroughs. Story Continues 'CURIOSITY AND DESIRE TO CREATE' ""In the past thirty years, (China's tech industry) has only emphasized making money, and ignored innovation. Innovation is not solely driven by business, it also needs curiosity and a desire to create,"" he said in July. DeepSeek has taken the decision to make all its models open-source, unlike its U.S. rival OpenAI. In open-source models, the base code is publicly available for any developer to use and modify at will. Liang's interviews reveal he has bought into the open-source culture that U.S. tech insiders previously argued was one reason the U.S.'s Silicon Valley held an edge over its Chinese counterparts. ""Even if OpenAI is closed-source, it cannot stop others from catching up...Open-source is like a cultural practice, rather than a business practice...a company that does this will have soft power."" Liang grew up in the southern province of Guangdong, which during the eighties and nineties led the country in adopting market capitalism. Liang said back then he was surrounded by people who valued starting a business over studying, but he was more academically inclined. He would go on to enrol in the elite Zhejiang University at age 17, majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering before pursuing a master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering, which he completed in 2010. Liang then co-founded a quantitative hedge fund in 2015, which uses complex mathematical algorithms for trading as opposed to human analysis. The fund's portfolio totalled over 100 billion yuan ($13.79 billion) by the end of 2021 but in April 2023, it announced on its WeChat account that it would expand its remit beyond the investment industry and concentrate resources to ""explore the essence of AGI"". DeepSeek was created a month later. OpenAI defines AGI (Artificial general intelligence) as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. DeepSeek's employees are mainly graduates and PhD students from China's top universities, whom Liang believes prefer to work for DeepSeek because it is tackling the biggest challenges in AI. ""What attracts the best talent is obviously the solving of the world's hardest problems,"" he said in July. ""Our goal is still to go for AGI.""

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration ( Reuters: Dado Ruvic/Illustration ) Program: More from PM Transcript Samantha Donovan: The rapid progress of a Chinese artificial intelligence model has caused the biggest fall in the history of the US stock exchange. News that Chinese startup company DeepSeek had developed an AI tool with so-called advanced reasoning skills has seen confidence in the American tech sector plummet, so much so that US computer chip manufacturer NVIDIA had nearly a trillion dollars wiped off the value of its shares on Wall Street. Nadine Haynes has more. Nadine Haynes: It was the news that had Wall Street buzzing. The market leader in computer chips, NVIDIA, lost nearly one trillion Australian dollars when its shares fell by 17%. The cause of this plunge, a Chinese startup has made unexpected progress with its new artificial intelligence tools, sparking a loss of confidence in the US. Toby Walsh: It is the biggest fall in the US stock market in history. Nadine Haynes: Toby Walsh is an AI expert at the University of New South Wales. Toby Walsh: But I think it actually represents good news for the rest of us, which is that it isn't just the US tech giants that are going to be dominating the AI race. It's actually a race that all of us can compete in against. It's not going to stop just with this Chinese firm DeepSeek that has managed to match the best of the West. It demonstrates that all of us can do it. Nadine Haynes: NVIDIA doesn't actually create artificial intelligence, but the computer chips it makes are used by companies that do. What is worrying the US tech industry is the idea that the Chinese startup, which is called DeepSeek, has caught up with the American AI models like ChatGPT. A research paper released last week found DeepSeek's R1 showed advanced reasoning skills, such as the ability to rethink its approach to a math problem, and it appears they've done it at a fraction of the cost. Suelette Dreyfus from the University of Melbourne thinks DeepSeek's R1 measures up pretty well compared with ChatGPT. Suelette Dreyfus: Certainly there's been some report suggesting that in certain areas it would look as though, yes, it does as well. Now maybe ChatGPT might lead on things like conversational AI still, but DeepSeek is reported to be better in sort of specialized applications, providing service to developers who want better customization and it costs less. Nadine Haynes: But Suelette Dreyfus says there's still a long way to go. Suelette Dreyfus: The marketplace has made a decision and that decision was to shed almost $600 billion in NVIDIA's market cap in the biggest one day loss in US history for a company. And that would tend to indicate that the market believes that the Chinese based developers have really made huge advances. Nadine Haynes: Apart from performance, Toby Walsh from the AI Institute at the University of New South Wales points out that one of the biggest differences between DeepSeek's AI model and ChatGPT is financial. Toby Walsh: Probably the biggest difference is the cost that it was to make it. They only spent $6 million apparently to build this. This is an order or even possibly two orders magnitude less than the US had spent on doing it. And it performs just as well, if not slightly better than the best of the West. So really remarkable. Nadine Haynes: The research paper released last week praising the performance of DeepSeek's R1 came on the same day as President Donald Trump's inauguration, and it helped launch a debate in the US as to how to compete with China on AI. Marina Zhang from the Australia China Relations Institute spoke from Beijing about how this AI model came about. Dr Marina Yue Zhang: The core team are Chinese educated top university graduates. So the average age is very, very young. I mean, even the management team is around 35 years old. And to be honest, the culture and the method is more like a Silicon Valley startup rather than the typical Chinese startup. So that's quite surprising. But nevertheless, they demonstrate these results. Two months and a budget of 2% of open AI. I mean, this is just, you know, everybody's talking about this.

It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. One of the North East's most successful tech entrepreneurs has backed a campaign to tackle digital poverty. Paul Callaghan, a serial entrepreneur and philanthropist, is set to speak at the launch of a new fund aimed at helping people from every background explore careers in technology. The event, the North East Tech Charity Dinner, will take place at Wylam Brewery in Newcastle on Thursday, March 13. It will see tech companies and ambassadors from across the region come together to celebrate the launch of the Dynamo North East Digital Inclusion Fund. The fund aims to support initiatives that help people gain confidence in digital technologies and create pathways into employment. Organisations that can directly assist those most affected by these barriers will receive funding. Mr Callaghan said: ""As someone born and raised in the North East, I am delighted to be involved in this initiative. ""We are rightly proud of the growth of the tech sector in this region, which has excellent companies and a fantastic workforce, yet we still have one of the highest rates of poverty and digital exclusion in the UK. ""People face greater inequality and economic disadvantage without access to digital technology and the internet. ""This often harms children and young people's education and career opportunities. ""For older people, it can lead to social isolation and a damaging lack of access to online services."" He added: ""I know how generous the people of this region can be and working collectively as a business community, we can help to address the challenge of digital poverty and change the lives of many people."" Dynamo North East, the region's largest tech cluster, is leading the fund. Dr David Dunn, CEO of Dynamo North East, said: ""We are delighted to have Paul joining us on our mission to help tackle digital poverty in the North East. ""However, while the North East has made great strides in attracting such employment opportunities, digital poverty levels in the region remain at higher-than-average levels, which is why we are calling for people from across the industry – like Paul – to come together and help us tackle this. ""Together, we can narrow the digital divide and ensure that, as new opportunities arise, they are open to people from all backgrounds and communities."" The Community Foundation's recent Vital Signs report on access found that many people in the North East, including those affected by social and economic disadvantages, see digital advances as a barrier in their lives. John Hollingsworth, chief philanthropy officer at The Community Foundation, said: ""It is fantastic to be working with a purpose-driven organisation like Dynamo North East and entrepreneurs such as Paul on this project. ""Our own Vital Signs research tells us that improving digital access is a key priority, particularly because the opportunity our region has in the tech sector is huge and we want more people to benefit. ""This fund is a fantastic initiative, and we would encourage any business in the tech sector to come along to the networking dinner and find out more about how they can get involved.""

A company called DeepSeek said it had developed a large language model that can compete with U.S. AI giants but at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. Nvidia, Broadcom and Google’s parent company Alphabet were among the high-flying stocks that fell to earth, at least for now. The noise in the tech sector obscured some solid gains in other parts of the market. Here’s a look at DeepSeek’s impact on the financial markets, by the numbers: 5.6% Monday’s decline in the S&P 500 tech sector, the biggest drop in the index since September 2020. Nvidia was one of eight stocks in the tech sector to post double-digit losses on the day. The decline for the index would have been worse if not for a gain of more than 3% in shares of Apple. $590 billion The approximate decline in Nvidia’s market value. That decline is more than the combined market value of home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe’s. Nvidia still carries a market value of about $2.9 trillion. $27.6 billion The drop in Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s net worth after the selloff, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Ellison’s net worth jumped last week after President Donald Trump said a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to AI. Forbes says Ellison is still worth $200 billion. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, saw his net worth drop $20.8 billion to $103.6 billion. 28.3% The decline in Vistra Corp., the biggest drop for any stock in the S&P 500. Vistra isn’t a tech company — it’s an independent power producer. Its shares soared last year on expectations that the build out of AI infrastructure in the US. will require enormous amounts of power. 351 The number of stocks in the S&P 500 that actually rose Monday. That the index dropped sharply on a day when better than three-fifths of its component stocks rose demonstrates the outsized influence of tech stocks such as Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closed with a modest gain.

Donovan Erskine January 27, 2025 11:38 AM DeepSeek 1 The AI race has taken yet another twist with the emergence of DeepSeek AI, an open-source LLM that’s free to use on PCs and mobile devices. The company behind DeepSeek says it developed the AI assistant in just two months with a budget of $6 million. Since its release, AI powerhouse NVIDIA has seen its stock drop by 17%. DeepSeek AI has quickly skyrocketed in popularity since being released to the public, surpassing ChatGPT to become the most popular free app on Apple’s App Store, and the number two free productivity app on the Google Play Store. Source: NVIDIA No company has financially benefited more from the tech industry’s AI boom more than NVIDIA . While the GPU manufacturer has enjoyed record success over multiple quarters, the company’s stock has fallen 17% as DeepSeek continues to mount momentum and capture the attention of audiences. The team behind DeepSeek AI claim to have developed the LLM in 2 months on a (relatively) modest budget of $6 million.

DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. Recommended Videos Chipmakers incurred some sizeable losses. Still, the noise in the tech sector obscured some solid gains in other parts of the market, such as the consumer discretionary sector, which includes Amazon and Tesla, and the communications sector, which counts Meta Platforms as a member. Cruise lines were also standouts. The S&P 500 closed the week with a loss of 1%. The market got a slight jolt late Friday after the White House said President Donald Trump would impose promised tariffs on some key U.S. trading partners. Here's a look the week in the stock market, by the numbers: 4.6% The week’s decline in the S&P 500 tech sector, the biggest drop in the index in about four months. Big losses for chipmakers like Nvidia, Micron Technology and Broadcom weighed down the index. The decline would have been worse if not for a solid gain in shares of Apple. 71.46 The approximate point drop in the S&P 500 Friday between the time the White House confirmed Trump's decision on tariffs and the close of the market. That's a drop of about 1.2%. Though not a dramatic swing, it does harken back to Trump's first term, when pronouncements on trade policy could bring about rapid change in the direction of the stock market. $590 billion The approximate decline in Nvidia’s market value on Monday, a record. The decline was more than the combined market value of home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe's. Nvidia still carries a market value of just under $3 trillion. The company's billionaire CEO, Jensen Huang, saw his net worth drop by nearly $21 billion Monday. 13.6% The weekly decline in Constellation Energy Corp., which isn't a tech company but an independent power producer. Shares of power companies such as Constellation, Vistra and GE Vernova had soared on expectations that the build out of AI infrastructure in the U.S. will require enormous amounts of power. $25 million That's the amount Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms agreed to pay to settle a 2021 lawsuit that President Donald Trump brought against the company and CEO Mark Zuckerberg after Trump’s accounts were suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. More importantly for shareholders, Meta reaffirmed its commitment to spending heavily to implement its AI strategy. 5.9% The weekly gain for Apple Inc., which ironically may have benefitted from DeepSeek's announcement. Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta, Apple hasn’t been investing as heavily in AI – one of the reasons it has been seen as an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek’s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum. $27.6 billion Monday's drop in Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s net worth after the selloff, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Ellison’s net worth jumped last week after President Donald Trump said a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to AI. Forbes' tally shows Ellison made back about $13 billion of the drop as this week went along and Oracle’s stock recovered. 2027 That's when Royal Caribbean Group, known mainly for its namesake ocean cruises, plans to enter the river cruise market. That news, plus better-than-expected quarterly earnings, helped Royal Caribbean post the biggest weekly gain of any stock in the S&P 500 at nearly 15%. __ This story has been corrected to say that Constellation Energy had a weekly decline, not gain.

The entire U.S. market is taking a tumble on Monday morning as a result, but many analysts are skeptical of the company’s claims. TechCrunch reports that DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence firm founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, former chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer, has recently made waves in the tech industry with its breakthrough AI models. The company’s mobile app, released in early January, has topped the App Store charts across major markets, including the U.S., UK, and China. However, the company’s claims have not escaped doubts about their veracity. What sets DeepSeek apart is its open-source models — which are free to use — incorporate a reasoning feature, articulating the AI’s thought process before providing responses. The company claims to deliver performance comparable to leading AI offerings, such as GPT-4o, while using a fraction of the computing power. This development — along with the fact that DeepSeek is open source and completely free for use — has significant implications for the tech industry, potentially reshaping competition between established tech giants and startups by lowering barriers to entry. CNBC reports that the stock market is down heavily due to DeepSeek’s implications for high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia. The Nasdaq Composite fell by 3.4 percent at the opening bell. The Dow fell 180 points and the S&P 500 cratered by two percent. Immediately, social media users began exploring the extent of Chinese censorship present in DeepSeek. One user posted a video demonstrating that the AI would begin to answer a question about the famous “Tank Man” image from the Tiananmen Square Massacre, only to censor itself. Wall Street analysts were quick to post notes skeptical about DeepSeek’s claims. Citi questions whether DeepSeek’s achievements were made without the use of advanced GPUs to fine-tune the models or build the underlying large language models (LLMs) through the distillation technique. While the dominance of U.S. companies in the most advanced AI models could potentially be challenged, Citi estimates that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, the U.S.’s access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Bernstein believes that the resulting panic in the tech industry seems overblown, acknowledging that DeepSeek may have reduced costs of achieving equivalent model performance by about 10 times. However, they note that current model cost trajectories are increasing by about that much every year, which cannot continue indefinitely. Bernstein argues that innovations like those employed by DeepSeek are necessary for AI to continue progressing and that any new compute capacity unlocked is more likely to be absorbed due to increased usage and demand rather than impacting the long-term spending outlook. Goldman Sachs sees potential competition between capital-rich internet giants and startups, given the lowering barriers to entry. They also expect a shift from training to more inferencing, with increased emphasis on post-training capabilities that require significantly lower computational resources compared to pre-training. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs anticipates the potential for further global expansion for Chinese players, given their performance and cost/price competitiveness. DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around U.S. restrictions on high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing China’s progress. Breitbart News will continue to report on this developing story. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship."

But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek’s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum. $27.6 billion Monday’s drop in Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s net worth after the selloff, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Ellison’s net worth jumped last week after President Donald Trump said a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to AI. Forbes’ tally shows Ellison made back about $13 billion of the drop as this week went along and Oracle’s stock recovered.

The entire U.S. market is taking a tumble on Monday morning as a result, but many analysts are skeptical of the company’s claims. TechCrunch reports that DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence firm founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, former chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer, has recently made waves in the tech industry with its breakthrough AI models. The company’s mobile app, released in early January, has topped the App Store charts across major markets, including the U.S., UK, and China. However, the company’s claims have not escaped doubts about their veracity. What sets DeepSeek apart is its open-source models — which are free to use — incorporate a reasoning feature, articulating the AI’s thought process before providing responses. The company claims to deliver performance comparable to leading AI offerings, such as GPT-4o, while using a fraction of the computing power. This development — along with the fact that DeepSeek is open source and completely free for use — has significant implications for the tech industry, potentially reshaping competition between established tech giants and startups by lowering barriers to entry. CNBC reports that the stock market is down heavily due to DeepSeek’s implications for high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia. The Nasdaq Composite fell by 3.4 percent at the opening bell. The Dow fell 180 points and the S&P 500 cratered by two percent. Immediately, social media users began exploring the extent of Chinese censorship present in DeepSeek. One user posted a video demonstrating that the AI would begin to answer a question about the famous “Tank Man” image from the Tiananmen Square Massacre, only to censor itself. Wall Street analysts were quick to post notes skeptical about DeepSeek’s claims. Citi questions whether DeepSeek’s achievements were made without the use of advanced GPUs to fine-tune the models or build the underlying large language models (LLMs) through the distillation technique. While the dominance of U.S. companies in the most advanced AI models could potentially be challenged, Citi estimates that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, the U.S.’s access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Bernstein believes that the resulting panic in the tech industry seems overblown, acknowledging that DeepSeek may have reduced costs of achieving equivalent model performance by about 10 times. However, they note that current model cost trajectories are increasing by about that much every year, which cannot continue indefinitely. Bernstein argues that innovations like those employed by DeepSeek are necessary for AI to continue progressing and that any new compute capacity unlocked is more likely to be absorbed due to increased usage and demand rather than impacting the long-term spending outlook. Goldman Sachs sees potential competition between capital-rich internet giants and startups, given the lowering barriers to entry. They also expect a shift from training to more inferencing, with increased emphasis on post-training capabilities that require significantly lower computational resources compared to pre-training. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs anticipates the potential for further global expansion for Chinese players, given their performance and cost/price competitiveness. DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around U.S. restrictions on high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing China’s progress. Breitbart News will continue to report on this developing story. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship."

Constellation, Vistra and GE Vernova were leading the S&P 500 this year as investors speculated on AI's power needs. Now, the arrival of DeepSeek is raising questions about how much power will actually be needed. Power companies that are most exposed to the tech sector's data center boom plunged Monday, as the debut of China's DeepSeek open-source AI laboratory led investors to question how much energy artificial intelligence applications will actually consume. Stream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are. WATCH HERE Vistra closed nearly 30% lower, erasing its gains for 2025. Constellation Energy , Talen Energy and GE Vernova tumbled more than 20%, with the latter two stocks also giving up this year's gains. Before Monday's selloff, Constellation, Vistra and GE Vernova had surged to top of the S&P 500 as investors speculated that AI data centers will boost demand for enormous amounts of electricity. Natural gas stocks also fell steeply Monday, suggesting some investors believe the sector might get as big a boost as expected from data center demand. Producer EQT Corp. lost nearly 10% while pipeline companies Kinder Morgan and Williams Companies fell more than 8%. DeepSeek released an AI model on Christmas Day that Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang described in an interview with CNBC last week as ""earth shattering."" Scale AI provides training data for AI applications. DeepSeek followed up last week with the release of a reasoning model named DeepSeek-R1 that competes with OpenAI's o1 model. DeepSeek has since risen to the top of mobile app stores. Wang said DeepSeek has essentially caught up with OpenAI.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has described DeepSeek as ""super-compute efficient."" Bank of America analysts said in a Monday note that DeepSeek is ""challenging the notion of U.S. leadership in AI and raising doubts about the high expectations for cloud capex, chip growth and power requirements."" The tech companies have anticipated needing so much electricity to supply data centers that they have increasingly looked to nuclear power as a source of reliable, carbon-free energy. Constellation, for example, has signed a power agreement with Microsoft to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Talen is powering an Amazon data center with electricity from the nearby Susquehanna nuclear plant. Vistra has not signed a data center deal yet, though investors see promise in its nuclear and natural gas assets. GE Vernova has soared this year as the market believes its gas and electric grid businesses will benefit from AI demand. The Bank of America analysts said grid investment in the U.S. and Europe is still required. ""Electrical grids in Europe and the U.S. remain under-invested and one of the critical bottlenecks in terms of meeting load growth requirements,"" the analysts said.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) Getty Images Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), also known as Technology Readiness Assessments, help policymakers, philanthropies and investors, and innovators determine the development stage of emerging technologies – serving as a helpful tool to navigate hype cycles . The TRL scale provides a standardized measure of a technology's maturity, from fundamental research to implementation. Since the passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is advancing 21st century industrial policies that promote technology-based economic development predicated around emerging technology areas outlined in the bill. CHIPS emphasized bolstering the semiconductor industry and shoring up American leadership status in industries shaped by quantum science and technology, energy technology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and beyond. The U.S. National Science Foundation’s Regional Innovation Engines program , the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs , and the U.S. Defense Department’s Microelectronic Commons hubs are three signature programs created through the bill to grow regional innovation economies around these technologies. As CHIPS implementation progresses, TRL scales will become essential for decision-makers. Policymakers, media, educators, workforce developers, and science and technology leaders in funded regions must assess their technology's market readiness over the next decade to guide investments, workforce planning, and public messaging. The Industrial Policy Origin of the TRL Scale The TRL scale was formalized by researchers and technologists at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). AFP via Getty Images MORE FOR YOU The TRL scale was born from U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space shuttle mission in 1974 . The agency needed a structured way to assess and manage the progression of the various technologies relevant to its mission. NASA’s projects involved substantial costs and risks, so establishing a clear system for understanding the maturity of each technology component was vital. As NASA experienced success with this approach, other governmental bodies and industries took note, including the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy, and Transporation, which each adapted the TRL scale for its unique technology domains beginning in the early 1990s. Now, TRLs are widely used across industries, including aerospace, maritime, electronics, and healthcare, to guide procurement strategy, investment roadmaps, and risk mitigation approaches when road-mapping a technology’s maturation timeline. Different sectors and government agencies may use their customized version of the TRL. For example, the U.S. National Institutes of Health has three TRL scales for diagnostics, therapeutics, and medical devices. The Defense Department uses the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) scale across many programs and initiatives. For industrial policy implementors or observers, the TRL scale is handy in evaluating emerging technologies boosted through federal investments. The technology maturation pathways for CHIPS Act technology areas especially demand significant investment and rigorous testing before becoming viable across m programs and initiatives. The 9 TRL Scale Levels of Technology Development The TRL Scale includes nine levels moving from early conceptual ideas to fully realized systems or products ready for market deployment. TRL 1 is the lowest, and TRL 9 is the highest. TRLs are often used as a proxy for commercial readiness in government contracts or grant solicitations. TRL 1: Basic Principles Observed and Reported TRL 1 represents basic scientific research. Here, fundamental principles are studied and reported in published studies, but there’s no direct application in mind. This level is the foundation where theoretical research is explored. Example : New synthetic rubber compound discovered in university lab and published in peer-reviewed journal Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : Extremely High TRL 2: Technology Concept Formulated In this stage, the initial idea for a new technology based on research is formulated, and potential applications are identified. There’s still no experimental proof, prototype, or testing, but a general concept of technology starts to take shape. In this stage, the initial idea for a new technology based on research is formulated, and potential applications are identified. There’s still no experimental proof, prototype, or testing, but a general concept of technology starts to take shape. Example : Idea of applying rubber to tires formulated Risk of Technology Failing to Mature: Extremely High TRL 3: Technology Proof of Concept The technology concept begins to be validated with proof-of-concept studies. Researchers develop models or simulations to assess the viability of the technology. Early-stage experiments may be conducted, but the technology is far from being usable in any real-world context. Example : Rubber is tested for strength and malleability to determine if it can be used in tires, and a proof-of-concept is developed. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature: Very High TRL 4: Technology Validated in a Laboratory Environment TRL level 4 is when real experimental work takes place. Components of the technology are tested in a controlled lab environment, often using prototypes that demonstrate key functions. At this point, there’s growing confidence in the feasibility of the technology, but it remains unproven in practical scenarios. Example : Rubber is further tested in a lab to determine tire-like properties, like durability. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : High TRL 5: Technology Validated in a Relevant Real-World Environment As the technology matures, testing shifts to environments that mimic real-world conditions. Validation is still in prototype form, but the technology is evaluated in settings more reflective of where it will eventually be applied. Example : Rubber is used to create a prototype tire and fitted on a wheel Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : High TRL 6: Technology Demonstrated in a Relevant Real-World Environment In this phase, a fully functional technology prototype is developed, and testing is conducted in conditions that closely resemble the intended operational environment. TRL 6 is a major milestone as it signals that the technology has moved beyond proof of concept and shows promising real-world applicability. Example : The tire is mounted on a wheel and tested on an artificial rolling road. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature: Medium High TRL 7: Technology System Prototype Demonstrated in an Operational Environment At TRL 7, the technology prototype undergoes rigorous testing in the actual operational environment. This level ensures that the technology functions as intended under the stresses, constraints, and demands of real-world conditions. Any remaining issues can be identified and corrected before full deployment. Example : The tire is tested on a car on the road. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : Medium TRL 8: Technology System Finalized and Validated Through Testing and Demonstration The technology is nearing its final stages of development. At this point, the technology is complete and has been tested thoroughly. All the necessary qualifications and certifications are obtained to confirm its readiness for deployment. Example : The tire is certified to be able to be used on the road by consumers. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : Low TRL 9: Actual System Proven Successful in Operational Environment TRL 9 is the final level, where the technology is fully operational and can be integrated into commercial use. The technology is proven through continuous real-world applications, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness. Example : The tire has been tested through its life cycle to ensure it is safe for use. The tire will be introduced to the market for consumers to purchase. Risk of Technology Failing to Mature : Low Using TRL Scale in Industrial Policy Implementation The U.S. Economic Development Administration's Tech Hubs grants aim to grow regional economies around emerging technology advances focused on later stage TRL levels. Shalin Jyotishi, New America The U.S. National Science Foundation's Regional Innovation Engines grants help regions grow local economies by advancing applied R&D and emerging technology development focused on earlier stage TRL levels. U.S. National Science Foundation CHIPS Act investments like NSF Engines and EDA Tech Hubs aim to funnel research into technologies through TRL level 9. While both investments aim to bring technologies to market, NSF Engines was designed to focus earlier on the TRL scale with more emphasis on use-inspired research while EDA Tech Hubs focus more heavily on testing and prototyping. These investments especially aim to help emerging technology development progress past the so-called “Valley of Death,” which refers to TRLs 4-7. Most innovations fail to mature beyond the Valley of Death because innovators don’t account for risk factors beyond technical feasibility. There is more to technology development than the science itself. Engines and Tech Hubs help regions navigate nontechnical risks, including market uncertainty, regulatory risk, operational risk, and the soundness of the business model underpinning the technology deployment. Once a technology progresses past TRL 7, policymakers, business leaders, investors, and workforce leaders can feel more confident that the technology will mature through level 9, given enough budget and time allocation. However, depending on its intended use, technologies can exist at multiple TRL levels. For example, the components of a cell phone are at TRL level 9 for most use-cases, but if a use-case involved having phones operational at extreme cold in Alaska or extremely hot and humid temperatures in Florida, the component TRLs would change. TRLs could be used to assess which components need to be upgraded to accommodate new use cases. By providing a common language and structure, TRLs enable state and local governments, philanthropies, industry, economic and workforce developers, and investors to communicate more effectively and honestly about the maturity of the technology their Engine or Tech Hub hopes to focus their regional economy around. This insight is invaluable in deciding whether to allocate further resources, pivot development strategies, or abandon an initiative altogether. Fostering technological innovation is not easy, and harnessing it to create the industries and jobs of the future is even more difficult. As the nation continues to implement 21st-century industrial policy to grow the innovation economy, the TRL scale will prove to be an indispensable tool for navigating hype cycles and supporting the development of groundbreaking innovations.

Chinese AI climbs to top of iPhone app chart The Chinese startup behind the AI service is offering users its most advanced models completely free of charge Close Saqib Shah 27 January 2025 COMMENTS Listen here on your chosen podcast platform. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is limiting new registrations for its AI service, citing “large-scale malicious attacks” on its platform. The issues, which began at around 1.30pm UK time, are slowing down the website and playing havoc with the company’s API (the tech that lets other apps talk to DeepSeek’s AI). Follow the Standard’s live blog for the latest on DeepSeek Earlier on Monday, DeepSeek said it was restricting sign-ups to those with Chinese mobile phone numbers. The company’s website and app appears to be working for those who previously created accounts, though users have noticed that the AI is taking longer to process queries. News of the disruption comes after DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT to become the top app on Apple’s charts. As more Western users have flocked to DeepSeek, concerns about Chinese censorship have also surfaced. For instance, the bot refuses to respond or abruptly ends conversations about topics like the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Here’s what you need to know about the AI that has Silicon Valley in panic mode. Stock market shock The emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI that can allegedly go toe-to-toe with US giant ChatGPT, has rattled global markets . On Monday, US stock indices took a nosedive as jittery investors dumped tech stocks, spooked by fears that AI development costs had spiralled out of control. The sell-off sparked a trillion-dollar wipeout, according to Bloomberg , hitting US and European chipmakers, AI companies, and energy firms the hardest. AI powerhouse Nvidia saw around $400bn (£321bn) wiped from its market value, while tech titans Meta, Google, and Microsoft also took significant hits. The downturn was triggered by the release of DeepSeek’s latest AI model, which it claims operates at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the current poster child for modern AI with more than 300 million active users. The buzz around the Chinese bot has hit a fever pitch, with tech heavyweights weighing in. On Monday, Elon Musk poured cold water on DeepSeek’s claims of building its advanced models using far fewer, less powerful AI chips than its US competitors. What is DeepSeek? DeepSeek’s AI looks and functions much like ChatGPT and other large-language models. It can answer questions, generate poetry and prose, and write complex code (the programming language used to build everything from apps to websites). What sets it apart, however, is that DeepSeek claims to offer all of these functions (along with a few others) at a level comparable to its larger rivals, and all at a significantly lower cost. In a research paper , DeepSeek’s engineering team revealed they only needed about $6m (£4.8m) in raw computing power to develop their new system – roughly 10 times less than Meta's investment in its latest AI technology, according to The New York Times . Notably, DeepSeek achieved all this under the constraints of strict US export controls on advanced computing tech in China . As restrictions from the Biden administration started to bite, the Chinese firm was forced to get resourceful, building its models with fewer and far less powerful Nvidia AI chips. What impact has DeepSeek had? While the Chinese-US tech race is marked by increasing protectionism, DeepSeek has taken a different approach. Following in the footsteps of companies like Meta, it has decided to open-source its latest AI system. By sharing the underlying code with the wider tech community, the company is allowing other businesses, developers, and researchers to access and build upon it. It means that anyone with the right expertise can now use DeepSeek’s models to create their own products or conduct research. DeepSeek's user interface will seem instantly familiar to anyone who uses AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude DeepSeek The company’s breakthroughs have sent shockwaves through the tech industry. Meta, NVIDIA, and Google’s stock prices have all taken a beating as investors question their mammoth investments in AI in the wake of DeepSeek’s models. The fear is that DeepSeek will turn out to be the new TikTok , a Chinese giant that encroaches on the market share of US tech giants. Industry titans have described it as a wake-up call for the West. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen hailed the success of DeepSeek as a ""Sputnik moment”, suggesting it will inject a new level of competition and innovation into the AI landscape. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, who became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, warned that the gap between US and Chinese AI is narrowing. Speaking to CNBC , the entrepreneur called DeepSeek’s latest AI model an “earth-shattering” release. However, Mr Wang expressed doubts about DeepSeek’s claims of using fewer resources to build its models, speculating the company may have access to a large number of chips. Who owns DeepSeek? DeepSeek is an AI start-up that was spun off from a Chinese hedge fund called High Flyer-Quant by its manager, Liang Wenfeng, according to local media . Mr Liang has credited the company’s success to its fresh-faced team of engineers and researchers. Rather than focusing on years of experience, the company prioritises raw talent, with many of its developers being recent graduates or newcomers to the AI field. This approach, according to its founder, has been key to the company’s growth and innovation. How do you use DeepSeek? DeepSeek’s AI can be used for free on both the web and through a mobile app. Its interface is virtually identical to ChatGPT’s: Users can interact with the bot by typing text or uploading files or images. There’s also the option to enable DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning system. Unlike AI that identifies patterns in data to generate content, like images or text, reasoning systems focus on complex decision-making and logic-based tasks. They excel at problem-solving, answering open-ended questions, and handling situations that require a step-by-step chain of thought, making them better suited for trickier tasks like solving maths problems.

In addition, users can ask the AI to search the web as part of its responses, which is useful for finding recent events or verifying information. Although it is a multimodal AI that can recognise various types of media, DeepSeek’s consumer-facing bot does not currently generate images or process audio. In comparison, ChatGPT offers speech recognition to all users, and an advanced voice mode for more natural conversations is available to paying members. OpenAI has also introduced a video-generating AI called Sora in the US for subscribers. MORE ABOUT AI China Chatbot Artificial Intelligence DeepSeek"

FNGU: If you are bullish on specific mega-cap growth stocks like Meta, Tesla, or NVIDIA. Ideal for short-term trading when you expect the FANG+ Index to outperform the broader tech market. Higher potential gains/losses due to extreme concentration. 2. TQQQ: If you want exposure to the broader tech sector (Nasdaq-100). Better suited for diversified short-term trades in tech and growth stocks. Less concentrated risk than FNGU, although still very high. --- Performance Example In a tech bull market: FNGU might outperform because the FANG+ companies often lead rallies. TQQQ would still perform strongly but may lag FNGU’s returns due to broader diversification. In a downturn: Both can suffer significant losses, but FNGU may fall more sharply due to its concentration. --- Key Considerations Risk Tolerance: FNGU is riskier because of its narrow focus, while TQQQ spreads risk slightly across 100 companies. Market View: Bullish on FANG+ leaders → FNGU. Bullish on overall tech growth → TQQQ. Holding Period: Both are short-term trading tools. Long-term holding is not recommended due to leverage decay. --- Conclusion Choose FNGU if you are targeting the elite tech giants and are confident in their outperformance in a bullish market. Choose TQQQ for broader exposure to the tech sector with similar leverage. It’s less volatile but still very risky. Both are high-risk, high-reward instruments that require active management and a clear exit strategy. 您的位置： 文学城 » 论坛 » 投资理财 » 看牛帅的帖子买FNGU，科普一下？好像比TQQQ 更侧重科技，哈哈 所有跟帖： • 谢谢亮线！又是一个好贴。哈哈 - MarkM76 - ♀ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 22:41:01 • 做点功课，哈哈，在极端情况下可买。小心再小心 - BrightLine - ♂ (167 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 05:14:42 • 这是哪个AI提供的？FNGS的成分股好像过时了，现在没有中概股 - Wei_PDX - ♂ (151 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 22:54:58 • FNGS 里面的tsla, bidu, baba 早就被crwd, avgo, now 取代了 - 犀牛望月 - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 23:32:27 • 所以，DeepSeek不好用，还是要用ChatGPT（没有政治倾向的意思） - parentb - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 02:05:52 • 你安装、试了没有？ - 玻璃坊 - ♂ (278 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 03:22:11 • 对，数据需要更新 - BrightLine - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 05:13:21 • 你的deepseek是不是用了几年前数据? - 犀牛望月 - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 23:33:23 • 如果现在还有阿里巴巴和百度，谁还敢买 - Octobter - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 23:49:59 • 说明FNGU与时俱进，哈哈 - BrightLine - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 05:16:10 • 哇，FNGS的三倍体！FNGS在日本火得不得了。 - Octobter - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/25/2025 postreply 23:40:34 • 赞，学习，不敢玩 - longnv - ♀ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 05:05:43 • 我也是学习，哈哈，危险，必须知道自己在做什么。要么短期抄底，要么认定当年是牛市 - BrightLine - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 05:18:02 • aum: 26b vs 8b - va168 - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 06:12:45 • first thing you may compare is their risk factors quantitatively - 牛经沧海 - ♂ (0 bytes) ( ) 01/26/2025 postreply 13:04:00 请您先登陆，再发跟帖！ 文学城简介 广告服务 联系我们 招聘信息 注册笔名 申请版主 收藏文学城 WENXUECITY.COM does not represent or guarantee the truthfCCPA ulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of communications posted by other users.

https://torrentfreak.com/tech-industry-urges-eu-to-halt-italys-overreaching-anti-piracy-measures-250122/,,Tech Industry Urges EU to Halt Italy Overreaching Anti - Piracy Measures * TorrentFreak,20250122T190000Z,https://torrentfreak.com/images/caution-featured.jpg,torrentfreak.com,English,United States,XLK,Technology,tech industry,"Launched last year, Italy’s elaborate ‘ Piracy Shield ‘ blocking scheme was billed as the future of anti-piracy efforts. To effectively tackle live sports piracy, broad blocking powers aim to block piracy-related domain names and IP addresses within 30 minutes. While many pirate sources have indeed been blocked, Piracy Shield is not without controversy. There have been multiple reports of overblocking, where the anti-piracy system blocked access to Google Drive , Cloudflare , and other legitimate sites and services. Meanwhile, calls for more transparency and accountability are growing. Tech Industry Sounds Alarm Bell Yesterday, the Computer & Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) sounded the alarm. In a letter addressed to the EU Commission, the coalition of tech industry companies, including Amazon, Cloudflare and Google, shared grave concerns. The European branch of CCIA acknowledges that Piracy Shield aims to protect rightsholders. However, they argue that the ‘blunt’ DNS and IP blocking measures represent a threat to other companies and the public. “While this approach aims to protect intellectual property and reduce online piracy, it relies on IP address and domain name system (DNS)-level blocking, making it a potentially extremely blunt instrument to address online copyright infringement,” CCIA writes. In addition, extending the blocking scheme to DNS resolvers and VPN providers is seen as a major concern. These tools are not suited to carry out blocking measures, CCIA says, as they are fundamental to the protection of free expression. CCIA emphasizes that concerns about overblocking are not hypothetical, as the Piracy Shield is already wreaking havoc. It cites the aforementioned Google Drive blockade, which affected millions of Italians and took hours to resolve. “On 20 October 2024, Google Drive was mistakenly blocked by the Piracy Shield system, causing a three-hour blackout for all Italian users, while 13.5% of users were still blocked at the IP level, and 3% were blocked at the DNS level after 12 hours.” Overblocking Transparency, Verification & Accountability While European Courts have previously greenlighted pirate site blocking schemes, CCIA highlights that Italy’s implementation lacks sufficient safeguards and transparency. That makes the prevention and swift correction of errors much more difficult. The tech group also notes that Piracy Shield was developed by a company affiliated with local football league Serie A, one of the few rightsholders currently allowed to use the system. This raises concerns of whether the system adequately considers all stakeholders’ interests. CCIA says that AGCOM, the regulator that manages Piracy Shield, should take measures to address these concerns. “The Italian Piracy Shield should at the very least incorporate more robust verification protocols and significantly enhance transparency, as well as adequate redress mechanisms for affected users, to reduce these negative impacts.” Problematic Reporting Obligations In addition to matters directly related to blocking, the tech industry is concerned about recent amendments to Italian copyright law that introduce obligations that contradict the principles set forth in the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA). These amendments mandate all intermediary providers to report any knowledge of illegal activity, including minor copyright infringements. Failure to comply could result in up to one year of imprisonment . According to the CCIA, these requirements introduce new obligations for companies that simply pass on traffic. It argues that these requirements go beyond EU law and will create a chilling effect on freedom of expression and innovation online. Withdraw Piracy Shield CCIA believes that Piracy Shield and the recent legal amendments violate several EU laws. They were not submitted under the TRIS procedure either, a key element of the European Union’s single market policy when it comes to rules regarding online services. To properly address these concerns, CCIA urges the EU Commission to engage with the Italian Government to put a halt to the anti-piracy measures, so their lawfulness can be thoroughly checked. “The Italian government should withdraw the above-mentioned legislation in order to go through the TRIS procedure, allowing the Commission and other Member States to review the substance of these flawed and ineffective initiatives, and address their infringement of European laws,” CCIA concludes.

Schechter’s articles from Greenberg Traurig, LLP are most popular: with Senior Company Executives and HR Navigating the Future of H-1B, L-1 and O-1 Visas As the new Trump administration takes shape, tech companies and foreign workers are keenly observing potential changes to the H-1B visa program and other related tech visas. The administration is expected to appease its opposing stakeholders by maintaining strong relationships with the tech industry while also addressing concerns from those advocating for stricter immigration policies. H-1B and L-1 Visas: A Balancing Act While some factions within the administration may push for a reduction in high-skilled immigration, the administration's close ties with tech companies suggests it will likely maintain current levels of H-1B and L-1 visa issuances. The tech industry heavily relies on these visas, and any drastic reduction could disrupt business operations and innovation. However, procedural changes that we saw in the previous administration, as well as new ones, might be introduced to indirectly limit access, such as increased scrutiny during adjudications, slower processing times, increased requests for evidence, higher denial rates, and more frequent site visits. A particular focus is expected on third-party placement firms and staffing companies, which have been accused of misusing the H-1B program. Companies that are in the outsourcing/staffing industry may face heightened scrutiny and additional requirements, especially in terms of documenting third-party worksite placements. Buy American, Hire American: Implications and Expectations The anticipated ""Buy American, Hire American"" executive order could lead to reviews of companies using large numbers of H-1B visas to determine if they are prioritizing foreign workers over U.S. citizens. This may also involve increased activity from the Department of Justice's Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER), which scrutinizes whether foreign nationals are being unfairly preferred in hiring. Geopolitical Considerations and Security Checks The administration might impose stricter limitations on H-1B visa holders from countries perceived as unfriendly, such as China and those countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Enhanced security and administrative checks could lead to delays for nationals from these countries, reflecting broader geopolitical concerns. The administration could also bring back its Travel Bans via executive orders, as it did previously. Potential Revisions to Existing Policies There is speculation about reversing USCIS's deference policy, which has allowed USCIS adjudicators to rely on prior approvals involving the same parties and facts rather that adjudicating every visa petition from scratch. While the recent H-1B modernization rule codifies the deference policy, the administration could issue directives requiring case-by-case reviews, potentially complicating and slowing the process for employers and applicants. Additionally, work authorization for some spouses of tech workers may disappear. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the H-4 EAD in 2021 and it may try to do this again. There have been no similar attempts at, or discussions around, rescinding L-2 work authorization. Optional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT Previous attempts by the Trump administration to limit OPT and STEM OPT were met with resistance from the tech industry and educational institutions. Further restrictions on these programs seem unlikely in the short term because any changes would likely face significant pushback due to their importance to tech companies and universities. Prevailing Wage and Union Advocacy Efforts to increase prevailing wages for H-1B workers may gain traction, with heightened scrutiny on companies accused of undercutting wages through foreign hires. The incoming head of the Department of Labor could advocate for policies that favor higher prevailing wages and address union concerns. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty While the new administration may introduce challenges for high-skilled immigration, the business community's pushback and the economic benefits of these programs could help prevent implementation of any drastic measures. Companies and foreign workers should stay informed and prepare for potential procedural changes. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Rebecca B. Schechter Laura Foote Reiff"

INTERNATIONAL Biden’s administration proposes new rules on exporting AI chips By: Agencies Date: January 14, 2025 Share post: Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Email Washington, Jan 13: The Biden administration is proposing a new framework for the exporting of the advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. But the framework proposed Monday also raised concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centres and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters previewing the framework that it’s “critical” to preserve America’s leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare. “As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,” Raimondo said. The framework “is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors. A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put US companies at a disadvantage. “While we share the US government’s commitment to national and economic security, the rule’s potential risks to US global leadership in AI cannot be emphasised enough,” said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group’s senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry. One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centres abroad.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) AP By Matt Arco | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Steve Bannon appears to have had enough of Elon Musk . President-elect Donald Trump ’s former chief strategist has called Musk “a truly evil person” and said “stopping him” from influencing the incoming president has “become a personal issue” for him. “I will get Elon Musk kicked out by the time he’s inaugurated,” Bannon said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera . “He won’t have a blue pass with full access to the White House. He’ll be like everyone else.” Bannon added that Musk “should go back to South Africa,” where he was born, asking, “Why do we have South Africans, the most racist people on earth, White South Africans … making any comments at all on what goes on in the United States?” Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, contributing heavily to America PAC, a super political action committee that deployed canvassers, aired TV ads and reached voters digitally in battleground states. He had signaled after the election he was willing to back GOP primary challenges to Republican members of Congress seeking re-election in 2026 who waver on Trump’s appointments and agenda. In recent weeks, Trump’s coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump’s movement have accused Musk and others in Trump’s new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump’s “America First” vision. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy , and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his immigration policies. The debate touched off last month when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Her comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.

",20250113T123000Z,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-117205725,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-32438,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg",economictimes.indiatimes.com,English,India,XLK,Technology,tech industry,"Agencies Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta , has once again criticised Apple , accusing the tech giant of stagnation in innovation and operating a restrictive ecosystem that hampers competition. Speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg addressed issues ranging from Apple’s reliance on iPhone sales to its App Store policies and closed ecosystem practices. Zuckerberg expressed dissatisfaction with Apple’s progress since the release of the iPhone nearly two decades ago. He remarked, “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.” According to Zuckerberg, declining iPhone sales reflect consumer fatigue with what he described as minimal upgrades between models. He also noted that Apple has failed to introduce significant advancements comparable to the strides other companies, like Meta, are making in emerging technologies such as the metaverse and virtual reality . “It feels like they haven’t really invented anything groundbreaking in a while,” Zuckerberg said. Criticism of App Store Fees The Meta CEO took issue with Apple’s 30% commission on App Store transactions, commonly referred to as the “Apple tax.” He argued that this fee places an undue burden on developers and increases costs for consumers. “They do it by basically squeezing people and having this 30 percent tax on developers,” Zuckerberg stated. The issue of App Store fees has been a contentious topic in the tech industry. Companies like Epic Games have legally challenged Apple’s policies, while regions like the European Union have pushed for reforms. However, Meta’s dissatisfaction with Apple’s practices is amplified by its reliance on apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which are subject to these fees. Live Events Zuckerberg also criticised Apple’s closed ecosystem, which he claims stifles competition by preventing seamless integration of third-party devices. “They build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they’ve just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way,” he said. He cited Meta’s experience with its Ray-Ban smart glasses as an example. According to Zuckerberg, Apple declined to allow Meta to use the same protocols that enable AirPods to connect seamlessly with iPhones, citing security concerns. “It’s insecure because you didn’t build proper security into it. Now you’re using that as an excuse for why only your products can connect easily,” he added. Zuckerberg also shared his thoughts on Apple’s Vision Pro headset , priced at $3,499. While he acknowledged Apple’s attempt to innovate, he argued that the device’s initial iteration falls short of expectations. “The Vision Pro is probably one of Apple’s bigger swings at trying something new in a while,” he said. “I don’t want to criticise too harshly since we’ve had early versions of products that weren’t great. But the first version of the Vision Pro definitely didn’t hit it out of the park.” The rivalry between Meta and Apple has a long history, stemming from their differing business models and approaches to privacy. In 2021, Apple’s introduction of the App Tracking Transparency feature limited Facebook’s ability to track user data for targeted advertisements, prompting public criticism from Zuckerberg. He argued that the move harmed small businesses reliant on personalised ads. Meta has also raised concerns about Apple’s approach to privacy and security . While Apple has positioned itself as a champion of user privacy, Meta has suggested that its policies are designed to prioritise profit and maintain control over its ecosystem. Zuckerberg’s remarks on Joe Rogan’s podcast underscore these ongoing tensions. Despite his criticisms, Zuckerberg remains hopeful about the tech industry’s capacity for change. “The good news about the tech industry is that it’s super dynamic, and things are constantly getting invented,” he said. “If you don’t do a good job for like 10 years, eventually you’re just going to get beat by someone.” Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

But there were signs of a shift at this year’s Las Vegas event, as the tech sector begins to confront its substantial energy needs, which are certain to grow as cloud computing and artificial intelligence advance. “If you’d asked me to do CES five years ago, I wouldn’t necessarily have seen the point,” said Sebastien Fiedorow, chief executive of the French start-up Aerleum, which manufactures synthetic fuel from carbon dioxide (C02). “But we are in a very different CES than five years ago,” he told AFP, adding that even if energy companies remain “on the fringes” of CES, “we’re here.” “It’s a good first opportunity,” he added. Data centers accounted for 4.4 percent of US electricity needs in 2023, a figure that is likely to rise to 12 percent by 2028, according to the US Department of Energy. Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, said energy transition was intended to be “a big focus” of this year’s show. “It’s something we’ve talked about for awhile,” he added, stressing that the tech sector needs “innovative solutions” to ensure it has the power it requires moving forward. ‘Not the most sexy’ Among the companies pitching such innovation at CES, which wrapped up on Friday, was the Dutch firm LV Energy, which generates electricity from sound and vibrations. General director Satish Jawalapersad said the company’s presence at the show was noteworthy. “The fact that we’re here with the CES does say something, definitely,” he told AFP. But LV Energy didn’t mention artificial intelligence in its presentation, which he said likely suppressed interest, with AI being “the magic word,” at CES. “Maybe we’re not the most sexy… because we don’t say those words,” he told AFP. Other energy firms also acknowledged a struggle to break through. DataGreen, another French company, aims to build smaller, greener data centers that run on renewable power, saving tech companies money by reducing data storage costs. Cloud computing giants have so far shown no interest, said DataGreen’s head of AI, Julien Choukroun. “For now, they don’t see the point (in partnering with DataGreen) but we’re trying to convince them,” Choukroun said. The company won an innovation award at CES this year, its first appearance at the show, and Choukroun argued its services are essential. “We can’t continue to increase the hangar space (of data centers),” he said, stressing the land available to house sprawling storage sites “is not infinite.” He voiced confidence that once Big Tech realizes DataGreen offers cost savings, that will “be more persuasive than the ‘green'” aspect. Changing mindsets Jordan Huyghe, product manager at the French company Otrera, which designs small nuclear reactors, said a major change in the relationship between tech and the energy sector will require investment from giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Amazon is already the world’s largest purchaser of renewable energy. In September, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to reopen the Three Mile Island power plant in the US state of Pennsylvania, the scene of a devastating nuclear meltdown in 1979. Energy from the plant will power Microsoft data centers. Solutions, Huyghe said, can come from companies big enough to fund them. “To move forward on projects like these, you need to raise money,” he said. While interest remains muted for smaller players, Jawalapersad of LV Energy said his company has “numerous leads” in the United States. Fiedorow of Aerleum said there was no doubt the tech sector’s focus on energy is growing."

And certainly, with any new administration, some jockeying and strategic manoeuvring is to be expected. But for anyone who has been following Meta’s evolution – the tech sector’s interminable tussles over free speech and content moderation – as well as the broader cultural rethink in boardrooms across a range of US sectors, this change is far from unexpected.

Zuckerberg’s comments reflect his dissatisfaction with Apple’s stagnation in delivering groundbreaking technology and its restrictive policies. Advertisement Zuckerberg remarked, “[Apple has] used the [iPhone] to put in place a lot of rules that I think feel arbitrary. I feel like they haven’t really invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.” These statements point to a broader critique of Apple’s reliance on its past successes. For Zuckerberg, the dominance of the iPhone - introduced in 2007 - has allowed Apple to establish and enforce policies that he believes stifle competition and innovation in the broader tech industry. A major point of contention is the App Store’s controversial 30% transaction fee for developers, a policy that Zuckerberg and others in the industry argue is burdensome and restrictive. Advertisement The App Store fee has long been a pain point for companies like Meta, which rely on these platforms to distribute their applications. Zuckerberg’s frustration underscores a broader industry concern: whether platform owners, such as Apple, are unfairly leveraging their control to limit what other companies can achieve. He added that these rules are “not really tied to any good or new ideas.” Zuckerberg’s remarks come against the backdrop of ongoing tensions between Apple and Meta. The two tech giants have clashed in recent years, particularly over privacy policies introduced by Apple in 2021, which significantly impacted Meta’s ad revenue. These policies gave users more control over their data, making it harder for companies like Meta to target advertisements effectively. Advertisement While Zuckerberg acknowledged Apple’s past achievements, his critique suggests that the tech giant is falling short of the high standards set by its late co-founder Steve Jobs. As the tech industry continues to evolve, Zuckerberg’s comments add to a growing conversation about the need for innovation and fairness in a rapidly changing digital ecosystem.

The trade show is the largest tech industry event in the world, with over 138,000 attendees and 2.5 million square feet of floor space. It's primarily a venue for businesses—startups, multinationals, retailers, distributors, and financiers—to connect. But the show is also open to the press and the general public, so everyone is vying for each other's attention, eyeballs, and wallets. The level of glitz and spectacle, especially at the big-budget booths for the largest companies, is astronomical.

On his podcast, Steve Bannon pretty recently launched scathing attacks against Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy who support H1-B visas for the foreign tech workers. According to Daily Beast, Steve Bannon repeatedly referred to Tesla CEO Elon Musk as ‘the South African’ and eventually argued that H1-B visas harm the US workers specifically the Black and Hispanic professionals in the tech industry. Additionally, he also called for a complete moratorium on immigration while describing the visa program as ‘obscene’ and claiming that it totally suppresses the domestic job opportunities. During such times, the conservative podcaster also criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson while dubbing him ‘Polly Pockets Johnson’ and accusing him of being totally ineffective, asserted Daily Beast. Steve Bannon now actually fears that House Speaker Mike Johnson will slow down the policy implementation of US President- elect Donald Trump by eventually proposing complex omnibus bills that could delay critical initiatives like mass deportations and tax reforms. The ongoing rhetoric by Steve Bannon actually highlights severely deep divisions within the MAGA movement specifically between tech billionaires and traditional immigration hawks, noted Daily Beast. His attacks actually suggest an ongoing internal struggle for ideological control of the conservative movement. FAQs: Which famous personality still continues to stoke the internal MAGA conflict?

How The Tech Industry Can Help Navigate The Blur By Ben Gebremeskel , Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 09, 2025, 10:15am EST Share Save Ben Gebremeskel, Founder / CTO of TeckPath . getty Imagine walking into a bakery. The air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread, a warm croissant melts in your mouth, and you feel a sense of nostalgia. Then you discover the scene was entirely AI-generated—crafted with precision down to the ""smell"" and ""taste."" You're left wondering whether that experience was real or an elaborate digital simulation. This analogy illustrates the growing state of confusion in today's world: What is real, and what is artificial? As AI continues to evolve, the line between the tangible and the virtual is becoming increasingly blurred. Now more than ever, the responsibility falls on the tech industry to lead the way, ensuring a smoother and more ethical transition into this AI-driven future. The Blurred Lines Of Reality And AI: A Growing Challenge Currently, AI is seamlessly integrating into everyday life: • Art And Creativity: AI can paint, compose music and write novels with stunning depth. • Media And News: AI-generated articles and deepfake videos challenge our ability to discern truth. • Virtual Reality: Immersive gaming and metaverse experiences feel as real as physical life. In the next 10 to 20 years, I expect we'll see an explosion of these technologies. Entirely virtual worlds will blend into our physical existence, AI companions will be indistinguishable from humans, and synthetic experiences will reshape industries and personal lives. The question remains: How can society adapt to this ""new normal"" without losing trust in reality? How The Tech Industry Can Lead A Smoother Transition The tech industry stands at the forefront of this revolution, and with great innovation comes even greater responsibility. Here's how tech leaders can ensure a responsible, ethical and transparent path forward as the lines between AI and reality blur. 1. Promoting Transparency And AI Watermarking The tech industry must prioritize transparency and implement standardized methods like AI watermarks—digital indicators embedded into images, videos and text to clarify their origins. For example, AI-generated images and videos could include invisible watermarks detectable by software tools, and content platforms could label AI-generated articles, helping audiences make informed decisions. It's like food labeling—knowing whether your produce is organic or genetically modified allows you to make informed choices. Major players like OpenAI, Google and Meta must collaborate to develop and adopt global transparency standards for AI content. 2. Building Ethical AI With Guardrails As AI capabilities expand, ethical development must be non-negotiable. Tech companies need to establish ""guardrails"" to prevent misuse and unintended consequences: • Clear Boundaries For Deepfakes: While AI can entertain, malicious deepfakes can cause harm. • Ethical AI Frameworks: Adopt principles that prioritize human well-being, accountability and fairness. • Bias Mitigation: Ensure AI systems are tested rigorously for fairness to avoid amplifying societal inequalities. Companies should build ethics teams and audit systems to monitor AI models for compliance with ethical standards. Just as safety nets protect performers in a high-wire act, ethical frameworks ensure AI advancements don't endanger society. 3. Educating The Public About AI Widespread AI literacy is essential for individuals to navigate this new reality confidently. Tech companies should invest in educational programs that teach people how to recognize AI-generated content and understand AI's capabilities and limitations. Key focus areas could include: • AI awareness training in schools, businesses and communities. • Tools for fact-checking and identifying manipulated content. • Promoting critical thinking in evaluating media and digital experiences. Just as teaching someone how to spot a counterfeit dollar empowers them to make safer financial decisions, AI literacy equips people to distinguish between reality and illusion. Develop partnerships with educational institutions and governments to integrate AI literacy into mainstream education. 4. Responsible Innovation In The Metaverse And Virtual Platforms The metaverse and virtual environments will redefine work, play and relationships. Tech companies must focus on responsible innovation to ensure these digital worlds enhance—not replace—our real-world experiences. Key priorities include: • Striking A Balance: Design platforms that encourage real-world engagement alongside virtual immersion. • Mental Health Safeguards: Implement tools to prevent addiction and ensure healthy use of virtual spaces. • Security And Privacy: Protect user data and identities in increasingly immersive environments. A well-designed city blends parks, schools and entertainment, promoting balance and well-being—and virtual worlds should do the same for digital lives. Industry leaders must establish ethical guidelines for virtual platforms, ensuring these spaces remain enriching and secure for users. 5. Collaboration For Accountability AI's reach spans across borders, industries and societies. To address its challenges, the tech industry must foster collaboration among policymakers, researchers and innovators. Together, they can create accountability structures for AI's deployment and growth by developing global AI ethics policies that prevent misuse, collaborating on shared tools for AI content verification and fostering cross-industry partnerships to solve emerging AI challenges. Tech companies, governments and civil society organizations must form global alliances to guide AI's development responsibly. It's like building international air traffic control systems—collaboration ensures progress doesn't come at the cost of safety. The Future: A World Where AI And Humanity Coexist AI doesn't have to replace or diminish human experiences; it can enrich them—if approached responsibly. By promoting transparency, building ethical guardrails and fostering widespread AI literacy, the tech industry can help society embrace the AI revolution with trust and confidence. Although the bakery experience from the beginning of this article might have been AI-generated, what if it also led to discovering your favorite real-world bakery through AI's suggestions? Reality and AI can coexist, creating value and meaning when balanced thoughtfully. As we stand on the edge of this transformative era, one thing is clear: The responsibility lies in the hands of the tech industry to lead us into a future where we don't fear AI but embrace its potential while staying grounded in our humanity.

https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/panasonic-new-oled-tv-ces-2025.html,,Panasonic new OLED TV stole the show at CES 2025,20250109T040000Z,https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Panasonic-Z95B.jpg,androidheadlines.com,English,China,XLK,Technology,tech industry,"CES is in full swing, and plenty of the top brands in the tech industry are showing off their latest and greatest tech. Among the announcements, we had a torrent of new TVs. Panasonic showed off its newest OLED TVs at CES , and one of them is the Z95B. How the Panasonic Z95B stole the show at CES 2025 Panasonic is a tech company with an influence all across the tech industry. So, it should be no surprise that it has several lines of OLED smart TVs on the market. The company recently released some new TVs just a couple of months ago. However, Panasonic wasn’t finished with its launches, as it brought some TVs over to CES. Just four months after launching the Panasonic Z95A, Panasonic showed off the Z95B. After less than half a year later, you wouldn’t think that there would be any notable changes. However, Panasonic pointed to several innovations that make the newest version better. For starters, this new TV has a better cooling system over its four-month-old predecessor. Called the ThermalFlow aerodynamic cooling system, it promises to keep the TV cooler while it’s in use. Panasonic says that this technology was inspired by techniques seen in racecar design. That’s a pretty odd comparison, but if it works, it works. New panel Along with that, Panasonic boasts a new Primary RGB Tandem Panel. We didn’t get too many details on how this will improve the overall picture. However, it’s worth launching a new iteration just four months later, apparently. While it uses a new panel, the processor powering the TV is the same. The Panasonic Z95B uses the HCX Pro MK II AI processor. So, you’ll get the same level of performance as last year’s version. You won’t get the same speaker performance, however. The company redesigned the speakers, and the company says that the TV will offer an immersive experience. Rounding out the specs, the Panasonic Z95B supports Dolby Vision IQ, AMD FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync. Along with that, it has a smooth 144Hz refresh rate. This TV will launch in the US with a 55-inch, 65-inch, and 77-inch model."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) AP By Matt Arco | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Billionaire and MAGA loyalist Elon Musk recently bucked some of President-elect Donald Trump ’s base and came out in favor of certain immigration visas despite the incoming president’s hardline immigration policies. And now U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is wading into the fight. “If there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country, why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers last year — including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas — while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?” Sanders posted to X Wednesday morning, along with an op-ed he penned for Fox News that called on the H1-B visa “mess” to “be fixed.” “Bernie woke up and chose violence,” quipped Ron Filipkowski. In recent weeks, Trump’s coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump’s movement have accused Musk and others in Trump’s new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump’s “America First” vision. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy , and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his immigration policies. The debate touched off last month when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Her comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Cybersecurity has become a fast-growing segment of Israel’s high-tech sector, which is a key economic growth driver accounting for 20% of economic activity, 16% of jobs and more than half its exports. In its State of the Cyber Nation Report, YL said that despite geopolitical instability, it foresees Israel’s cybersecurity influence expanding “from a hotbed of exceptional security solutions to widespread recognition of Israeli cybersecurity startups as dominant global market leaders.” YL noted that there were 89 funding rounds in Israel in 2024 and 50 of them were seed, or early stage rounds, raising a total of $400 million. The report said global VCs more than doubled their funding rounds in 2024. In growth stages – so-called C and higher rounds – there were 16 rounds raising $2.9 billion, up 300% from $888 million in 2023, YL said. In all, Israeli cyber firms raised $1.89 billion in 2023. “The changes we’re observing in 2024 — global VCs investing earlier in companies, an opening up of the seed and growth round markets and more acquisitions, especially by Israeli companies —signal a rising tide for 2025,” says Andy Ellis, partner at YL Ventures. “While the floodgates aren’t going to crash open, expect to see more activity across the board: A and B rounds should become more accessible, C and later rounds larger and an increase in seed rounds.” Ofer Schreiber, senior partner and head of YL’s Israel office, credits Israel’s elite military intelligence units for its success by creating “a no-nonsense, hands-on entrepreneurship culture.” He added that the war that began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 had forced cyber founders into a new reality as many in the tech sector had been called into military service. “Founders needed to rally to ensure business and operational continuity in uncertain economic conditions and with a concerned customer base,” Schreiber said.

The lawsuit alleges that the abuse began when Ann Altman was three and Mr Altman was 12, and also includes an allegation of rape - with the filing alleging the last instance of abuse took place when Mr Altman was an adult but she was still a child. In a joint statement posted to his account on X with his mother and two brothers, the OpenAI boss denied the allegations, calling them ""utterly untrue"". ""Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her wellbeing,"" the statement said. ""Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult."" It added: ""Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. ""This situation causes immense pain to our entire family."" Mr Altman is one of the tech sector's most prominent figures.

Ms Altman has also previously made similar allegations against her brother on social media platforms. In the court documents, filed in the US state of Missouri, Ms Altman's lawyers say she has experienced mental health issues as a result of the alleged abuse. The lawsuit requests a jury trial and damages in excess of $75,000 (£60,000). Mr Altman is one of the tech sector's most prominent figures, having overseen the rise of OpenAI up to and since its launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, which sparked the ongoing boom around the generative AI technology that powers ChatGPT."

Silicon Valley's Indian dream: The fight over US's most controversial visa, the H1B Forbes India ^ | January 7, 2025 | Deedy Dos Posted on 01/07/2025 11:32:20 AM PST by wildcard_redneck A visa programme intended to attract top talent to the United States has become a lightning rod for controversy and an unexpected battleground in America's culture wars, with racial tensions against Indians at its core. The H1B work visa debate has drawn in figures like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Bernie Sanders, capturing the attention of over 200 million people online and affecting 1.7 billion people across the US and India. The controversy ignited when Sriram Krishnan's nomination as Trump's senior White House policy advisor on AI sparked outrage among the far-Right Republican faction. An old tweet about removing “country caps” and snippets from a podcast I did with Krishnan were misinterpreted as advocating for unlimited Indian immigration, while the elevation of Indian-Americans like Vivek Ramaswamy and Kash Patel to key government positions led some to question Trump's allegiance to the white Right. The H1B programme, restructured in 1990, allows employers to sponsor foreign workers for “specialty occupations” through an annual lottery system allocating 85,000 spots (65,000 general + 20,000 for advanced degrees). The process costs employers $12,000-15,000 per application, with about 14-17 percent success rate given the 470,000 applications in 2024. The visa is valid for three years, extensible to six years, during which most pursue green cards through EB-2 or EB-3 categories. Indians dominate the programme, receiving about 60 percent of new H1Bs and 80 percent of renewals. Due to the country cap limiting green cards to 7 percent per nation, over 1 million Indians and their families are stuck in a 130-150 year backlog, forcing them to continuously extend their H1Bs. The tech industry absorbs roughly 70 percent of H1B workers, with 50-70 percent of Silicon Valley being foreign-born. (Excerpt) Read more at forbesindia.com ...

I would definitely call that the intentional displacement of the American workforce and the colonization of America.

In reality he was a technical marketing manager. He was ALSO the one who tried to cover up the Pentium floating point flaw. His stock options were based on how many of the first Pentiums we would sell so he fabricated the results and then told executive staff it only showed up once in 3M years. The KEY problem is when it DID show up, it didn’t set the exception flag and just gave you the wrong answer. Impossible to write code to address the issue. This was withheld from validation and executive staff. Vinod Dham was fired when this all came out and he then jumped ship to Cyrix again claiming he was the father of the Pentium. He managed to mess up Cyrix by grabbing IP from both Intel and AMD. About 10 years ago I heard he was involved in some real estate scam in Florida. My first manager at Intel was from India and was 1.5 years late for my first review. He also thought it was beneath him to schedule meetings with subordinates. He was frog walked out the door by security and HR gave me 1.5 years of back pay and profound apologies. In my nearly 40 years working in semiconductor design, I have met 2 Indian engineers worth their salt.

We have a lot of friends who are Indian-born and most are very Americanized. But the dirty little secret of Indian visas is that it is largely controlled by the Brahmin caste members here in the US. Brahmins come over here, get influence in hiring decisions and make sure only other Brahmins get the visas.

Credit: Shutterstock / Jay Fog The US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a fresh complaint against Google, alleging that the company acts as the employer of certain contract workers and must negotiate with their union, Reuters reports . The Board has said Google is a “joint employer” for roughly 50 San Francisco-based content creators hired through IT contractor Accenture Flex. These workers, who joined the Alphabet Workers Union in 2023, should be considered under the tech giant’s purview, according to the agency, the report said. An administrative judge will now hear the complaint, with the decision subject to review by the NLRB’s five-member panel. If the Board confirms Google’s status as a joint employer for the Accenture Flex contractors, the tech giant would be compelled to engage in collective bargaining and could be held accountable for breaches of federal labor law. NLRB is also looking into a separate complaint from October, which accuses Google and Accenture Flex of altering working conditions without consulting the union first, according to the report. This follows the NLRB’s January 2024 ruling requiring Google to negotiate with employees at YouTube Music — an Alphabet subsidiary — hired through a different staffing firm. Google has appealed the decision, and a US federal court is scheduled to review the case later this month. Google has faced growing labor challenges, marked by worker protests and layoffs . Last year, the company removed a $15-an-hour minimum wage for contractors and implemented changes aimed at sidestepping union negotiations. Implications for the industry Google has stated that it does not have sufficient control over contract workers to qualify as their joint employer, according to the report. The outcome of the case could set a precedent for how contract workers are treated across the tech industry, where companies frequently rely on third-party staffing firms. “Companies may need to rethink their mix of employment types and how they engage contract and gig workers,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “In a worst-case scenario, this work could be moved to locations where such regulations don’t exist. Alternatively, companies might face additional compliance requirements, costs, and audits if the NLRB wins against major corporations.” Meanwhile, large corporations may need to adopt a more flexible stance on the issue, as the number of contract and gig workers is expected to grow, Gogia added. A decision against Google could also energize unionization efforts within the tech sector, offering a roadmap for organizing workers in an industry that has traditionally resisted union activity. “The topic is also profoundly interlinked with the country’s political climate,” Gogia said. “If one were to consider the past stand that the Trump administration had on the subject, it is clear that the concept of joint employer may not see the light of day after all.” SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

Cybersecurity has become a fast-growing segment of Israel's high-tech sector, which is a key economic growth driver accounting for 20% of economic activity, 16% of jobs and more than half its exports. In its State of the Cyber Nation Report, YL said that despite geopolitical instability, it foresees Israel's cybersecurity influence expanding ""from a hotbed of exceptional security solutions to widespread recognition of Israeli cybersecurity startups as dominant global market leaders"". YL noted that there were 89 funding rounds in Israel in 2024 and 50 of them were seed, or early stage rounds, raising a total of $400 million. The report said global VCs more than doubled their funding rounds in 2024. In growth stages - so-called C and higher rounds - there were 16 rounds raising $2.9 billion, up 300% from $888 million in 2023, YL said. In all, Israeli cyber firms raised $1.89 billion in 2023. ""The changes we're observing in 2024 -- global VCs investing earlier in companies, an opening up of the seed and growth round markets and more acquisitions, especially by Israeli companies --signal a rising tide for 2025,"" says Andy Ellis, partner at YL Ventures. ""While the floodgates aren't going to crash open, expect to see more activity across the board: A and B rounds should become more accessible, C and later rounds larger and an increase in seed rounds."" Ofer Schreiber, senior partner and head of YL's Israel office, credits Israel's elite military intelligence units for its success by creating ""a no-nonsense, hands-on entrepreneurship culture"". He added that the war that began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 had forced cyber founders into a new reality as many in the tech sector had been called into military service. ""Founders needed to rally to ensure business and operational continuity in uncertain economic conditions and with a concerned customer base,"" Schreiber said.

Bing and Google searches often search for the word Google. Microsoft is using Google-like art on Bing. At this point, it's pretty safe to say Google's Doodles are fairly well known. There's even a site dedicated to Doodles that hosts the library of images used. It's also safe to say the tech industry has a penchant for preferring a particular art style for a lot of the art we see online; whether you want to call it minimal realism or toyism, the tech industry loves the style , especially Google . This blur in style may be the reason Microsoft is currently using some Google-looking art when you search the word Google (as spotted by Windows Latest and reblogged by 9to5google ), complete with a search box, just like a Google Doodle. Yep, when you search the word Google on Bing, you're taken to a page that looks like a Google Doodle, except when you search, you're actually searching Bing. Bing is looking a lot like Google Can this really be a coincidence? Close Can you quickly tell which is Google and which is Bing? You can test this for yourself on your desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet, whether you use the site or the Bing app. Viewing the result on a large screen is where things look eerily similar to Google. On your phone, using your browser or the Bing app, things are a little more obvious you're not searching with Google, thanks to the donation text under the search box (as seen below). This donation text is also there when searching on larger screens; it's just much less noticeable (as seen above).

It stands to reason Google is a regularly searched term on Bing as well. So why not make people feel at home before serving up the actual link to Google? Or maybe Microsoft really likes minimal realism, to the point it isn't aware it's spoofing the look of Google Search on its search page results for Google.

The trade show sees thousands of tech firms – as well as around 100,000 attendees, including industry executives and media – see thousands of new products and services announced over the course of the four-day show. It is seen as one of the key events in the tech industry calendar and is one of the largest shows of its kind, with a particular focus on smaller firms looking for a place to showcase their innovations. Every major European country is there - France is big, but so is the Netherlands, and even Ukraine might be bigger than the UK Gary Shapiro “This is where CEOs come to meet each other and to see what innovation can help grow their companies and their processes,” Mr Shapiro told the PA news agency. “We are the largest technology event in the world by far, almost by every measure. “We’re not a consumer event, we’re definitely the largest business event in the United States, and every year we get the most international visitors – we’ll have over 50,000 people from outside the United States.” On the UK’s presence, Mr Shapiro said: “The UK used to be much more engaged, frankly. “If you go around the Eureka Park (an area of the convention), every major European country is there – France is big, but so is the Netherlands, and even Ukraine might be bigger than the UK. “I don’t think it (CES) has the same support from the Government that other countries provide it, which is interesting because the UK actually has a lot of tech innovation and potential. “You’re such a close ally, it’s kind of crazy, it doesn’t make any sense, I can’t explain it.” According to the list of exhibitors on the official CES website, 41 companies from the UK will have a presence at the show, including Etc – the incubation arm within the BT Group, female tech firm Elvie and precise location company what3words. A UK Government spokesperson said: “Supporting our tech sector is central to our mission to transform public services, drive economic growth, and boost productivity. We recognise the valuable work of CES in championing innovation and fostering collaboration within the global tech industry, connecting businesses of all sizes from across the world “We recognise the valuable work of CES in championing innovation and fostering collaboration within the global tech industry, connecting businesses of all sizes from across the world.” A key figure in the US tech sector, Mr Shapiro also said the CTA was “excited” about the return of Donald Trump to the White House after previously working with the president-elect and his team during his first term. “They did a lot of very positive things in a very pro-business environment,” Mr Shapiro told PA, but added that he had some concerns around Mr Trump’s plans to introduce more tariffs on goods coming to the US. “What we don’t feel as great about is the issue of tariffs spiralling out of control, causing inflation, and obviously countries will reciprocate, and that’s what led us to the Great Depression 100 years ago, that same attitude,” he said. “Most economists recognise that tariffs are inflationary and they’re not healthy for anybody, and they’re taxes on consumers. “We just released some numbers today, which show that the spending power of Americans would be affected by almost 100 billion dollars if he does everything he says he will in terms of people’s ability to buy smartphones, laptops, tablets, TVs and other things – so we’re concerned. “I’m optimistic, but I’m sure I’ll have a lot of moments of concern and angst. “Trump is not predictable – which is a strength for him in negotiations, but it causes angst in the business community.” MORE ABOUT UK Government CES France Las Vegas TVs Netherlands Donald Trump Ukraine BT Group Elvie White House European"

The RTX 50 series is just the latest example of how far things have gone off the rails. Sure, it’s cutting-edge, but when GPUs cost more than your monthly rent and guzzle power like a tech-obsessed Hummer, you have to wonder… What is even happening anymore? Survey ✅ Thank you for completing the survey! The innovation excuse is getting boring Every time NVIDIA drops a new GPU, it’s like they’re trying to outdo themselves – not just in performance but in how much they can charge. The RTX 5090, for instance, is rumoured to pack 1.7x the shader cores of its predecessor. Faster memory? Check. Better efficiency? Allegedly. And while all of this sounds great on a spec sheet, it’s hard to ignore that these “advancements” are coming with jaw-dropping price tags. Add As A Trusted Source For Google. Add as a preferred source on Google Sure, NVIDIA isn’t the only one guilty of this. Tech companies across the board keep chasing innovation at all costs – our costs, specifically. They’ll say things like, “It’s the future of gaming,” or, “It’s for the pros who demand the best,” but let’s be honest: how much of this cutting-edge tech actually benefits the average user? Also Read: CES 2025: Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA gear up to shape computing’s next big leap Supply chains, rare metals, and other price hikes Now, let’s give NVIDIA a sliver of credit. It’s not all their fault. The tech industry’s reliance on rare earth metals and fragile global supply chains isn’t exactly helping. NVIDIA’s GPUs are built using advanced 3nm chips from TSMC – chips that are as expensive to produce as they are difficult to source. Throw in geopolitical drama, rising material costs, and post-pandemic production struggles, and yeah, prices were bound to go up. But here’s the thing – NVIDIA’s been here before. They’ve seen these challenges coming for years. Yet instead of trying to soften the blow for consumers, they seem to be leaning into the chaos, treating every new GPU launch like an auction for the ultra-rich. What about the electricity bill? Oh, and don’t forget the power requirements. The RTX 5090 is rumoured to draw upwards of 450 watts. That’s not just a GPU; it’s a space heater with some shaders thrown in. Upgrading to this monstrosity doesn’t just mean a bigger PSU; it means rethinking your entire setup – cooling, airflow, maybe even wiring in another circuit breaker if you’re feeling fancy. This isn’t a GPU for the average gamer. It’s for people who treat gaming like a luxury sport, where the cost of entry includes upgrading your entire rig and bracing for a spike in your electricity bill. And let’s not even start on the environmental impact of all this power-hungry hardware. That sure isn’t cheap to run Also Read: Sam Altman on AGI: OpenAI visionary on the future of AI Tech industry’s growing divide Here’s the real kicker – this isn’t just a NVIDIA problem; it’s a tech industry problem. Across the board, companies are doubling down on “innovation” that’s pricing out regular users. Whether it’s smartphones creeping past $2,000 or laptops marketed as “pro” that cost as much as a used car, the message is clear: if you’re not rolling in cash, you’re not invited. For NVIDIA, the RTX 50 series epitomises this trend. It’s packed with AI features, real-time ray tracing, and other buzzwords that look great in marketing but feel increasingly irrelevant for gamers who just want to enjoy smooth gameplay without financial regret. Casual users and budget gamers? Good luck. NVIDIA’s got their eyes on the whales. What’s next? As GPUs get more expensive and power-hungry, the divide between the haves and the have-nots in tech is only growing wider. Enthusiasts with disposable income will keep chasing the latest and greatest, while everyone else is left scavenging for last-gen hardware and “mid-tier” products that still cost a small fortune. So here’s a thought, NVIDIA and friends: maybe it’s time to dial it back? Yes, we all appreciate innovation, but innovation without accessibility is just a flex. How about GPUs that don’t require a second mortgage or a small power plant to run? How about making technology for everyone again – not just the 1% only? Until then, the RTX 50 series might be the crown jewel of graphics technology, but for most of us, it’s just a shiny reminder of how out of touch the tech industry has become.

Cook joins other CEOs and companies donating hefty sums to the inauguration. Axios, citing unnamed sources, reported on the donation. An Apple spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment, but the donation came from Cook’s personal funds, not the company’s, according to Axios. Amazon, Meta and OpenAI’s Sam Altman also have reportedly each given $1 million to the inaugural fund. It actually is traditional for corporations in general to donate to inaugurations of incoming administrations, but tech companies have sought to establish friendlier ties with Trump than in his first term, when they were a frequent target.

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways China hopes it’s found its leverage in the tech war with Washington. The country holds a dominant position in the processing of critical minerals like gallium and lithium. Chinese companies like battery giant CATL have also emerged as key suppliers to automakers around the world. Now, Beijing may be leaning into that dominance to respond to U.S. moves denying access to semiconductors and other advanced technologies. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce proposed new restrictions on exports of technology used to make battery cathodes, as well as those used to process gallium and lithium, key minerals used for electronics and electric vehicles. One proposed restriction concerns lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are used in several EV models including those from Tesla and BYD. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Commerce Ministry is now seeking public comment on the new rules until Feb. 1, according to state news agency Xinhua. If these rules are implemented, they would just be the latest in a series of Chinese export restrictions targeting critical minerals and the technologies to process them. Last month, Beijing banned the export of gallium, germanium, and antimony, key metals used in chipmaking, to the U.S. after the U.S. Commerce Department subjected more Chinese companies to export controls. The U.S. and China blacklists On Thursday, China also announced it would limit exports of “dual-use” items to 28 U.S. firms, including General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing Defense, Space & Security. It also added 10 U.S. companies to its “unreliable entities” list, which bars them from doing business in China. Beijing cited arms sales to the island of Taiwan as its reason for the designation. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement These blacklists are part of Beijing’s broader response to U.S. efforts to constrain exports to China’s tech sector. The U.S. first stepped up its restrictions on China’s tech sector under the Trump administration when it put companies like Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. on its trade blacklist. The Biden administration later upped the ante and introduced export control measures in October 2022 that curbed the sale of advanced chips or chipmaking equipment to China without permission. The Biden administration tightened those restrictions in October 2023 and once again in December 2024. Even as Asia-based companies like TSMC and Samsung control much of advanced chipmaking, U.S. companies still play a pivotal role in the production process. For example, Nvidia is involved in chip design, while Applied Materials provides equipment and services for chipmakers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The U.S. is also using other measures, like a ban on U.S. investment into China’s tech sector and import bans on Chinese products, to put pressure on China’s tech sector. On Thursday, the Biden administration said it was considering a new rule that will control sales of Chinese-made drones in the U.S. Beijing is now trying to adopt these tactics for itself. The “unreliable entities” list was first released in 2020, following the Trump administration’s blacklisting of Huawei. Then, in November, Beijing introduced rules that would allow it to control exports of “dual-use” technologies, or those that could be used for military purposes, to designated companies. Still, Thursday’s blacklisting is unlikely to have much of an effect on the companies named. The U.S. firms on both lists are primarily defense contractors, with minimal exposure to the Chinese market. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com About Our Ads"

The tech industry employed 5.43 million professionals, with a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in FY24, focusing on Generative AI, cloud and cybersecurity skills. The expansion into tier 2 and 3 cities is seen as critical to bridging talent shortages, according to Grant Thornton Bharat's '2025 Tech Trends Report'. ""As far as India is concerned, technology companies will need to navigate the business growth challenges as well as seize the new opportunities from Generative AI and new tech in 2025,"" said Raja Lahiri, partner and technology industry leader, Grant Thornton Bharat. The country's focus on GenAI and Engineering Research and Development (ER&D) services drove 7.4 per cent growth, with aerospace, defence and automotive leading digital engineering projects. Moreover, with 1,700 global capability centres (GCCs), India remains a hub for tech innovation, bolstered by investor interest and a strong start-up ecosystem, the report mentioned. ""India is expected to continue to dominate the global technology services market driven by the availability of massive tech, engineering talent as well as high-quality business and digital transformation impact on global clients,"" Lahri added. Despite challenges, the industry's vast talent pool and growing adoption of generative AI, SaaS and digital transformation projects position it for a moderate recovery in 2025. According to the report, Indian companies would need to create and foster a culture of excellence in quality, innovation and customer experience to lead the world of tech in the New Year. The Indian tech industry faced slowing revenue growth and rising employee costs in FY24, spurred by high attrition rates during the pandemic. ""Firms must balance cost containment with strategic investments in innovation to navigate economic uncertainties and maintain competitiveness in the evolving tech landscape,"" the report mentioned. India's deeptech ecosystem, comprising over 3,600 start-ups, demonstrates immense potential in areas like AI, space tech, and health tech. ""Strategic Gen AI deployment, encompassing use-case selection, robust governance, and operational efficiency, positions organisations to achieve long-term value creation, making AI a cornerstone of the digital transformation journey,"" it added."

He instructed Musk to “sit back and study” to understand MAGA’s - and what supporters believed was Trump’s - America First stance to keep U.S. jobs for Americans. “They’re recent converts,” Bannon said Tuesday on his War Room podcast, referring to Musk and other tech-world Trump supporters.

The visa issue is “central to the way they gutted the middle class in this country,” he complained. Trump strategist Steve Bannon: AP Musk was a Johnny-come-lately to politics before he forked over at least $250 million to help Trump get elected. Both he and tech entrepreneur (and Trump’s former rival for GOP presidential nomination) Vivek Ramaswamy have now been tasked by the president-elect with carving up the federal government to save money in their new DOGE operation. Musk and Ramaswamy have suddenly strongly spoken up in recent days on behalf of protecting special H-1B visas for skilled foreigners to fill high-level tech jobs, including in Musk’s businesses because American simply aren’t up to the task. The South African-born Musk last week endorsed a post on X that referred to American workers as “re***ed,” which is widely regarded as an ugly slur (Musk has since deleted his support for the attack post). Elon Musk: Reuters Elon Musk gives stark warning as he makes first appearance at Trump rally Ramaswamy has also complained that Americans are not up to snuff when it comes to competing with brainy foreigners. He blamed the dumbed-down culture of the U.S. Trump has backed Musk on the many “great” foreign workers in the country on H-1B visas, surprising many of the MAGA supporters who voted for him. Musk doesn’t appear to be budging, even though he has, out of character, suddenly called for a more “positive” and “beautiful” social media conversation. He made the appeal two days after he told H-1B opponents in a diatribe on X: “F*** yourself in the face.” Bannon came back with a different idea for Musk’s face.

The company had 742 initial and 1,025 continuing employment petitions approved, reflecting its growing reliance on foreign talent. Musk supports the H-1B visa program, essential for his business success. Major tech firms like Amazon, Cognizant, and Infosys also top the list, maintaining a demand for skilled workers. Loomer Vs Musk: Why Trump’s MAGA base is up in arms over H-1B visa | 5 things to know Elon Musk , a prominent advocate for the H-1B visa program , is speaking from both personal experience and as a business owner, with his company, Tesla , increasingly relying on foreign talent to fill key roles. Tesla, which previously did not make the top 25 list of H-1B visa employers, now ranks 16th in 2024, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP). The company’s increase in H-1B petitions signals a growing reliance on skilled foreign workers, with 742 initial petitions approved in 2024, more than double the 328 approved in 2023. Tesla also had 1,025 petitions for continuing employment approved in 2024. Musk, who himself worked in the US on an H-1B visa early in his career, has become one of the most vocal supporters of the program, which allows US companies to hire foreign workers for skilled positions. ""I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong because of H-1B,"" Musk posted on his social media platform X. He added that he would ""go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,"" highlighting the program's importance to his business success. Tesla's rise on the H-1B list follows a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies have long advocated for expanding the number of H-1B visas granted by the US government. The program, which is capped at 65,000 new visas annually, with an additional 20,000 available for workers holding advanced degrees, has been a critical pathway for skilled workers, particularly from countries like India, China, and the Philippines.

In fiscal year 2024, Amazon led the list with 3,871 approved petitions for initial employment, followed by Cognizant with 2,837 and Infosys with 2,504. Other major players in the tech industry, including IBM, Microsoft, and Google, also ranked high, with Tesla securing its place alongside these global giants. The H-1B program has been a cornerstone for many of the largest tech firms in the US, which rely on it to meet growing demands for skilled labor. As the debate over foreign workers continues, Musk's push for H-1B expansion remains a contentious issue, with business leaders advocating for broader access to talent, while critics argue that it undermines opportunities for domestic workers. With its increased reliance on the program, Tesla’s position as a top H-1B employer reflects the ongoing demand for skilled workers in the tech and engineering sectors, and Musk's vocal support underscores the stakes in the larger debate over US immigration policy.
