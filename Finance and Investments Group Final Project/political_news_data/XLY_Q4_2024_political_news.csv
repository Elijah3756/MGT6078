Carter became the 39th president in no small part because voters felt that simple offer of honesty was sufficient after the turmoil of the Richard Nixon era. Unfortunately for Carter and the country, it was never quite enough. Carter’s life spanned 10 decades of dizzying change. He was the first president born in a hospital and will surely be the last to remember life before electricity. His childhood farm in Georgia had been decimated by the Depression, then revived by the New Deal. He graduated from the Naval Academy the year before the Cold War began, and he took office shortly before the final Soviet invasion. His presidency bridged the end of FDR’s majority with the beginning of the Reagan Revolution. It also prefigured some of the defining challenges — energy dependence, climate change, partisan polarization — of the decades to come. Historians have generally ranked Carter in the middle-lower tier of U.S. presidents, amid the Garfields and Hayeses and Van Burens. They’ve at times overstated the case against him. Even so, at the center of Carter’s long life and short presidency lurked an enigma: How did this formidable man — widely considered tough, judicious, intelligent — end up by most accounts a disappointment in office? He wasn’t much of a politician, for one thing. Walter Mondale, his vice president, once said that Carter “thought politics was sinful.” The talent for trading favors, stroking egos, balancing coalitions — it eluded him entirely. Carter compounded this weakness by surrounding himself with loyalists and outsiders, fatally unwise to the ways of Washington. One result was that much of his ambitious agenda was thwarted. Although Democrats held huge majorities throughout his term, Carter struggled mightily to advance his goals. On taking office, he named Frank Moore, an obscure 41-year-old campaign hand, as his liaison to Congress; Moore soon became known as the “most maligned man” in Washington. Carter’s habit of dumping fully formed proposals on Congress routinely backfired. His tax reform of 1978, a major priority, was dead on arrival even among notional allies. (“He didn’t consult me when he was writing this bill,” recalled Democratic Sen. Russell Long, “so why should I consult him when I’m gutting it?”) There were successes, too. Carter secured peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David, a historic feat that helped end decades of violence. He agreed to an arms-limitation deal with Russia and came to support increased defense spending at a key moment in the Cold War. He normalized diplomatic relations with China, making the world safer and richer for decades. His efforts to deregulate industry — including the airlines, freight railroads and interstate trucking — helped lay the groundwork for the miraculous consumer economy of the 21st century. Yet it was Carter’s inability to effectively wield the powers of the presidency that would be his undoing. His failure to free 52 American hostages in Iran for more than a year became a microcosm of U.S. impotence. His response to the 1979 energy crisis — going on prime time, warning of the perils of “self-indulgence and consumption” — proved irresistible to his foes. In announcing his intention to challenge Carter for the 1980 Democratic nomination, Sen. Ted Kennedy said: “Now, the people are blamed for every national ill, scolded as greedy, wasteful, and mired in malaise.” (Thus did Carter’s address become the “malaise speech,” although he never uttered the word.) A year on, Ronald Reagan was asking voters two simple questions: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” and “Is America as respected throughout the world?” He would defeat the incumbent in a landslide. It is generally held that Carter was a better former president than president. Opinions may vary on his overseas activism or his tendency to criticize his successors. Undeniably, he was an energetic force for democracy and public service. More to the point: Who could deny the evocative power of an aging former president, stooped but vibrant, building homes for the poor, teaching Sunday school, simply getting on with the business of life after so many often-brutal setbacks? That, too, was Carter. That was no lie. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X RevContent Feed"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Erik Sherman reports on business, economics, finance, tech, and law. Follow Author Dec 31, 2024, 12:54pm EST Share Save Comment Depressed Asian young girl feel worry about financial problem in house. Stressed desperate young woman looking frustrated to paperwork and bills think of money debt, budget loss, bankruptcy at home. getty Economists and business leaders have regularly pointed to consumer spending as a good sign for the economy. Understandably why, because about 69% of gross domestic product — GDP, the typical economic measure — is consumer spending. A red flag of credit card defaults has gone up that should make everyone take much greater care. Why consumer spending is critical Without that seemingly indefatigable consumer spending engine, things would freeze up. Even worse, there would be chain reactions. Companies that did direct business with people would see their revenues drop. They would conserve resources by laying off employees and spending less with their vendors. Those vendors — business-to-business companies — would then protect themselves by similar actions. More people would become unemployed, face economic pressure, and reduce their own spending as much as possible, causing yet another round of spending reductions. In the parlance of control theory, you get a whopping positive feedback loop, which isn’t positive in the emotional or strategic sense. Actions keep moving things in a given direction until they might oscillate out of control, like driving a car that skids under icy or wet road conditions and then steering the wrong way and spinning. Credit takes place of income People have continued to spend, and for the wealthier that may be fine because they have the necessary resources to do so. A majority of U.S. households, however, have found themselves left behind over the last 40 years. Median wage growth has not kept pace with inflation , those at the economic 25 th percentile have lost value every year, and the people at the 75 th percentile and above have seen real earnings grow by around 10% a year. MORE FOR YOU What happens when people’s incomes don’t keep up with growing costs, especially during high inflation jumps that permanently increase the cost of living, is that they look to make up the difference in other ways, like credit cards and other forms of highly expensive revolving credit. The following graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis is of consumer loan data from the Fed’s Board of Governors. Growth of credit card and revolving consumer debt. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis The more such credit use grows, the top-heavier the economy. A current major red flag indicates that things are more precariously balanced than is generally admitted. Credit card defaults skyrocket The Financial Times recently ran an article on how U.S. credit card loan defaults are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Using information from BankRegData, which regularly follows and collates data from regulatory agencies, the FT reported that credit card lenders wrote off $46 billion in seriously delinquent loan balances from January through September 2024. That was up 50% from the same period in 2023 and the largest amount in 14 years. As an example, Capital One said that as of November, the percentage of its overall loans marked as unrecoverable reached 6.1%, up from last year’s 5.2%. Overall, might mean a larger selection of loan types, not just credit cards. “High-income households are fine, but the bottom third of US consumers are tapped out,” Mark Zandi, head of Moody’s Analytics, told the paper. “Their savings rate right now is zero.” According to the FT , as of the end of September 2024, those who can’t pay off their credit card balances in full paid $170 billion in interest over the previous 12 months. The hope that the Fed would keep slashing rates, eventually resulting in lower credit card terms, disappeared just over a week ago when they projected that inflation would rise in 2025 and that there would be far fewer rate cuts next year. Maybe people can keep their credit use in safe hands, but with credit card defaults on the rise, concern about the economy is the least people can offer.

Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. While that is $25 billion less than the previous three years' average, based on Vanda Research's data, it's still within the post-COVID-19 range — indicating a healthy appetite for the average investor to be engaged with markets. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD ( AMD ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Palantir ( PLTR ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Amazon ( AMZN ). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Nvidia has pulled in $29.8 billion in retail net inflows this year, per Vanda Research's findings, up from $11.4 billion last year. Tesla's retail inflows dropped to $14.7 billion from $48 billion in 2023. Tesla still edged out Nvidia as the top holding in retail investor portfolios, however — representing a 10.58% average portfolio weighting compared to 10.33% for Nvidia. The other four top tickers were more index-based trades levered to popular themes such as AI: Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares ( SOXL ), Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ ( TQQQ ), and SPDR S&P 500 ( SPY ). ""2024 was an eventful year for markets,"" Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said. ""For the average retail investor, it was another great year of portfolio performance. Loyalty to tech names paid off."" Retail investors' portfolios beat S&P, Nasdaq Indeed that tech loyalty did pay off. Vanda Research estimates that the average retail portfolio is up 40.74% this year, the second-highest performance since 2014. Only 2023's 41.94% performance was better over this 10-year time span. On a flow-adjusted basis, Vanda Research noted that this would mark the second time retail investors have beaten the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) in back-to-back calendar years and the first time since 2014 that the non-institutional crowd beat the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ). Whether the feel-good times for retail investors will continue in 2025 is anyone's guess. On the positive side, the incoming Trump administration has promised business-friendly policies such as cutting government spending through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and extending tax cuts. Story Continues “I’m not saying it’s going to be perfect, but I’m saying the possibilities of us doing very well over the span of the next few years is significant,” Joe Moglia , former CEO of TD Ameritrade, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below). But the markets are poised to enter January on a whimper despite potential pro-growth Trump policies as the outlook for Fed policy has become increasingly uncertain . The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year after its December meeting, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China . In a new interview on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid , San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly didn't rule out a potential rate hike. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 2% and 5%, respectively, in December. The Nasdaq Composite is up 1.4%. Market leader Nvidia is down 1% in December. ""The stock market in 2025 will likely experience fluctuations, but significant opportunities are seen in individual stock picks, especially in sectors like EVs, AI, healthcare, and quantum computing,"" MarketGauge chief strategist Michele Schneider told Yahoo Finance. ""Tax cuts and deregulation could spur growth, although tariffs and inflation remain risks. The year may start under pressure but rally towards the middle to end of the year posting modest gains, with a potential stagflation environment prevailing until mid-2026."" None of Schneider's top stock picks for 2025 would qualify as typical retail investor favorites: AbbVie ( ABBV ), Kratos ( KTOS ), International Business Machines ( IBM ), Salesforce ( CRM ), Coinbase ( COIN ), Chewy ( CHWY ), Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ), Alibaba ( BABA ), and Rivian ( RIVN ). But hey, maybe they will garner some retail investor attention. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market. Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

( JWN ) Stock Forecasts",20241230T144500Z,,finance.yahoo.com,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer economy,"Summary Monday Tee Up: Hello 2025! This will be another holiday-shortened week, as markets are closed on Wednesday for New Year's Day. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, the S&P 500 rose 0.7%, and Nasdaq was up 0.8%. Santa Claus has been nice to equity investors in 2024, but not so much in the final days of December. With just two trading days left in the year, the Dow is higher by 14%, the S&P is up 25%, and the Nasdaq has popped 31%. The new earnings season will kick off in mid-January with the big banks reporting first. For 2025, Argus forecasts 12% EPS growth for S&P 500 companies. This follows higher-than-expected 9% growth in 2024. On the economic calendar, there are only a few releases this week. On Tuesday, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index will be reported; on Thursday, Construction Spending; and on Friday, ISM Manufacturing. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja's Call of the Week is the ISM Manufacturing report, and he has offered the following thoughts. 'We are looking for Friday's report on Manufacturing New Orders to remain just above 50, signaling expansion. This is an important leading indicator and even modestly good news would be a welcomed sign for manufacturing -- which hasn't been pulling its weight in a strong consumer-driven economy.' Mortgage rates went up 13 basis points (bps) last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.85%, according to FreddieMac. The average price for regular gas held at $3.02 per gallon.

Photograph: Shailesh Andrade/Reuters The New Year could be a period of transformation for the Indian retail industry, one of the fastest-growing globally, where the contemporary retail landscape is rapidly evolving, influenced by the preferences of digital-first generation Gen Z and retail tech. Helped by tailwinds such as rising disposable income, rapid urbanisation, the rise of non-metro tier II cities, and growing middle class along with a digitally-savvy consumer base, the organised retail sector is poised to grow expanding its play further with a customer-centric approach. ""FY25 is likely to see continued focus on building supply chain efficiencies, along with upgrades to logistics hubs and tracking systems to meet fast delivery demands. ""Employment generation in quick commerce, logistics, and related sectors is also expected to continue,"" said EY India Tax Leader for Retail Practice Paresh Parekh. Indian consumers, influenced by global exposure and digital technologies, are prioritising higher quality and value for money. This has resulted in a shift in spending from luxuries to essentials or more affordable options. ""Despite these challenges, the outlook for 2025 remains positive, driven by demographic trends, urbanisation, digital growth, and the aspirations of a young, dynamic middle class,"" he said. Parekh expects an increase in foreign investments in the retail sector and a continuance of consolidation led by PE firms and strategic acquisitions. According to the Retailers Association of India (RAI), the Indian retail sector in 2024 has witnessed a mix of challenges and opportunities. ""Growth was subdued in the first half, with marginal consumption increases and cautious consumer spending. ""Many retailers struggled to achieve like-for-like growth, reflecting shifting consumer priorities,"" said its CEO Kumar Rajagopalan adding ""Despite this, the year also brought innovation and resilience."" Retailers have embraced technology to enhance operations and customer experience and initiatives like ONDC are creating exciting new opportunities, particularly in reaching untapped markets. ""Looking ahead, the sector remains cautiously optimistic. The festive and wedding seasons have boosted momentum, and with strategic planning, retailers can sustain growth into 2025,"" he said. The Indian retail sector contributes around 10 per cent to its GDP and according to the latest annual report of leading retailer, Reliance it is expected to cross $1.4 trillion by 2027. It is also poised to become the third-largest market by 2030. Over the emergence of quick commerce, Deloitte India partner, consumer products and retail sector Anand Ramanathan said it is a ""viable business model"" and it is here to stay. 2024 has been disruptive for the retail sector, which besides the emergence of quick commerce, also saw the revival of mass consumption and the value retail segment for the first time since the pandemic. ""100 million middle-income households will be added this decade to the economy. 2025 will continue to see the impact of this growth in middle-income households with further momentum in mass consumption. ""This will have a positive impact across sectors including fashion, home and food services,"" said Ramanathan. Puneet Mansukhani, sector head - Retail KPMG said in 2024 retailers faced significant challenges due to inflation impacting profitability and supply chain disruptions. ""These issues required strategic pricing adjustments and innovative solutions to maintain smooth operations. ""The festive season did see some uptake as compared to the previous year but overall the customer was cautious. ""The ecommerce spend in the tier 2 and 3 cities was stronger than urban and the trend is likely to continue which makes the retailers feel bullish and optimistic in 2025,"" he said.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. John Navin is a Colorado-based journalist who writes about stocks. Follow Author Dec 29, 2024, 11:15am EST Share Save Comment Retail stocks getty The exchange traded fund that reflects the price movements of a host of retail stocks hit a new high in November but failed to make it quite that high in December. Certain individual retail equities, on the other hand, found a way to keep going and then established the higher highs. No one disputes the value of diversity when it comes to buying stocks but the investor who can discern which might be better than others could come out ahead. With that in mind, here is the retail ETF chart — and the charts of four individual names that have outperformed it lately. 4 Retail Stocks Outperforming The Retail ETF SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE: XRT) First, the underperforming fund: SPDR S&P Retail ETF daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The retail fund with 80 holdings took off in November, couldn’t make the new high in December and dropped to the 50-day moving average before bouncing. How the holiday revenue numbers come in will be interesting but it looks as if expectations for the sector in general might be coming down a bit. MORE FOR YOU Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE: BBW) Build-A-Bear Workshop daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com This is what is meant by “outperforming.” The stock went ahead and made it up to a new high this month, no problem. There has been no significant dip down toward the 50-day moving average. You can see how different this is than the pattern for the SPDR Retail ETF. The specialty retail company is relatively lightly traded with an average daily volume of 266,000 shares. Build-A-Bear Workshop has a market capitalization of $610 million. It’s a Russell 2000 component. Some people don’t like it: the short float is 10.03%, on the high side. Dillards (NYSE: DDS) Dillards daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in mid-December, thought to be a bullish kind of signal. The breakout above the July high came this month and buyers really came in at that point. The department store chain has a market cap of $7.26 billion. This is another one that’s lightly traded: average daily volume is 144,000 shares. With a short float of 14%, it’s likely that a good portion of this move came from shorts rushing to get covered. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) Tapestry daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The late December high is higher than the late November high as designated on this chart by the red dotted line. The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average in early October, a sign of bullishness to come. From the August low to the recent high is almost a double. Tapestry is a luxury goods outfit whose brands include Coach, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. Market cap is $15.28 billion. The company pays a dividend of 2.14%. Urban Outfitters (NYSE: URBN) Urban Outfitters daily price chart, 12 29 24. stockcharts.com The late November gap up took the price above the previous price resistance from July of $49. Unlike the movement of the retail ETF, this one just kept making new highs in December. The 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average mid-month. The short float is 10.43% — this is another of the retail stocks that may be benefitting from shorts being forced to cover their positions. Urban Outfitters is a retail apparel business with a market cap of $5.16 billion. The stock is a component of the Russell 2000. Brands include Anthropologie, Menus and Venues and Urban Outfitters.

Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian This article is more than 10 months old Nearly 170,000 UK shop workers lost their jobs in 2024 This article is more than 10 months old Collapse of chains such as Homebase and Body Shop contributed to big rise, and another tough year is on the cards Almost 170,000 retail workers lost their jobs during another challenging year for the UK high street, data suggests. The collapse of big chains such as Homebase and The Body Shop put thousands of jobs at risk and contributed to 169,395 retail jobs disappearing during 2024 – a 42% rise on 2023 levels. End-of-year figures compiled by the Centre for Retail Research registered the highest annual reading since more than 200,000 jobs were lost in 2020 in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced retailers to shut their stores during lockdowns. The centre said 38 big retailers went into administration in 2024, with further household names including Lloyds Pharmacy , Carpetright and Ted Baker . Administration accounted for about a third of all 2024 retail job losses – 55,914 in total – with the remainder axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small independent stores shuttering unprofitable stores. Homebase collapses into administration with thousands of jobs at risk Read more Retailing jobs form a sizeable portion of the country’s overall job market, with 2.87m roles representing about 8.5% of all UK jobs , according to the most recent figures from the British Retail Consortium. The trade body calculates that retail vacancies are about 30% lower than they were in the period immediately preceding the pandemic. Overall employment appears to have remained relatively steady, with a historical UK average of 2.77m retail jobs between 1978 and 2023, although the population has risen by 13m since the 1970s. Prof Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: “The comparatively low [job loss] figures for 2023 now look like an anomaly, a pause for breath by many retailers after lockdowns if you like. “The problems of changed customer shopping habits, inflation, rising energy costs, rents and business rates have continued and forced many retailers to cut back even more strongly in 2024.” Experts have said small high street shops could face a particularly challenging 2025 because of tax rises announced in this autumn’s budget as well as wage changes. Companies will see an increase in national insurance contributions as well as a reduction in discounts for business rates next year. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The British Retail Consortium has also predicted that an increase in employer national insurance contributions and a reduction in the threshold at which companies start paying will create a £2.3bn bill for the sector. Bamfield warned of another bleak year in 2025, predicting that as many as 202,000 jobs could be lost. “By increasing both the costs of running stores and the costs on each consumer’s household it is highly likely that we will see retail job losses eclipse the height of the pandemic in 2020.” Explore more on these topics Retail industry Job losses news Share Reuse this content"

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey for 2023/24, conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, showed non-food items accounted for about 53% of per capita spending in rural areas, up from about 47% in 2011/12, and 60% in urban areas, up from about 57%. The shift in spending patterns is expected to lead to a decrease in the weighting of food items in the consumer price index (CPI), which is used by the central bank to frame monetary policy. Officials from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation have previously indicated plans to revise the base year for the retail inflation data from 2012 to 2024, incorporating these findings. Analysts said food is likely to have a smaller weighting in India's consumer price index in the near future. The urban-rural monthly per capita consumer spending gap narrowed to 70% in 2023/24 from 84% in 2011/12, the report noted. In nominal terms, rural consumer spending climbed 9.55% year on year to 4,122 rupees ($48.23) per month in the year through July from 3,773 rupees the previous year, while urban spending rose 8.31% to 6,996 rupees from 6,459 rupees, the report showed. Adjusted for inflation, rural spending grew just 3.5%, while urban spending remained subdued due to retail inflation of about 5.5% in the fiscal year that ended in March. Compared with 2011/12, rural consumer spending rose 45.4%, outpacing the 38.1% increase in urban areas, reflecting a slight convergence in consumption patterns. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 58% of India's economic activity, remains a critical driver of economic growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

Over the course of the year, these industry titans fiercely competed for consumer loyalty, market dominance and innovation leadership. Here’s a recap of the major moments in this ongoing battle, as covered by PYMNTS.

Δ Market Share and Consumer Spending The year kicked off with Amazon strengthening its lead over Walmart in consumer spending . By the end of 2023, Amazon accounted for 10% of all U.S. retail sales and 4.4% of total consumer spending, while Walmart captured 7.3% of U.S. consumer retail spending . This momentum carried into 2024, with Amazon securing 3.5% of consumer spending in the second quarter, compared to Walmart’s 2.9%. Digital Advertising and Retail Media Both companies ramped up their investments in digital advertising . Walmart expanded its retail media network, Walmart Connect , by adding display ads to Sam’s Club ’s Scan & Go feature and exploring new opportunities for non-endemic brands to advertise on in-store screens. Meanwhile, Amazon enhanced the appeal of its advertising services, including offering lower prices for Prime Video ad placements compared to Netflix . Loyalty Programs and Membership Perks Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The battle for paid memberships continued to heat up in 2024. By midyear, Amazon Prime led with a 67% penetration rate among U.S. consumers, while Walmart+ had grown to capture 30% of the market. To fuel further growth and deepen engagement, both companies introduced new benefits. Walmart teamed up with Burger King to offer dining perks for Walmart+ members, while Amazon expanded its Grubhub partnership , offering Prime members added food delivery advantages. Sales Events and Consumer Participation Prime Day and Walmart+ Week remained key battlegrounds in the retail rivalry. Amazon’s Prime Day set new records, with sales jumping 11% to surpass $14 billion. Although Walmart+ Week had lower overall participation, it experienced a massive 71% increase from the previous year. Interestingly, Walmart+ Week shoppers outspent their Amazon counterparts , averaging $473 per person compared to $326 for Prime Day shoppers. Innovation in Physical Retail Both companies advanced their efforts to digitize the in-store experience. Walmart revealed plans to implement digital shelf labels in 2,300 stores by 2026, enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience. Meanwhile, Amazon refined its Just Walk Out technology and smart shopping carts , while also licensing these innovations to other retailers. Expansion Into New Categories The rivalry between Amazon and Walmart also extended into new markets. Amazon ventured into the auto sales sector with its Amazon Autos platform, while Walmart forged third-party partnerships to strengthen its position in the same space. Both companies also ramped up their quick commerce initiatives, with Amazon testing 15-minute grocery deliveries in India to compete directly with Walmart-backed Flipkart . Additionally, Amazon’s push into rapid delivery services reflects its broader strategy to challenge Walmart’s dominance in the eCommerce and delivery sectors. Discounting Strategies Price wars between Amazon and Walmart gathered steam as both retailers intensified their discounting strategies to appeal to budget-conscious consumers. Amazon was reportedly set to introduce a new section showcasing low-cost items shipped from China , while Walmart unveiled its “largest savings event ever” in July , aiming to capture more price-sensitive shoppers. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, the Amazon-Walmart rivalry shows no signs of slowing down. Both companies remain at the forefront of innovation, expanding their offerings with new technologies like Amazon’s MK30 delivery drone and Walmart’s gamified marketplace, Walmart Realm . These initiatives highlight their drive to redefine the retail experience and stay ahead of the competition. Neil Saunders , managing director , retail , at research firm GlobalData , told PYMNTS Walmart and Amazon were both “retail winners” this year. “They are two of the main powerhouses of U.S. retail and are driving good growth,” he explained. “The mainstay of Walmart’s success is in grocery which, interestingly, is an area where Amazon continues to struggle . Amazon’s success is mostly in general merchandise and making their delivery speed faster and more convenient. Both retailers are seeing growth among more price-sensitive consumers who are seeking value. Walmart and Amazon are well positioned for further success in 2025.” Meanwhile, Greg Zakowicz , senior eCommerce expert at Omnisend , agreed Walmart and Amazon were both winners in 2024. “Walmart took a long-term approach to building up its business to appeal to higher-income shoppers without alienating its core base, and the combination of economic challenges and improved offerings made 2024 a pivotal and successful year for the retailer,” Zakowicz explained to PYMNTS. “It managed to increase its share of higher-income households and reshape its brand perception through its product offerings and logistics infrastructure — something Amazon is best known for.” Memberships are key to customer loyalty, he added, and “Prime has been the dominant membership and I don’t see that changing in 2025, but Walmart has made substantial progress. Its perks, such as a Paramount+ subscription and same-day grocery delivery, make it an attractive offering that effectively counters what Amazon offers, especially as consumers look for value. I think Walmart has done a good job of creating perks useful and appealing for customers. This is their Trojan horse into becoming a first-choice retailer for goods once commonly associated with Amazon.” Walmart has an advantage over Amazon in groceries, particularly with membership services , Zakowicz added . Same-day, free delivery and expanded product lines, like organics, make Walmart appealing to all income levels. “I’m most curious to see how Walmart’s renewal rates are in 2025, especially for those who joined during their $49 promotion,” he noted. “This will be Walmart’s indication of how well they are creating value for their members and can impact their product strategy moving forward. Poor renewal rates could lead to choosing to reduce certain product lines, such as organics, which could lead to further defections.” In 2025, Zakowicz said key areas to watch include: Walmart’s membership renewal rates. Amazon’s increased ads in Prime Video, and whether they impact renewals or drive paid ad-free upgrades. The speed at which both companies adapt to new trends, like Amazon’s fast-follow of Chinese sellers with Amazon Haul versus Walmart’s more calculated approach. The impact of tariffs on each company, and which one is better insulated, will be crucial to monitor.

The report comes after data from MRI Software showed Boxing Day shopper footfall was down (Dominic Lipinski/PA) PA Wire Anna Wise 27 December 2024 Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . The number of UK retailers on the brink of collapse surged by a quarter in recent months, a new report has warned. The strain on the retail sector follows new data showing a drop in the number of people heading to the shops during Boxing Day sales. The latest Red Flag Alert report from insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor found 2,124 UK retailers were in critical financial distress between October and December 16. This was 25% higher than in the previous three months, between July and September, although marked a slight decline of nearly 1% compared with the same period a year ago. The latest figures include a 29% quarter-on-quarter surge in the number of general retailers on the brink of collapse, and a 17% jump among food and drug retailers. This year has highlighted the resilience and adaptability of some UK retailers, but the sector remains under significant strain Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor Online sellers, takeaway food shops and mobile food stands, and convenience shops were among the businesses struggling the most. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “This year has highlighted the resilience and adaptability of some UK retailers, but the sector remains under significant strain. “Clearly, some retailers have found ways to manage financial pressures effectively, but others, particularly in general retail, are struggling under the weight of rising operational costs and squeezed consumer spending.” The report from Begbies comes after data from MRI Software showed Boxing Day shopper footfall was down 7.6% across all UK retail destinations compared with last year.

We expect elevated insolvency levels across this sector during 2025 Julie Palmer Clothing and footwear retailers had a weaker November than previous years with sales volumes declining by 2.6% for the month, according to the latest official figures. Homebase was one of the household names to announce it had called in administrators last month, after being hit hard by an “incredibly challenging” three years for the DIY sector. Ms Palmer said this poorer performance in “traditionally a critical month for the sector, further underscores the tough trading conditions, as consumers hold off on purchases amid low confidence and rising prices”. “Adding to this uncertainty, the measures announced in the autumn Budget , including the planned increase to employers’ national insurance contributions, will significantly dial up the challenges faced by these businesses,” she added. “These changes, alongside increases to the minimum wage, will negatively impact cash flow and, consequently, we expect elevated insolvency levels across this sector during 2025.” Homebase called in administrators last month (Peter Byrne/PA) PA Wire Ms Palmer said that the marginal year-on-year decline in the number of retailers facing critical distress provided a “glimmer of home” with some businesses finding ways to adapt to financial pressures and changing shopping behaviours. But she said others were more “vulnerable” to online competitors such as Temu and Shein , which have drawn in swathes of shoppers attracted to low-cost fast-fashion. Meanwhile, a total of 28,747 retail businesses in the UK were also in significant financial distress over the latest quarter, dropping from 34,494 over the same period last year.

The sustained growth momentum, coupled with a reduced risk of rapid labor market cooling, has provided the Federal Reserve with justification for its recent hawkish policy shift. On December 19, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the final GDP growth rate for Q3 was 3.1% (annualized, seasonally adjusted), surpassing the preliminary estimate of 2.8% released a month earlier. This figure also exceeded the 2.9% forecast by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones. The final GDP data incorporates economic indicators not available during the preliminary estimate. The Department of Commerce attributed the upward revision to stronger-than-expected export and consumer spending figures. Exports rose by 9.6%, a 2.1 percentage-point increase from the preliminary estimate, while personal consumption expenditures grew by 3.7%, up 0.2 percentage points. The growth in consumer spending marks the highest increase since Q1 of last year (4.9%). Despite forecasts that consumer spending would slow in the second half of the year due to slowing wage growth and dwindling household savings, these predictions have proven inaccurate. With consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, it remains a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. With the Q3 data revised upward, the U.S. economy has now recorded annualized growth above 3% for two consecutive quarters, following a 3.0% growth rate in Q2. Unlike South Korea, the U.S. reports GDP growth rates as annualized figures based on quarter-over-quarter changes, seasonally adjusted. The data underscores the resilience of the U.S. economy and suggests that the labor market is less likely to cool rapidly. Bolstered by this positive economic news, U.S. stock markets ended the tumultuous third week of December on a high note. On December 20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 498.02 points (1.18%) to close at 42,840.26. The S&P 500 gained 63.77 points (1.09%) to reach 5,930.85, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 199.83 points (1.03%) to 19,572.60. This marked the first time in 11 trading sessions that all three major indices closed higher. The Dow Jones, which had endured a 10-day losing streak until December 18—the longest since 1974—managed a sharp rebound over the next two days. The S&P 500 also saw its biggest single-day gain since early November. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism in a post-Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference, stating, “The downside risks to the labor market appear to have diminished. The U.S. economy is remarkable.” The Federal Reserve initiated a rate-cutting cycle in September, citing easing inflation and a cooling labor market as justification for a 0.50% rate cut (the so-called ""big cut""). However, with inflation stabilization slowing and labor market risks receding, the Fed has signaled a return to a more hawkish stance, indicating a slower pace of rate reductions. close close 건전한 댓글 문화 운영 원칙 댓글 안에 당신의 성숙함도 담아 주세요.

Why It Matters The latest data comes as economists had anticipated a climb from November's consumer confidence of 112.8 to 113.8, thus making the decline a notable shift following months of increasing optimism. Despite more positive reports in previous months, concerns remain about the economic outlook, leaving policymakers and businesses questioning whether the downturn in confidence will translate to slower growth in 2024. What to Know The board's consumer confidence index dropped to 104.7 this month, down from 112.8 in November. The index evaluates both current economic perceptions and expectations for the next six months, offering a snapshot of consumer sentiment. ... This month's most concerning figure came from a sharp fall in Americans' short-term outlook for income, business conditions and job opportunities. The metric plummeted over 12 points to 81.1, dangerously close to the threshold of 80 that signals a potential recession. Despite this drop, the proportion of Americans anticipating an economic downturn over the next year remained steady. Meanwhile, the board also reported that consumer assessments of current conditions slipped slightly, from 141.2 to 140.2. Other Reports on Consumer Spending Retail spending remained robust through November with a 0.7 percent monthly gain reflecting strong holiday shopping activity. Personal spending also climbed by 0.4 percent from October to November, bolstering broader economic momentum. Fueled by consumer spending, which drives nearly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, the nation's economy expanded at a healthy 3.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. Economists, however, are closely monitoring whether consumers can maintain this level of support amid a backdrop of rising uncertainties including President-elect Donald Trump 's return to the White House. Economists have previously raised red flags over Trump's plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10 percent on imports from China, a move experts warn could drive inflation higher. What People Are Saying Amid November's consumer confidence, Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that households might be underestimating the potential cost increases from such trade policies, or they may believe Trump's campaign promises won't translate into actual policy. ""Households for now seem to have their heads in the sand about the potential uplifts to consumer prices from tariffs and deportations, or they think Trump wasn't serious about his intentions during the campaign,"" Tombs wrote in a client note, according to The Associated Press. What Happens Next Despite the drop, the interplay between consumer confidence, spending and economic policy will shape the coming months, and the early days of Trump's presidency will likely play a pivotal role in determining whether previous upbeat expectations are justified.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File) Party City has been unable to overcome its financial challenges, its chief executives told employees Friday, especially the inflation that has increased costs and reduced consumer spending. So the company, which still had more than 700 stores, said it's starting to wind down operations immediately, reports CNN , which watched the video meeting. Corporate employees were informed that Friday was their last day, that there would be no severance pay, and that their benefits are ending. ""It's really important for you to know that we've done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,"" Barry Litwin told them. The struggles aren't new, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2023, which let it cancel debt of almost $1 billion. Some stores closed after that as part of the restructuring, per Yahoo Finance . But $800 million in debt remained a drag on the company. Until now, Party City was the largest party supply store in the US; it had about 6,400 full-time and 10,100 part-time employees as of 2021, per CNN. The company was competing with not just larger chains such as Walmart and Costco but Amazon and Halloween pop-up stores. ( Big Lots is going out of business, too.)

(AFP/Dziki Oktomauliyadi) Days before Christmas, retailers have expressed the hope for solid sales during the year-end festive season. Budihardjo Iduansjah, chairman of the Indonesia Retail and Tenant Association (Hippindo), told The Jakarta Post on Thursday that, notwithstanding widespread concerns about weaker consumer spending, sales remained stable and were expected to see a strong seasonal bump as the year draws to a close. “We think that this [weaker spending] will not reduce [sales]. [They] are not rising too much compared with last year, but there is an increase from the previous months,” Budihardjo explained, noting that the Christmas and New Year period tended to drive up sales in December by an average 20 percent. He added that businesses in the segments of food and beverages (F&B), fashion, salons, theaters and others stood to gain particularly from the year-end effect, driven by bonuses and benefits received by most workers, but this year also by more money circulation after the regional elections that were held in November. He went on to say that this had improved people’s spending power, helping businesses to bounce back from months of sluggish performance. The country has grappled this year with what some economists and business associations have pointed to as signs of weakening consumer spending power, such as a shrinking middle class, a rising share of expenditure going to groceries and a sharp drop in automotive sales.

Δ GDP was better than expected, and it’s almost always the case that GDP’s direction rests firmly on the shoulders of U.S. consumers’ spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of the figure. GDP increased at a 3.1% annualized pace in the third estimate by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis , up from the second estimate of 2.8%. The pace was up from the second quarter of this year at a 3% annualized growth rate. Consumer spending, as measured in the personal consumption expenditures metric, was up 3.7%, annualized. The PCE price index — a measure of inflation — rose by 1.5% in Q3, continuing its downward trend from 2.5% in Q2 and 3.4% in Q1. This slowing rate of inflation suggests that some of the earlier pressure points, such as supply chain disruptions and elevated commodity costs, have eased. Disposable Personal Income Growth Lags Outlays However, disposable personal income, the measure of what consumers have on hand to spend on goods in services, continued to grow at a pace that was outmatched by inflation and spending. The data showed that household disposable personal income increased by 1.1% in Q3, higher than the 1% increase seen in Q2. If prices and spending rise more quickly than income, then the logic follows that consumers save less. This is borne out by the latest data, where the personal saving rate settled at 4.3%, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers Continue to Struggle With High Interest Rates ” found that coming into September, the last month of the third quarter, struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers — who account for 23% of the population — averaged $2,447 in savings, while those living without difficulty averaged $7,558. Fifty-one percent of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers struggling with monthly expenses had no readily available savings. In the meantime, the latest retail spending data showed that the savings rate may see further pressure, while credit cards continue to be a key means of spending into the holidays. Meeting monthly debt obligations means that there’s even less disposable income to set aside. November’s consumer spending was buoyant, as eCommerce sales rebounded from a tepid pace in October. Census Bureau data released this week indicated that overall retail sales surged 0.7% in November, ahead of the consensus of 0.6% gains month over month and quickening from October’s newly revised 0.5% pace (up from the previous 0.4% report). The average credit card debt , as measured across all PYMNTS survey respondents, was over $5,000, but struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers are carrying balances of $7,000. In addition, 41% of financially struggling cardholders often or always reach their card limits. They are more than six times as likely as financially stable consumers to do so.

Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualised rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter US GDP today. The economy was previously reported to have expanded at a 2.8% pace last quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending and export growth, which offset a downward revision to private inventory investment and upward revision to imports. The economy grew at a 3% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. The US Fed last night delivered a third consecutive rate cut, but projected only two reductions in borrowing costs next year compared to the four it had forecast in September, citing continued economic resilience and still-elevated inflation. There are also concerns that some of the incoming Trump administration's policies, including tax cuts, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and tariffs on imported goods, would be inflationary. The Fed's policy rate was reduced by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.5% range. It was hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that ""it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession,"" adding that ""the US economy has just been remarkable, I feel very good about where the economy is - and we want to keep that going."" US consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7% pace. That was revised up from the previously estimated 3.5% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.4% pace. Final sales to private domestic purchasers were previously estimated to have risen at a 3.2% rate, while domestic demand increased at a 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $15 billion, or 0.4%. They were previously estimated to have risen $0.2 billion, or unchanged in percentage terms. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, lowered from the initially estimated 2.2% pace. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2% rate in the second quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions have sharply narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.6% rate.

Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. The economy was previously reported to have expanded at a 2.8% pace last quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending and export growth, which offset a downward revision to private inventory investment and upward revision to imports. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday delivered a third consecutive rate cut, but projected only two reductions in borrowing costs next year compared to the four it had forecast in September, citing continued economic resilience and still-elevated inflation. There are also concerns that some of the incoming Trump administration's policies, including tax cuts, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and tariffs on imported goods, would be inflationary. The Fed's policy rate was reduced by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range. It was hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that ""it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession,"" adding that ""the U.S. economy has just been remarkable, I feel very good about where the economy is ... and we want to keep that going."" Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7% pace. That was revised up from the previously estimated 3.5% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.4% pace. Final sales to private domestic purchasers were previously estimated to have risen at a 3.2% rate. Domestic demand increased at a 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $15.0 billion, or 0.4%. They were previously estimated to have risen $0.2 billion, or unchanged in percentage terms. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, lowered from the initially estimated 2.2% pace. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions have sharply narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.6% rate. That was revised up from the 2.5% rate reported last month. Gross domestic output grew at a 2.5% pace in the April-June quarter.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/patientrightsadvocateorg-calls-on-gov-dewine-to-swiftly-sign-hospital-price-transparency-legislation-302335768.html,,PatientRightsAdvocate . org Calls on Gov . DeWine to Swiftly Sign Hospital Price Transparency Legislation,20241219T043000Z,,prnewswire.com,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer economy,"COLUMBUS, Ohio , Dec. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PatientRightsAdvocate.org (PRA) applauded today's bipartisan passage by the Ohio General Assembly of major legislation to deliver hospital price transparency for Ohioans and urged Governor Mike DeWine to sign the bill without delay. The legislation, originally introduced as House Bill 49 by Ohio State Representatives Tim Barhorst (District 85) and Ron Ferguson (District 96) in February 2023 , was passed unanimously by both chambers as an amendment to H.B. 173 . If enacted, it would require Ohio hospitals to post the prices of available services online for upfront public viewing. ""By passing this strong price transparency bill, Ohio legislators ignored special interests and stood up for Ohio healthcare consumers who for too long have been blinded to prices and forced to pay for care with a blank check,"" said PRA Founder and Chairman Cynthia Fisher . ""This historic bill makes Ohio the first state in the nation to require that hospitals publish upfront prices in dollars and cents, so patients can protect themselves from overcharges and choose affordable care. We applaud Reps. Barhorst and Ferguson for their steadfast leadership and tireless efforts as they overcame every obstacle for nearly two years to make this critical bill a reality. Every Ohio patient, employer, family, and healthcare consumer can now benefit from actual, upfront healthcare prices, empowering them to rip off the blindfold and only pay agreed-upon, fair-market rates and benefit from remedy and recourse if overbilled. We urge Gov. DeWine to sign this bill into law immediately to substantially reduce Ohio's healthcare costs and return these funds to workers, businesses, and public-sector budgets."" The Barhorst-Ferguson legislation would codify the federal Hospital Price Transparency Rule first enacted in January 2021 by President Donald J. Trump . According to PRA's Seventh Semi-Annual Hospital Price Transparency Report released last month, only 13% of Ohio hospitals reviewed are fully complying with the rule. Of the 2,000 hospitals reviewed nationwide, just 21% are in full compliance. When initially considered by the Ohio House of Representatives in June 2023 , the bill (as H.B. 49) was passed by a bipartisan 90-5 landslide. As the legislation made its way through both chambers of the General Assembly, Ohioans negatively impacted by surprise hospital bills and hidden fees voiced their support for the bill's enforcement provisions, including patients like Tracey Owens and Drew White . Tracey Owens ( Norton, OH ) : ""Price transparency, as articulated in the Ohio legislation, empowers patients to avoid such outrageous healthcare costs and choose affordable care. ... It forces hospitals to compete over price and quality, just like everywhere else in the economy, putting downward pressure on costs. ... Signing this bill into law will help prevent more people from falling victim to the predatory healthcare system like I did. It will finally reduce outrageous state healthcare costs."" Drew White ( Cincinnati, OH ): ""We urgently need upfront prices to identify affordable care and avoid medical bankruptcy. ... If hospitals were required to post their prices, I could have compared surgery charges and chosen the best quality care at the lowest possible price. Unfortunately, since I was blinded to prices, I had no other option than to proceed with the surgery at my local hospital with only a prayer that the bill would be reasonable. ... Price transparency will catapult the American health care system into today's pro-consumer economy. It will end the days of six-figure bills for moderate surgeries and four-figure bills for stitches."" In support of advancing the strongest possible version of H.B. 49, PRA led multiple public awareness campaigns, including the launch of RealPricesForOhio.com , paid targeted digital media, and mobile billboards driven around the Ohio Statehouse and the Ohio State University campus. About PRA PatientRightsAdvocate.org (PRA) is a leading national healthcare price transparency organization dedicated to ushering in systemwide transparency through advocacy, testimony, media, legal research, and grassroots campaigns. PRA believes that the availability and visibility of actual, upfront healthcare prices will greatly lower costs for patients and employers through a functional, competitive healthcare marketplace.

Group turnover for Berry Bros. & Rudd in the 12 months to 31 March 2024 fell by 3.3% to £245.98 million (excluding adjustments for en primeur), according to the documents filed at Companies House, down from £254.28 million the previous year, while the company also recorded a loss before tax and exceptional items of £1.2m down, from a profit of £9.46m the previous year (or £19.59m in the year to March 2022). CEO Emma Fox wrote it had been “a turbulent year” in both the global fine wine and spirits as well as the wider luxury consumer goods sector more generally, coming at a time of high inflation, high interest rates and falling prices. “Global uncertainty and challenging macro-economic headwinds, coupled with a year of planned high investment for BB&R results in an anticipated drop in EBITDA,” she wrote in the financial records. EBITDA before exceptional items was recorded at £10.08m, a 51.2% slide from the previous year (£20.67m), but the core fine wine and spirits business in the UK and Asia performed well “with a low digit increase” in revenue, Fox said. The records showed that en primeur grew by 15%, however sales of more mature wines and commission from the BBX platform fell “in line with the wider fine wine market”. Meanwhile revenue from events rose 16%, and the spirits business saw a “small but steady sales growth”. BB& R brands and UK distribution was up 11.8%, and the third-party brands also in growth. There was also a boost to income from fine wine storage, up 27%, due to the group’s increased storage capacity after the opening of its Andover facility in October 2022. Customer numbers – particularly customers who collect fine wine – rose, and there were also more frequent purchases, she said. US declines However performance on the other side of the Atlantic showed a different story, she noted, with sales down 8.8%. The US business had a challenging time fighting the “large headwinds” evident in a tougher consumer economy, she argued, followed last year’s double-digit growth, amid two years of tailwinds. Decline in the American spirits import business, Hotaling & Co – which saw EBITDA fall 41.7% – indicated that that “the post-Covid spirits boom” has well and truly halted, amid increased investment in advertising and promotional spending. Distributors were reporting lower operating profits and “unpredictable consumer behaviour”, which had led to heavy destocking and larger declines in shipments and depletions, Fox said. Overall, this had contributed to the wider group’s 51.5% decline in EBITDA and lower operating margins .

Chair Lizzie Rudd said the business had “adapted to the challenges posed by tough market conditions, high inflation and interest rates” while continuing to push the boundaries “of what it means to be the most trusted fine wine and spirits merchant in the world”, growing, adapting and innovating the business “when many of our competitors are scaling back”. She pointed to the company’s minority stake in Cotswold Distillery, which was acquired in April 2023 , as well as its partnership with Symington Family Estates in acquiring England’s oldest commercial vineyard, Hambleden Vineyards just over six months later. “We expect the market challenge of the past year to persist over the next twelve months, in an industry that has not seen stability in some time. Despite this, we have made a reasonable start to the financial year and I am confident that the group’s strategy and sound financial footing makes us well-place to make the most of the opportunities that inevitably arise from such times.” As a result, a dividend of 1310p per share was issued (640p in Oct and 670p to be paid out in Jan 2025) which the company said reflected the “sustainable underlying growth in the business”. “The underlying positive performance of this year, in spite of the challenging market conditions is a direct result of the talent, dedication and commitment of our employees past and present,” Rudd added.

Retail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, advancing 0.5% after a previously reported 0.4% rise in October. Estimates ranged from a 0.1% dip to a 1.0% jump. Labor market resilience, characterized by historically low layoffs and strong wage growth, is underpinning consumer spending and keeping the economic expansion on track. Strong household balance sheets, reflecting record stock market prices and high home prices, are also driving spending. Household savings remain supportive. Live Events The solid increase in retail sales came despite a late Thanksgiving holiday that pushed Cyber Monday into December, and was consistent with a strong start to the holiday shopping season. It was also in spite of a less favorable seasonal factor, the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data. Federal Reserve officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and were expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, the third reduction in borrowing costs since the U.S. central bank embarked on its easing cycle in September. Strong retail sales added to warmer inflation readings in recent months in suggesting that the Fed could pause rate cuts in January. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration's planned policies, including tariffs on imports and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, are also seen complicating matters for the central bank. ""Sticky, above-target inflation will weigh on the Fed's decisions next year,"" said Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""But with tariffs set to squeeze real after-tax incomes and undermine confidence, we think the Committee will be more worried initially about the labor market."" The U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range, having been hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after an unrevised 0.1% dip in October. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.

While the company saw impressive global growth, especially in international markets, its U.S. performance has raised concerns.

Δ By the Numbers The company’s net revenue rose 9%, reaching $2.4 billion, with a 33% increase in international sales, while U.S. sales remained relatively flat. Despite the strong overall performance, the Americas region — which accounts for the bulk of Lululemon’s business — saw a modest 2% increase in net revenue and a 2% decline in comparable sales. Lululemon’s struggles in the U.S. market can be attributed to several factors, including market saturation, according to Zachary Robichaud , instructor, School of Retail Management, Ted Rogers School of Management , Toronto Metropolitan University . “Lululemon’s U.S. presence is well-established and the athleisure category overall is highly competitive, with players like Nike , Adidas , and emerging direct-to-consumer brands offering similar products at competitive prices,” Robichaud explained to PYMNTS. Shifts in consumer behavior due to the economy is another factor, Robichaud noted, adding, “ while athleisure remains popular, U.S. consumers may be prioritizing budget-conscious purchases amid economic pressures like inflation, seeking lower-cost alternatives. Specifically in the athleisure category, many low-cost competitors have entered the market.” Still, brand perception challenges persist, he added. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “In a mature market like the U.S., staying fresh and innovative is critical,” Robichaud said. “Lululemon’s premium price point may limit its appeal in a cost-sensitive environment, especially if the brand isn’t perceived as consistently delivering newness or exclusivity.” Another factor impacting Lululemon’s performance in the U.S. is the economic landscape, according to Greg Zakowicz , senior eCommerce expert at Omnisen d . “The biggest challenge in the U.S. is price point,” Zakowicz told PYMNTS. “As we’ve been discussing for the past 18 months, consumers are trading down for value. Athleisurewear is an area where that tradedown happens. “Consumers still love the Lululemon brand, and its products have a reputation of lasting over time, which plays into the value equation. However, as a brand that doesn’t offer blanket deep discounts, they sell at a premium price. Until consumers feel confident in their personal economic positions, the price point will prevent quick growth.” Looking Ahead Despite these challenges, Lululemon officials remain optimistic about its U.S. prospects. CEO Calvin McDonald noted in the company’s Dec. 5 earnings call that Lululemon is working on strategies to revitalize its U.S. business. “Last quarter, I laid out our plans to drive improvement in our U.S. business,” McDonald explained. “These plans include implementing a new reporting structure within our product team, increasing the penetration of seasonal newness within our assortments by Quarter 1 2025, and chasing into updated colors, prints and patterns to provide guests with more options in the second half of this year. Our merchandising and brand teams are now more fully integrated, which leads to better coordination and faster decision-making regarding how we bring our innovation to life.” When looking at the composition of the company’s assortments, McDonald said “ we are on track with our efforts to increase the penetration of seasonal newness and expect to be in line with historical levels in quarter one 2025. I feel good about the quality and quantity of newness the teams have planned, and we are well-positioned for spring. “Our teams have been agile and have been chasing into seasonal colors, prints and patterns. These efforts have contributed to the sequential improvement in newness within our assortment in the back half of the year. We continue to see significant potential for growth in the U.S. Our guest retention remains high, and we see an opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with more newness in the assortment. We continue to grow our membership program, and we are now 24 million members strong.” Even given these efforts, some retail experts remain cautious about Lululemon’s prospects in the U.S. market. In an interview with PYMNTS, Neil Saunders , managing director , retail , at research firm GlobalData , said, “Lululemon’s slower American growth raises the question as to whether it is starting to bump up against a ceiling. “There is much more competition in the U.S. market, and even relatively loyal Lululemon consumers are shopping around more widely. This problem isn’t going to disappear over time. If anything, it’s going to intensify. Lululemon’s response to this needs to be to lean more heavily into more embryonic categories, including its men’s business.” As Saunders noted, while Lululemon’s brand loyalty remains strong, the increased competition and economic pressures are contributing to a shift in how consumers are allocating their spending. As shoppers become more selective, Lululemon’s challenge will be to continue offering compelling products that resonate with their core audience while also attracting new customers in a crowded market. “The other factor at play is a more constrained and pickier shopper,” Saunders added. “While most Lululemon shoppers are far from being hard-pressed, they are still impacted by inflation and have modestly reduced the volume of things they buy. This has a dampening impact on sales growth. The good news here is that this will automatically course correct as the consumer economy improves. So, the medium-term hope is that sales growth in the Americas will settle above current rates.” Recommended Stablecoin Issuers Race for Bank Charters as Fed Weighs Access Tariff Tally: Global Losses Eclipse $35 Billion Going Into Q3 Earnings Visa and Proof Team to Bolster Digital ID Verification Alibaba Unveils AI Chatbot and Prices AI Glasses at $659 See More In: athleisure , athleticwear , Calvin McDonald , Earnings , GlobalData , lululemon , Neil Saunders , News , PYMNTS News , Retail"

The result suggested that households had saved rather than spent the Stage 3 tax cuts, which was also reflected in the rise in the savings rate. Advertisement Higher frequency data on household spending showed the trends continuing in Q4. The ABS Monthly Household Spending Indicator (MHSI) for October revealed that nominal consumer spending in trend terms eased to 0.1% in October from 0.2% in September, with the annual growth rate also easing to 1.9% from 2.3%. Advertisement Westpac’s monthly card tracker also reported a sharp fall over the two weeks to November 30, declining 2.6pts to 134.6. “The quarterly growth pulse eased further to +0.6%qtr, down from +1.2%qtr recorded four weeks ago” , noted Westpac. “Momentum has slowed back to the sluggish pace seen in late-August”. Advertisement CommBank’s Household Spending Indicator for November also recorded weak consumer spending, especially in per capita terms. Analysis from Justin Fabo at Antipodean Macro shows that Australians have used the windfall from Stage 3 tax cuts to pay down mortgage debts. Advertisement As illustrated below, household mortgage offset account balances rose more than usual in Q3 as tax cuts inflated after-tax take-home pay. The increase in Q3 was around $5 billion more than a year earlier, according to Fabo. This is good news from a financial stability and inflation perspective, as it will have lowered household and domestic demand, other things equal. Advertisement"

In February, the embattled retailer announced plans to shut 150 underperforming stores within three years - including 55 closures by the end of 2024 . But the company now expects to close 65 locations by the end of the year. Bosses said they will remain open through the holidays to let regular customers shop but then shutter for good before the end of December. Macy's has yet to announce exactly which stores will be affected, but employees are speculating whether their location could be on the chopping block. The latest to emerge is at the Kingston Collection mall in Massachusetts . Once all 150 are shuttered, Macy's will be left with just 350 stores - a far cry from the peak of around 1,100 in 2008. Like many department stores, Macy's has been suffering from dwindling sales amid the stratospheric rise of online rivals and the demise of America's suburban malls. The company appointed a new CEO, Tony Spring, earlier this year, who announced a major turnaround effort. Spring revealed the updated closure numbers during Macy's latest earnings on Wednesday, telling investors: ‘We now expect to close roughly 65 locations this year. Closures will occur post-holiday.’ Macy's now now expects to close 65 locations by the end of the year. Pictured is a previous closure in Houston in 2013 Macy's shares plummeted more than 12 percent Wednesday after revealing poor sales, but have mostly recovered by Thursday. They are still down 15 percent so far this year. Sales at the iconic department store chain - which also owns Bloomingdale's - fell by 2.4 percent in the quarter ending in November, the company also reported Wednesday. Macy's also significantly lowered its expected earnings for 2024. Shares plummeted more than 12 percent Wednesday on the news, but have mostly recovered by Thursday lunchtime. They are still down 15 percent so far this year. Adding to the turmoil, Macy’s is dealing with an accounting scandal involving a single employee who hid over $150 million in delivery expenses . The company insists this was a one-off but admits the error has cost them $79 million in their full-year outlook. A retail expert told DailyMail.com that while there may be more store closures, Macy's still makes a profit and so was not a bankruptcy risk. On this Wednesday's quarterly earnings, retail expert Neil Saunders - from GlobalData - said: 'Macy’s outlook is very mixed. There is still a big dose of decline in the numbers, but the chain isn’t at the bottom of the department store league table – which is positive. 'The numbers are not expected to strengthen significantly over the year ahead as the consumer economy remains pressured and Macy’s is in the middle of a turnaround program. 'There will certainly be store closures in the year ahead, but most of these have already been planned in. 'Macy’s might be struggling to generate growth, but the group is still generating profit and is in the black. As such, bankruptcy is not on the cards.' Macy's has been hit by falling sales ahead of the traditional holiday shopping period The company's stock is down 22 percent so far this year The retailer recently revealed a lone employee hid more than $150 million in delivery expenses Read More Nearly 17,000 people sign petition slamming the 'non-binary and transgender extravaganza' Macy's plans for this month's Thanksgiving Day Parade Macy's is one of many retailers closing stores this year as the ongoing 'retail apocalypse' forces brick-and-mortar locations to grapple with rising theft and shrinking profit margins. There were almost 2,600 store closures in the first four months of 2024 . If that trend continues, almost 8,000 will have been lost by the end of the year. It emerged in October that Walgreens will shutter more than 1,200 stores in bid to turn around struggling chain. In the same month, Big Lots said it was shutting 500 stores across multiple states as its financial woes worsen. Meanwhile, Badcock Home Furniture & More said at the end of July it is closing all its 380 stores dotted around the South after it fell into bankruptcy earlier this year. Dollar stores have been hit hard too, with 99 Cents Only announcing in April it would shutter all 371 of its locations across California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada. Family Dollar has said it will shut 1,000 stores under its own banner and that of sister company Dollar Tree over the next three years.

The Real Story Behind The Numbers By Pamela N. Danziger , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Pam Danziger reports on retail, focused on the luxury consumer market. Follow Author Dec 12, 2024, 09:56am EST Dec 12, 2024, 11:39am EST Share Save Portrait of a waitress with a chalkboard merry x-mas at the coffee shop getty Deep within the Bureau of Labor Statistics otherwise strong November jobs report was news that retail employment was down nearly 30,000 jobs from October. With the holiday shopping season fast approaching, the report didn’t make sense, especially since earlier this year, the National Retail Federation (NRF) predicted retailers plan to hire between 400,000 and 500,000 seasonal workers. Spoiler alert: Retail didn’t lose employees in November; rather, retail employment came up short from what the BLS expected based on its seasonal-adjustment calculation. But you’ve got to read the fine print in the report and do your own calculations to get the real picture. The November retail jobs report needs context. Reported Retail Employment Situation The BLS November “Employment Situation” stated, “Retail trade lost 28,000 jobs in November, after showing little net employment change over the prior 12 months.” It went further to say nearly half the job losses came among general merchandisers where many shoppers turn first, think Walmart, Target, Costco and Macy’s. The media and highly reliable sources ran with the job loss news, such as Mitchell Barnes, labor economist at The Conference Board , who reported retailers have continued a trend to shed workers this year as shopping online picks up. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor “November's decline in retail employment could reflect holiday shopping shifting from in-person to online,” he said in a statement. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas confirmed that some jobs in the retail sector have shifted to transportation and warehousing because of the rise in online retail. For example, Amazon announced plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers this year. These seasonal hires are likely to end up in the BLS’s transportation and warehousing classification since the BLS Table B reporting “Establishment Data” doesn’t have a line item for employment by nonstore retailers, unlike the Census Department which breaks out nonstore retail in its reporting. Nonstore retail currently makes up about 30% of total retail sales. Retailer Seasonal Hiring Plans Challenging BLS’s reports that general merchandisers dropped about 15,000 employees, Target announced plans to hire 100,000 workers, Macy’s to add 31,500 full and part-time associates and J.C. Penney’s to bring on some 10,000 additional staff. Walmart and Costco, the nation’s number one and three largest retailers have not announced seasonal hiring plans, but one can expect they’d need to staff up for the holiday season too. Challenger, Gray and Christmas predicts that this year’s retail seasonal hiring will be weaker than in the recent past and the Indeed Hiring Lab reports that U.S. retail job postings are running about 11% below 2023 levels through the first three quarters of the year. Yet, the NRF vice president of government relations and workforce development Edwin Egee suggests that there isn’t enough employee supply to meet retailers’ seasonal demands. “We’re as close to full employment as I can possibly imagine,” he said. “It’s going to be a challenge for our members to bring in additional labor for this particular holiday season.” I put in multiple requests for the NRF to help reconcile the BLS November jobs report with its holiday hiring prediction and they didn’t respond. Memo to NRF: Please call me because I have questions about your historic holiday season sales data too. Seasonal Retail Hiring Is Obscured However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lent a helping hand. The BLS explained that the reported decrease of 28,000 employees in November is “based on seasonally adjusted employment levels” and thus evens out “predictable seasonal patterns in data, for example hiring for the holiday season.” In other words, the seasonal adjustment data hides rather than reveals the number of workers added for the holiday season. BLS economist Carson Wilson said to look at the not seasonally adjusted data to see the holiday buildup in retail employment. That showed 280,500 retail employees were added in November, specifically accounting for any full or part-time employees on the payroll as of the 12th day of the month. “The not seasonally adjusted over-the-month-change (OTMC) in retail trade employment for November 2024 was +280,500 and the seasonally adjusted OTMC was -28,000. The difference in these two numbers – 308,500 – is the ‘normal seasonal movement,’” he explained. In plain English, November’s retail employment fell 28,000 employees short of where its statistical model expected retail employment to be. Retailers didn’t lose 28,000 jobs in November; they added 280,500 workers but given past history, they should have increased the number of workers by 308,500. Since the holiday retail season employment buildup extends from October through December and many of those seasonal hires may need to stick around into January to handle the expected returns onslaught , we’ll have to wait until February or March to get a real fix on the retail employment picture. And then we’ll need to look at the not seasonal adjusted data not the seasonally adjusted numbers. Holiday Hiring Still Falls Short What we know right now is that retailers added 414,400 employees in October and November, up from 15.5 million in September to 16 million in November. Specifically 133,900 were brought on board in October followed by 280,500 in November. To date, seasonal retail hiring falls in the lower end of NRF’s predicted range of between 400,000 and 500,000 seasonal workers and below last year’s 494,000 “build up” seasonal retail workers from October through December 2023, according to BLS. Being caught shorthanded on the retail selling floor could be a problem for retailers this holiday season, sending more shoppers to their phones, tablets and computers. But given that early season foot traffic is down – Black Friday was off by 8% and the full year is down 3%, according to Sensormatic Solution – and NRF is expecting November-December holiday retail sales to grow a modest 2.5% to 3.5% this year, basically flat with inflation factored in, maybe retailers have their lower employment needs covered. Fewer employees could be a good thing from a short term financial perspective, but one that could haunt retailers next year in what looks like another tough year behind the cash register.

The since-fired employee accidentally understated the value of small parcel delivery expenses in late 2021, an official briefed on the probe told the Wall Street Journal . In a desperate bid to mask the error, the accountant intentionally made incorrect accounting entries and falsified accompanying documents for years until the colossal blunder was uncovered this fall. According to the official, the employee, who has not been named, was not motivated by personal or financial game. They are said to have made false records only to cover their mistake. The discovery of the accounting errors prompted Macy's execs to postpone the reporting of their quarterly financial results for two weeks in November, causing a landslide in shares as investors pulled out amid the chaos. Sales at the iconic department store chain, which also owns Bloomingdale's, fell by 2.4 percent in the quarter ending in November. Shares plummeted more than 12 percent in early trading on the news. They had already fallen 22 percent this year. Meanwhile, Macy's stock dropped another 10 percent on Wednesday after the retailer slashed its profit targets for the year, per the Wall Street Journal. Executives blamed shopping habits and the cost of living for the pullback, saying it expected consumers to continue cutting down on non-essential spending. A Macy's accountant hid $150 million in expenses after making a genuine mistake and trying to cover it up for years afterwards, an investigation has heard Macy's has been hit by falling sales ahead of the traditional holiday shopping period Chairman and CEO Tony Spring said the company are working diligently to complete the investigation Macy's declined to comment on whether it had referred the case to any law-enforcement or regulatory authorities. They said the employee who caused the financial nightmare hid around $151 million in cumulative delivery expenses from the fourth quarter of 2021 all the way up until the third quarter of 2024. Read More Macy's to withdraw from mall as mass closures continue 'We've concluded our investigation and are strengthening our existing controls and implementing additional changes designed to prevent this from happening again,' Macy's Chief Executive Officer Tony Spring said in a press statement. The executive did not disclose how the erroneous entries were unearthed, or how they managed to slip the notice of the company's auditor, KPMG. According to the Wall Street Journal, Macy's paid KPMG around $12.8 million in audit fees from 2021 until 2023. DailyMail.com has contacted KPMG for comment. The Big Four accounting firms, PwC, Deloitte, EY, and KPMG, have admitted to hundreds of violations of audit independence regulations in the US. A retail expert told DailyMail.com that while there may be more store closures, Macy's still makes a profit and so was not a bankruptcy risk. The troubled department store chain announced in February that it would shut 150 over the next three years - including 55 by the end of 2024 . It will be left with just 350 stores - a far cry from the peak of around 1,100 in 2008. Since then it has been in steady decline . The company's stock is down 22 percent so far this year The retailer recently revealed a lone employee hid more than $150 million in delivery expenses Macy's has yet to announce exactly which stores will be affected, but employees are speculating whether their location could be on the chopping block. The latest to emerge is at the Kingston Collection mall in Massachusetts , but will stay open for locals to shop there through the holidays and close in early 2025. On this morning's quarterly earnings, retail expert Neil Saunders from GlobalData said: 'Macy’s outlook is very mixed. There is still a big dose of decline in the numbers, but the chain isn’t at the bottom of the department store league table – which is positive. 'The numbers are not expected to strengthen significantly over the year ahead as the consumer economy remains pressured and Macy’s is in the middle of a turnaround program. 'There will certainly be store closures in the year ahead, but most of these have already been planned in. 'Macy’s might be struggling to generate growth, but the group is still generating profit and is in the black. As such, bankruptcy is not on the cards.'

S . History  ,20241211T191500Z,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/12/illegal-immigrants-denver-colorado-AP-640x335.jpg,breitbart.com,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer economy,"“The immigration surge of the past few years has been the largest in U.S. history,” the New York Times admitted five weeks after the nation’s voters rejected the Democrats’ wealth-shifting migration policy. ‘Total net migration during the Biden administration is likely to exceed eight million people,” including legal and illegal migrants, said the report by David Leonhardt, “a senior writer … who runs The Morning , our flagship daily newsletter.” He wrote: That’s a faster pace of arrivals than during any other period on record, including the peak years of Ellis Island traffic, when millions of Europeans came to the United States. Even after taking into account today’s larger U.S. population, the recent surge is the most rapid since at least 1850. The article may help Democrats recognize and admit why they lost the 2024 election. But so far, Democrats are refusing to follow the money in migration politics. The record-breaking inflow has been tracked by Breitbart News but will come as a shock to the upper-income readers of the New York Times ‘ establishment website. For many years, the New York Times, the Washington Post , and similar outlets have refused to admit the policy, the scale, or the economic impact of migration on ordinary Americans. Instead, establishment journalists have described the huge, wealth-shifting inflow as “thousands” of migrants. Those skewed reports in the media have minimized the voters’ recognition of the inflow’s scale and impact. The media’s refusal to count and describe the inflow has also hidden the resulting shift of vast wealth from ordinary young Americans to older and wealthier stock investors. The media’s refusal to follow the money in migration has also allowed them to pretend that the government-directed flood of immigrants is an uncontrollable event or an unexpected humanitarian crisis. The refusal is mostly driven by pro-migration editors and their ability to hire pro-migration reporters. In reality, the federal government deliberately launched the migration inflow in 1965 as an economic policy that was hidden under the Cold War’s narrative about Americans’ homeland being a “ Nation of Immigrants .” This graphic visualizes the countries of origin for the estimated 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. Data source: Migration Policy Institute, U.S. Census Bureau. (Visual Capitalist via Getty Images) The bipartisan 1965 decision reversed the 1925 migration cutbacks that had shifted wealth to ordinary Americans and helped produce generations of productivity-boosting technologies . Democratic president Lyndon Johnson opened the doors in 1965. Republican President George H. Bush doubled the inflow of 1990, and President Joe Biden’s border chief — progressive zealot Alejandro Mayorkas — doubled it again in 2021 in cooperation with West Coast consumer-economy investors . The practical result of Biden’s Extraction Migration policy has been lower wages , higher housing costs , higher interest rates , lower productivity , and greater civic chaos for 330 million Americans. To his credit, Leonhardt quietly recognizes how migration has moved wealth from ordinary families to older investors. He wrote: Bernard Yaros Jr., a lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a research firm, described the recent increases as “something that we really haven’t seen in recent memory.” Mr. Yaros said that they had “helped cool wage growth.” Donald Trump recognized the elite-imposed policy and criticized it to win elections in 2016 and 2024. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May 2024 statement from Donald Trump’s campaign. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . — CHINA The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

Where is it headed? India's consumption patterns are shifting from basic necessities to services like healthcare and education. The middle class is expanding rapidly, projected to reach 60% of the population by 2047, driving economic growth and potentially transforming India into a consumption powerhouse. This growth is fueled by increasing disposable incomes and an aspirational drive. ET Online Updated On Dec 11, 2024 at 09:10 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Indians are not as worried about food, clothes and shelter -- the very basic needs for survival -- as they used to be 10 years ago. Roti, kapda aur makaan indicated the struggle of common Indians for bare necessities. But a radical shift in the way Indians consume has taken place in the past decade. According to the National Account Statistics 2024 data, consumers have shifted towards services, away from food, clothing and housing. The share of essentials has declined in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) between FY13 and FY23 while that on health and education among others rose. Health saw 8.2% growth and education 7.5% growth. Housing expenses dropped from 16.4% to 13% and clothing from 6.1% to 4.8%. Transport and communication also saw substantial growth at 8.2% and 7.8% respectively. Food and beverages remain the largest spending category, but their share decreased from 30.5% to 28.2%. Within this category, packaged food experienced the highest growth at 10.4%, followed by meat (8.7%), fish and seafood (8.3%), and eggs (7.1%). Advt These numbers would suggest that the Indian middle class is growing, as people rise above struggling for bare necessities and start spending more on heath and education, which indicates an aspirational drive, or on discretionary items which indicates purchasing power. How India's population pyramid is shape-shifting As per the figures released last year from PRICE ICE 360° surveys based on primary data, The middle class is the fastest-growing major segment of the Indian population in both percentage and absolute terms, rising at 6.3 percent per year between 1995 and 2021. It now represents 31 percent of the population and is expected to be 38 percent by 2031 and 60 percent in 2047. More than one billion Indians will make up the middle-class when India will turn 100. The People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE), an independent, not-for-profit think tank and facts tank, collected primary data in 2014, 2016 and 2021, covering over 40,000 households, both rural and urban from 25 states, for its PRICE ICE 360° surveys. The results paint a strikingly new picture of India. By the end of this decade, the survey says, the structure of the country’s demographics will change from an inverted pyramid, signifying a small rich class and a very large low-income class, to a rudimentary diamond, where a significant part of the low-income class moves up to become part of Middle Class. Consequently, the income pyramid will have a smallish layer at the bottom comprising the Destitute and Aspirer groups, a huge bulge of the Middle Class and a big creamy Rich layer on top. The percentage growth is much higher for the upper income groups than the lower income groups. In fact, for the lowest income groups the growth could even be in the negative. Advt What a middle class bulge would mean for business Today, Western multinational giants, especially those in the FMCG sector, come to India looking for volume growth. India's market size has a big pull. Imagine when in addition to even larger volumes, they also come to India looking for profit margins; such a large middle class will obviously give colossal purchasing power to India and the capacity for huge discretionary spending. Imagine desi companies easily growing into global biggies supported by vast domestic scale. Growing disposable incomes, along with the rise of the middle class, will make India a consumption powerhouse. Imagine more than half of India's population being the middle class, with typical middle-class inclination for quality education, and exhibiting typical middle-class mindset of striving slowly, steadily but resolutely to make a class jump. Such a large number of college-educated professionals will surely unleash innovation and enterprise at a gargantuan scale. That would be like a dozen Bengalurus sprouting across India, with probably mohallas having their own unicorns. Add a dozen Hyderabads too where Indian techies won't be doing merely the grunt work for the world's biggest companies. They won't be running the back offices but the brain offices. Class and religious conflicts that weigh down on India's economic potential will likely lose their potency as the dominance of the middle class will also dictate political discourse. Politics, especially electoral politics, will likely revolve around typical middle-class issues such as health, education, infrastructure and jobs. As urbanisation grows, old forms of social affiliations such as caste will weaken, creating an egalitarian India, empowering a large chunk of India's population which now remains chained to disabling discourses.

(The) +0.90% Designer Brands Inc. -4.28% Consumer companies rose amid optimism about holiday spending. Kroger rallied after a federal judge blocked the supermarket chain from acquiring Albertsons, siding with Biden administration antitrust enforcers who said the $20 billion supermarket merger would erode competition and raise prices. Designer Brands, the shoe-seller which does business as DSW, said sales fell in the third quarter and cut its outlook for the year as unfavorable weather and economic uncertainty reduced consumer spending, sending shares sharply lower.

Indians are not as worried about food, clothes and shelter -- the very basic needs for survival -- as they used to be 10 years ago. Roti, kapda aur makaan indicated the struggle of common Indians for bare necessities. But a radical shift in the way Indians consume has taken place in the past decade. According to the National Account Statistics 2024 data, consumers have shifted towards services, away from food, clothing and housing. The share of essentials has declined in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) between FY13 and FY23 while that on health and education among others rose. Health saw 8.2% growth and education 7.5% growth. Housing expenses dropped from 16.4% to 13% and clothing from 6.1% to 4.8%. Transport and communication also saw substantial growth at 8.2% and 7.8% respectively. Food and beverages remain the largest spending category, but their share decreased from 30.5% to 28.2%. Within this category, packaged food experienced the highest growth at 10.4%, followed by meat (8.7%), fish and seafood (8.3%), and eggs (7.1%). These numbers would suggest that the Indian middle class is growing, as people rise above struggling for bare necessities and start spending more on heath and education, which indicates an aspirational drive, or on discretionary items which indicates purchasing power. How India's population pyramid is shape-shifting As per the figures released last year from PRICE ICE 360° surveys based on primary data, The middle class is the fastest-growing major segment of the Indian population in both percentage and absolute terms, rising at 6.3 percent per year between 1995 and 2021. It now represents 31 percent of the population and is expected to be 38 percent by 2031 and 60 percent in 2047. More than one billion Indians will make up the middle-class when India will turn 100. Live Events The People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE), an independent, not-for-profit think tank and facts tank, collected primary data in 2014, 2016 and 2021, covering over 40,000 households, both rural and urban from 25 states, for its PRICE ICE 360° surveys. The results paint a strikingly new picture of India. By the end of this decade, the survey says, the structure of the country’s demographics will change from an inverted pyramid, signifying a small rich class and a very large low-income class, to a rudimentary diamond, where a significant part of the low-income class moves up to become part of Middle Class. Consequently, the income pyramid will have a smallish layer at the bottom comprising the Destitute and Aspirer groups, a huge bulge of the Middle Class and a big creamy Rich layer on top. The percentage growth is much higher for the upper income groups than the lower income groups. In fact, for the lowest income groups the growth could even be in the negative. What a middle class bulge would mean for business Today, Western multinational giants, especially those in the FMCG sector, come to India looking for volume growth. India's market size has a big pull. Imagine when in addition to even larger volumes, they also come to India looking for profit margins; such a large middle class will obviously give colossal purchasing power to India and the capacity for huge discretionary spending. Imagine desi companies easily growing into global biggies supported by vast domestic scale. Growing disposable incomes, along with the rise of the middle class, will make India a consumption powerhouse. Imagine more than half of India's population being the middle class, with typical middle-class inclination for quality education, and exhibiting typical middle-class mindset of striving slowly, steadily but resolutely to make a class jump. Such a large number of college-educated professionals will surely unleash innovation and enterprise at a gargantuan scale. That would be like a dozen Bengalurus sprouting across India, with probably mohallas having their own unicorns. Add a dozen Hyderabads too where Indian techies won't be doing merely the grunt work for the world's biggest companies. They won't be running the back offices but the brain offices. Class and religious conflicts that weigh down on India's economic potential will likely lose their potency as the dominance of the middle class will also dictate political discourse. Politics, especially electoral politics, will likely revolve around typical middle-class issues such as health, education, infrastructure and jobs. As urbanisation grows, old forms of social affiliations such as caste will weaken, creating an egalitarian India, empowering a large chunk of India's population which now remains chained to disabling discourses.

US economic activity slightly expanded in most Federal Reserve (Fed) districts since early October this year, with subdued employment growth, a modest rise in inflation and future optimism among businesses, the Fed said in a summary of surveys and interviews known as the ‘Beige Book’. Three regions exhibited modest or moderate growth that offset flat or slightly declining activity in two others. Though growth in economic activity was generally small, expectations for growth rose moderately across most geographies and sectors. US economic activity slightly expanded in most Federal Reserve districts since early October, with subdued employment growth, a modest rise in inflation and future optimism among businesses, the latest 'Beige Book' said. Expectations for growth rose moderately across most geographies and sectors. There was optimism that demand will rise in near future. Consumer spending was generally stable. Business contacts expressed optimism that demand will rise in coming months. Consumer spending was generally stable. Many consumer-oriented businesses across districts noted further increases in price sensitivity among consumers, as well as several reports of increased sensitivity to quality. Spending on home furnishings was down, which contacts attributed to limited household mobility. Commercial real estate lending was similarly subdued. Capital spending and purchases of raw materials were flat or declining in most districts. Employment levels were flat or up only slightly across districts. Hiring activity was subdued as worker turnover remained low and few firms reported increasing their headcount. The level of layoffs was also reportedly low. Contacts indicated they expected employment to remain steady or rise slightly over the next year, but many were cautious in their optimism about any pickup in hiring activity, a release from the Fed said. Wage growth softened to a modest pace across most districts, as did expectations for wage growth in coming months. Prices rose only at a modest pace across Fed districts. Both consumer-oriented and business-oriented contacts reported greater difficulty passing costs on to customers. Input prices were said to be rising faster than selling prices for most businesses, resulting in declining profit margins. Although input prices rose generally, contacts in several Districts noted declines in certain raw materials and non-labour costs.

According to Adobe’s marketing data analytics service, Adobe Analytics, consumer spending on Cyber Monday (December 2), following the year’s biggest shopping event, Black Friday (November 29), amounted to $13.3 billion, a 7.3% increase from the previous year. This broke the record of $12.4 billion set just a year earlier. Previously, Adobe Analytics reported that online sales on Black Friday amounted to $10.8 billion nationwide. Online spending during Thanksgiving and Black Friday increased by 8.8% and 10.2% compared to last year, respectively. From Thanksgiving through Black Friday to Cyber Monday, the five-day period referred to as ""Cyber Week,"" online spending totaled $41.1 billion, surpassing last year’s $38 billion and setting a new record. Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, noted the remarkable year-over-year growth in online sales during Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The most popular items were toys, along with electronics such as computers, headphones, speakers, electric scooters, and smartwatches. According to CNN, U.S. consumers spent $15.8 million per minute during the last two hours of Cyber Monday. CNN also attributed Cyber Monday's record-breaking sales to shopping via mobile devices. Consumers spent $7.6 billion through mobile shopping, and the proportion of online sales made via mobile devices rose significantly to 57% this year, compared to 33% in 2019.

Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account The circumstances that prompted this week’s political crisis in South Korea are unique to South Korea . But forces at work there are at work elsewhere, including here. Generation after generation of low birth rates has imposed great strains on the young, who in response are turning to conservative, and sometimes even anti-democratic, politicians. In the United States, a majority of men under 30 voted for Republican candidate Donald Trump, despite the president-elect’s authoritarian leanings. France is in crisis this week, after Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally helped bring down the government . And in South Korea, a conservative president attempted a coup. Things will get worse. Fertility rates continue to fall around the world. Every generation of young people is smaller than the previous one. They are expected to work harder and earn less while financing the needs of the old. Because there are fewer young people to drive the consumer economy, growth is weak and many younger workers struggle to make ends meet. Who can blame them for turning against the politicians who created this mess? South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world , a projected 0.68 in 2024, far less than the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman needed to maintain a population. The country could lose two-thirds of its population by the end of this century. Explainer: Yoon Suk Yeol declared, then rescinded, martial law in South Korea. What now? The situation so far “South Korea may become the first country to disappear from the face of the earth,” the Economic Times speculated . China and Japan also have ultralow fertility rates and are losing population. Japan’s then-prime minister Fumio Kishida warned last year that his country is “on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.” Developed East Asian countries combine high levels of education among women with a strongly patriarchal culture. As a result, many women decide to focus on their career, which they would be expected to give up if they had children. That decision breeds resentments. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol won a narrow election victory in 2022 in part with the support of angry young men who “have redirected their growing economic frustration by scapegoating women as the new out-group,” Rhys Moon wrote in the Harvard Political Review. “This growing anti-feminist movement is a dangerous rightward turn among young voters.” President Yoon is an avowed anti-feminist, claiming that institutions and policies that promote equality for women aren’t needed, and that feminist attitudes are responsible for South Korea’s ultralow birth rate. When parliamentary opposition frustrated his conservative agenda he tried, but failed, to impose martial law. In his first term as American president, Mr. Trump placed judges on the Supreme Court who then overturned Roe v. Wade , which protected a woman’s right to an abortion. For his second term, he has nominated crackpots and misfits to run federal health services , the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the military . His goal appears to be to completely restructure federal institutions – the Deep State, as he and his supporters call it – even if it means undermining those institutions, and democracy along with it. Undermining democracy may even be the intent. Chinese women look to South Korean ‘K-girls’ for inspiration as declining birth rates spark backlash One of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers is the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, a fervent pro-natalist who, along with vice president-elect JD Vance, supports the Hungarian approach of offering financial incentives to encourage couples to have more children. Viktor Orban’s Hungary is the most extreme example of the far right’s authoritarian tendencies combined with natalist policies, but that anti-democratic, anti-feminist, pro-natalist agenda is on the march across Europe. Efforts in Canada by Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government to counter the impact of this country’s low fertility rate – we’re at 1.4 and falling – by increasing temporary and permanent immigration have had disastrous consequences, including housing shortages and strained health care systems. Opposition to immigration is growing, though it has yet to approach levels seen in other countries. There is no reason to fear that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre harbours authoritarian, anti-immigrant or anti-feminist tendencies. His populist conservatism is mild by international comparison. But Canadians would be foolish to believe that what is happening elsewhere – from Seoul to Washington to Paris to Budapest – could never happen here. No country is immune."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other best retail stocks to invest in. What Does the Holiday Shopping Season Look Like? On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Tariff Threats: Are They Real for Investors and Consumers? Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of “tariff threats” on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect’s proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump’s first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn’t a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar’s possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these “tariff threats” might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar’s strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar’s strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US.

Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify around 40 retail stocks and narrowed our list to 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders, as of fiscal Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates membership warehouses and e-commerce sites offering an elaborate selection of branded and private-label products in a broad category range. The company attained its target of 30 new warehouse openings in fiscal 2024, which included one relocation and resulted in 29 net new buildings. It expanded its operations to Maine, bringing it to 47 states in the US. The company is also seeing growth opportunities worldwide, with its fiscal 2025 plans holding 12 of its planned 29 openings outside the US. With three of the company’s warehouses being relocations, it has plans to add 26 net new buildings in fiscal 2025. In addition, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) is expanding its e-commerce business, with Costco Logistics also running on a positive momentum. Much of the growth was attributed to appliances and furniture in big and bulky. Logistics delivered more than 4.5 million items in the year, up 29% over the prior year. The company is continually enhancing its member experience by improving delivery times, scheduling functionality, and item assortment. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : “Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) continues to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability by lowering its emissions. For example, it has converted its Kirkland Signature laundry packs from plastic tubs to a pouch. This has reduced plastic packaging by 80%. It has also moved to localize production of bulky items such as water, paper, and laundry detergents. Manufacturing these goods closer to the countries in which they are sold reduces emissions associated with shipping.” Overall, COST ranks 2nd on our list of best retail stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of retail stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE: BURL ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51 Burlington Stores Inc. (NYSE:BURL) is an off-price retailer of branded apparel. It also sells accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for relatively lower prices. The company operates more than 1000 stores, primarily under the brand name Burlington Stores. Total sales for the company grew by 11% in fiscal Q3 2024, on top of 12% sales growth last year. The primary driver of growth for the company’s fiscal Q3 2024 earnings was its new store opening program. It is on the path to end 2024 with 101 net new stores. However, the unseasonably warm temperature significantly impacted Burlington Stores Inc.’s (NYSE:BURL) comparable sales trend in fiscal Q3 2024. It reported healthy sales in its back-to-school season, one of the primary drivers of sales in Q3. However, the positive sales trend dropped from mid-September onwards. According to the company, the primary reason behind this impact was that its consumers still consider it a coat company. Despite this headwind, Burlington Stores Inc. (NYSE:BURL) employed its conservation plan to keep tight control over its receipts and liquidity, reacting quickly to the warmer temperature. The company expects to regain its sales growth in the holiday season and the coming of winter. Argosy Investors made the following comment about Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter : “Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL) participates in the off-price retail category and competes against well-known players such as TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. BURL recently suffered from an inventory overhang that dented margins and is also suffering from a slowdown in same-store sales. With that said, the company has the capacity to double its stores, double its margins to levels consistent with peers, and expand same-store sales growth. On normalized margins, which the company last achieved in fiscal 2019, BURL is trading at ~10x earnings, with the potential to grow top-line low double digits, increase bottom line mid-teens, and increase EPS high teens over time.” Overall, BURL ranks 6th on our list of best retail stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of retail stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a technical athletic apparel retailer that also offers footwear and accessories. The company operates stores in the US, China Mainland, Canada, Australia, and South Korea. Its international markets are seeing continuous strength as the Lululemon brand is resonating with consumers around the globe. One of the company’s largest opportunities is growing its business outside of North America. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is on track to quadruple its international revenue from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. The company’s near-term action plan involves leveraging its chase and fast-track design capabilities to bring more seasonal newness into its women’s assortment as promptly as possible. It is focusing on its strong performers, including its gold zip scuba in Softreme, aligned leggings in colors and prints, and new silhouettes and seasonal fabrics. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) plans to fast-track several new styles of performance shorts, tops, and tracksuits in 2025. Through these strategies, it aims to return to its historic levels of newness, no later than Spring 2025. Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its Q2 2024 investor letter : “I mentioned last quarter and higher above that I like buying quality stocks on sale. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), the 2nd worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, qualifies. I published a full thesis on the stock before its most recent earnings, but the basics: the yoga pants and clothing company has had an amazing post-pandemic run that is approaching its end. Its growth in the US is slow/non-existent at the moment, but it is growing very fast in China and Europe. I think that international growth is likely to endure, and that its US slowness is likely to be temporary. Lululemon shares are not ‘cheap’, but they are on sale for an average price, and I think the company will grow faster than average over the next five years. I would be wrong if Lululemon is a fad gone bust, or faces a huge post-pandemic hangover as people get used to leaving the house more. We’ll see.” Overall, LULU ranks 9th on our list of best retail stocks to invest in.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stands against the other best retail stocks to invest in. What Does the Holiday Shopping Season Look Like? On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Tariff Threats: Are They Real for Investors and Consumers? Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of “tariff threats” on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect’s proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump’s first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn’t a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar’s possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these “tariff threats” might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar’s strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar’s strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US.

Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROST ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is an off-price apparel retailer that operates home fashion stores under two brands: Ross Dress for Less (Ross) and DD’s Discount. It operates over 1,764 Ross store locations in 43 US states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. It also has over 345 DD’s Discounts stores across 22 US states. Customers can find discounted in-season designer and name-brand apparel at the company’s stores, along with footwear, accessories, and home fashion. The company’s discounts typically vary from 20% to 60% compared to regular department and specialty store prices. Ross Stores Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) completed its expansion program for 2024 in fiscal Q3 2024, adding 43 new Ross and four DD’s Discount stores.

Ross Stores Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ROST) total sales for fiscal Q3 2024 grew to $5.1 billion, up from $4.9 billion in the prior year. However, several factors slowed its fiscal Q3 2024 sales, including severe weather from Hurricane Hilton and Lane and unseasonably warm temperatures late in the quarter. However, investors are bullish on the stock and expect these headwinds to be temporary. The fact that customers are leaning towards discounts and deals, especially in the discretionary items category, also falls in the company’s favor. In its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter , TimesSquare Capital Management mentioned Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST): “In Consumer-oriented sectors, we lean towards value-oriented or specialty retailers, franchise models, as well as premium brands. Also gaining 23% over the quarter was Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST), an off-price retailer featuring apparel and home fashions. Third-quarter results were solid as sales comparisons accelerated with higher levels of customer traffic across geographies. Management raised full-year guidance. We added to the position given our increased conviction at the start of the quarter.” Overall, ROST ranks 5th on our list of best retail stocks to invest in.

Net sales and other revenue for the company was $18.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024, compared to $18.2 billion in fiscal Q2 2023.

The Wednesday report , which is one of eight released by the Fed annually, reported growth in economic activity and expectations for continued growth across geographies and sectors. Businesses have optimism that demand will rise in the coming months, the report said. Key Insights From November Fed Beige Book Consumer spending was stable : Businesses that are consumer-oriented reported sensitivity to price increases and more focus on quality. Softer sales were reported by restaurants as consumers held back on spending for this segment. Apparel and snowmobiles also saw weakened sales in the period due to the weather. Low Mortgage demand : The report found that mortgage demand was low with home loan demand mixed during the reporting period across districts. Farm equipment : One of the key takeaways from the report is farm equipment sales being a headwind on investment activity with concerns that the prices of the equipment could see weakened demand continue given weakness in the farm economy. Energy activity : The oil and gas sector was flat for the November period, but demand for electricity generation experienced a sharp increase, the report said. Rapid expansion of data centers and investments in renewable generation capacity were themes in the report. Employment : A slowdown in hiring demand was reported, but employment held steady for the period with wage increases listed as ""modest.""

https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/unexpectedly-hawkish-beige-book-finds-economic-activity-rose-most-districts-slowness,,Unexpectedly Hawkish Beige Book Finds Economic Activity  Rose  In Most Districts As  Slowness  Tumbles,20241204T203000Z,https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-12/slow%20mentions%20beige.jpg?d0ee24&itok=IZtwzlY0,zerohedge.com,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer spending,"Back in September, the otherwise sleepy and mostly boring report that is the Fed's Beige Book report (which nobody otherwise reads due to its sheer size and dismal signal-to-noise ratio) got a sudden boost of notoriety and popularity when none other than Jerome Powell explained after the Fed's 50bps rate cut, that he had been closely following the Beige Book which had emerged as a driving force behind the Fed's unexpected ""jumbo"" 50bps rate cut. And unlike others, we actually do read the Beige Book, which is why two weeks before the FOMC rate cut we titled our analysis of the latest report as follows: "" Ugly Beige Book Reveals Economic Activity ""Flat Or Declining"", Consumer Spending Slowing In Most Districts ."" So one can see why Powell panicked and why two rate cuts followed in September and November, just days after the election. Fast forward to today when moments ago the Fed published its latest, December, Beige Book which suggested that a reversal of the sluggish, ""flat or declining"" conditions observed in September and November is underway, and which together with a strong jobs report on Friday may be sufficient to enable the Fed to pause rate cuts for the foreseeable future, especially now that Donald Trump is in the White House. According to the Fed's latest report, economic activity ""rose slightly in most Districts"", a clear improvement from the descriptions used in the previous months, and that ""three regions exhibited modest or moderate growth that offset flat or slightly declining activity in two others."" Employment levels were flat or up only slightly across districts and prices rose only at a modest pace across Federal Reserve districts. Reading further, we find yet another indication of the Trump effect, namely that although growth in economic activity was generally small (thank Biden), expectations for growth rose moderately across most geographies and sectors (thanks Trump) and ""business contacts expressed optimism that demand will rise in coming months."" Elsewhere, we find that consumer spending was ""generally stable"" although many consumer-oriented businesses across Districts noted further increases in price sensitivity among consumers, as well as several reports of increased sensitivity to quality. Among the negative aspects, spending on home furnishings was down, which contacts attributed to limited household mobility, while demand for mortgages was low overall, though reports on recent changes in home loan demand were mixed due to volatility in rates. Commercial real estate lending was similarly subdued. Still, contacts generally reported financing remained available. Turning to capital spending and purchases of raw materials, these were flat or declining in most Districts while sales of farm equipment were a notable headwind to overall investment activity, and several contacts expressed concerns about the future prices of equipment given ongoing weakness in the farm economy. Energy activity in the oil and gas sector was flat but demand for electricity generation continued to grow at a robust rate. The rise in electricity demand was driven by rapid expansions in data centers and was reportedly planned to be met by investments in renewable generation capacity in coming years. Some more details from the Beige Book, starting with Labor Markets: Employment levels were flat or up only slightly across Districts . Hiring activity was subdued as worker turnover remained low and few firms reported increasing their headcount . The level of layoffs was also reportedly low . Contacts indicated they expected employment to remain steady or rise slightly over the next year, but many were cautious in their optimism about any pickup in hiring activity . Wage growth softened to a modest pace across most Districts, as did expectations for wage growth in coming months. Job growth and wage growth for entry-level positions and skilled trades were an exception, rising robustly and expected to grow further through next year. While Friday's jobs report will have more to say about this, today's ADP report which indicated a sharp bounce in wage growth suggests that the Fed is now working on stale wage data. Turning to prices: Prices rose only at a modest pace across Federal Reserve Districts. Both consumer-oriented and business-oriented contacts reported greater difficulty passing costs on to customers. Input prices were said to be rising faster than selling prices for most businesses, resulting in declining profit margins. Although input prices rose generally, contacts in several Districts noted declines in certain raw materials and non-labor costs. In contrast, rising insurance prices were again reported widely as significant costs pressures for many businesses. Contacts indicated they expect the current pace of price growth to persist, but businesses in several Districts indicated tariffs pose a significant upside risk to inflation. Here are the main highlights by Fed District Boston: Economic activity was down a bit on balance. Prices increased at a slight pace. Employment held steady despite a slowdown in hiring demand. Consumers held back on restaurant spending. Warm, dry weather crimped demand for selected goods. Commercial real estate contacts perceived stabilization in the office sector. Expectations were mixed, marked by uncertainty among many contacts. New York: On balance, regional economic activity expanded slightly, led by strong growth in the manufacturing sector. Employment in the region grew slightly, and wage growth remained moderate. Commercial real estate markets steadied after a period of weakness, with a pickup in demand in the New York City office market. Selling price increases remained modest. Philadelphia: Business activity edged up in the current Beige Book period after falling slightly last period. Consumer spending was flat overall, but the broader nonmanufacturing sector edged up, and manufacturers reported modest growth. Employment, wages, and prices all rose modestly, but inflation expectations edged higher over concerns about potential tariffs. On average, firms expect moderate economic growth over the next six months. Cleveland: District business activity grew modestly in recent weeks, and contacts expected activity to increase further in the months ahead. Demand for business services remained robust, and nonresidential construction activity increased modestly. Employment levels grew slightly. Overall, contacts indicated that wages, nonlabor input costs, and prices increased modestly. Richmond: The regional economy grew slightly in recent weeks. Some negative impacts from Hurricane Helene and the port worker strike were reported by businesses in affected regions and segments of the economy. Employment was little changed this cycle, while wages grew moderately and price levels were little changed, leading to reports of profit margin compression for businesses. Atlanta: Economic activity in the Sixth District grew. Employment was steady and wages grew slowly. Input costs and prices were little changed. Retail sales improved slightly. Tourism declined modestly. Demand for housing deteriorated. Transportation activity grew slightly. Loan growth was modest. Manufacturing fell, and energy activity grew modestly. Chicago: Economic activity increased slightly. Consumer and business spending rose modestly; employment was up slightly; construction and real estate activity was flat; nonbusiness contacts saw little change in activity; and manufacturing activity decreased modestly. Prices were up modestly, wages rose moderately, and financial conditions loosened slightly. Prospects for 2024 farm income were unchanged. St. Louis: Economic activity across the Eighth District has slightly increased since our previous report. Prices increased moderately, with greater pushback against those price increases. Consumer spending has slightly declined across the income distribution. Contacts expected slight growth in employment, particularly coming from industrial production. The outlook has modestly improved; however, contacts noted that uncertainty about future policies was slowing investment, and businesses were increasing inventories in anticipation of potential import tariffs. Minneapolis: District economic activity increased slightly. Employment grew, but labor demand softened, and turnover was down. Wage growth was moderate, and prices increased slightly. Consumer spending was flat, but tourism increased. Energy, commercial construction, and residential real estate also saw growth while manufacturing and homebuilding decreased. Kansas City: Economic growth was modest and balanced across sectors. Expectations for demand growth were strong and supported plans to increase hiring and capital expenditures. Most contacts indicated they do not plan to raise wages substantially over the next year. Yet, the outlook for consumer spending remained strong, even as customers became more sensitive to prices and quality. Dallas: Economic activity rose moderately over the reporting period. Growth continued in nonfinancial services and resumed in manufacturing and retail. Employment increased, and wage growth ticked up. Outlooks improved, with widespread increases in demand expectations. Interest rate cuts have had an overall positive but mild effect, and contacts were mostly bullish on prospective business conditions under the incoming administration, though some noted worry about potential trade and immigration policy changes. San Francisco: Economic activity was stable. Employment levels were generally unchanged, and wages and prices increased slightly. Retail sales and activity in services sectors changed little. Activity in manufacturing, residential real estate, and financial services increased somewhat, while conditions in commercial real estate were stable. Conditions in agriculture softened slightly And in keeping with the argument that the Dec Beige Book was much more hawkish than many expected, a quick semantic analysis finds that mentions of ""slow"" collapsed from 55 in October and an average of 56 in the past year to just 29, the lowest since the covid surge. Meanwhile, ""inflation"" remained sticky with 12 mentions, up 1 from last month and the highest since April Bottom line: if the September Beige Book is what ultimately tipped the scales for the Fed to cut 50bps, then the December Beige Book is the first solid hint that a Fed pause may take place as soon as this month (which is perfectly understandable since Trump is now in the White House and the Fed will do everything in its power to make his life miserable).

What Does the Holiday Shopping Season Look Like? On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Tariff Threats: Are They Real for Investors and Consumers? Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of “tariff threats” on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect’s proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump’s first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn’t a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar’s possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these “tariff threats” might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar’s strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar’s strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US. With these trends in view, let’s look at the 10 best retail stocks to invest in. A woman in a retail store trying out a product, showcasing the retail colocation of the company.

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is a discount retailer that offers an elaborate array of merchandise, including seasonal items, consumable items, apparel, home products, and more. Its merchandise includes brands from manufacturers and its own private brands that are sold at a discount. The company has focused labor hours on perpetual inventory management in its store to improve its in-stock levels and support its sales growth. These efforts have paid dividends and have led to year-over-year improvements in its in-stock levels. Dollar General’s (NYSE:DG) merchandising and supply chain teams have also contributed to this in-store progress by simplifying operations for the company’s teams. The company has also undertaken the first full-scale refresh of its sorting process within its distribution centers. With this initiative, Dollar General’s (NYSE:DG) ultimate goal is to enable its store teams to stock shelves more quickly and drive higher on-shelf availability for customers. This is expected to ultimately support ongoing sales and boost profitability. The company expects to complete this work by the end of the year. It ranks tenth on our list of the 10 best retail stocks to invest in. 9. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a technical athletic apparel retailer that also offers footwear and accessories. The company operates stores in the US, China Mainland, Canada, Australia, and South Korea. Its international markets are seeing continuous strength as the Lululemon brand is resonating with consumers around the globe. One of the company’s largest opportunities is growing its business outside of North America. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is on track to quadruple its international revenue from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. The company’s near-term action plan involves leveraging its chase and fast-track design capabilities to bring more seasonal newness into its women’s assortment as promptly as possible. It is focusing on its strong performers, including its gold zip scuba in Softreme, aligned leggings in colors and prints, and new silhouettes and seasonal fabrics. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) plans to fast-track several new styles of performance shorts, tops, and tracksuits in 2025. Through these strategies, it aims to return to its historic levels of newness, no later than Spring 2025. Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its Q2 2024 investor letter : “I mentioned last quarter and higher above that I like buying quality stocks on sale. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), the 2nd worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, qualifies. I published a full thesis on the stock before its most recent earnings, but the basics: the yoga pants and clothing company has had an amazing post-pandemic run that is approaching its end. Its growth in the US is slow/non-existent at the moment, but it is growing very fast in China and Europe. I think that international growth is likely to endure, and that its US slowness is likely to be temporary. Lululemon shares are not ‘cheap’, but they are on sale for an average price, and I think the company will grow faster than average over the next five years. I would be wrong if Lululemon is a fad gone bust, or faces a huge post-pandemic hangover as people get used to leaving the house more. We’ll see.” Share Page 1 of 9 Next >> NYSE:DG NYSE:ACI NYSE:WMT NYSE:TJX NYSE:TGT Headline NYSE:ANF NASDAQ:ROST NASDAQ:COST NASDAQ:LULU Daily Newsletter Walmart Inc.

The National Accounts reveal an economy on life support as aggressive interest rate rises and the high cost of living bite into business and consumer spending. Credits Peter Ryan, Reporter Image Details The National Accounts reveal an economy on life support as aggressive interest rate rises and the high cost of living bite into business and consumer spending. ( AAP: Dan Peled ) Program: More from The World Today Transcript Sally Sara: Australia's economy is limping along at its slowest pace since the 1990s recession, excluding the pandemic, and is only held up by government spending according to the latest GDP figures released today. The national accounts reveal an economy on life support as aggressive interest rate rises and the high cost of living bites into business and consumer spending. But despite the flatlining result, Australia's interest rates look like staying on hold well into next year. I was joined a short time ago by our senior business correspondent, Peter Ryan. Peter, good afternoon. Take us through the numbers and what they're telling us. Peter Ryan: Well, hi Sally. These figures are for the third quarter of this year or the three months to the end of September. They reveal Australia's economy is pretty much stuck in the slow lane, not surprising given those 13 rate rises since May 2022 and the high cost of living really squeezing consumers and businesses. To the numbers, Australia's gross domestic product or GDP rose by 0.3% in the September quarter and by just 0.8% over the year below forecast. Economists had been expecting something modestly better with growth of 1.1% over the 12 months. Now, it might be sluggish growth, but the economy is still expanding, though only just. The Bureau of Statistics says it did grow for 12 quarters in a row, but that growth has continued to slow since September last year, but it's propped up by public investment up 6.3% in the September quarter. General government investment rose by 6% with a splurge on defence equipment imports and investment in hospitals and roads. Also, GDP per capita fell by 0.3%, the seventh straight quarter. In other words, households per person are feeling the pressure, which goes to lower living standards. Jarden chief economist, Micaela Fuchila, says household spending, which normally underwrites growth, played a very small role in this GDP outcome. Micaela Fuchila: Household spending was flat during the quarter, meaning that consumers actually didn't grow relative to the previous quarter. And they're only getting by by paying their bills. And at the same time, we have our public sector that is doing the heavy lifting when it comes to investment and public consumption. So the government actually added 0.7% to the to this quarter growth. So it's quite significant. Sally Sara: That's Micaela Fuchila, their chief economist at Jarden. And Peter Ryan, how will the Reserve Bank interpret the slowing economy and the outlook for interest rates? Peter Ryan: Well, Sally, the Reserve Bank will no doubt be watching this as evidence of a slowing economy, given that those rate rises are designed to take heat out of the economy and heat out of demand. The RBA, though, is also guided mainly by inflation. Headline inflation has slowed to 2.8%. It's back within the RBA's target band of 2 to 3%. But its underlying inflation, which strips out volatile items like government energy rebates and lower petrol prices, still stubbornly high at 3.5%. The jobs market remains tight. So big reasons for the RBA to stay on hold. Most economists don't see rates falling until May next year, maybe later. The RBA board holds its final meeting of the year next week. So economists will be watching for any signs of changed language or sentiment that might signify the timeline for rates relief next year. Sally Sara: That's Peter Ryan there.

China’s economic growth target of 5% this year is looking ambitious, given sluggish consumer spending, an uncertain outlook for the country’s exports and a still shaky property market . President Xi Jinping ’s government spent recent months trying to fix those problems via a succession of stimulus measures that left investors clamoring for more decisive action. Now the election of Donald Trump as US president, with his threat of steep tariffs on Chinese goods, has cast another shadow over the world’s second-largest economy. The risk is of a deflationary spiral that sends China into a period of protracted, Japan-style malaise after three decades of unprecedented growth.

LPRC and Verkada's State of Retail Safety Report reveals the challenges facing retail workers and, importantly, offers a blueprint for employers tasked with addressing them. Safety concerns are widespread, and workers report higher-ups aren't taking action: More than one in four (27%) retail workers reported feeling unsafe at work. Those fears aren't unfounded: more than half (54%) of retail workers experienced customer aggression or harassment. Despite these persistent threats, nearly one in four (22%) retail workers say their workplace has minimal to no security and 62% say that their company hasn't changed the level of security measures in the last 12 months. These threats have a ripple effect on retention and hiring: Nearly twenty percent of retail workers report they have considered looking for a new job due to personal safety concerns, and they are motivated: 40% report they are likely to leave their current job in the next 12 months due to personal safety concerns. Retailers face hurdles when they're backfilling these roles, though: 37% of store managers agree that concerns about safety are a barrier to hiring. Retail workers believe better security would help: Nearly three in four (71%) retail workers who have experienced some type of violence at work say they would feel safer with enhanced security measures. Those same respondents say that theft (77%), robbery (76%), and physical assaults (61%) could have been prevented had better security been in place. But just increasing security isn't enough: Retail workers also need better mechanisms to report these threats to law enforcement. Only half (52%) of respondents always report violent incidents to police/law enforcement. The number drops even lower when asked about witnessing a coworker(s) experiencing physical violence, where only 44% reported to police or law enforcement. ""Retail is a cornerstone of the economy, supporting 1 in 4 American jobs. The unfortunate reality is that today, retail workers are being asked to shoulder unacceptable risks every time they clock into work,"" said Read Hayes, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Loss Prevention Research Council. ""This research provides a sobering snapshot of that reality, and builds on the Loss Prevention Research Council's ongoing work to provide a roadmap for how retailers can better protect their employees and merchandise, and importantly, create safer work environments."" ""Safety is a fundamental right, and we have a responsibility to protect the 55 million Americans who work in retail,"" said Alana O'Grady Lauk , Vice President of Public Affairs at Verkada. ""This study underscores the importance of not only investing in security infrastructure but also creating a culture where retail workers feel valued, protected, and heard.""

The retail real estate sector shows strength due to rising consumer spending and evolving preferences. High street leasing rose to 3.82 million square feet, although mall space absorption decreased to 1.72 million square feet. PTI Updated On Dec 2, 2024 at 12:45 PM IST Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook New Delhi: Leasing of retail space in shopping malls and prominent high streets rose nearly 5 per cent during January-September this year across eight major cities, according to Cushman & Wakefield . Real estate consultant Cushman & Wakefield data showed that the absorption or leasing of retail space in Grade-A malls and main high streets across the top eight cities stood at 5.53 million square feet during January-September 2024 against 5.29 million square feet in the corresponding period of the preceding year. These eight cities are -- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad. Advt Saurabh Shatdal, Managing Director (Capital Markets) and Head-Retail-India, Cushman & Wakefield, said, ""India's retail real estate growth remains intact as can be observed from the strong leasing numbers, both in malls and main streets"". Increasing discretionary spending and evolving consumer preferences are driving demand for premium retail spaces, he added. Shatdal, however, said India would need to accelerate the development of quality retail spaces across major cities to unlock even greater transaction volumes, as it remains highly attractive to global retailers looking to expand their footprint. Commenting on the data, Akash Nagpal, VP-Leasing of realty firm Trehan Iris, said this growth reflects a strong rebound and a renewed sense of confidence in the retail sector. ""With consumer behaviour evolving post-pandemic, there's a clear demand for dynamic, experiential spaces. Hence, our approach is to create retail destinations that not only cater to traditional retail needs but also promote community engagement, offering experiences that can't be replicated online."" Sameer Verma, General Manager at Lulu Mall, Lucknow, said the steady increase in mall leasing activity across major cities underscores the robust recovery and expansion of the retail sector. Advt ""This positive trend aligns with our vision of creating world-class retail experiences that cater to evolving consumer preferences while fostering a thriving ecosystem for our retail partners,"" he added. According to Cushman & Wakefield data, the leasing of retail space in high streets increased to 3.82 million square feet during January-September this year from 3.44 million square feet in the year-ago period. However, the absorption of retail space in shopping malls declined to 1.72 million square feet from 1.85 million square feet. Among cities, Hyderabad's prominent high-street locations saw strong demand for retail space, with the leasing of 1.72 million square feet during January-September 2024 against 1.60 million square feet in the year-ago period.

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who is being demoted from the powerful Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate to the largely powerless Minority Leader. Schumer’s demotion to the minority status — which is shared by the other 46 Democrats — was smoothed by his support for President Joe Biden’s maximum-migration policy. That Schumer-backed policy imported roughly nine million southern migrants — ensuring the defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the loss of three Democrat-held Senate seats. That three-seat loss created a new 53-seat Republican majority in the Senate, thus forcing Schumer to hand over the gavel and return to minority status. Moreover, this is the second time Schumer has lost the Majority Leader job because he prefers mass migration above investment in American citizens’ prosperity, productivity, and births. In 2014, the Democrats lost five Senate seats because President Barack Obama welcomed illegal migrants and pushed for passage of the “Gang of Eight” amnesty and cheap labor bill. Schumer supported the bill, which canceled his expected promotion to Senate Majority Leader in 2015. By 2022, Schumer had forgotten his 2014 election disaster and was back touting the mass migration directed by Biden’s pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas: The 2024 election was a rerun of the 2014 election, in part, because both disasters were caused by the Democrat party’s increasingly unpopular welcome for millions of migrants. Democrat senators are blaming the Schumer-backed policy for their fall. “We destroyed ourselves on the immigration issue in ways that were entirely predictable and entirely manageable,” a Democrat senator told the Hill for a November 29 report. “That’s political malpractice. That’s not someone else’s fault. That’s not the groups pushing us around,” the senator added. For many years, Schumer has favored migrants over American citizens: “We’re nothing if we’re not a Nation of Immigrants,” he told pro-migration business leaders in 2020: Immigrants [not Americans and their children] built this country with their hands, enriched our culture with their minds and spirit, and provided the spark that drives our economy. … Many of you may not know this; My middle name is Ellis. Guess what? I was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island, and in keeping with that tradition, our second daughter, we chose her middle name to be Emma for the poet Emma Lazarus, who wrote on this [plaque subsequently added to the] pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses yearning to be free.” So this is in my bones as a New Yorker, as someone whose grandparents immigrated to the country in search of a better life. However, the elites and major donors in his hometown of New York City have other incentives to fund politicians who favor migration. The government-invited flood of low-wage migrants spikes their real estate wealth and cuts the cost of local labor. This inflow also hides the failure of the city government to reform its education agencies and weaken the economic clout of the middle-class New Yorkers who might collectively elect a reformist mayor and governor. “An international migration Ponzi scheme is the only thing that averts a demographic doom loop for cities like New York and San Francisco,” as Americans flee the Democrats’ huge and badly run cities, author Michael Lind wrote in a September 2023 article for Compact magazine. However, Schumer and his party are also deeply reliant on billionaire donors based in his hometown of New York and California, home of failed presidential candidate Harris. The party’s pro-migration donors are exemplified by FWD.us, whose top lobbyist has blamed Democrats for not providing enough economic support to Biden’s flood of wealth-shifting migrants. Mark Zuckerberg and a founding corps of West Coast consumer-economy investors created FWD.us in 2014 to support the “Gang of Eight” migration expansion bill. Schumer helped push that bill through the Senate, but it was torpedoed when GOP primary voters defenestrated the House Republican’s Majority Leader, pro-migration Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA). In 2020, Zuckerberg — and his policy adviser, David Plouffe — helped Biden defeat Trump . Since 2021, Mayorkas has imported roughly nine million inadmissible migrants to serve as consumers, renters, and workers for the U.S. consumer economy. The economic and civic damage done by Mayorkas’s deliberate migration policy pushed a large share of undecided swing voters to support Trump during the last week of the 2024 campaign, according to a report by Blueprint2024 , a pro-Democrat polling firm. Harris lost because “the political atmosphere was pretty brutal,” Plouffe rationalized in a PodSaveAmerica podcast on November 26 — without admitting how his FWD.us policies poisoned the political atmosphere for Harris. “I think the political atmosphere, the desire for change … really presented huge challenges for us,” Plouffe evaded. On November 5, those challenges cost Schumer three senators plus the majority gavel — for the second time."

S . economy grows at 2 . 8 % pace in third quarter on consumer spending , unchanged from first estimate",20241128T201500Z,https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,columbian.com,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer spending,"WASHINGTON — The American economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September on strong consumer spending and a surge in exports, the government said Wednesday, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of third-quarter growth. U.S. gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world’s largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation’s economic policies. He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Stay informed on what is happening in Clark County, WA and beyond for only $1.99/week Subscribe Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.1%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. The public still feels inflation’s sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up Trump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers. Wednesday’s report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP.

RELATED: Texas Military, Troopers Turn Back Wave of Migrants at Border River Crossing “They’re saying ‘We didn’t communicate the wonderfulness of our policies sufficiently,'” scoffed Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to reduce migration. “The problem is not their messaging — the problem is the substance of their [pro-migration] policy and its consequences,” Krikorian said: The administration and its allies in the media and elsewhere had almost complete control over shaping the way people perceive this [migration] phenomenon, and they’ve failed to do that [succesfully] because the reality overwhelmed their ability to dress it up. There’s only so much you can do through press releases. If community centers are being shut down because they need to be filled with [more] illegal aliens, there’s no narrative that’s going to make that palatable to people. When somebody is released into the United States by the government, is put up in a hotel for free, and then is flown to Atlanta for free, and then goes and murders somebody , there’s no covering that up. Flores’ message, he added, is “If we had only spent X times more money, we could have managed this more effectively and we wouldn’t have lost the election.” “What these guys are doing is what the kids call ‘Cope,’ trying to make themselves feel better,” Krikorian added. The theater conversation is important because Flores’ employer — FWD.us — has been the primary driver of migration policy in the Democratic Party since Trump’s 2016 win. Mark Zuckerberg and a founding corps of West Coast consumer-economy investors created FWD.us to support the “Gang of Eight” migration expansion bill. In 2020, Zuckerberg — and his policy advisor, David Plouffe — helped Biden defeat Trump . That helped ensure FWD.us got the pro-migration border chief it wanted, Alejandro Mayorkas. Since then, FWD.us has worked closely with Mayorkas to expand southern migration under a new narrative of “humane, orderly and safe immigration” via supposedly “legal pathways.” Since 2021, Mayorkas has imported roughly nine million inadmissible migrants to serve as consumers, renters, and workers for the U.S. consumer economy. In March 2021, Kamala Harris deferred to Mayorkas’ FWD.us-approved policies when she rejected Biden’s request that she become the “border czar” above Mayorkas. In 2024, David Plouffe became the campaign manager for the Harris campaign. Flores joined the campaign team , according to Vox.com. FWD’s leaders — and their West Coast business partners — provided a huge share of Harris’ funding. FWD.us — and like-minded progressive foundations — also funded many of the progressive groups in the Democratic Party’s base, ensuring far greater support for migration than in 2012. RELATED: Border Patrol Chief Disagrees with Biden, Mayorkas; Admits No “Operational Control” Over Border On the 2024 campaign trail, Harris did not break from Mayorkas’ migration policy. She quietly included it in her platform and used the same language pushed by FWD.us — even though Mayorkas’ migration was the second-most important issue in the race. Since the November 5 disaster, many Democrats have tried to hide the political damage done by the FWD.us agenda. Harris lost because “the political atmosphere was pretty brutal,” Plouffe rationalized in a PodSaveAmerica podcast on November 26 — without admitting how his FWD.us policies poisoned the political atmosphere for Harris. “I think the political atmosphere, the desire for change … really presented huge challenges for us,” Plouffe evaded. She did not change course on migration because “she had tremendous loyalty to President Biden,” claimed Stephanie Cutter, a top advisor in the campaign. She continued: Imagine if we said, “Well, we would have taken this [alternative] approach on the border” … it wasn’t going to give us what we needed, because it wouldn’t be a clean break [with the Biden/Mayorkas record]. “She was at negative 20-something [percent] on immigration,” added Quentin Fulks, a deputy manager of Harris’ campaign who has managed several other candidates’ campaigns. “We got that down to negative 10.” That gain is small comfort to the many other Democratic interest groups and donors who now face Trump in the White House. The Cinema Meeting Flores and the president of FWD.us, Todd Schulte, spoke to their D.C.-based progressive allies on November 19. They met in a cinema at a showing of a new documentary “ Separated ” in a downtown theater. “This film would not be out and you guys would not be seeing if it was not for the support of FWD,” declared NBC News reporter Jacob Soboroff , whose book provided the basis for the documentary. After the documentary was shown, the invited progressive audience listened as Flores explained the 2024 presidential defeat. Democrats did not properly prepare for Biden’s migration, said Flores, who worked in Biden’s White House for six months. “What really happened is Democrats didn’t come in,” she said, adding: When President Biden was elected, there was a huge majority of public support to rebuild the asylum system, to make it more humane, more orderly. The majority of the public actually supported increased immigration to the United States. Four years go by, and that has completely reversed. Breitbart News has closely tracked the growing public opposition to migration. Democrats should have spent heavily to minimize the economic pain of the migrants’ arrival, Flore said: I think that is not because people do not want the United States to be a place of refuge. I do not think that’s an anti-immigrant sentiment — I think that is an “anti-mismanagement of immigration” sentiment. I think that’s anti-chaos [sentiment]. I think that is the cost of not running systems that really center American communities who intake and welcome immigrants. There’s not a set of laws about what should happen when people come to the border and what happens after that point. There just isn’t. The White House’s narrative failure allowed Trump to persuade voters that migration was tied to economics, inflation, and housing costs, Flores said: Lack of [a pro-migration] narrative … led everyone to hear the consistent message that Trump had been saying for eight years … that immigration was the cause of every domestic problem, whether it was housing, whether it was the price of goods. “I’m not sure I totally agree with all you said,” responded MSNBC host Jen Psaki, a former spokeswoman for Biden who hosted the cinema event. She added: I actually think that part of it from what I’ve seen, at least in [polling] data, is that people in a lot of communities are concerned that the border is not secure. Where Next? After Flores spoke, FWD.us president Schulte set the direction for his progressives to counter Trump’s pushback against the huge migration inflow favored by the investors. “We should build a much more welcoming and humane and orderly immigration system,” he told his invited audience of pro-migration progressives: We’ve got to have an immigration system. It’s not about one built in the last century, but one that works for the next decades to come. We can do that, and it will be imperfect and challenging. FWD.us is an advocacy group for wealthy investors — not for migrants who want green cards. FWD.us has a very rational mission: migrants grow the economy, partly through their low-wage work, partly through their consumption and monthly rents, but also because they cause massive deficit spending that fuels more business and sales. The migrant-inflated economy grows the nation’s pool of profits — and every extra $1 of profit investors earn from migration adds roughly $20 to their stock values. Unsurprisingly and rationally. The public does not want their wages cut , their housing costs raised , and their workplaces denied productivity investments . Nor do they want their limited civic assets to be overloaded , their personal security eroded , and their civic society distracted by strange voices and foreign demands for the benefit of wealthy investors . In this fight over immigration policy, the progressives are serving the investors, Krikorian noted The left really believes in open borders, and they think that they’re sticking it to the man, when, in fact, the Man is laughing all the way to the bank … The smarter ones, I think, figure, “Look, yes, this is serving the interests of capital — I get it and I don’t like it. But in the long run … it’s going to change politics. In this long battle over power and money, Schulte and his allies lost their first-round “Gang of Eight” fight in 2014. But they fought Trump to a draw in the second round, from 2016 to 2020. In round three, their allies — Mayorkas and Biden — scored very big by importing roughly 9 million extra economic migrants across the southern border, alongside an additional 4 million legal immigrants and visa workers. Round four has just opened badly for FWD.us as Trump prepared to occupy the Oval Office and deport more than 1 million migrants. During the cinema meeting with progressives, Flores described the FWD.us’ plan for massive resistance against Trump’s pro-American policies and against Americans’ civil right to secure borders and a national labor market: What can people do? …FWD.us has been spending last year working with a lot of people in this room and building out what could be a modern way that we as the United States welcome displaced people, but also increase legal pathways to migration and to start talking about it. We’re going to be releasing it, and we’re going to be — even when Trump is doing what Trump is doing — we have to start putting out better policy solutions because our immigration system is so incredibly outdated, it is hard to justify. I just think of so many families who came in under, say, President Biden, who used his humanitarian legal pathways, and who now will likely lose status. It could be as soon as January. So I think it’s also about, one look out for your neighbors, work with your state and local governments and say “Do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agreements.” Resist the pressure to feel that this election meant that people support mass deportations ….The politics are hard that I don’t think the American people are both like I remember when Trump was left the first time in my hometown, the children vanish from schools, and that will happen again. And so I think that local organizing is really, really critical, and governors and mayors are going to be on the front lines … You’re going to see a state-by-state response, and … there’s many ways you can protect people, Schulte stepped in to praise his progressive allies, and to recommend narratives and keywords — Chaos! — to use in the PR fight over migration. But Schulte admitted, “I do think that where we are heading is really hard, and it’s going to be really challenging.” A week later, his task got much harder. One of the primary founding members of FWD.us, Reid Hoffman, suggested he would depart the United States because of Trump’s win, according to the New York Times . Worse, FWD.us founder Zuckerberg went to mend fences with Trump in Mar-a-Lago. “It’s an important time for the future of American Innovation. Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming Administration,” the company said in a press statement . Stephen Miller, who is Trump’s top deputy for migration and Schulte’s main enemy, claimed victory on Fox News: [Zuckerberg] has been very clear about his desire to be a supporter of, and a participant in, this change we’re seeing all around America and the world, with this reform movement that Donald Trump is leading. https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1861931743877722149 As Schulte told his progressive allies in the cinema meeting, “Where we are heading is really hard, and it’s going to be really challenging.”"

U.S. gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world’s largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation’s economic policies. He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. ALSO READ: Trump’s cabinet picks, appointees face bomb threat, swatting incidents Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.1%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. READ MORE FROM: NIGERIAN TRIBUNE EXPOSED!!

Gross domestic product increased at an unrevised 2.8% annualised rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. Slight downward revisions to consumer spending, government outlays and exports, were offset by upgrades to private inventory accumulation, business investment as well as state and local government spending. The US economy grew at a 3% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a still-brisk 3.5% pace. That was revised down from the previously estimated 3.7% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at an unrevised 3.2% pace. Domestic demand increased at 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $0.2 billion, or were unchanged in percentage terms last quarter. They increased 9.6% from the same quarter one year ago. Profits of domestic financial firms decreased $2.6 billion, while those of non financial institutions increased $30.8 billion. Profits from the rest of the world fell $38.3 billion. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.2% rate last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a downwardly revised 2% pace in the second quarter. GDI was previously estimated to have increased at a 3.4% pace in the April-June quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions have sharply narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.5% rate last quarter, matching the second quarter's downwardly revised pace. Gross domestic output was previously reported to have advanced at a 3.2% pace in the April-June quarter. More stories on News Business Us Economy US Federal Reserve Accreditation: Reuters"

U.S. gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world’s largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation’s economic policies . He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.1%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. The public still feels inflation’s sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up Trump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers. Wednesday’s report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP. The Commerce Department will issue the final report on Dec. 19. This story has been corrected to show that consumer spending rose at the fastest pace since the fourth quarter, not the first quarter, of 2023.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product surged by 2.8 percent in the third quarter, unchanged versus the 'advance' estimate issued last month. The report said upward revisions to private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment were offset by downward revisions to exports and consumer spending. The unrevised increase by GDP in the third quarter still reflects a modest slowdown from the 3.0 percent jump in the second quarter. The deceleration by GDP growth in the third quarter primarily reflected a downturn in private inventory investment and a larger decrease in residential fixed investment. These movements were partly offset by accelerations in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending, the Commerce Department said. 'A strong economy argues in favor of more gradual rate cuts than the 50bps that kicked off the Fed's easing cycle,' said Nationwide Financial Markets Economist Oren Klachkin. 'With healthy GDP growth and solid labor market, Fed officials are now vigilant that cutting too quickly will stimulate inflation.' With regard to inflation, the Commerce Department said the pace of consumer price growth in the third quarter was unrevised at 1.5 percent, which reflects a notable slowdown from the 2.5 percent jump in the second quarter. The increase by core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, was downwardly revised by 0.1 percentage point to 2.1 percent. Core consumer prices surged 2.8 percent in the second quarter. Copyright(c) 2024 RTTNews.com.

(Nick Rohlman/The Gazette via AP, File) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: November 27, 2024 at 8:54 AM EST | UPDATED: November 27, 2024 at 12:37 PM EST By PAUL WISEMAN, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September on strong consumer spending and a surge in exports, the government said Wednesday, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of third-quarter growth. U.S. gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. But the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world’s largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Still, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation’s economic policies . He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated. But growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged. When he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy. Growth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.1%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. The public still feels inflation’s sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up Trump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers. Wednesday’s report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP. The Commerce Department will issue the final report on Dec. 19.

This book deals with Hoveyda's life and political career; his appointment to Prime Minister in 1965, by the Shah of Iran; his subsequent arrest, imprisonment, and execution. The book also chronicles the extensive role that the American government played in Iranian politics in the sixties and seventies. Based on recently declassified U.S. government documents, the book shows that for the past thirty years, the question of democracy has been central to American foreign policy in Iran. The book's author, Persian born Abbas Milani, lived in Iran, and was a student of Iranian politics during most of Hoyveda's tenure. Milani has also authored two other books. A tranlation of ""King of the Benighted"", a novella by Manachehr Irani. ""Tales of Two Cities: a Persian Memoir"", is Milani's biography. It includes details about his arrest and imprisonment for expressing political views, while teaching at the University of Tehran. ""The Persian Sphinx"", an extensive biography, took Milani over four years to write. It involved extensive research, and over 130 interviews with friends, acquaintances, and foes of Prime Minister Hoyveda. This significant book tells the story of a central political figure, and his role in the struggle in Iran between modernity and traditionalism. During the thirteen years serving as a Prime Minister, Hoveyda sought to free Iran from poverty and repression, and to usher the country into the modern age. Dr. Milani says of Hoveyda, "" He lived at the height between Iran's historic struggle between modernity and tradition."" As it the threat of a revolution began to rise, however, the Shah tried to create a scapegoat by ordering the arrest and imprisonment of Hoveyda. On January 16, 1979, the Shah and his family fled Iran. But they left behind their trusted Prime Minister, Amir Abbas Hoveyda. When the new revolutionary government took power on February 11, 1979, Hoveyda was still in prison. Rather than risk an escape attempt, he chose to stay and surrender to the Islamic victors. This left Hoyveda in the unfortunate position of being the only high-ranking official and the only Prime Minister of the previous regime to fall into the hands of the victors. Dr. Milani says of Hoyveda, ""He was a true intellectual, a man of cosmopolitan flair, a liberal at heart who served an illiberal master."" This book is not only a must read for those interested the life of an important Iranian political figure, and his role in shaping Iran's transition from traditionalism to modernity. It also offers exciting behind-the-scenes investigative reporting, and documentation about a turbulent era in Iran's history, and it's impact on United States foreign policy Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Linkedin Tags Amir-abbas Hoveyda The Persian Sphinx Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Iran Politics Shia Islam And Politics Politics Of Iran Government Of Iran Politics Of The Middle East Government Society Of Iran Abbas Milani To continue, please log in, or sign up for a new account.

NBC News; Getty Images Nov. 27, 2024, 7:00 AM EST By Harriet Baskas Traveling for the holidays this year? The answer increasingly depends on your paycheck. Households earning at least six figures a year are expected to make up the largest share of holiday travelers this season — 45%, up from 38% in 2023, according to a recent survey by the consulting firm Deloitte. And they’re on track to make up a majority of paid lodging customers, expanding their ranks as hotel guests from 43% last season to 52% now. “Travelers are looking to invest in upgrades and experiences that will make the holiday memorable,” said Kate Ferrara, vice chair for U.S. transportation, hospitality and services at Deloitte. But that’s partly a reflection of who’s traveling in the first place. While richer people are expanding their footprint in the holiday travel mix, lower-paid ones are shrinking theirs: Households making under $50,000 are set to make up just 23% of travelers, down from 28% a year ago, Deloitte found. (The median U.S. income was about $80,600 a year , according to the latest Census data.) It’s another sign of what Jan Freitag, national director for hospitality market analytics at the real-estate data firm CoStar, calls the “wealth effect” rippling across the consumer economy. “Continued higher stock and home prices make higher-end households ‘feel’ wealthier,” he said, “and so they are taking this festive season as another reason to treat themselves.” The trend helps explain why racial disparities in net worth have widened during the recovery from the pandemic, even as certain income gaps have narrowed . It also helps explain why airlines and hotel operators have wasted no time chasing affluent customers’ disposable dollars — dangling an ever-expanding slate of luxury packages and prompts to upgrade, which have become unmissable for anyone booking a trip in recent years. Travel brands have “done a great job since Covid of attracting these types of customers by adapting their products to this ‘premium leisure’ segment,” said Jonathan Kletzel, a travel, transportation and logistics leader for the auditing firm PwC. Indeed, the luxury travel network Virtuoso said it’s seen seasonal bookings surge 37% since last year among its high-end clientele. Nightly rates for ritzy hotels during the holidays are up 6%, at just over $2,000 per night. Some of the most popular holiday destinations, including high-end resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean, have risen even more steeply — by about 8%, with rooms now going for over $3,000 a night. Domestic airfares for the week of Christmas this year are averaging $352 round-trip, 9% more than last year, according to the booking site Hopper. And round-trip tickets to Europe for the week of Christmas are averaging $1,207, a whopping 33% jump from last year. It isn’t just the ultrarich splashing out on top-tier travel and driving up prices for everyone else. Consumers overall “are more willing to pull back on goods than on experiences,” said Misty Belles, vice president for global public relations at Virtuoso. But even while they prioritize things like travel, many consumers “are also looking for value for money, and they fully expect service levels to reflect the prices they’re paying,” she added. That’s true across income levels and far beyond the hospitality industry. Shoppers continue to flock toward retailers where they feel they’ll get the best bang for their buck, and an intensifying competition on price is driving Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts this week. Weather threatens to snarl Thanksgiving travel plans: What to know 03:50 But while post-pandemic travel demand continues to rise , many are finding ways to venture out without spending more. Some 64% of Americans plan to take more than one trip this holiday season, Deloitte found, up from 57% in 2023. And 28% plan to significantly increase their budgets for their longest trip, up from just 18% last year. At the same time, PwC found a big jump in travelers planning to stay with family and friends over the holidays — 56% this year versus 45% last — and falling interest in booking name-brand hotels (39%, down from 46%). “These travel choices may suggest that people are looking to save money, likely choosing cheaper options to keep their travel costs down,” the researchers wrote. Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for Bankrate, said there are signs that “inflation continues to strain holiday travelers in a big way.” The consumer finance company found 86% of households making less than $100,000 annually expect to change their holiday travel plans due to cost increases (although a hefty 77% of six-figure earners said the same). Bankrate found 29% of travers expect to take on debt to fund their travels this season. That includes 22% who plan to carry a credit card balance, and 10% who plan to use “buy now, pay later” services . “They don’t want to skip the trip entirely, but they’re willing to cut some corners to save money,” said Rossman.

On the other hand, cafes which offer a cup of coffee at below 100 baht have witnessed significant growth of between 60-100%. Consumers prefer coffee at 60-80 baht though they still opt for more expensive caffeine hits on special occasions or to reward themselves, he said. Korn added that consumers’ spending amount per bill has dropped from 250 baht to 100-150 baht, citing data from Grab delivery service platform. However, he confirmed that the cafe sector itself has not slowed amid the decline in consumer spending, saying that consumers instead looked for other drinks, such as a smoothie or Dubai chocolate. “If we look at the food industry as a whole, we find that delivery orders are down, but indulgence is on the rise,” he said. Korn went on to say that, like cocoa, global coffee bean prices have surged by 74.3% year on year due to global warming and a decline in crop productivity, a condition worsened by the 90% import tax imposed on coffee beans. One kilogramme of coffee beans now costs up to 200 baht when 90% import tax, 7% value added tax and transportation cost are included, he explained. Coffee beans cultivated in Thailand were not enough to close the gap in the market, he added. - The Nation/ANN Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

New monthly data from the Australian ﻿Bureau of Statistics has showed the consumer price index was at 2.1 per cent for October - the same as it was in September - and lower than what economists had been expecting. The figure is lower than August's 2.7 per cent, and is the lowest level since July 2021.﻿ READ MORE: Coles slash more prices in lead-up to Christmas ﻿ Headline inflation has remained at its lowest level in more than three ﻿years. (Luis Enrique Ascui/The Age) Once again, energy rebates and falling fuel prices helped headline inflation stay at the lower end of the RBA's target range. However, one of the key measures of underlying inflation – the trimmed mean – actually increased slightly to 3.5 per cent, still beyond the 2 to 3 per cent target. ﻿""The falls in electricity and fuel had a significant impact on the annual CPI measure this month,"" ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt said. READ MORE: What the RBA is really looking at when it sets interest rates ﻿ ""When prices for some items move by large amounts, measures of underlying inflation like the CPI excluding volatile items and holiday travel, and the trimmed mean can provide additional insights into how inflation is trending. ""Annual trimmed mean inflation was 3.5 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent in the previous month and similar to where it was in August.""

With the trimmed mean rising to its highest level since July, today's inflation data is highly unlikely to lead the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates in its final meeting of the year in a fortnight. The RBA typically puts more weight on the quarterly figures, the next instalment of which isn't due until late January.

That message must be broadcast widely because President-elect Donald Trump’s deputies must keep the trust of the American people as they enforce the nation’s popular migration laws, Homan said. “We will be very transparent,” Homan said, adding, “We’ll be sending a lot of information out every week on exactly what we’re doing, do a lot of videos, a lot of interviews. We need to control the narrative so we keep the trust of American people.” Homan has a tough enemy. Pro-migration advocates have their own poll-tested narratives, and boatloads of cash, many advocacy groups , skewed polls , and media support to push their messages via many channels. “I think it’s really important to pin this [deportation fight] on Donald Trump” because he does not want to be blamed for the drama of deportations, said a leading advocate for more migration. These pro-migration groups cite the economic gains from their Extraction Migration economic strategy — but they ignore the domestic economic losses , civic damage , and national risks , and the vast civic damage done to the migrants’ home countries, such as Haiti and Nicaragua . They raise alarms about separated families, crying mothers, border chaos, and military-style enforcement — but they ignore Americans’ civil right to secure borders , the many migration-caused crimes in the United States , as well as the migrants’ deaths , the child labor , and the migrants’ left-behind families . “There’s never been a bigger separator of families than [Joe Biden’s border chief, Alejandro] Mayorkas,” said Jay Palmer, an expert in labor trafficking expert and former advisor to President Donald Trump. “What he did was he ripped [foreign] families apart, left the kids there and brought the men to the United States to work as cheap labor”: Homan’s Message “The American people need to hear the tragedy” of mass migration, Homan said. Biden’s migration has killed thousands of migrants, Homan said, adding: I was down in Texas last year, and I was with a sheriff. I was with him for four hours. We found two dead bodies. He told me he’s lucky to find 10 percent of the bodies because … the animals have taken them. They won’t find a lot of them who drowned in the river. … I stood on the back of a [smuggler’s] tractor trailer and 19 dead aliens that were baked to death, including a five year old little boy … So if people wore my shoes for 34 years and seen the tragedies, the senseless deaths, that I’ve seen, they understand me that a secure border saves lives. Many more migrants die on their way to the U.S. border, Homan said, adding, “The Darien Gap [in Panama] has thousands [of deaths] a year.” Many more migrants are raped and sexually assaulted by the Democrats’ easy-migration policies, he said: “I talked to girls as young as nine that were raped multiple times by members of the cartels [that manage the migrant flow]. … Everything innocent, pure was ripped from her soul, she’ll never be the same, her life will never be the same. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed by drugs smuggled amid the chaos of mass migration, he said. Aspiring nurse Laken Riley is just one of many Americans killed by the migrants who have been imported, housed, and transported by Democrat party officials and their allied nonprofit groups: The enforcement-save-lives message has to be presented in several ways, Homan said. “Sometimes you’ve got to slow roll it, but other times, I think, the shock of it will move people.” “We’re going to send out our message through various media outlets to let American people know about the children we save, about the victims of trafficking. … We want to tell that story.” “We can’t count on newspapers,” Homan added. North of the border, the repatriation process for migrants will be conducted carefully and humanely, he added. “We have committed to this being a humane process,” he said: This won’t be neighborhood sweeps. This is a targeted enforcement operation. We know exactly who we’re going to arrest before we leave office. … Every arrest we make has been approved by a supervisor. We know exactly who we’re looking for. We have a pretty good idea where we’re going to find them. They got to get approval to do it. So it’s going to be well, well-planned, humane operation. Officials will start by focusing on the hundreds of thousands of migrants who are criminals and the roughly 1.3 million migrants who have used all their legal appeals, he said: If a judge says, “No, you don’t qualify [for asylum]. You must go home,” then we must execute those orders, remove those people. If we don’t … [then] just abolish the immigration court because [judges] orders obviously don’t mean anything anymore. Migrants know the law and often take many steps to evade enforcement, he said. So “if you come to this country illegally and you get an order of removal [from a judge], but you hide out, [and if] you decide to have a child that becomes a U.S. citizen, that’s on you,” he said. “Having a child in the United States does not give you amnesty.” One migrant displayed his use of his infant as a shield against repatriation: “He can’t hold this country hostage,” Homan said when Breitbart cited the video and added, “The bottom line is: He’s the one who broke the law, he put himself in that position, he put his child in that position … knowing he was in the country illegally, knowing that he had an order for deportation.” Homan’s message is applauded by immigration reformers. By first repatriating criminals and migrants who have been ordered home, it will be a “long, long time before you start getting to the people who might evoke sympathy,” said Ira Mehlman, the spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, adding: We didn’t get into this overnight. We’re not going to get out of it tomorrow. It is going to be a process, a long process, and you just go after it in some kind of rational way that sends a signal that we are not going to tolerate this anymore. Once in power, Trump’s deputies will be able to lift the lid on the many semi-secret scandals and disasters created by Biden’s migration deputies. The exposure of the abuse and harm done to migrants, to U.S. blue-collar families , and to U.S. college graduates by the investor-led progressives may temporarily deflate many progressives’ claims of moral superiority: Anti-Enforcement Narratives Trump’s enforcement campaign — and Homan’s good-cop narrative — will face a lavishly funded, sophisticated, and emotional PR campaign of emotional attack ads and counter-narratives. Much of the elite pushback will be conducted by eager reporters and social media managers. Many prefer to see themselves as progressive champions for vulnerable migrants and innocent children against powerful “racists” and mean “xenophobes.” But their pushback is being guided by the West Coast investors at Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us , which has been closely allied with Mayorkas since at least 2020. The FWD.us group was formed in 2013 by Mark Zuckerberg and other wealthy West Coast consumer-economy investors . The investors gain roughly $20 in stock value for every extra $1 earned in profit when the government extracts welfare-aided consumers , apartment-sharing renters, and low-wage workers from poor countries. Those consumer-economy investors fund many progressive groups in Washington, DC, and around the nation. This Astroturf Empire distracts politicians, officials, judges, and the media from recognizing the huge economic impact caused by the investors’ policy of extracting more consumers, renters, and workers from poor countries. The network has funded many astroturf campaigns , urged Democrats not to talk about the economic impact of migration, and manipulated and steered coverage by the TV networks and the print media . The result is that many progressives and media people stay silent about migration’s civic and economic damage. For example, migration inflates the cost of housing, deflates both salaries and wages, reduces automation and productivity , and gives C-Suite executives more power over professionals . These investor groups developed many of their major poll-tested narrative themes during the first Trump administration. Those themes frame the repatriation issue as the hate-driven, chaotic, and wasteful infliction of pain on children and families — but not the rational, popular, decent, and legitimate defense of a nation’s citizens from a mass inflow of poor foreign workers and their dependents. Rolling Stone parroted the corporate narrative on November 19: In the corner of the center, one young Haitian girl was flipping through a children’s book and playing with a small, blonde doll. She wasn’t bothering anyone or hurting anyone in any way. Yet, she is, to the President Trumps of the world, a quintessential example of someone who should be easily demagogued for electoral gain, rounded up, and purged from our country. These talking points portray the enforcement of immigration laws as fueled by irrational and chaotic personal bigotry. “ Cruelty is the point ,” says Douglas Rivlin, the spokesman for America’s Voice, which is backed by the FWD.us investor group, said . “The Trump team [will] implement anti-immigrant policies,” not enforcement of immigration laws, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told ABC News. Democrats wrap their pro-migration policies in family values rhetoric and imagery of military-style enforcement. Under Trump, “taxpayer dollars could be used to fund deportation flights that would tear apart … families , but also our communities,” said Eva Bitran, director of immigrants’ rights at the ACLU in Southern California. “They’re talking about rounding up people who are law-abiding, undocumented immigrants in this country, many of whom are working, paying taxes [to state and local governments],” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker told MSNBC . Pro-migration advocates are also expanding the definition of families to include distant relatives, citizen families with migrant relatives , and unrelated migrants living in the same apartment or house. “Mass deportation is family separation by another name,” NBC journalist Jacob Soboroff said on November 19, adding: “It’s not separating [parents from] children at the border … [it is separating illegal-migrant] parents from the [US-born] children and the children from their schools in the interior.” His comment came at a November 19 screening of a Hollywood-produced documentary about border security, which was supported and promoted by FWD.us. The documentary explained how advocates used the “kids in cages” and “family separation” themes to create a media uproar that pressured Trump to end “zero tolerance” border enforcement in June 2018. The D.C. audience consisted largely of pro-migration activists, most of whom were older women eager to embrace the FWD.us narrative about cruel treatment of migrant families. One woman shouted: They got away with this one time. We’re not going to let him [Trump] do it again. We’re not going to let him make our federal government the Third Reich of the US. We’re not going to let them make our National Guard the Gestapo [Nazi secret police] of the U.S. We are not going to let that happen. They want to send out National Guards … We’ll bring their fathers, their mothers, their teachers, and they’ll have to look them in the eye before they take these [migrants] people out of their home. “Thank you for speaking out — it is what everybody feels,” responded Jen Psaki, an MSNBC host at the event. “Your spirit, I hope, is what many, many people have.” But Psaki also admitted that the public is backing Trump : “If you look at polling, which is imperfect, there is a large percentage of the American public who is concerned about border security, concerned about security in their communities.” The FWD.us narrative also includes threats against Americans’ economy and pocketbooks. The repatriation of migrants will cause inflation and economic harm to Americans, insist Democrat-aligned economists. Axios.com posted a laundry list of employers’ objections under the headline “The industries that could be hardest hit by Trump’s immigration crackdown.” But these threats of economic turmoil ignore the gains for low-wage Americans — higher wages, cheaper housing, more high-tech investment, and more cooperative employers . The themes of military-style enforcement, cruelty, economic turmoil, and crying children, are wrapped together by the primary theme of “ chaos .” “Mass exclusion … feeds chaos at the border,” economist Michael Clemens claimed. “It will cause chaos , and that will be bad for local law enforcement to have that type of chaos , where people are afraid to go to their local police officers. … that’s what causes an archy in societies,” Rep. Tom Suozzi, told CNN on November 18. “There’s a lot of people who are committed to spurring chaos for their own means,” Todd Schulte, the president of Zuckerberg’s FWD.us lobby, told the theater audience. “I think a lot on that question of chaos,” said Shulte as he urged the audience of shabbily dressed progressives to blame Trump, not his deputies such as Homan and Stephen Miller: I think it’s really important to pin this on Donald Trump … it is actually really important to me that he is the person who feels the pressure when he does things well, and he is the person for when he tried to end DACA, there was this huge blowback from [young illegal migrants] “dreamers” to the Pope to the CEOs. And he said, “Oh no, no, no, Congress should act!” … He got pinned into a corner … he was eating shit politically for this. I don’t believe he was doing this because he thought it was the right thing in his heart. And that, to me, is a really important lesson for those of us on the outside But he admitted, “I do think that where we are heading is really hard, and it’s going to be really challenging.”"

India’s capital New Delhi frequently ranks among the world’s most polluted cities. Each winter, vehicle and factory emissions couple with farm fires from surrounding states to blanket the city in a dystopian haze. Acrid smog this month contains more than 50 times the World Health Organization recommended limit of fine particulate matter — dangerous cancer-causing microparticles known as PM2.5 pollutants, that enter the bloodstream through the lungs. Experts say India’s worsening air pollution is having a ruinous impact on its economy — with one study estimating losses to the tune of $95 billion annually, or roughly three percent of the country’s GDP. The true extent of the economic price India is paying could be even greater. “The externality costs are huge and you can’t assign a value to it,” said Vibhuti Garg, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Bhargav Krishna of the Delhi-based research collective Sustainable Futures Collaborative said “costs add up in every phase”. “From missing a day at work to developing chronic illness, the health costs associated with that, to premature death and the impact that has on the family of the person,” Krishna told AFP. – ‘Health and wealth hazard’- Still, several studies have tried to quantify the damage. One by the global consultancy firm Dalberg concluded that in 2019, air pollution cost Indian businesses $95 billion due to “reduced productivity, work absences and premature death”. The amount is nearly three percent of India’s budget, and roughly twice its annual public health expenditure. “India lost 3.8 billion working days in 2019, costing $44 billion to air pollution caused by deaths,” according to the study which calculated that toxic air “contributes to 18 percent of all deaths in India”. Pollution has also had a debilitating impact on the consumer economy because of direct health-related eventualities, the study said, reducing footfall and causing annual losses of $22 billion. The numbers are even more staggering for Delhi, the epicentre of the crisis, with the capital province losing as much as six percent of its GDP annually to air pollution. Restaurateur Sandeep Anand Goyle called the smog a “health and wealth hazard”. “People who are health conscious avoid stepping out so we suffer,” said Goyle, who heads the Delhi chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India. Tourism has also been impacted, as the smog season coincides with the period when foreigners traditionally visit northern India — too hot for many during the blisteringly hot summers. “The smog is giving a bad name to India’s image,” said Rajiv Mehra of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. Delhi faces an average 275 days of unhealthy air a year, according to monitors. – ‘Premature deaths’ – Piecemeal initiatives by the government — — that critics call half-hearted — have failed to adequately address the problem. Academic research indicates that its detrimental impact on the Indian economy is adding up. A 2023 World Bank paper said that air pollution’s “micro-level” impacts on the economy translate to “macro-level effects that can be observed in year-to-year changes in GDP”. The paper estimates that India’s GDP would have been 4.5 percent higher at the end of 2023, had the country managed to curb pollution by half in the previous 25 years. Another study published in the Lancet health journal on the direct health impacts of air pollution in 2019 estimated an annual GDP deceleration of 1.36 percent due to “lost output from premature deaths and morbidity”. Desperate emergency curbs — such as shuttering schools to reduce traffic emissions as well as banning construction — come with their own economic costs. “Stopping work for weeks on end every winter makes our schedules go awry, and we end up overshooting budgets,” said Sanjeev Bansal, the chairman of the Delhi unit of the Builders Association of India. Pollution’s impact on the Indian economy is likely to get worse if action is not taken. With India’s median age expected to rise to 32 by 2030, the Dalberg study predicts that “susceptibility to air pollution will increase, as will the impact on mortality”.

One by the global consultancy firm Dalberg concluded that in 2019, air pollution cost Indian businesses $95 billion due to ""reduced productivity, work absences and premature death"". The amount is nearly three percent of India's budget, and roughly twice its annual public health expenditure. ""India lost 3.8 billion working days in 2019, costing $44 billion to air pollution caused by deaths,"" according to the study which calculated that toxic air ""contributes to 18 percent of all deaths in India"". Pollution has also had a debilitating impact on the consumer economy because of direct health-related eventualities, the study said, reducing footfall and causing annual losses of $22 billion. The numbers are even more staggering for Delhi, the epicentre of the crisis, with the capital province losing as much as six percent of its GDP annually to air pollution. Restaurateur Sandeep Anand Goyle called the smog a ""health and wealth hazard"". ""People who are health conscious avoid stepping out so we suffer,"" said Goyle, who heads the Delhi chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India. Tourism has also been impacted, as the smog season coincides with the period when foreigners traditionally visit northern India -- too hot for many during the blisteringly hot summers. ""The smog is giving a bad name to India's image,"" said Rajiv Mehra of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. Delhi faces an average 275 days of unhealthy air a year, according to monitors. Premature deaths Piecemeal initiatives by the government -- -- that critics call half-hearted -- have failed to adequately address the problem. Academic research indicates that its detrimental impact on the Indian economy is adding up. A 2023 World Bank paper said that air pollution's ""micro-level"" impacts on the economy translate to ""macro-level effects that can be observed in year-to-year changes in GDP"". The paper estimates that India's GDP would have been 4.5 percent higher at the end of 2023, had the country managed to curb pollution by half in the previous 25 years. Another study published in the Lancet health journal on the direct health impacts of air pollution in 2019 estimated an annual GDP deceleration of 1.36 percent due to ""lost output from premature deaths and morbidity"". Desperate emergency curbs -- such as shuttering schools to reduce traffic emissions as well as banning construction -- come with their own economic costs. ""Stopping work for weeks on end every winter makes our schedules go awry, and we end up overshooting budgets,"" said Sanjeev Bansal, the chairman of the Delhi unit of the Builders Association of India. Pollution's impact on the Indian economy is likely to get worse if action is not taken. With India's median age expected to rise to 32 by 2030, the Dalberg study predicts that ""susceptibility to air pollution will increase, as will the impact on mortality"".

That's largely due to the region's economic uncertainties. Despite the small market gains on average across the continent, the situation in individual markets varies. For instance, Egypt showed an impressive 34% growth for a third consecutive quarter due to strong local production capacity throughout 2024. Nigeria, on the other hand, is the biggest market in Africa but grew merely 1%, mainly due to the depreciating Naira. The currency's value dropped almost 70% from January to September. Following South Africa's strong growth for the last six quarters, the smartphone market in the region saw a sharp 10% decline. Again, economic uncertainties are the main reason for the low consumer spending. Climbing food prices and raging inflation are the main culprits. Kenya also saw a 10% decline as fuel costs and production challenges dampened consumer spending, while Morocco took a massive hit with a 24% decline in smartphone sales. Transsion continues to lead the market in Africa, taking a 50% market share and recording steady 8% growth despite the market conditions. Samsung's shipments fell 30% due to low demand in South Africa, which is typically one of the company's biggest markets in Africa. Xiaomi also managed to grow by 13% and despite Realme's impressive 101% growth, Honor's 287% gain remains unmatched. Meanwhile, Oppo achieved 22% more sales year-on-year.

With strong core economic fundamentals, Vietnam is attracting significant foreign direct investment and a growing expat community, fueling the rise of a burgeoning middle class with increasing purchasing power. This favorable economic climate has created ample opportunities for shopping mall operators like Vincom Retail that can cater to the middle class's growing demand for high-quality retail experiences. Advertisement Leveraging expertise and resources cultivated over the years, Vincom Retail has been rapidly expanding its operations, pioneering retail real estate formats and redefining customer experiences. With the company's unwavering commitment to meeting the diverse needs of consumers across all segments, Vincom Retail is positioned for continued growth and resilience in an ever-evolving market. Vincom Retail: Rapid Expansion Marked Significant Milestones Advertisement Over the past two decades, Vincom Retail has emerged as a dominant force in Vietnam's retail landscape, reshaping how the country's households, youth, and middle class spend their leisure time and money. Back in 2004, at the heart of Vietnam's capital Hanoi, a groundbreaking project was taking shape on Ba Trieu street, a central business district in Hanoi. The 21-story mixed-use twin towers was a testament to Vietnam's burgeoning ambition and a bold vision for the future. Designed and constructed entirely by Vietnamese engineers and workers, the project was completed in a record-breaking 18 months, showcasing the nation's growing technical prowess. Advertisement The opening of Vincom Center Ba Trieu marked a pivotal moment in Hanoi's transformation. More than just a retail center, it symbolized Hanoi's modernization and catalyzed urban renewal, paving the way for rapid development. This pioneering spirit, exemplified by Vincom, set the stage for the retail revolution that would reshape the Vietnamese landscape. Since the groundbreaking success of Vincom Center Ba Trieu, Vincom Retail has substantially expanded its footprint with 88 shopping malls across 48 provinces and cities nationwide, cumulatively reaching approximately 1.84 million square meters of retail GFA, solidifying the company's position as the premier mall owner and operator in Vietnam. Coupled with an annual footfall of nearly 200 million, Vincom Retail demonstrates its ability to capitalize on the nation's burgeoning market of nearly 100 million people. Advertisement Vincom Retail : A Multi-Tiered Approach to Retail Dominance Vincom Retail's two-decade journey has been marked not just by rapid expansion, but also by multi-tiered mall format strategy. To cater to a broader spectrum of consumers, from budget-minded shoppers to high-end clientele, the company has adopted a multi-tiered approach to its shopping mall formats. This strategy has enabled Vincom Retail to withstand economic downturns, solidify its market position, and seize emerging opportunities. Advertisement Vincom Retail's portfolio encompasses a range of formats, including flagship Vincom Centers, large-scale Vincom Mega Malls, community-oriented Vincom Plazas, and commercial streets. In Vietnam's major urban centers like Hanoi and HCMC, Vincom Retail's iconic shopping mall development, such as Vincom Center Ba Trieu and Vincom Center Dong Khoi, have emerged as cultural landmarks and tourist attractions. These retail destinations set trends, from the latest fashion to cutting-edge entertainment, shaping consumer behavior and preferences. Advertisement For major metropolitan areas, Vincom Retail has implemented a strategy of developing large-scale Vincom Mega Malls. These sprawling complexes, situated in rapidly growing urban centers, provide a comprehensive mix of residential, commercial, and retail offerings. By strategically locating these mega malls in key economic hubs, Vincom has created vibrant destinations that attract both local residents and tourists. In addition, Vincom Retail has capitalized on the rapid growth of Vietnam's middle-income population and urbanization rate by developing high-quality Vincom Plaza shopping malls across the major provinces of the country. Beyond traditional mall format, Vincom Retail pioneers new retail real estate concept with the commercial streets like Venice, K-Town, and Little Hong Kong. These developments, inspired by international models like Clarke Quay and Taikoo Li Chengdu, serve as vibrant community hubs, connecting local residents and tourists to a diverse range of retail, dining, and entertainment offerings. Vincom Retail : The Trusted Platform and Partner for International and Local Brands Vincom Retail's pioneering spirit is also reflected in its role as a gateway for major foreign brands to access the Vietnamese market. The company has emerged as a strategic partner for both international and domestic brands seeking to expand their footprint in this dynamic market. Vincom Retail's unique value proposition, which includes prime locations, expansive spaces, and a significant market share, has made it an attractive destination for retailers of all sizes. Renowned international brands such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo have chosen Vincom Center as the location for their first stores in Vietnam, recognizing its potential to reach a discerning consumer base. Beyond international brands, Vincom Retail has also played a pivotal role in the expansion of domestic brands. By offering a nationwide network of shopping malls, the company has provided a platform for local businesses to scale their reach and operations. Poseidon, Tân Việt, Pantio, Highlands and many other popular domestic brands, have successfully leveraged Vincom Retail's presence to develop a countrywide store network. Vincom Retail has demonstrated its commitment and support to its tenants, especially during challenging periods. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company provided substantial financial support, totaling VND 3,357 billion, to help tenants weather the storm. This proactive approach has strengthened the strong partnerships between Vincom Retail and its retail partners. To further boost the success of its tenants, Vincom Retail regularly implements marketing and promotional campaigns to attract footfall. These initiatives, which often involve cross-promotions and loyalty programs, help drive tenants' sales and enhance the overall shopping experience of the shoppers. By fostering a vibrant retail atmosphere, Vincom continues to attract new brands and customers alike.

These next-generation mall will redefine the traditional shopping mall experience, offering a diverse range of retail, dining, entertainment, and lifestyle options. Vincom Retail has recently annouced plans to launch two new Life-Design Mega Malls in 2025, with more unique and ambitious Mega Mall projects on the horizon.

Through creating unique and immersive shopping experiences, Vincom aims to further elevate the retail landscape and attract a wider customer base.

The firm has revised its GDP growth estimates downward, citing factors like a cooling labor market, tighter immigration policies, and rising tariffs as major contributors to the slowdown. The report forecasts GDP growth of 2.4 per cent in 2024 (4Q/4Q), which is expected to drop to 1.9 per cent in 2025 and further decline to 1.3 per cent by 2026. The report attributed this deceleration to weakening consumer spending and reduced business investment. ""Tighter immigration policy and tariffs weigh heavily on the economy , slowing GDP growth in 2025 and more sharply in 2026,"" the report stated. The report highlighted that the consumer spending, a key driver of the US economy , is anticipated to slow significantly over the next few years. Growth in consumer spending is expected to decline from 2.6 per cent in 2024 to 2.0 per cent in 2025, and further to just 1.3 per cent in 2026. It said, ""As labor income growth cools, consumption decelerates. Goods consumption declines less than services as lower interest rates support durables consumption. In 2026, we expect sharper deceleration as tariffs dampen both economic activity and labor markets."" Higher tariffs are predicted to not only slow economic activity but also contribute to inflationary pressures by driving up prices. This, combined with reduced labor income, is expected to weigh heavily on consumption. The labor market outlook also presents challenges. Payroll growth is projected to average just over 100,000 jobs per month in 2025, while unemployment is forecast to end 2024 at 4.3 per cent, drop slightly to 4.1 per cent in 2025, and rise again to 4.5 per cent in 2026. The report highlights that tighter immigration policies will constrain labor supply, affecting both income and employment levels. ""Lower immigration means significantly lower payroll prints in 2025 and 2026,"" it stated. Additionally, fiscal policy is expected to provide minimal relief in the near term, with most provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set to expire by the end of 2025. While the reinstatement of SALT deductions and other minor provisions for tariff-affected firms are anticipated in 2026, their impact is expected to be limited. ""The assumed reinstatement of SALT deductions and some deductions for tariff-affected firms will be new, but none of the changes come before 2026,"" the report added. The report outlined a challenging economic environment for the US, marked by slower growth, sticky inflation, and a cooling labor market. (ANI)"

Culture, he argues persuasively, is not an industry. “Cool Britannia” has encouraged a world view, internationally promoted by Unesco, that, for the arts, and culture generally, the bottom line is the only line to take. But it has not worked for the arts, or the people who work in them, while real power lies with international corporations. Since the 1980s the arts have become a private commodity, not a public good. O’Connor shows how this has happened and argues that culture—for the arts shape that broader idea—should be returned to the public sphere, and take its place alongside health, education and welfare. Long period of decay The invention of the creative industries, which attached the arts to a bigger phenomenon made possible by digitisation, appeared to give them a larger role in the national economy. But since 2010 the arts have experienced a long period of decay, while even the creative industries have recently ceased to grow. The present Labour government must find a solution to what O’Connor describes as an “interregnum”, as neoliberalism decays. Culture has become part of the consumer economy while the public sphere, to which the arts supply the means of thinking about society, has been shattered. Postmodernism has dissolved any idea of cultural authority. Value is only expressed through the cash nexus. Art has no critical edge. New Labour’s utopian invention of the creative industries, O’Connor argues, transformed our language, but “creativity” has no clear meaning. It is there in science as much as the arts. The cultural economy has been taken over by corporations and “platform capitalists”, and the arts are as badly off as they were in the 1980s. The claim that culture was an industry was unsupported by a corresponding industrial strategy, while the “New Public Management” (a term describing a process developed during the 1980s of making culture more “businesslike”) privatised the public service the arts supplied. The new definition of the arts appeared more democratic—but it was the pseudo-democracy of the market. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, O’Connor continues, the claims that the arts would benefit if seen as a creative industry have proved false. We have a new precariat of middle-class start-ups; individual artists are worse off. Creative autonomy has declined, and the sense of a common public culture has disappeared. That needs to be rediscovered as a social necessity and the site of freedom, giving real control over our lives. Culture must be promoted not as a personal gratification for those in the know, but as a fundamental part of citizenship and a human right. But how to achieve this? O’Connor draws on the ideas of the Foundational Economy Collective, a loose group of international researchers, who argue that as much as 70% of a national economy is local, as opposed to the international economy that obsesses capitalism and national governments. Culture must reassert its role alongside health and education as a means to liveability, not GDP. This is a radical transition, but once culture is seen as essential to life, not just as a pleasurable personal compensation for its pains, it is possible. O’Connor outlines how this can be delivered, beginning with the household and leading to a reconstruction of the public sphere and recognition of the public value of culture. But that value must be re-formed as a democratisation and localisation that rediscovers its social, not its economic, roots. Market failure will no longer be the only justification for subsidy. This does not mean a greater economic role for government—where in any case UK cultural spend is 0.5% of its total—but a rethink that builds from the local, and includes the commercial. We have a new Labour government, but the signs are not good. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, may speak of the pleasure of learning the flute, but institutional arrangements militate against change. The secretary of state for culture, Lisa Nandy, has no experience in the field. The arts have been given to Chris Bryant as part of the creative industries. The neoliberal thinking remains. Yet the new government has faltered with its emphasis on the glum times ahead. Surely a rethink of the field of the arts would show the government on the front foot. The arts are struggling, the broader culture, of which they are a part, is in the hands of international corporations. We need a new ode to joy. • Robert Hewison is a cultural historian and commentator • Justin O’Connor, Culture is Not an Industry: Reclaiming Art and Culture for the Common Good , Manchester University Press, 294pp, £14.99 (pb), published 27 February 2024 Books Politics Economics Art market Share"

SUN KAIFANG/FOR CHINA DAILY China will ramp up efforts to drive large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in deals for consumer goods, with plans for strengthened supervision of the funds and measures to stimulate consumer spending, China's top economic regulator said on Tuesday. Li Chao, a spokeswoman for the National Development and Reform Commission, said the next phase will see strengthened full-chain supervision of funding, ensuring that projects swiftly deliver tangible outcomes. Authorities will also crack down on market malpractices, such as deceptive pricing tactics like ""raising prices before applying discounts"" and false promotions. ""We will conduct evaluations to strengthen support for policies aimed at driving equipment upgrades and trade-in deals for consumer goods, summarizing and extending successful experiences and practices,"" Li said at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. ""Meanwhile, we will study and propose new policy measures to further increase support and expand the scope of the policies, which will be publicly announced in due course after completing the necessary procedures,"" she added. ""The goal is to continue using the policies to benefit the public, enhance corporate profits and drive economic improvement."" China's accelerated push for driving large-scale equipment upgrades and promoting trade-in deals for consumer goods is paying off, with significant growth in consumer spending on key goods like home appliances and accelerated development in industrial upgrading, providing a solid base for the country's continued economic recovery, said officials and experts. In October, sales of home appliances — also known as white goods — and audiovisual equipment jumped nearly 40 percent year-on-year, the NDRC said. Li said the policies are designed to stimulate economic recovery from both the supply and demand sides, as businesses are encouraged to upgrade their products to meet evolving consumer needs, while trade-in incentives boost consumer spending. The approach is yielding results. In the first 10 months, investment in purchases of equipment and tools rose 16.1 percent year-on-year, contributing over 60 percent to overall investment growth. The National Bureau of Statistics said retail sales, a key measure of consumer spending, grew 4.8 percent year-on-year in October, up from 3.2 percent in September. ""Thanks to policymakers' cash-for-clunkers program funded by 150 billion yuan ($21 billion) in ultra-long-term government bonds, retail sales growth jumped in October,"" said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura. As the trade-in program continues to boost sales of cars and white goods, his team expects retail sales growth to remain elevated over the rest of this year, he added. Zhou Maohua, a researcher at China Everbright Bank, said he believes China will likely register around its 5 percent annual economic growth target, buoyed by a suite of countercyclical policies introduced since September. ""The measures have boosted market expectations, with consumption and investment showing signs of strengthening in the year's final stretch,"" Zhou said. ""Robust demand management policies are aligning domestic demand with stable supply, positioning the economy for a balanced recovery."" Looking ahead, Li from the NDRC said China's economy is expected to sustain its recovery momentum during the November-December period, building on the upward trend seen since October, as existing policy measures take effect and new policies are implemented. ""We are working collaboratively with all sectors to ensure the annual growth goal is met,"" she said. Li added that China's economic outlook for 2025 remains optimistic, supported by robust structural factors and favorable market conditions. Key among these are over 300 major reform initiatives set in motion at the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee, which will boost the internal driving forces and invigorate innovation and vitality. Meanwhile, she said China's vast domestic market continues to be a significant asset, with substantial untapped demand. And policymakers still have ample policy space and policy tools to maintain economic stability.

Here’s what rich Indians are spending on Soumya Gupta 2 min read 20 Nov 2024, 05:05 am IST Legacy consumer firms have been losing their premium, urban customer base to a bevy of VC-backed, online-first consumer brands for some years now. (iStock) Summary Indian consumers are cutting back discretionary spending and the slowdown is hurting legacy and new-age consumer companies alike. Nonetheless, rich Indian consumers have continued their spending on various categories. Mint explains the shifts in premium, urban consumer demand. Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now What are large companies saying about a slowdown? Maruti-Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker, told investors last month that demand for cars remained “muted"" and that it was planning higher discounts to push sales. It is also pinning hopes on sales of premium cars in rural areas, as is Hindustan Unilever, the country’s largest mass consumer packaged goods firm. HUL said that growth in big cities was “trending down"", lagging smaller cities and rural India. Biscuits-maker Britannia said the consumer slowdown was highest in Indian metros. Meanwhile, personal care and foods manufacturer Marico told investors it will rely on higher prices, shift to online sales, and a gradual rural recovery for growth. Are rich Indians spending on ‘new-age’ brands instead? Perhaps not. Legacy consumer firms have been losing their premium, urban customer base to a bevy of VC-backed, online-first consumer brands for some years now. But even new age firms are facing the heat from the slowdown. E-commerce software firm Unicommerce told investors earlier this month that festive season demand has been “soft"", especially after sales ended, while logistics firm Delhivery told investors that “consumption slowdown is real"" and so is its impact on e-commerce. Honasa Consumer (Mamaearth), reported a 7% drop in revenue and slipped into losses in the September quarter. Its shares hit lower circuit on Monday. Also read | Will new ad rules kill coaching centres? So, what are rich, urban Indians consuming? Luxury goods, travel, pricey essentials, real estate and goods and services related to weddings. Axis Capital estimates more than a third of new real estate projects launched in the December 2024 quarter are priced above ₹ 2 crore, up from a fifth a year ago. The Confederation of All India Traders estimate 48 lakh weddings will generate business worth ₹ 6 trillion this wedding season, largely for wedding apparel, jewellery and event planning. Where else are the rich spending? Quality health and education, even when they are getting more expensive. High-end schools, with tuition fees upwards of ₹ 7 lakh a year, are growing rapidly in tier-2 and 3 cities in India. Many of these are affiliated with international education systems such as the International Baccalaureate and the UK’s IGCSE board. Meanwhile, private healthcare is also getting more expensive. Insurance firm ACKO estimated India’s medical inflation stood at 14% (as of 2021) while major health insurers have hiked premiums by 10-15% this year. Health insurance penetration in India remains largely restricted to urban Indian consumers. Also read | What makes Indian roads the deadliest? Where does this leave India’s consumer economy? Private consumption traditionally drives India’s economic growth, accounting for more than half of our gross domestic product (GDP). But, with rising income disparity, rich urban consumers have disproportionately contributed to the consumer economy. Dramatic shifts in their spending patterns can hurt large consumer companies and sections of the industry. However, if rural demand continues to recover, the return of low-priced mass consumption can help make up the shortfall. Companies will have to tweak their product and pricing strategy accordingly, say experts. They may double-down on small packs (such as shampoo sachets) at low prices for rural consumers and further expand their premium offerings to smaller towns.

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported on November 15 that retail sales for October reached $718.9 billion, reflecting a 0.4% increase from the previous month. This exceeded analysts’ expectations of a 0.3% rise. Year-over-year, retail sales grew by 2.8%. Analysts interpret the stronger-than-expected retail sales figures as an indication that consumer spending remains resilient despite concerns about economic slowdown, according to Reuters. close close 건전한 댓글 문화 운영 원칙 댓글 안에 당신의 성숙함도 담아 주세요.

FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account U.S. retail sales increased slightly more than expected in October as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and electronic goods, suggesting the economy kicked off the fourth quarter on a strong note. The fairly upbeat sales report on Friday, which was accompanied by sharp upward revisions to September’s data, together with news of a rebound in import prices last month, prompted traders to pare back expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in December. Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday “the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates.” “Retail sales data today make many in the markets wonder if another rate cut at the December meeting is warranted at all,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “With fiscal policy expected to shift into high gear on the pro-growth stimulus side, perhaps the Fed’s monetary policy should not be putting another log on the fire to fuel growth by lowering rates, as it could lead to a return of inflation.” Retail sales rose 0.4 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 0.8 per cent advance in September, the Commerce Department’s Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, would climb 0.3 per cent after a previously reported 0.4-per-cent gain in September. Sales at auto dealerships accelerated by 1.6 per cent, while receipts at service stations gained 0.1 per cent. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 2.3 per cent. Receipts at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 0.7 per cent after rising 1.2 per cent in September. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances. Building material and garden equipment store sales rose 0.5 per cent, likely boosted by rebuilding efforts in areas devastated by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Online retail sales edged up 0.3 per cent, despite Amazon’s Prime Day promotion. But sales at clothing stores fell 0.2 per cent while those at furniture outlets declined 1.3 per cent. There were also decreases in sales at miscellaneous retailers, health and personal care as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Robust consumer spending helped the economy maintain its strong pace of growth last quarter. Consumption is being largely underpinned by low layoffs, with additional help from strong household balance sheets thanks to a stock-market rally and high home prices. Though inflation has not made much headway in recent months, it is on a downward trend, raising households’ purchasing power. Household savings also remain lofty. Concerns have been raised that growth is mostly being driven by middle- and upper-income households, which have more flexibility and substitutability of consumption. But Bank of America card data show spending resilient across income groups. “We do not see signs of increased reliance on credit cards in any income cohort,” said Aditya Bhave, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities. “However, we note that higher-income households appear to be outperforming in certain service sectors such as airlines, lodging, entertainment and cruises.” Economists expect retailers will enjoy a fairly decent holiday shopping season, which starts later this month. Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services dipped 0.1 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 1.2-per-cent gain in September. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have jumped 0.7 per cent in September. But data for August was revised lower, suggesting that third-quarter consumer spending growth pace could be trimmed down to a 3.5-per-cent annualized rate from the 3.7-per-cent pace estimated last month. Nonetheless, the sharp upward revision to September’s core retail sales put consumer spending and the overall economy on a higher growth trajectory. Economists estimated that consumer spending was growing at a 3-per-cent rate early in the October-December quarter. Hurricanes and a strike by factory workers at Boeing, which depressed industrial production in September and October, were expected to temporarily slow economic growth to around a 2.5-per-cent pace in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.8-per-cent rate in the third quarter. Shortly after the data, financial markets lowered the odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s Dec. 17-18 meeting to 58.4 per cent from 61.6 per cent earlier, CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed. The odds of rates being unchanged increased to 41.6 per cent from 38.4. Some economists see a rate cut next month as a very close call, citing the lack of progress in lowering inflation back to the U.S. central bank’s 2-per-cent target. Stocks on Wall Street traded lower. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note briefly hitting a 5-½-month high. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. The Fed last week cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.5-per-cent to 4.75-per-cent range. The central bank embarked on its policy-easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point rate cut in September, its first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. It hiked rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation. A separate report from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics showed import prices rebounded 0.3 per cent in October after an unrevised 0.4-per-cent decline in September. Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, would slip 0.1 per cent. In the 12 months through October, import prices increased 0.8 per cent after dipping 0.1 per cent in the 12 months through September. Imported fuel prices rose 1.5 per cent after two straight monthly declines. Food prices fell 1.6 per cent, declining for the third consecutive month. Excluding fuels and food, import prices gained 0.4 per cent after rising 0.3 per cent in September. The so-called core import prices increased 2.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis in October despite the dollar’s appreciation against the currencies of the main U.S. trade partners. A rising dollar normally dampens import price pressures. Government data this week showed consumer prices increased 0.2 per cent for a fourth straight month in October while producer prices picked up 0.2 per cent. The import price data cemented economists’ estimates of a 0.3-per-cent increase in October in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. That would match September’s gain and lift the annual increase in core inflation to 2.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent in September. The core PCE Price Index is one of the measures tracked by the Fed for monetary policy. “While we expect a continued broad-based cooling in consumer price inflation overall next year, the outlook for goods prices in particular may be clouded by potentially offsetting effects from the incoming administration’s trade policies and further dollar appreciation,” said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan."

Headline retail sales are forecasted to increase by 0.4%, with lower gasoline prices partially offset by higher auto sales. Key Points: Core Retail Sales Forecast: Core retail sales are expected to increase by 0.3%, reflecting stable consumer spending patterns, especially in card-based transactions. Headline Sales Boost from Autos: Headline retail sales are projected to rise 0.4%, bolstered by auto sales growth, though partially countered by lower gasoline prices. Conclusion: Goldman Sachs expects October’s retail sales data to show steady growth, with solid core sales and a slight headline boost from auto sales. This aligns with a generally resilient consumer spending environment despite variable fuel prices. For bank trade ideas, check out eFX Plus .

Log in Subscribe Stock illustration of a traditional cracker vendor (Freepik) S mall businesses have seen a steep decline in sales amid weakening consumer spending, according to an executive at state-owned lender BRI, which has translated into worsening loan quality in the sector. Supari, director of micro business at the country’s largest lender for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), said on Wednesday that sales of small businesses nationwide had plummeted between 40 and 60 percent as households curbed spending, partly due to the rollback of pandemic-era social assistance programs. “Everywhere the story is the same, business owners are seeing their sales drop drastically. Like it or not, this is the reality for these small businesses now,” Supari said, as quoted by Bisnis.com . Indonesia’s third-quarter GDP report, released on Nov. 5 by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), shows a 4.91 percent year-or-year (yoy) slowdown in the contribution of consumer spending to GDP growth, from 4.93 percent in the second quarter and 5.06 percent in the third quarter of 2023. This translates into overall economic growth of 4.95 percent in the third quarter this year, dipping below the usual 5 percent average. BRI's internal surveys indicated that the cessation of some government assistance had led to weakened consumer spending since last year, after spending bolstered steadily from 2020 to 2022, said Supari.

The results highlight the challenges facing the UK fast fashion sector, with both Boohoo and UK peer ASOS operating in a volatile market and struggling against competition from lower cost Chinese-founded fast fashion Shein and Chinese online retailer Temu. Boohoo also said that it plans to raise up to 39.3 million pounds through a placing, subscription, and retail offer, with new shares to be issued at 31 pence each. It posted an adjusted EBITDA of 20.8 million pounds ($26.4 million) in the six months ended Aug. 31, compared with 31.3 million pounds made in H1 FY24. The company has also been grappling with tensions over its strategic review, leadership changes, and disputes with its largest shareholder, Mike Ashley-owned Frasers Group, which holds a 27% stake and is seeking greater influence despite Boohoo's concerns over potential conflicts of interest with rival businesses. Boohoo expects a higher gross merchandise value and a stronger adjusted EBITDA performance in the second half of the year versus the first half. Its first-half revenue dropped 15% to 619.8 million pounds from 729.1 million pounds in the same period last year.

Published Nov. 11, 2024 Nate Delesline III Reporter post share post print email license A holiday shopping street scene. Over 50% of people in a recent NRF survey said they plan to do their holiday shopping online this year. "" Holiday Shopping - Downtown Crossing "" by Massachusetts Office Of Travel & Tourism is licensed under CC BY-ND 2.0 Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . Dive Brief: Holiday season sales growth will remain steady despite some contradictions in the latest federal economic and jobs data, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. The NRF is maintaining its retail sales projections of a 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year increase, according to Jack Kleinhenz, the organization’s chief economist. A recent dip in jobs numbers and the slowed growth of the gross domestic product in the third quarter are likely due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and labor union strikes. Overall, the NRF said, employment gained 104,000 jobs on a three month average and GDP growth was strong, continuing 10 consecutive quarters of increases. Salaries and wages were up 3.9% from a year ago as of September, as measured by the federal Employment Cost Index. While that’s the slowest growth since late 2021, Kleinhenz said it’s above inflation. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, fell to a year-over-year increase of 2.1% in September, just above the federal government’s 2% target and the lowest it's been since 2021, the NRF said. Dive Insight: While it’s too soon to say how last week’s election results might affect the economy for the rest of the year and beyond, the overall holiday season economic outlook still looks positive based on the latest economic indicators, Kleinhenz said. “ Putting all these considerations together, this holiday season looks very good,” Kleinhenz said . “ Households are starting the season in decent financial shape and are managing the constraints of their paychecks, with growth in wages and salaries still supportive of a steady pace of spending.” However, possible tariffs, which could be enacted as soon as January, may weaken consumers’ spending power by $78 billion to $80 billion if their full scope takes effect, analysts with Telsey Advisory Group, led by Dana Telsey, said Friday in a note following a conference call with the NRF about its latest sales outlook. These tariffs, based on NRF analysis, are poised to have a negative effect on consumer spending, especially on toys, apparel, furniture, appliances and footwear, and could have an inflationary impact of 0.4%to 0.5%. Still, the NRF said on Oct. 15 that the economy “remains fundamentally healthy and continues to maintain its momentum.” The organization expects this year’s holiday season retail sales will increase , reaching a total ranging from $979.5 billion to $989 billion in November and December. “Given third-quarter spending performance and comprehensive upward revisions in late September for income, spending and the savings rate, I have increased confidence in the economy’s strength and the near-term outlook,” Kleinhenz said. The NRF also said in October that consumer spending for the season is expected to reach a record high of $902 per person across gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Consumer Trends, Holidays"

Economists estimate that the contribution of care ranges from 15 per cent to 17 per cent of the Indian GDP. Shrayana Bhattacharya November 11, 2024 11:21 AM IST First published on: Nov 11, 2024 at 04:10 AM IST Share Comments Print In my small circle of friends and family in Delhi, where Diwali has increasingly become a festival of planning “pollution holidays”, those of us who can’t afford to run away, end up finding or faking good cheer. The past few weeks have been punctuated by hospital visits, with many of us suddenly called on to care for ailing parents. Through all the triumphs and tragedies of hospital corridors, we experienced everyday forms of care and concern — health professionals trying their very best, unexpected phone calls of encouragement, strangers offering blood and platelets in response to open calls for help. Beyond merriment and markets, the air around Diwali has rearranged itself to ask us tough questions about the state of care and civic connection. Last fortnight, while there was much reportage on what Diwali and Dhanteras signaled about the health of consumer spending, the world also marked the second UN International Day of Care and Support on October 29. “Care” and “support” encompass all direct and indirect ways we nurture each other and respond to our needs for emotional, physical and psychological nutrition. Of course, every day is a day of care and support. But celebrating the quiet work of care in India is hardly as eye-catching as celebrating boisterous consumption growth. Advertisement If we recognise that economic behaviour — spending, saving, investing, working — is underpinned by our social nature, our vital human desire to enjoy love and connection, the care economy and the consumer economy should hardly be disconnected islands. Yet, many of us worry about the exaggerated emphasis on one domain over the other in how modern Indians derive their sense of self and meaning. At a time when our culture instructs us to be “too cool to care”, to compete and self-maximise incessantly, can policy and institutions help dignify the labour of caring for others? What would an economy that centred care look like? First, it would credibly reward those engaged in care work. UNFPA estimates suggest the demand for care is daunting — nearly 360 million children and 147 million elderly people require care in India. Overwhelmingly, it is women who respond to this demand, supplying 5.6 hours of unpaid work daily. Men supply 30 minutes. Women with paid jobs face the most acute time-poverty, performing six times more unpaid care labour than employed men. It is high time the tax brackets, wage rates and retirement ages of women were adequately reformed to compensate for this trade-off between care and career. Advertisement Government care workers on the frontlines (ASHAs, Anganwadi workers), home-based carers and domestic workers will always bear the burden of the health fallout of pollution or pandemics. Surely, they deserve victory in their continuing fight for social security packages and fair wages. Second, an economy centred on fostering caring relations and capacities between people would be more creative in how individuals are cared for by public and private institutions. For most people, coupledom and traditional family structures are the path to secure caregiving. However, as many elder persons’ groups and activists highlight, the romanticised Indian family is hardly a sure-shot provider of emotional or economic support for an ageing society. Adequate social pensions for the elderly, stronger public infrastructure for childcare, subsidies and incentives for business or cooperatives providing care can go a long way. Finally, no policy fix can truly help without a radical revolution in how we value the work of care as a society. This revolution is not about hollow sloganeering or tweets of appreciation. The great scholar of care, Nel Noddings, saw practical education and experience of caregiving as being central to the cultivation of caring in society. People who cared for another person through a specific series of routinised one-on-one encounters could also be persuaded to care about wider injustices and inequality in public life. She defined this “education” as “a constellation of encounters, both planned and unplanned, that promote growth through the acquisition of knowledge, skills, understanding and appreciation”. most read 1 Red Fort blast: After 14 years of calm in Delhi, one night of fear rekindles security concerns 2 C Raja Mohan writes: India-Bhutan ties show how to get it right in a challenging neighbourhood 3 For a country that believes in non-violence, SC order on stray dogs should be unacceptable 4 Yogendra Yadav writes: We need to move from a caste census with a capital C to one with a small c 5 On stray dogs issue, SC undermines its own balanced approach Care is not a commodity; it is an interpersonal relationship that defies standard transactional economic frameworks of buying and selling. And as Diwali firecracker bans remind us each year, carrot-and-stick approaches are hardly sustainable or easy to implement at scale. Moreover, I don’t buy a worldview that thinks we are all small-spirited, where the threat of punishment is the dominant pathway to make us care about the public good. Each of us has the urge to care about and care for someone or something. Some of us, often women, are encouraged to nurture the caring instinct, while others, largely men, are not given the skills or social sanction to comfortably inhabit these roles. In my interviews with elite middle-aged men from all-boys boarding schools, their capabilities at fatherhood remained a chief lament. Most gained strong skills for being economic providers, but this was often coupled with a belief that boys derived self-worth, love and meaning largely from their ability to signal their place in the market of real estate, status or wealth. All their lives, they had been taught to care about competing. We need a different curriculum, especially for men — both at home and in educational institutions. The famous last paragraph of the novel Middlemarch offers a tip for care-centred policies: “For the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life…” If politicians and policy makers wish to incentivise more child births, if they want a productive and healthy workforce, if they want cleaner air, they will need to care about encouraging and rewarding our intrinsic instincts to perform such unhistoric, hidden acts of care. Beyond the economy propelled by consumption and costly penalties, there is one propelled by love, desire, care, concern and connection. Take the latter more seriously. Bhattacharya is an economist and author.

Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now MUMBAI : The godfather of Indian advertising and the patriarch of English theatre in India are two terms often used to describe Alyque Padamsee. That might be too limiting. For Padamsee had the spirit of an iconoclast, which led him to push the boundaries of whatever it was that he set his sights on. In the foreword to his autobiography tantalisingly titled Double Life , Dushyant Mehta, then director, Repro India Ltd, narrates a joke about the man popular in advertising circles: “Alyque Padamsee, chief executive of Lintas, also known as ‘God’, had a secretary called Jenny Pope. To meet God, you first had to meet the Pope."" Also Read: ‘Ratan Tata: A Life’ review: A wasted chance to tell a business story That sums up his impact on generations of Indian advertising professionals who either worked with him over the 14 years from 1979 to 1993 when he ran Lintas or merely glanced through his creative oeuvre. That last is the stuff of legend and why he’s universally rated as an advertising genius who created some of the most memorable campaigns seen in India in the 1970s through 1990s. This was pre-liberalization India, where a combination of rapidly failing socialism and stifling social mores kept a tight lid on natural aspirations and dreams. An advertising legend Yet, where others saw an old India of restrictions and limitations, Padamsee viewed the country from the lens of an emerging generation that was looking to express itself. Thus emerged the Liril girl in 1975, a symbol of this new India that was shedding some of the inhibitions of the past and giving herself permission to dream and even fantasize. Model Karen Lunel, cavorting in a bikini under a waterfall, was a thousand Indian housewives enjoying themselves in the privacy of a bath. Following Liril came ads for Cherry Blossom, Surf, and Bajaj Auto, with characters like Cherry Charlie and Lalitaji, a tribute to Padamsee’s ability to strike a chord with everyday Indians. He was equally at ease using advertising cleverly (some said scandalously) to sell a product like condoms, as he did with the notorious Kamasutra ad featuring Marc Robinson and Pooja Bedi. Also Read: Rakesh Gangwal: the airline industry disciplinarian behind IndiGo’s success For sure, it wasn’t always him but the bunch of brilliant professionals he assembled, including Kiran Khalap, K.V. Sridhar, and Neville D’Souza. Many of them learnt from Padamsee and then went on to set up their own agencies. Khalap, for instance, co-founded Chlorophyll Brand & Communications Consultancy. Under Padamsee, Lintas (an acronym for Lever International Advertising Services), which had begun operations in India as a division of Lever Brothers' advertising wing, prospered and was rated the country’s most creative agency. Advertising, though, was too narrow a sphere to consume him entirely. Though he was born into a traditional Ismaili Khoja Muslim family, a performative streak ran through the Padamsees. While his father, Jafferseth Padamsee, was an affluent businessman, his brother, Sultan Padamsee, was into theatre. He passed away tragically by suicide at the age of 23. Also Read: Banking’s Mir Jafars who sold out India to the colonizers One of Alyque’s sisters, Roshan Alkazi, was married to Ebrahim Alkazi, the legendary director of the National School of Drama in New Delhi between 1962 and 1977. Another cousin was the famous painter Akbar Padamsee, who is considered one of the pioneers of modern Indian painting. A legendary performer Young Alyque, therefore, was brimming with creative ideas by the time he went to St. Xavier's College in Mumbai, where cricket competed with theatre for his attention. Tall and wiry, fast bowling suited both his physique and his personality. By then, he had already raised the banner of revolt, declaring himself to be an agnostic despite being raised in a devout Muslim family. His three marriages, to Pearl Padamsee, Dolly Thakore, and Sharon Prabhakar, all Christians, came as little surprise, the common factor being that each of them was involved with theatre. A night job as a performer on stage and on celluloid was a logical next step for the ad man. Movies weren’t really his thing, though he earned some fame for playing Jinnah in Richard Attenborough’s film Gandhi . But those who have been privileged to watch him in his stage production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman will forever remember him as Willy Loman, the ageing travelling salesman whose line “the only thing you got in this world is what you can sell"", was a nice little epitaph for Padamsee himself. Also Read: From Geneva to India: Simone Tata's entrepreneurial odyssey Famous actors like Dustin Hoffman and Philip Seymour Hoffman have essayed the role on Broadway and Hollywood, but Padamsee brought the tragic story of a mediocre man aching for the love of his children even as he crushed their own dreams, to life. Subsequently, productions like Jesus Christ Superstar , Tuglaq, and Evita , kept his love for theatre pulsating. In all, he produced over fifty full-length plays. Padamsee passed away in 2018 at the age of 90. In her tribute, Rama Bijpurkar, who started her career with Lintas under him before becoming one of the country’s foremost thought leaders on India’s consumer economy, invoked his one-line ad brief for Surf, “Always the champion, never the challenger,"" to sum up the man. It was a perfect epitaph for the colossus of Indian advertising. Gift this article Catch all the Industry News , Banking News and Updates on Live Mint.

Photo: Cindy Ord / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/Getty Images via AFP/File Source: AFP Don't miss out! Join Tuko.co.ke Sports News channel on WhatsApp now! Cartier owner Richemont posted Friday a hefty drop in net profit for the first half of the year as watch sales sank in China, where weak consumer spending has hit the luxury sector. Richemont said its profit after tax reached 457 million euros ($492 million), down from 1.5 billion euros in the same six-month period last year as it booked a 1.2-billion-euro write-down from the sale of its Yoox-Net-A-Porter online fashion business . Its net profit for continuing operations was 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the six-month period ending in September, 20 percent lower than in 2023 and less than expected by analysts polled by Swiss news agency AWP. Global sales fell one percent to 10.1 billion euros. Sales from the Asia-Pacific region were down by almost a fifth while all other regions in the world posted ""solid growth"", Richemont said in a results statement. Citing ""reduced consumer spending"" in China, Richemont said growth in other Asian countries was ""more than offset"" by a double-digit drop in sales in the world's second biggest economy. PAY ATTENTION : TUKO Needs Your Help! Take our Survey Now and See Improvements at TUKO.co.ke Tomorrow ""The global watch market is experiencing a slowdown, particularly in China, which is affecting all watchmaking brands globally, with the high-end segments showing greater resilience,"" Richemont chairman Johann Rupert said in the statement. He said Chinese demand ""will take longer to recover"". Last month, French group LVMH, the world's biggest luxury company whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior and Bulgari, reported a 4.4 percent drop in third-quarter sales. Gucci owner Kering said its sales sank 15 percent in the same quarter due to slowing consumer spending in China. Richemont's stock price fell more than four percent in the Swiss stock exchange. ""There is a slowdown in China that we are experiencing like our competitors,"" Richemont chief executive Nicolas Bos said in a conference call. ""We have no clue on how long it will last and whether we've reached the bottom or not,"" he said.

PHOTO: EPA-EFE Rob Curran Published Fri, Nov 8, 2024 · 01:27 PM — Updated Sat, Nov 9, 2024 · 09:24 PM THE US Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected on Thursday (Nov 7), the quarter-percentage-point cut coming as no surprise to anyone. What was more surprising, however, was chairman Jerome Powell’s rosy picture of a Goldilocks-like US economy – one that’s not too hot and not too cold. At his traditional press conference after the Fed’s two-day meeting, he marvelled at the “remarkable” resilience of US labour markets and consumer spending. In his words, economic growth was neither too cold (recessionary) nor too hot (inflationary). While he refused to divulge if the central bank was planning another rate cut in December, he did express confidence that rate policy was still restrictive and slowing economic growth, and that the Fed was looking for a neutral level. He added that data between now and December could reveal an upside or a downside surprise. If the labour market softens further, as Powell seemed to anticipate, a rate cut would be guaranteed. If economic data continues to improve and inflation data heats up, it would give the Fed the option to pause. Recent data has created “a sense of some of the downside risks to economic activity having been diminished”, said Powell. The rate-setting committee is “feeling good” about its full-employment mandate. “We’ve had one inflation report that wasn’t terrible, but it was a little higher than expected,” he said. The September reading of the consumer price index, at 2.4 per cent, was close to the Fed’s comfort zone, but it had moved in the wrong direction, and exceeded economists’ expectations. Since and even before Donald Trump’s remarkable election victory on Wednesday, Treasury yields have risen because of fears that his policies would stoke inflation or cause a deficit crisis, or both. Powell said the Fed was following developments in the Treasury market, but pointed out that yields were still not at their cycle highs. Concerns that yields at current levels could thwart the Fed’s attempts to alleviate economic pressure were premature, he said. SEE ALSO Asia: Markets extend rally after Federal Reserve rate cut The rate cutting cycle: What does it mean for fixed income investors Hong Kong central bank cuts interest rate after Fed move Gold extends gains on Fed rate cut, but heads for weekly fall More As for Trump’s fiscal policy plans, Powell said it was far too early to anticipate any changes in Fed policy in response. The central bank would model the likely economic impact of policy once the legislation is written, he said. Powell refused to be drawn on whether he was concerned about a deficit crisis under Trump’s leadership. As a general matter, the Fed chair said, current levels of US debt are sustainable, but the path of spending more than is taken in as income is unsustainable. One Wall Street strategist said the Fed would likely be interpreting the market response to Trump’s victory as much as he does. The stock market is saying Trump’s tax cutting and deregulation will be good for business, but the bond market is warning that tariffs and tax cuts will also cause inflation, said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at money manager Global X. “While the Fed feels the risks are balanced between stable prices and maximum employment, this could shift quickly, increasing the risk to reaccelerating inflation,” he said. The only imminent risk that Powell fears could spoil the Goldilocks tea party on the US economy is a major geopolitical shock. He echoed warnings from JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon – that conflicts in the Middle East and Russia could be ruinous for global social and economic stability. Oil futures are currently hovering around US$70 a barrel, but any escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran could send them above US$90 a barrel, where they could cause wider inflationary pressures. The stock market was volatile during and after Powell’s press conference on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing more or less flat near its record high of 43,729, after a 1,500-point surge on Wednesday, post-election. The main hope by analysts was that Powell would tacitly promise another rate cut. While the market did not hear that specifically, at least one economist felt otherwise. “Although he stressed data dependence as expected, he gave several indications that a December cut remains his base case,” said Aditya Bhave, US economist at brokerage Bank of America Securities. “He discussed the strength of many economic indicators, including productivity, and described the performance of the US economy as remarkable.” Powell did not say it in such words, but his underlying message seemed to be this: Enjoy the rate cuts, the Goldilocks economy and the stock-market euphoria for the time being. The Fed will worry about tariffs, deficits and everything else later. Decoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order. Sign up here to get Decoding Asia newsletter.

PHOTO: AFP Published Fri, Nov 8, 2024 · 09:49 AM JAPAN’S households cut spending for a second month as inflation continues to deter consumption, backing the case for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to take a cautious approach to rate hikes. Outlays by households dropped 1.1 per cent from a year earlier in September, compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.8 per cent decrease, after sliding 1.9 per cent in the previous month, according to a report by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on Friday (Nov 8). Outlays have now risen only twice in the past 12 months. Consumer spending has consistently failed to show clear signs of strength as households have been forced to cope with prices increasing at or above the BOJ’s inflation target for 30 months. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he will compile an economic package to help those suffering from higher costs of living as policymakers at the central bank bide their time until wage growth is robust enough to lift personal spending. The yen’s weakness is a key factor weighing on the purchasing power of Japanese households. Consumer confidence slid for the first time in five months in October after Japan’s currency fell to the weakest level in almost three months. The currency resumed its slide after Donald Trump prevailed in the US presidential election this week. If the yen extends its downward trajectory it could stoke discontent among consumers by spurring inflation due to higher import costs. That could also help bring the timing for the BOJ’s next rate hike forward to December, according to Kazuo Momma, a former BOJ executive director.

Economists see annualised growth slowing to 0.6 per cent quarter on quarter, according to the latest median estimate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than half the economy, has stayed below pre-pandemic levels. Japan’s authorities are hopeful that a recent acceleration in wage growth will spur personal spending.

Real estate consultant Cushman & Wakefield on Thursday released its Q3-2024 'Retail MarketBeat' report, which highlighted a sustained momentum across India's main streets, leading retail growth across the top 8 cities. ""Main streets dominated the leasing landscape, accounting for a remarkable 68 per cent of the total 1.6 million square feet leased this quarter,"" the consultant said. Advt Strong demand on main streets has pushed rental growth, particularly in Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru , Chennai and Kolkata , where rates surged up to 15 per cent year-on-year. Saurabh Shatdal , Head Retail and Managing Director - Capital Markets at Cushman & Wakefield, said, ""The Indian retail sector is evolving rapidly, and main streets continue to record high leasing due to limited mall supply."" ""The strong demand-supply dynamic has driven rental growth, particularly in Delhi-NCR and Pune. Malls, however, faced a quieter quarter due to a lack of supply - a gap that we expect to be addressed in Q4,"" he added. Retail leasing trends, led by fashion, F&B and accessories, reveal a clear shift toward more discretionary spending, highlighting the evolving lifestyles of Indian consumers, Shatdal said. According to data, retail leasing in Ahmedabad fell 32 per cent to 0.06 million square feet in the July-September period from 0.09 million square feet in the year-ago period. In Bengaluru , leasing of retail space grew 9 per cent to Rs 0.20 million square feet from 0.18 million square feet. Leasing of retail space in Chennai declined 33 per cent to 0.15 million square feet from 0.23 million square feet. Advt Delhi-NCR too saw a fall of 39 per cent to 0.27 million square feet from 0.45 million square feet. Leasing of retail space in Hyderabad rose 22 per cent to 0.49 million square feet from 0.40 million square feet. Demand for retail space in Kolkata remained almost flat at around 0.05 million square feet. In Mumbai, the leasing of retail space rose 74 per cent to 0.22 million square feet from 0.13 million square feet. The leasing of retail space in Pune grew 51 per cent to 0.18 million square feet during July-September from 0.12 million square feet in the year-ago period. Realty firm Paras Buildtech COO Kunal Rishi said, ""India's retail landscape is evolving rapidly. This demand reflects the rising aspirations of consumers, the expansion of organised retail, and the growing need for premium retail destinations across the country."" With urbanisation set to reach nearly 40 per cent by 2030, he said, the demand for modern, strategically located retail spaces is increasing to cater to evolving consumer preferences. ""As consumer habits shift and more brands enter the market, the focus will be on creating environments that offer more than just shopping - integrating lifestyle, entertainment and community engagement,"" Rishi said. While e-commerce continues to grow, he said the leasing activities highlight the enduring importance of physical stores in providing unique, experiential shopping that online platforms cannot replicate. ""The development of high-quality mall spaces will be key to supporting this evolution, offering retailers the infrastructure to meet the needs of a dynamic and rapidly changing market,"" he said.

Obi made the call on his X handle while raising concerns about the ongoing power crisis following another collapse of the national grid. The call came after Nigerians were plunged into a fresh round of darkness following another collapse of the national power grid. Since January 2024 till date, the grid has collapsed 10 times, and three times in October alone. Advertisement Speaking on the issue via a statement on Wednesday via X, Obi contrasted Nigeria’s struggles with power supply to South Africa’s recent success in achieving seven months of uninterrupted electricity. READ ALSO: National Power Grid Suffers Another Collapse Advertisement He said, “Again, yesterday the now regular news came that the National Grid had collapsed once again. Just a few days ago, on the 25th of October, South Africa that was the second-largest economy in Africa behind Nigeria until recently, with a quarter of our population, celebrated seven months of uninterrupted power supply. “South Africa generates and distributes about 40,000 MW of electricity, while Nigeria struggles to generate and distribute just 10% of that.” “Is there any tribe in Nigeria that enjoys uninterrupted power supply like South Africa? I am labelled a tribal bigot. When I ask if any religion enjoys special privileges in this crisis, I am called a religious bigot. But I will continue to speak the truth about our situation today,” he said. “The fact remains that we are all suffering equally from this failure,” he said. Advertisement Obi urged Nigerians to move past “primordial sentiments” and instead focus on electing leaders who can drive the country towards development. He said, “The fact remains that we are all suffering equally from this failure. The solution lies not in tribal or religious affiliations but in visionary leadership and a shared commitment to progress. “We must set aside these primordial sentiments and elect leaders who are competent, capable, and have the vision to transform our nation from a consumer-driven economy to a productive one by investing our meagre resources in critical areas of development like health and education, lifting our people out of poverty, and ensuring increased electricity production and distribution.” Join Our Whatsapp Channel To join: Simply click on the link below & turn on notifications to get the latest updates More Stories Scores Feared Dead As Mining Pit Collapses In Zamfara 16 Killed As Mine Collapses In Militia-Held East DR Congo [UPDATED] Five Rescued As Building Collapses in Lagos Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Tue, Nov 5, 2024 · 12:46 PM BRITISH consumer spending grew only modestly last month as uncertainty in the run-up to finance minister Rachel Reeves’ Oct 30 Budget and rising energy bills deterred shoppers, a survey showed on Tuesday (Nov 5). The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said spending in shops increased by 0.6 per cent in annual terms in October, below September’s 2 per cent growth and the weakest rise since July. Separate data from Barclays also showed softer growth in consumer spending in October. “Speculation about the impact of the Budget, a holding back of demand until Black Friday promotions and a later half-term break all impacted retail sales data,” said Linda Ellett, UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at accounting firm KPMG, which sponsored the BRC’s data. “With clarity now provided by the Budget and many households escaping paying increased tax from their wages, retailers will be hoping for an upturn in consumer confidence and spending.” The brunt of the tax hikes announced last week by Reeves fell mostly on businesses. However, consumers were hit by a 10 per cent increase in a regulated price cap on household energy last month. In its report, Barclays said spending on debit and credit cards rose 0.7 per cent in annual terms in October, also the slowest since July and down from September’s 1.2 per cent increase. Spending on essential items fell 2.2 per cent, the biggest drop since April 2020, led by spending in supermarkets. But spending on non-essential items increased 2.1 per cent, driven mostly by ticket sales for upcoming concerts by performers such as Coldplay.

The Bank of England is widely expected to cut borrowing costs for only the second time since 2020 on Thursday as inflation pressures fall back further.

Foreigners pulled out $10 billion in October, even more than they had during the sudden lockdown of the economy during the March 2020 outbreak of Covid-19. The benchmark index posted its biggest monthly decline in more than four years. Worse, it doesn’t look like the selling pressure has been exhausted. Valuations still appear stretched, even as expectations about corporate earnings start to wane after a string of disappointing results for the September quarter across industries. In a way, this was expected: India’s consumer economy is weak, and interest rates are high. Car dealers are awash with an all-time-high inventory. If festive-season buying doesn’t clear $9 billion of unsold stock, particularly of smaller vehicles priced below 1 million rupees ($12,000), there will be trouble ahead. Shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the country’s largest automaker, have slumped 18% in just over a month. It isn’t just consumer durables that are waiting for buyers to show up. After struggling for years with tepid rural demand for staples, the likes of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. are staring at an urban slowdown. India’s income and wealth inequality, among the worst in the world, is finally coming to bite. “There is a top end, and people with money are spending like that is going out of style,” Suresh Narayanan, the chairman of Nestle India Ltd., said recently. “The middle class… seems to be shrinking.” To see how these concerns are weighing on the market, start with the analysts’ consensus estimate for the year ahead. Stocks in the MSCI India Index are expected to deliver 15% growth in profits in dollar terms, compared with decade’s average of 20%. India is the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with the central bank penciling in 7.2% annual expansion. But as I have written before, large parts of India Inc . haven’t been feeling this growth for some time. Now analysts, too, are turning pessimistic, slashing their forecasts. Live Events Bloomberg Contrast this with China, where the consensus opinion was deeply negative before the recent government stimulus. Now the expectation from MSCI China is that it will deliver profit growth similar to MSCI India in dollar terms. That’s the most optimistic that analysts have been in the past seven years. So where should global investors be heading next, India with its deepening demand funk and rising stress in household balance sheets? Or China, where factory activity is finally showing some proof of life after five months of contraction? Maybe the story is more nuanced than that. A decade-long, $800 billion surge in investment by large Indian conglomerates, led by forays into newer industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, is supposed to trickle down to the rest of the economy, creating new jobs and lifting depressed household incomes. In a sharp contrast with China’s property overhang, India’s inventory of unsold apartments is near a record low in major cities. Rate cuts next year could start a new cycle of homebuying and construction. That would also give lenders an opportunity to shed a dangerous overreliance on unsecured loans. Still, it may be imprudent to expect an immediate unleashing of animal spirits. Political uncertainty is high, both globally and at home. Even once the outcome of the US presidential election is known, future American policies and Beijing’s reaction to them will unfold slowly. Any Chinese response that includes a beggar-thy-neighbor depreciation of the yuan will make it harder for Indian exporters to plan new capacities. Meanwhile, polls this month in the western state of Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, will test Narendra Modi’s hold on power in his third term as prime minister. Bloomberg As the opposition alliance mounts pressure on Modi’s coalition government, the contest to succeed the 74-year-old leader will heat up within his Hindu right-wing party. Markets can’t expect any consequential economic reforms until the next national election in 2029. The central bank will probably place a strong emphasis on maintaining financial and price stability. And while the federal government seems intent to step up capital expenditure, resource-strapped state administrations might have to pull back on their infrastructure spending. That could weigh further on corporate earnings — and valuations. Even after the recent selloff, MSCI India trades at 22 times forward earnings, more than 1.5 standard deviations higher the its two-decade average. Chinese stocks are a lot cheaper, by comparison. The lure of quick riches and the gamification of risky options trading has led to nearly 30 million new client accounts opening at India’s National Stock Exchange in the last eight months, taking the total to 200 million. With retail interest crowding into stocks, the market is still too frothy. During an hour-long special trading session Friday evening, an annual ritual to mark Diwali, auto stocks rose. As did banks and Nestle. It seems local investors desperately want the weakness in the consumer economy to be a temporary blip — caused by heavy rainfall. However, urban growth has been trending down for five quarters. To borrow a phrase made famous by the late US presidential candidate H. Ross Perot — although in a different context — it may require a deeper price correction before the “giant sucking sound” of foreigners pulling money out changes into the more familiar music of cash pouring in.

Charing the meeting of senior officials at the Finance Ministry on Monday, Ms Paetongtarn said the country faced a myriad of problems that accumulated over the years along with new challenges. She said the government must resolve entrenched structural issues, build resilience, and promote growth while noting that public spending is an effective tool for stimulating private spending and consumption. The premier added that the 900-billion-baht investment fund represents 5% of the country's GDP, so its disbursement would generate economic activities and income and help achieve the targeted GDP growth. Finance permanent secretary Lavaron Sangsnit said the government aims to disburse at least 80% of the investment budget. He said speeding up fund disbursement would help deliver that target without the need for additional measures. Mr Lavaron said the first month of the 2025 fiscal year in October saw above-average disbursement and urged state agencies to maintain the momentum. The fiscal 2025 budget of 3.75 trillion baht took effect on Oct 1, with the investment budget of 900 billion baht accounting for 24.2% of the total expenditure. Meanwhile, the northern office of the Bank of Thailand said on Monday that the economic conditions and consumption in the final quarter of this year are projected to improve due to the onset of the high tourism season and the government's stimulus measures. The industrial manufacturing sector is also expected to improve via increased demand from foreign partners and a rise in consumer demand during the festive season. However, farmers' income is forecast to decline, with consumer spending squeezed by the higher cost of living and severe flooding in the region. The recovery in the tourism sector is noted, while a fall in consumer spending, rapid changes in the market, and geopolitics are marked as key challenges for the region. Recent flooding caused extensive damage in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phayao, Phrae, Nan, Lampang, and Lamphun. The damage is estimated to be at least 14 billion baht, which is forecast to knock 0.7% off the gross regional product (GRP). KEYWORDS Thailand Budget Do you like the content of this article?

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with OMIC. In a note, Dolev underlined that evaluating Visa and Mastercard's U.S. growth trajectory now mostly depends on personal consumption expenditure. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that PCE increased 0.3% in September, or by $105.8 billion, compared to a 0.2% rise in August, aligning with experts' average estimate. Though it is believed to be similar, Dolev pointed out that roughly 45% of Visa's revenue growth has historically come from the cash-to-card conversiona statistic Mastercard does not reveal. Between the third quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2024, Visa's share of incremental U.S. consumer spending, computed as its payment volume against changes in PCE, was almost 61%. From a 52% average in 2023, this share has dropped to 47%. From the same five-year period, Mastercard's shareat 22%has fallen from an average of 22% to 20%. Dolev also pointed to Mastercard's advantage in the American debit card scene, where its share increased 20 basis points above Visa. In the third quarter, U.S. debit growth for Mastercard was 8%, while Visa's was just 5%. With its U.S. switching volume increase in October showing a 400 basis point month-over-month acceleration, Mastercard exceeded Visa's projected 200 basis point increase. For both businesses, cross-border transaction growth in October was similar; Mastercard noted a 200 basis point rise from September following a consistent third quarter. Dolev then changed his Mastercard price objective to $532 from $496 and Visa to $292 from $279. While the SA Quant rating system marks both companies with a ""Hold,"" Mizuho keeps an ""Outperform"" rating on Mastercard and a ""Neutral"" rating on Visa. This article first appeared on GuruFocus .

The spike came after the trade journal Miss Tweed reported that Moncler, which also owns Stone Island, was looking at a potential acquisition of Burberry, which has struggled as demand for luxury goods has fallen. The journal cited several industry sources who said the head of the luxury goods conglomerate LMVH , an investor in Moncler, was keen to get a deal done with the British retailer. LVMH, whose portfolio of high-end brands includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Celine, has a 15.8 percent stake in Double R, the investment vehicle that owns Moncler. That gives LVMH a seat on the Italian fashion brand’s board. ADVERTISEMENT Moncler told The Guardian it did not comment on “unsubstantiated rumours.” Shares in Burberry rose as high 872 pence in early trading on Monday, up more than 7 percent on Friday’s close of 812 pence. A number of analysts identified Burberry as a potential takeover target earlier this year after the company’s share price fell by 40 percent over a 12-month period. This meant it dropped out of the FTSE 100 index for the first time in 15 years. The drop in the share price and two profit warnings this year led to the abrupt exit of Jonathan Akeroyd in the summer after nearly three years as chief executive in July. Its profit warning in July followed a double-digit decline in sales across its core markets in what the company described as a “disappointing” first quarter. The company also scrapped its dividend. Store sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific fell by 23 percent, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa dropped by 16 percent. The company has also been particularly hit by an economic downturn in China, where consumers have become more selective about their high-end purchases. In May, Burberry reported that sales in China had decreased by 19 percent in the final quarter of last year. Burberry is one of several luxury brands that have struggled in recent years as consumer spending tightens. The Gucci owner, Kering, issued a profit warning in March, also citing a decline in Chinese consumer spending as factor in sluggish sales. ADVERTISEMENT The Guardian has contacted Burberry.

In Q2, it increased at 3 per cent. The increase primarily reflects rises in consumer spending, exports and government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased, a BEA release said. Real US GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in Q3 2024, an official 'advance' estimate said. In Q2, it increased at 3 per cent. Current‑dollar GDP rose by 4.7 per cent at an annual rate in Q3 2024 to a level of $29.35 trillion. In Q2, it increased by 5.6 per cent. Current-dollar personal income increased by $221.3 billion in Q3 2024 compared with an increase of $315.7 billion in Q2. The increase in consumer spending reflects rises in both goods and services. The increase in exports as well as imports primarily reflects an increase in goods. The quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) deceleration in real GDP in Q3 primarily reflects a downturn in private inventory investment and a larger decrease in residential fixed investment. These movements were partly offset by accelerations in exports, consumer spending and federal government spending. Imports accelerated. Current-dollar GDP increased by 4.7 per cent, or $333.2 billion, at an annual rate, in Q3 2024 to a level of $29.35 trillion. In Q2, it increased by 5.6 per cent, or $392.6 billion.

Current-dollar personal income increased by $221.3 billion in Q3 2024 compared with an increase of $315.7 billion in Q2. The increase primarily reflects an increase in compensation.

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) ran an ad where he declared “Benefits for illegal immigrants? No way.” But Tester has repeatedly voted for funding that is used to shelter, feed, and transport President Joe Biden’s flood of at least five million illegal migrants. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) defended her plans to amnesty illegal migrants but also told WISN.com on October 27. “Well … We need to vet everybody who is in this country — anyone who’s committed a crime should be deported,” she said, without describing how the vetting could be accomplished, or what crimes would prompt deportations. Republicans scoffed: “Tammy Baldwin has voted repeatedly against harsher penalties for criminal illegals and in favor of Kamala Harris’ reckless policies that threw open the southern border,” Tate Mitchell, at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . “The only reason she is trying to reverse course now is because she knows Eric Hovde has momentum and will work with President Trump to secure the border and protect Wisconsin families,” he added. Nationwide, many Democrats are funding ads that hide their record on migration. An October 31 report by NBCBNews said: Abortion is the most-mentioned topic in Democratic closing ads, followed by immigration, health care, bipartisanship and taxation, according to an analysis of more than 300 [October 30]TV ads from candidates and joint ads they ran with party committees. On one day Democrats ran 67 ads on abortion, 35 on immigration, 23 on healthcare, and 22 on bipartisanship, said NBCNews. https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/c2bc0ac2-218b-42ff-8e69-2530cd094ee8/ In contrast, GOP candidates posted 57 ads on immigration during the day. In Arizona, Republican Kari Lake slammed Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) after he suddenly declared “a border wall is important.” “He called it the dumb, stupid border wall,” Lake responded during their October 9 debate. Many polls show that swing voters oppose the Democrats’ pro-migration policies. For example, a mid-October Fox News poll shows a record 67 percent support among registered voters for the deportation of illegal migrants. Deportations were supported by 40 percent of liberals, 62 percent of Hispanics, 53 percent of blacks, 65 percent of moderates, and 86 percent of conservatives. The Fox News poll matches recent polls by Ipsos , Marist , YouGov , and Harvard-Harris . Those polls show almost two-to-one support for enforcing the nation’s existing border laws that protect American strivers and families from poor migrants and from employers who cheat by hiring cheap foreign labor. The federal government is importing millions of migrants to inflate the nation’s consumer economy with extra workers, consumers, and renters. This policy is great for investors and CEOs, but it also imposes huge burdens on American families, communities, and cities. On November 1, a Spanish newspaper, El Pais , described hte inflow of poor migrants into New York: “Every day we prepare a 100-liter pot of soup to distribute. When it runs out, if there are still people outside, we make another one… But we also have 200-liter pots, even 400-liter pots,” says [Natalia] Méndez, who is undocumented despite having arrived in the U.S. 30 years ago from Oaxaca (Mexico). Her children, dreamers , help her in the kitchen and with the distribution, “sometimes also of clothes, because they arrive with only what they are wearing.” … Giordana, a 43-year-old Ecuadorian, spends her afternoons squatting on a sidewalk in Manhattan, with her two children and two grandchildren, all of whom are in school. The woman, who arrived six months ago, says she cannot aspire to a conventional job with a set schedule: “The children leave school at 2 p.m. and someone has to pick them up and be with them. We cannot pay anyone to look after them because what my daughter [the mother of two of the children] and I earn is not enough.” A block away, outside a supermarket where several customers approach to give them food, a Venezuelan family — father, son, daughter-in-law, and a one-year-old granddaughter who crossed the Darién Gap aged five months — asks for help.

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) ran an ad where he declared “Benefits for illegal immigrants? No way.” But Tester has repeatedly voted for funding that is used to shelter, feed, and transport President Joe Biden’s flood of at least five million illegal migrants. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) defended her plans to amnesty illegal migrants but also told WISN.com on October 27. “Well … We need to vet everybody who is in this country — anyone who’s committed a crime should be deported,” she said, without describing how the vetting could be accomplished, or what crimes would prompt deportations. Republicans scoffed: “Tammy Baldwin has voted repeatedly against harsher penalties for criminal illegals and in favor of Kamala Harris’ reckless policies that threw open the southern border,” Tate Mitchell, at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . “The only reason she is trying to reverse course now is because she knows Eric Hovde has momentum and will work with President Trump to secure the border and protect Wisconsin families,” he added. Nationwide, many Democrats are funding ads that hide their record on migration. An October 31 report by NBCBNews said: Abortion is the most-mentioned topic in Democratic closing ads, followed by immigration, health care, bipartisanship and taxation, according to an analysis of more than 300 [October 30]TV ads from candidates and joint ads they ran with party committees. On one day Democrats ran 67 ads on abortion, 35 on immigration, 23 on healthcare, and 22 on bipartisanship, said NBCNews. https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/c2bc0ac2-218b-42ff-8e69-2530cd094ee8/ In contrast, GOP candidates posted 57 ads on immigration during the day. In Arizona, Republican Kari Lake slammed Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) after he suddenly declared “a border wall is important.” “He called it the dumb, stupid border wall,” Lake responded during their October 9 debate. Many polls show that swing voters oppose the Democrats’ pro-migration policies. For example, a mid-October Fox News poll shows a record 67 percent support among registered voters for the deportation of illegal migrants. Deportations were supported by 40 percent of liberals, 62 percent of Hispanics, 53 percent of blacks, 65 percent of moderates, and 86 percent of conservatives. The Fox News poll matches recent polls by Ipsos , Marist , YouGov , and Harvard-Harris . Those polls show almost two-to-one support for enforcing the nation’s existing border laws that protect American strivers and families from poor migrants and from employers who cheat by hiring cheap foreign labor. The federal government is importing millions of migrants to inflate the nation’s consumer economy with extra workers, consumers, and renters. This policy is great for investors and CEOs, but it also imposes huge burdens on American families, communities, and cities. On November 1, a Spanish newspaper, El Pais , described hte inflow of poor migrants into New York: “Every day we prepare a 100-liter pot of soup to distribute. When it runs out, if there are still people outside, we make another one… But we also have 200-liter pots, even 400-liter pots,” says [Natalia] Méndez, who is undocumented despite having arrived in the U.S. 30 years ago from Oaxaca (Mexico). Her children, dreamers , help her in the kitchen and with the distribution, “sometimes also of clothes, because they arrive with only what they are wearing.” … Giordana, a 43-year-old Ecuadorian, spends her afternoons squatting on a sidewalk in Manhattan, with her two children and two grandchildren, all of whom are in school. The woman, who arrived six months ago, says she cannot aspire to a conventional job with a set schedule: “The children leave school at 2 p.m. and someone has to pick them up and be with them. We cannot pay anyone to look after them because what my daughter [the mother of two of the children] and I earn is not enough.” A block away, outside a supermarket where several customers approach to give them food, a Venezuelan family — father, son, daughter-in-law, and a one-year-old granddaughter who crossed the Darién Gap aged five months — asks for help. The father, a worker at a state sugar mill who fled the country after a strike, is waiting for his asylum request to be processed so he can work; the four of them live in a shelter (families have an easier time finding accommodation than migrants who travel alone) … ” They are waiting for their papers to move to Pennsylvania, where they have relatives. Kamala Harris has promised to toughen border security — even as she has also promised to amnesty all migrants and to supercharge the huge inflow of economic migrants via the asylum and chain-migration gaps in the nation’s border."

https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2024/10/china-241031-voa01.htm,,Low consumer spending in China hinders economy there and abroad,20241101T110000Z,,globalsecurity.org,English,Syria,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer spending,"Low consumer spending in China hinders economy there and abroad In-Depth Coverage By Saibal Dasgupta October 31, 2024 U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has joined several independent economists to express her frustration about low consumer spending and the property crisis in China. Some experts have expressed disappointment over Beijing's limited measures to stimulate consumer spending, which is one of the biggest hurdles in the Chinese economy. ""Our view has been that raising consumer spending in China as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) is really important, along with measures to address problems in the property sector,"" Yellen said recently. ""So far, I would say, I haven't really heard any policies on the Chinese side that address that."" Yellen has criticized China for its focus on subsidizing large state-owned companies instead of working to revive the wider economy, the world's second largest. Analysts have suggested that China should stop subsidizing manufacturing companies with the money of households. The World Bank has predicted that China's GDP growth will be 4.8% this year, short of the country's 5% goal. It will slip further to 4.3% in 2025, the bank predicted. Low consumer demand in China can bring down the rate of growth in the global economy and affect the prospects of businesses in the U.S. and other parts of the world. ""For U.S. companies like Apple, Nike, Microsoft, KFC, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Tesla or General Motors, to name a few, China is a big market. Any increase or decrease in consumption in China can influence their bottom line,"" Lourdes Casanova, director at Cornell University's Emerging Markets Institute, told VOA. There are serious fears about the U.S. and the European Union slipping into recession, said Francesco Sisci, an expert on China affairs and director of Appia Institute, an Italy-based think tank. ""In China, there's deflation and no sign of getting out of it. If China doesn't get out of deflation, it could multiply recessionary forces worldwide. It might actually happen,"" Sisci said. Tendency to save, not spend China has taken several measures to revive the economy in recent weeks. They include lowering mortgage rates and cutting the reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to encourage banks to lend more money. The idea is to support households repaying home loans and encourage people to purchase more houses from the crisis-hit property business. However, analysts are not convinced about the effectiveness of the move. ""Housing demand is unlikely to see any meaningful revival just because of lower mortgage rates and down payment requirements, as experience shows,"" the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) said in a commentary. Casanova thinks low consumer demand is not an easy problem to resolve because the average Chinese believes in savings more than spending. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) as a percentage of GDP stands at 68% in the United States, 53% in Europe and 39% in China. Americans represent 31% of global PCE, while China's people represent just 11%. ""There is room for improvement in China but, you can't change consumers' habits overnight and, clearly, Chinese consumers are much thriftier than the American ones,"" she said. Americans often keep their cars outside the garage because garages are full of household items, clothes, toys, garage tools and other things, she pointed out. One way to increase consumer demand is to increase salaries and take additional social security measures. But for companies that would increase production costs and hurt exports, Sisci said. ""What China needs is transformative reforms that would have a political price, and the ruling Communist Party is not eager to pay it,"" he said. Contradicting the World Bank's view, China's Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min said the economy was responding positively to a series of stimulus measures taken by the government. ""These initiatives aim to leverage government spending to stimulate overall social investment and consumption, thereby increasing effective market demand,"" Liao said.

Spending has continued to be robust, despite elevated rates pressuring pocketbooks. We believe consumer spending will continue, even though credit card debt levels have risen and excess Covid era savings appear to be spent. In fact, we believe there’s a possibility consumer spending could surprise to the upside. Wealthier Americans with lower debt-to-income ratios are positioned well to sustain or increase their spending patterns. This group is responsible for a majority of American discretionary spending. Furthermore, while lower-income households face some stress right now, their financial conditions are poised to loosen as rates come down and inflation comes under control. If the outlook on the consumer starts to shift, we could see consumer discretionary names start to become investment opportunities. In particular we would point to retail businesses who have spent time building brand loyalty and catering to evolving consumer preferences. Over time these discretionary business models can become American staples. NEW YORK - AUGUST 5: Beverage cups featuring the logo of Starbucks Coffee are seen in the new flagship store on 42nd Street August 5, 2003 in New York City. The Seattle-based coffee company has emerged as the largest food chain in the Manhattan borough of New York with 150 outlets. (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images) Getty Images Assessing the Health of Consumers The first thing most people look at when talking about consumer health is credit card balances. Credit card debt in the U.S. reached $1.14 trillion in Q2 2024, a record high. However, while credit card balances are at all-time highs, it’s important to note that consumer debt service payments, excluding mortgages, make up 5.6% of disposable income – a number that’s in line with historical averages. If consumer debt grows in-line with GDP and incomes, then the all-time highs are a natural by-product of our nation’s record-setting growth coming out of the pandemic. Record high credit card debts are okay if they’re growing in line with the rest of the economy and debt service costs are manageable. Also worth noting is the composition of spending. While lower-income households carry a much higher credit card balance relative to their income, wealthier Americans are generally the primary driver of consumer spending. This groups ability to spend remains relatively healthy. High income households have seen a 17% increase in inflation adjusted retail spending since 2018. This is important because the top income quintile makes up 40% of personal consumption, and personal consumption makes up approximately 60% of domestic GDP. Lower income households are under more pressure. Their spending has still risen since 2018, middle income up 13.3% and lower income by 7.9%, but the spending growth lags that of their wealthier peers. This group is burdened by relatively heavier debt loads and are more exposed to inflationary pressures. Price increases have eroded their purchasing power, and rate hikes have hampered these groups’ access to credit. However, these groups are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Inflation appears to be moderating, with core PCE at 2.7% in September. Wage growth is also moderating, but not as quickly. Real wage growth was back in positive territory in September, clocking in at 1.8%. Furthermore, positive wage growth was especially strong for moderate wage earners. Finally, with inflation abating the Fed can finally start to reduce interest rates, bringing a degree of debt relief to millions of Americans carrying credit card balances or other adjustable rate debts.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Getty Images So, What’s Next For The American Consumer? The American consumer has been under stress, but it’s not like they stopped spending completely. We believe brands that have tried to work with the stressed consumer through this recent period of instability stand to benefit significantly as the tide for the consumer begins to turn. Think about a company like McDonald’s ( MCD ) – to attract customers wanting a better deal eating out, they’ve had to rely extensively on promotional offers. These promotional offers aren’t big profit engines, but the traffic during hard times helps build brand familiarity and form habits. When times are better and consumers can afford more, McDonald’s benefits from having expanded their consumer base. This kind of growth in bad times sets up the company for success when the economy is expanding. Companies like McDonalds are also trying to innovate to cement their position in a consumer’s lives by rolling out loyalty rewards programs and gamified applications. Businesses are willing to offer discounts or promotions through their apps because it helps build consumer habits and the data the businesses can get back about app usage gives them valuable information about which discounts or promotions are effective. Building habits and establishing a consistent customer base is key for helping companies sell more product, expand into new markets, and overcome disruptions to their consumer base or to their business model. Providing the customer with value and consistency also sometimes requires simplicity. Focused marketing and a simple product can be a really effective way to build brand loyalty. Take Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks ( SBUX ) for example – CEO Brian Niccol took the reins of the global coffee chain in September and has preached simplicity. A simpler and cheaper menu. An app that’s easier to navigate. A reversion back to being the neighborhood coffee shop. It’s just a simple focus on coffee! Before Starbucks, Niccol took Chipotle’s stock to all-time highs with its cost-efficient and customizable menu – all while limiting the complexity of actually making a burrito. Minimalism kept internal costs down and allowed the company to offer a better product at a better price. Keeping it simple and consistent can help consumers feel like they’re not splurging on lunch or their morning coffee and can lead to recession-proof earnings for the underlying businesses. Positioning yourself as a value option with a simple business model can also work outside of the food and beverage space. Look at apparel retailers. They have also benefited from a shift to preferences for value amid rising costs, especially among Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Retail stores where consumers can “trade down” are essential to maintaining consumer spending when times get tough. Think about companies like TJX Companies (TJX) and Burlington (BURL) – clothing retailers who have been taking market share from department stores for years and continue to look more like consumer staples rather than being discretionary names. Retail isn’t even close to dead here, as shoppers can still pick out branded items but at a steep discount. Where American’s aren’t opting for cost savings, they are opting for convenience. Think about mini splurges like ordering take out. DoorDash Inc ( DASH ) has continued to see robust growth among its users even as the broader economy has faced spending challenges. There are two angles to the success. First, on the consumer side, food delivery apps are becoming normalized. It’s becoming habitual, just like a morning stop at the local coffee shop. This habit building starts with meal orders, but the opportunity set for companies in the space is much wider. They’re solving last mile logistics for everything from meals to groceries to pharmaceutical goods to packages. Second, on the worker side of the equation, the gig-economy gives people another way to earn a bit of money to fund their habits. It doesn’t have the commitment of a second job and it’s flexible, but still gives people an easy way to earn money when times would otherwise be tough. Finally, it’s important to be cognizant of how broad the consumer space is. Not every company that has a consumer facing arm is necessarily dependent on the consumer for its growth. A prime example of this would be a company like Amazon ( AMZN ). Amazon is a huge consumer shopping platform so it gets categorized as a consumer discretionary type of name. But someone like Amazon also has other divisions. In particular, Amazon’s AWS division is one of the largest hyperscale cloud providers in the world and consistently generates a substantial portion of the company’s operating income – a far cry from being a simple consumer oriented e-commerce business. On the other hand, a company like an American Express or Visa get classified as financials, but they still depend on consumer spending and on brand loyalty to make money. Final Thoughts We think businesses offering discounts to Americans burdened by higher inflation and interest expenses are likely to keep building loyalty among their customers. Building loyalty now should pay off in the future when the consumer’s financial situation begins to improve. Furthermore, businesses need to streamline and adapt to new consumer preferences for value and convenience. Investors should keep a close eye on businesses with the potential to break away from dependency on the economic cycle and which assert themselves as American staples.

Δ The news may be a boon for consumption and, by extension, merchants. However, the personal income and outlays data indicated that a decrease in the share of savings as a percentage of personal disposable income may raise questions about whether it’s all sustainable. Third-quarter GDP growth , at 2.8%, rested in large part on consumer spending. The data released by the BEA Thursday (Oct. 31) gives more granular insight into September’s trends. Consumer spending was steady. Personal income and disposable personal income rose 0.3%, more than the 0.2% measured inflation. The read-across, with 0.5% growth in outlays (spending), is that consumers bought more in September. Drilling down into the $105.8 billion growth in consumer spending, both general categories — goods and services — saw gains. As for the categories themselves, healthcare, housing and nondurable goods (such as prescription drugs) saw the largest growth, as measured in dollar terms. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The expenses showed that key everyday essentials are still the bulk of what consumers are using their paychecks for. Larger-ticket items , such as vehicles and furnishings , are seeing combatively muted outlays , and even some declines. Personal savings have dipped from recent highs as measured as a share of disposable income, where the peak had been more than 5% and now stands at 4.6%. This could imply that consumers are tapping into their savings to cover everyday expenses. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Boomers Are Leaving the Credit Market ” found that 40% of consumers earning less than $50,000 a year reported they do not have readily available savings, which might lead them toward credit to offset those cash cushion pressures. PYMNTS Intelligence also found that almost 60% of consumers relied on credit products to pay for groceries last month. Earnings results from the likes of Mastercard and Visa this week have taken note of healthy credit use. Fewer consumers now have a smaller buffer for unexpected expenses as the savings rate slows , the data hinted . Combined with the slowing rate of incomes , these trends underscore a precarious balance between robust consumer spending and potential financial vulnerability.

U.S. consumer spending increased slightly more than expected in September, putting it and the economy on a higher growth trajectory heading into the final three months of the year.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in August, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.4% after a previously reported 0.2% rise in August.The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter, which was published on Wednesday. Consumer spending increased at a 3.7% annualized rate, the most since the first quarter of 2023, contributing the bulk of the economy's 2.8% growth pace last quarter. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Spending is being driven by a resilient labor market as well as a rise in household net worth, thanks to a stock market boom and higher house prices. But there are worries that growth is mostly being driven by middle- and upper-income households, which have more flexibility and substitutability of consumption. Subsiding inflation is, however, offering some relief for households, especially lower-income families. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2% in September after an unrevised 0.1% gain in August. Economists had forecast PCE inflation climbing 0.2%. In the 12 months through September, the PCE price index increased 2.1%. That was the smallest year-on-year rise in PCE inflation since February 2021 and followed a 2.3% advance in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.3% after increasing 0.2% in August.

The U.S. economy grew 2.8% in the third quarter, boosted by solid consumer spending. Microsoft and Meta reported mixed quarterly results even as both companies beat analysts' expectations on earnings. Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day: 1. A flood of reports Stock futures were lower on Thursday as Wall Street digests a mixed week of major earnings and inflation data reports. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.55%, while S&P 500 futures lost 0.80% and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 1.0%. More tech giants, including Amazon and Apple , will report earnings on Thursday.

Starbucks earnings The Starbucks logo is displayed above one of its cafes in London on Aug. 13, 2024. Hollie Adams | Reuters Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol on Wednesday promised a new plan will ""fundamentally change"" the coffee chain's strategy after earnings again missed Wall Street expectations . Net sales for the company fell 3% to $9.07 billion as demand weakened in the U.S. and China, including a 10% drop in traffic to U.S. stores. Niccol said a key goal for Starbucks is to hand deliver a customer's drink in under four minutes. Other changes Niccol announced include getting rid of extra charges for milk alternatives and cutting back menus. 3.

Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized rate, below the 3.1% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and the 3.0% jump during the second quarter. Consumer spending accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total and increased by 3.7%, the strongest pace since the first quarter of 2023. A number of reports on the U.S. economy will inform the Federal Reserve this week ahead of its decision on whether to further cut interest rates on Nov. 7. 4.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in August, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.4% after a previously reported 0.2% rise in August. The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter, which was published on Wednesday. Consumer spending increased at a 3.7% annualized rate, the most since the first quarter of 2023, contributing the bulk of the economy's 2.8% growth pace last quarter. Spending is being driven by a resilient labor market as well as a rise in household net worth, thanks to a stock market boom and higher house prices. But there are worries that growth is mostly being driven by middle- and upper-income households, which have more flexibility and substitutability of consumption. Subsiding inflation is, however, offering some relief for households, especially lower-income families. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2% in September after an unrevised 0.1% gain in August. Economists had forecast PCE inflation climbing 0.2%. In the 12 months through September, the PCE price index increased 2.1%. That was the smallest year-on-year rise in PCE inflation since February 2021 and followed a 2.3% advance in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.3% after increasing 0.2% in August. In the 12 months through September, core inflation increased 2.7% for the third straight month. The Federal Reserve tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target. The U.S. central bank last month launched its policy easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point interest rate cut, the first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. The Fed's policy rate is now set in the 4.75%-5.00% range, having been hiked by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. The Fed is expected lower rates by 25 basis points next Thursday.

GDP has slowed from the 3% posting during Q2. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 3.7% last quarter, marking the strongest performance since Q1 of 2023. The US federal government’s spending is factored into growth, albeit another reason why these data points never provide a true indicator of economic growth in the long term. The government managed to increase spending by an astounding 9.7% — 14.9% of which was spent on defense. Personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1.5%, providing a bit of good news for Fed who looks and causing optimism about a rate drop during the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Core PCE remained at 2.2%. Consumer spending, one-third of US GDP, has risen, but Americans are spending more on less. The government is not releasing the true figures or painting an accurate picture of the economy. Sure, consumer spending is up, but personal savings fell to 4.8% from 5.2%. Americans are spending more, but they are also falling into debt. The US remains the safe haven for international capital. We saw a 5.87% increase in capital flows to the US on a monthly basis based on the Global Market Watch, and Socrates predicts it will continue to increase.

And consumers are still opening their wallets and purses, tapping to pay, clicking to pay, swiping their cards; by extension, gross domestic product continues its upward trajectory, though at a pace slowing from previous readings.

Δ The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Wednesday that GDP expanded at a 2.8% pace , as measured in preliminary results for the third quarter. That’s a slowdown, a bit, from the 3% pace seen in the second quarter. Consumer spending grew at a 3.7% pace, adjusted for inflation, while prices were up 1.5% on an annualized basis. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of GDP. Consumer expenditures rose across nondurable goods, notably in prescription drugs, and services, with notable spending on healthcare and accommodations. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Seasonally Adjusted, Annualized Growth Rates Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis At the same time, the third quarter report offered evidence that personal income growth slowed, with disposable income rising by 3.1% compared to 5% gains in the second quarter. The personal savings rate dropped slightly to 4.8%.

Once again, out of the subitems that comprise the index, it was services (including housing and utilities, healthcare and transportation) which drove the bulk of the increase, at a 3% annualized rate. All in all, PYMNTS Intelligence finds that the latest data reflects a stable but cautious economic environment amid GDP growth. Consumer spending remains a crucial growth driver, yet the decline in disposable income growth and the savings rate may signal future constraints on spending capacity. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Separate PYMNTS Intelligence data indicate that as of September — right as the quarter was ending — a full 66% of consumers lived paycheck to paycheck, up 3% from a year ago. Savings might help supplement slowing disposable income, but as savings rates dip a bit, replenishing those cash coffers takes time. The latest paycheck-to-paycheck-related data have detailed that consumers who struggle to pay their monthly bills find ways to hold on to the savings they have. In fact, struggling paycheck-to-paycheck consumers average $2,447 in savings, while those living without difficulty average $7,558. But there are also some mixed signals coming out of earnings season. By and large, most of the payment networks and the banks have noted that consumer spending is resilient overall. But there are some pockets of volatility. In one example, Synchrony CEO Brian Doubles said “both new accounts and purchase volume growth continued to be impacted by a modest pullback in consumer spending,” adding that “our customers continue to be discerning in our discretionary purchases.” Discover Financial Services’ management has observed, as well, that as payments volumes were down by the low single digits, year over year, “cautious consumer behavior” has been observed.

Current spending levels may provide a welcome “not too hot, not too cold” scenario for the Federal Reserve. by Kristin Schwab Play Listen Now Save Share Download Consumer spending may be at a level that balances a healthy job market with stable prices. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images If gross domestic product is the measure of how well the economy is doing, then the economy is doing pretty well. The report out Wednesday shows GDP was up 2.8% in the third quarter, marking about two years now of strong growth. What has continued to prop it up? Consumer spending. Which presents a question about balance. Because if you’re the Federal Reserve, you want consumers to spend and keep the economy strong, but not spend so much that it drives up inflation again. The sweet spot for consumer spending? There is no simple answer. Because the sweet spot depends on what else is happening in the economy, said Jonathan Parker , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Ideally, you just want balanced growth,” Parker said. “You want growth in investment and consumption.” That’s consumption, the consumer spending part, and investment, business spending, which has also been strong. “We produce stuff,” Parker said. “We get stuff done and we put people to work.” A stark contrast to the deep pandemic days, when there were too many people chasing too few goods and not enough workers to get it all done. Julie Smith , an economist at Lafayette College, said a key element in achieving balance is people spending not too little, not too much. “I think a lot of that has to do with how they are feeling about the economy,” Smith said. And the consumer confidence numbers out this week say that “people are generally feeling OK to positive about the economy.” “OK to positive” might not sound like a glowing review, but it might just be the review the Fed needs. It could mean, for instance, that consumers feel confident enough about their jobs to keep spending, but not so confident that they’re job hopping for raises, which can increase inflation. Jim Wilcox , an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said the current equilibrium means consumer spending has fallen into that sweet spot. “The kinds of consumer growth we’re seeing lately are not going to reignite inflation,” Wilcox said. Spending that’s sort of even keeled allows the Fed to relax a little, at least for now. “They do not have to hurry to lower interest rates a lot,” Wilcox said. “And nor are they under much pressure to stop lowering interest rates.” Which he said puts the Fed on track to cut by a quarter of a percentage point next week.

Mike Blake/Reuters Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Print Save The U.S. economy expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter as households and businesses stood tall in the face of global headwinds and uncertainty ahead of the November election. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized after rising 3% in the previous quarter, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 2.9% pace. Consumer spending, which comprises the largest share of economic activity, advanced 3.7%, the most since early 2023. At the same time, a closely watched measure of underlying inflation rose 2.2%, roughly in line with the Federal Reserve’s target, figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed. The report card for the world’s largest economy illustrates solid momentum in domestic demand as the Fed began unwinding its tightest monetary policy program in decades. It’s also the last before Election Day, as American voters size up the general snapshot of US economic activity against their own financial situation, which has been beset in recent years by a high cost of living. GDP in the third quarter was restrained by volatile trade figures, which showed net exports subtracted 0.56 percentage point from the top line. Retailers stepped up imports of consumer goods as the quarter drew to a close on fears of a lingering dockworkers strike. Inventories also subtracted 0.17 percentage point. However, a measure of underlying growth trends favored by economists that combines consumer spending and business investment, known as final sales to private domestic purchasers, advanced 3.2%, the most this year. Nonresidential fixed investment rose an annualized 3.3%, the slowest in a year and dragged down by spending on structures. However, business spending on equipment was the strongest since the second quarter of 2023. The acceleration in consumer spending was broad. Residential investment declined an annualized 5.1%, the most since the end of 2022, as the housing market struggled under the weight of high mortgage rates and prices. The numbers should keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates in the coming quarters, including at their meeting next week. And while the figures showcase a solid momentum in the economy that may help bolster Vice President Kamala Harris’s election chances against her opponent, former President Donald Trump, that growth has not been evenly distributed in recent years, as the share of income going to profits has remained well above historical norms. A breakdown of corporate profits and employee compensation for the third quarter will be published next month with the BEA’s second estimate of GDP for the period.

Gross domestic product, a measure of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.8% annualized rate, according to a Commerce Department report Wednesday adjusted for inflation and seasonality. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 3.1%. The economy accelerated at a 3% pace in the second quarter. The report confirms that the U.S. expansion has continued despite elevated interest rates and long-standing worries that the burst of fiscal and monetary stimulus that carried the economy through the Covid crisis wouldn’t be enough to sustain growth.

Personal consumption expenditures, the proxy for consumer activity, increased 3.7% for the quarter, the strongest performance since Q1 of 2023. Another major factor the department cited for growth was federal government spending, which exploded higher by 9.7%, pushed by a 14.9% surge in defense outlays. However, an 11.2% jump in imports, which subtracts from GDP, held back the growth number and offset an 8.9% gain in exports. The release comes with the Federal Reserve poised to lower inflation rates further despite the seemingly strong economy and inflation that remains above target, though far from its peak in mid-2022. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut another quarter percentage point off its benchmark short-term borrowing rate when policymakers conclude their two-day meeting on Nov. 7.

New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows the quarterly consumer price index dropped to 2.8 per cent over the year to September, down from 3.8 per cent in June. That's the lowest level since the March 2021 quarter, while quarterly inflation was at just 0.2 per cent – not since June 2020 and the outbreak of COVID-19 was it lower.

NYSE:SHOP ) View Price & Profile Shopify seen beating estimates on resilient consumer spending Published: 12:43 29 Oct 2024 EDT Shopify Inc (TSX:SH., NYSE:SHOP) is on course to beat gross merchandise value estimates thanks to resilient consumer spending when it reports on November 12, Jefferies analysts have forecast. Merchant numbers using Shopify should continue to grow through the third quarter, as traction from new channels also buoys figures, Jefferies added in a note. Jefferies forecast gross merchandise values of $67.9 billion for the quarter, ahead of wider consensus estimates for $67.8 billion. Total revenue was seen climbing by 24% year on year to $2.124 billion in the meantime, with operating margins climbing to 16% on a non-generally accepted accounting basis. “Consumer spending has generally held up,” Jefferies pointed out, highlighting non-store retailer sales growth of 7% year on year in September. An operating margin of 14.6% had beaten expectations in the last quarter, analysts said, leaving investors eyeing a path for the figure to exceed 20% ahead. “Beyond margin expansion, we believe investors will be looking for positive color on new growth segments, signaling strong return on investment on incremental spending.” A ‘hold’ rating was set, alongside an $80 share price target, broadly in line with Monday’s closing price. “While we appreciate the durable topline growth and capacity for operating margin upside, we believe shares will likely remain range-bound given the premium valuation,” Jefferies said.

Run out of sugar? Someone will zigzag through traffic to get it to you before the tea goes cold. No time for a diaper run? Blinkit has you covered. Or Zepto... or Swiggy Instamart. Several such platforms are challenging the more established physical and online retailers. To have at least half a dozen options for quick commerce is a good thing in an economy where concentration of large monopolies and duopolies is on the rise. But what might seem like a gain for consumers is not a free lunch for the society. A 10-minute delivery has many hidden costs. That’s no showstopper for the industry. Blinkit sales more than doubled from a year earlier in the September quarter, according to financials released last week by its owner Zomato Ltd., a $27 billion startup that began to trade publicly three years ago. The unit, which rushes everything from groceries and medicines to pet supplies in eight minutes, is now nearly half as big as food delivery, Zomato’s original business. It’s growing six times faster. Swiggy Ltd., too, began as a food-delivery app. Instamart, which it started in two locations in 2020, has grown to cover 43 cities. And according to the prospectus of Swiggy’s much-awaited initial public offering, Instamart stocks nearly 20,000 items now, including electronics and wearables. That’s more than double from a year earlier. Back then, the average delivery time was nearly 17 minutes. In June, it fell to under 13 minutes. Rapid expansion is drawing in both fresh-faced entrepreneurs and seasoned investors. Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global recently raised their stakes in Zepto, founded by two 19-year-old Stanford University dropouts who found themselves stuck at home during the pandemic. The quick-commerce startup is worth $5 billion, based on its last funding round in August. Live Events Also Read: This festive season get 10 min gold, silver delivery I’m not convinced the economics of the 10-minute delivery will be able to withstand the relentless pressure of growth, especially in smaller cities and towns where the cost of warehousing a large number of goods may be too large compared with the size of the average order. The US market is littered with failures like Fridge No More, Buyk, Jokr, and Getir. So far, though, the Indian model has shown surprising resilience. It’s as if Covid-19 flipped an impulse-buying switch in people’s heads. “Life is short,” is how late-medieval Europe reconciled itself to the ravages of Black Death, the 14th-century plague that led to a surge of consumerism in a pre-capitalist society. Glass panes appeared in the windows of working-class homes, and a scandalized state sought to limit the height of Venetian women’s platform shoes. That history has an echo in 21st-century capitalist India, where the smartphone seems to have became a tool of affirming one’s existence: “I am, because the delivery guy says so.” Bloomberg The durability of this behavioral change is not something the established retail players could foresee. Earlier this month, shares in Avenue Supermarts Ltd., also known as Dmart, fell the most in over five years after analysts got spooked by the severity of the quick-commerce onslaught. Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian who owns the country’s largest supermarket chain, has started a pilot run of under-30-minute grocery delivery, according to the Morning Context, a news portal. Ambani has shut down a similar service in the past. Blinkit says its new “stores,” which are essentially retail partners that help fulfil demand in a neighborhood, break even when they reach 700,000 rupees ($8,300) in daily gross order value. The average for all its stores is nearing 1 million rupees a day. As some investors have noted, what started as “top-up” buying of milk, eggs and other frequently ordered items is now encroaching into “stock-up” purchases of higher-value staples ordered far less frequently. Brands like Adidas and Decathlon are queueing up for a ride, boosting the per-order amount. The origin of India’s quick-commerce revolution is not purely psychological. It’s also financial, economic and social. Trouble with other large bets, such as online education and fintech, is leading to faddish overinvestment in quick commerce. For the economy, it’s creating low-quality work amid a jobless recovery. India has only 1% of the world’s vehicles, but the largest number of deaths from road accidents. While the quick-commerce fleet is increasingly dominated by slower-moving electric two-wheelers, instantaneity is the top value proposition of quick commerce. And that won’t change. On work conditions, contracts, and responding to delivery partners’ grievances, the industry is doing a better job than ride-hailing platforms like Uber Technologies Inc. and Ola, and e-commerce behemoths like Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, according to Fairwork’s latest ratings. There are gaps, however, when it comes to letting riders earn at least the minimum wage. Collective bargaining remains a distant dream, and the traditional retail supply chain is so unhappy with being bypassed that it’s demanding an antitrust probe. A lot can go wrong when 1.4 billion consumers start expecting even household appliances to arrive in 10 minutes, and are not willing to take stock of the consequences of their impatience. They might get more than they bargained for when the doorbell rings. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

This year's festive season was particularly important for businesses looking to rebound after a slowdown in consumer spending during the summer and election periods. Companies were focused on driving sales beyond last year's numbers, according to apna.co. Additionally, the rapid expansion of the quick commerce industry contributed to this hiring momentum. Among the sectors, logistics and operations experienced the highest growth with a 70 per cent increase in job postings. Retail and e-commerce followed with a 30 per cent rise, while the restaurant and hospitality sector grew by 25 per cent. To meet the rising demand, logistics and mobility leaders like Rapido, Delhivery, Ekart, and Shiprocket have posted over 30,000 openings for roles like warehouse managers, logistics associates, inventory managers, and delivery drivers. ""At Apna, we typically start preparing for the festive season two months in advance. However, this year was crucial for our employer partners, who anticipated a 20-25 per cent increase in consumer demand. To support them, we began our preparations even earlier, building a strong talent pipeline,"" Nirmit Parikh, founder and CEO of Apna.co, said. The retail and e-commerce sector is also expanding, adding 18,000 roles, including category growth managers, sales associates, and customer support managers to enhance the consumer experience. In hospitality, 14,000 jobs have opened for positions like restaurant managers, front office staff, and administrative personnel. QSR giants like Jubilant Foodworks and food delivery platforms, such as Swiggy and Zomato, are also ramping up hiring to keep pace with the demand. This hiring trend is not limited to major metro cities, tier-2 and tier-3 cities are also experiencing a significant rise in job opportunities. Factors, such as increasing urbanisation, expansion of malls and quick-service restaurants, and improved consumer spending are driving this growth. Cities like Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Indore, Kanpur, Chandigarh, Patna, Coimbatore, and Jaipur have recorded a 25 per cent increase in job postings."

The retailer is slowing expansion and closing more stores amid intense competition from quick commerce platforms and subdued demand. Writankar Mukherjee & Chaitali Chakravarty ET Bureau Updated On Oct 26, 2024 at 07:54 AM IST Read by 100 Professionals Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook Representative image India’s largest retailer Reliance Retail has tapped several expatriates with retail experience from Europe, US and South Asia in a bid to streamline its grocery supply chain operations, enhance the online fashion business Ajio and improve margins, two industry executives said. Some of these expats have also been entrusted to coach a pool of young Indian leaders for a top leadership succession planning exercise started recently by the retail business of Reliance Industries Ltd , the executives said. At least five chief executives at Reliance Retail in their late 50s and 60s may move to mentoring roles as advisors or superannuate over the next few years. The initiatives at Reliance Retail come at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers, including Reliance, and Avenue Supermarts Ltd —the owner of DMart retail chain—are facing intense challenges in grocery retail from quick commerce platforms in large cities amid a subdued demand environment. Advt Reliance Retail has also slowed down expansion and sharply increased store closures this fiscal, resulting in only 110 net store additions in the first half of this fiscal year though it had opened 795 stores. This means store closures exceeded store openings by over six times. Last year, in the same period, the company reported net store additions of 610 outlets when it had opened 1,026 stores. The company had noted a weak apparel and footwear business in a quarterly earnings call earlier this month. “Some 20-30 professionals—some expats and some from within India—have recently joined as consultants to work on supply chain, finance, operations, category, inventory management and most importantly, margins,” one of the executives told ET. Reliance Retail has also started a succession planning for the top leadership even though there is no formal retirement age in the company. This is because many of its top management are in their late 50s and 60s, and the company wants to appoint young leaders. One of the roles that’s likely to see a new leader over the next few years is managing director for Reliance Retail Ventures—the holding company of all retail and FMCG business of Reliance—a position currently held by V Subramaniam. The following roles may also see changes: Chief executive officer of grocery retail, which is now headed by Damodar Mall; electronics retail business CEO led by Brian Bade, and lifestyle and fashion retail business CEO presently led by Akhilesh Prasad. The others are CEO of Ajio, a role held by Vineeth Nair and Reliance Trends chief operating officer, currently led by Vipin Tyagi. “It is still not decided when these executives will move to a mentoring role but like every big organisation, a succession planning has recently started. They themselves are grooming the successors along with the expat coaches ,” a second executive said. He said the large size of Reliance Retail and complex organisational structure has necessitated the involvement of expats. Reliance Retail didn’t respond to ET’s queries. Advt The company runs over 18,946 stores spanning grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. It is the largest in India by number of stores, sales and profit. There are also plans for a public listing but parent RIL has yet to take a final decision. While Reliance Retail occasionally utilises the expertise of expats to regroup its business, it is after several years that so many of them have joined the company in one go, the executives said, adding that these expats have mostly joined as consultants. “The timing is important. The July-September quarter has been particularly harsh for most retailers due to weak consumption, specifically in urban markets. The ten-minute delivery promise from quick commerce companies such as Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart is swiftly changing buying habits of consumers in top 15-20 cities where these companies service,” the first person said. Established retailers such as Reliance and Amazon are yet to start 10-15 minute delivery though the former has started testing the model.

All those 2023 predictions about a recession hitting the U.S. in 2024 have been wrong—so far, anyway. Instead, headlines have touted the apparent success of the Federal Reserve in engineering a slowdown in the rate of inflation without stifling the economy. Hooray for the Fed. But that hopeful news—and the constant drumbeat of election developments—seems to have drowned out another important, yet more sobering, trend: Consumers as a group are worn out by inflation and all the other financial disruptions triggered by the COVID pandemic. Although the rate of inflation has fallen back to levels close to those pre-pandemic, the prices of goods have not decreased. Housing remains unaffordable for many, and car insurance rates are higher than ever. Whether or not this year’s retail holiday season performs well, American shoppers are fundamentally discouraged about the future. The most recent Consumer Confidence Survey by The Conference Board, a nonprofit think tank, recorded a broad decline in its monthly index for September. “Consumer confidence dropped to near the bottom of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years,” according to Chief Economist Dana M. Peterson. The decline was the largest since August 2021, with all components of the index in retreat. Peterson noted that consumers’ assessments of current business conditions have turned negative; views of the labor market have softened; and people are more pessimistic about future labor market conditions as well as future income. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Among generations, the 35–54 age group (straddling Gen-X and Millennials and representing about a third of the U.S. population) were the least confident. The Conference Board survey found confidence declined across most income groups. Similarly, the widely-cited University of Michigan’s most recent Consumer Sentiment Survey found that although inflation expectations have fallen substantially since 2022, the percentage of consumers blaming high prices for their worse personal finances remains at or near an all-time high. Presidential election years tend to produce a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, and this year is no different. But do elections actually affect the consumer economy? A long-term University of Florida study released earlier this year found that they can, depending on who wins. A recent Nationwide Insurance Institute survey found that investors are “bracing for adverse outcomes if their preferred candidates fail to win.” Those investors expect a recession within 12 months. The case for a 2025 recession grows stronger when examining the huge run-up in the stock market (the S&P 500 stock index is 150% higher than it was in March 2020) and the sky-high prices of homes (on average up about 50%). These asset prices have driven up the net worth of many households, giving those consumers the confidence to keep spending. History teaches that such above-average returns are unsustainable. When those asset bubbles start to deflate, the impact on consumer spending will be swift. Financial industry chatter about how great things will be now that the Fed has started cutting interest rates is geared toward investors rather than everyday consumers. But history offers another lesson on rate cuts: In nearly every case over recent decades, a few months after the Fed begins cutting rates to fight inflation, a recession ensues.

Livemint 3 min read 25 Oct 2024, 08:30 AM IST Among urban netizens earning more than ₹ 4 lakh per month, only 42% consider themselves rich, while 1% even claim they’re poor. Summary About 88% of India’s urban netizens claim middle-class status. Across income slabs, even at the upper end, we mostly think we’re middlers. Does this reflect sketchy awareness of relative incomes? Modesty? Or is it about social mobility and what we invest in moving up? Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now The middle-class of a country often has a starring role in its economy as much as what we call the ‘public sphere.’ But who qualifies as a member can vary by how we define this class. Should we go by how people view their own status? According to the latest YouGov-Mint-Centre for Policy Research Millennial Survey, as reported in ‘Plain Facts,’ 88% of urban Indian netizens identify themselves as middle-class. This cuts across income levels: among respondents who also disclosed their earnings, 90% earning under ₹ 50,000 monthly slot themselves in this bracket, as do 57% of those who earn above ₹ 4 lakh every month. Overall, only 7% consider themselves rich and 5% poor. This nearly universal claim to middle-class status sits awkwardly with statistical readings. Also read: India’s middle-class riddle: How much do you need to be called rich? People Research on India’s Consumer Economy, for example, lists households with an annual income of ₹ 5 lakh to ₹ 30 lakh (at 2020-21 prices) as middle-class; its survey for 2022-23 found that this class accounts for 39% of the country’s population, but punches above its weight with 49% of household income, 47% of spending and 49% of savings. While online folks in our cities may have a middle-class skew, it’s clear from the Millennial Survey that more people see themselves in this class than a statistical lens would warrant—most remarkably at the upper end. How come? One answer is that people are scarcely aware of India’s big picture. Since ‘middle’ is a relative term, the relatively well-off may underestimate where they are placed. Among urban netizens earning more than ₹ 4 lakh per month, only 42% consider themselves rich, while 1% even claim they’re poor (and the rest middle-class). Likewise, in lower slabs, few individuals may be in a position to guess where they’d be slotted by a slice-up that uses monthly inflows as a criterion to classify us. As for what level of income would make people rate themselves as ‘rich,’ which was probed by the Millennial Survey via a separate query, the median is a monthly ₹ 90,000 per person. Among those self-classified as rich, ₹ 1.47 lakh per head is the mid-point that splits this lot into upper and lower halves. As it turns out, many people who call themselves middle-class are rich by their own yardstick. Could it be a leftover from our pre-millennial past, when being rich wasn’t glorious? An act of modesty? What explains this tendency to identify as middle-class? A lens of sociology may help. Also read: With incentives and deductions, middle-income share in India’s tax kitty shrinks As a slice of society, it is characterized not just by income, but also by higher education, better-paid ‘desk’ jobs, cushy lifestyles, media exposure, retirement nest eggs, and, crucially, upward mobility over a lifespan. Effort invested in this last bit is a key marker, since the destitute may rate their chances of better lives too low, while the wealthy are often past the point of striving for it. Such differences in motives and attitudes, partly shaped by money, may be explained by Maslow’s theory of needs, which slots them into five step-up levels. The most basic are needs of survival, like air, water, food, shelter and sleep. Safety and security are next, followed by love and belonging, and then esteem needs like dignity and status. Atop them all, we have ‘self-actualization’ needs, broadly about making the most out of life. Also read: Tax overload: India’s middle class is hurting because of inequitable taxation It’s plausible that India’s income profile does not mirror what a wide social prism would classify as our middle-class. That’s why well-off Indians who are driven to ascend an escalator of earnings—and Maslowian needs—may be calling themselves middle-class without batting an eyelid.

But Trudeau still insists that foreign migrants — not Canadian ingenuity and birthrates — are vital to growing the nation’s economy, and his supposed cutback actually accelerates the amnesty-like conversion of temporary migrants into Canadian citizens. The cuts are “temporary — to pause our population growth and let our economy catch up,” Trudeau said. “Our economy needs newcomers, we see the pressures facing our country, and we must adapt our policies,” said an October 24 statement from immigration minister Marc Miller. Trudeau’s political rivals say the cutback is too little and too late, amid the expanding poverty , housing spikes , birth-rate reductions , and stalled productivity caused by Trudeau’s agreement with consumer-economy investors to import many millions of desperate workers, poor Indian consumers, and apartment-sharing renters. Trudeau’s disastrous migration policy has been repeatedly endorsed by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border chief. “We look to the north, with Canada,” border chief Alejandro Mayorkas said in September 2024: Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. Polls show Trudeau is deeply unpopular , largely because his mass migration policy has wrecked Canada’s economy and society. “Today’s immigration flip-flop is a massive admission of failure by Justin Trudeau,” responded the leading opposition candidate, Pierre Poilievre, head of Canada’s Conservative Party: Desperate to save himself from Liberal MPs who want him gone, Trudeau now admits his immigration policies caused housing, health care and jobs crises. But he can’t fix what he broke. Only common sense Conservatives can do that. Call a carbon tax election so we can bring it home However, Poilievre also wants to keep importing many foreigners to inflate Canada’s consumer economy and real estate sector. For example, he said that migration levels should be set by housing costs and employers’ wants , which would prevent the labor shortages that help corporations raise productivity and help ordinary Canadians prosper in a pleasant society. “This is far from being a sufficient reduction,” Maxime Bernier, who founded the pro-Canadian People’s Party of Canada, sharply responded on X. Trudeau’s cutback, Bernier said, “will only slow down the [migrant] tsunami,” adding: We need to stop it. And right now. But it’s nevertheless a huge pivot for a government that literally flooded the country with foreigners and, until recently, was smearing anyone who didn’t agree that wanting MORE immigration was the only acceptable position. This also confirms that the Liberals now favour a more restrictive immigration policy than Pandering Poilievre’s fake Conservatives, who have never clarified where they stand on this crucial issue as the unserious party that they are. Trudeau’s massive immigration has damaged the nation’s economy by diverting resources from technology and productivity to housing construction and anti-poverty programs, says Canadian bankers. “Our economy is now smaller than it was in 2019 when adjusted for inflation and immigration, and pretty much in the same place it was a decade ago,” admitted a June 4 report by Canada’s RBC Royal Bank. Amid Trudeau’s migration, “a growing share of savings and investment has flowed to real estate and construction, which, while needed and beneficial for many reasons, are both relatively inefficient and can hold back the overall productive growth of an economy,” the report said. But Trudeau’s cutback plan still calls for massive migration into Canada’s fast-growing population, which is now roughly one-quarter immigrants . For example, Trudeau plans to import 395,000 immigrants in 2025, 380,000 in 2026, and 365,000 thereafter. That inflow will deliver four job-seeking migrants for every three students who graduate high school in Canada. Each year, Trudeau also imports roughly 500,000 supposedly “student” workers — mostly from India — and grants citizenship to many. The statement said Trudeau’s new cutback will ; Transition … more temporary residents who are already in Canada as students and workers to permanent residents. Representing more than 40% of overall permanent resident admissions in 2025, these residents are skilled, educated and integrated into Canadian society. They will continue to support the workforce and economy without placing additional demands on our social services because they are already established, with housing and employment. Trudeau’s announcement came after Canada’s unemployment rate increased 0.2 percent to 6.4 percent in June, according to Statistics Canada. In an update on October 11, Statistics Canada revealed that in September, the “unemployment rate fell 0.1 percent” to 6.5 percent. Breitbart News has previously reported that a Nanos Research Group poll, which surveyed 1,081 Canadians, found that 68 percent of Canadians felt that increasing the target number for permanent resident immigrants would negatively impact the cost of housing, while 20 percent felt that there would be a positive effect on housing prices. In July, Trudeau acknowledged that due to Canada’s housing market being impacted by a large number of foreign workers, young Canadians would be denied housing wealth, noting that they would not “get the same kind of homebuyers’ plan” that “people a generation ago did.” As of June 2023, Canada had reached a population mark of roughly 40 million people, and as of March 2024, the nation was reported to have hit the 41 million population mark, according to the Daily Hive."

Economic growth is likely to be still higher than the potential growth rate, Minister Choi Sang-mok said in a meeting with reporters in Washington D.C., according to the report. International organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), estimate South Korea's annual potential growth rate to be around 2%. South Korea's economy barely grew in the third quarter as consumer spending showed signs of recovery but exports declined, data showed on Thursday.

The combined inflow means that Biden’s deputies admitted roughly one legal or illegal migrant for every American born in 2024. The constitution says Congress controls immigration rules, “but this is a parallel immigration system” outside the law passed by Congress in 1990, noted Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge who now works with the Center for Immigration Studies. He added: Congress has said that people who don’t have visas, who aren’t admissible, aren’t supposed to be coming through the borders. Border officials registered 2.9 million “inadmissible” migrants at the southern border in the fiscal year of 12 months up to October, according to agency data released on October 22. At least 1.3 million were invited to cross the border via the humanitarian parole programs created by Biden’s pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. These migrants can be counted because they are registered and released by the Office of Field Operations, which works at the official “ports of entry” along the border. In 2021, Kamala Harris declined Biden’s invitation to help oversee Mayorkas’s migration policy. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mayorkas’s Department of Homeland Security says 700,000 migrants were returned to Mexico or removed to their home countries in the 12 months up to October. That claims shows that 2.2 million of the 2.9 million migrants were let into the United States. Few of the 2.2 million migrants were detained, despite the 1990 law requiring that asylum seekers be held until their asylum pleas are decided. The agency claimed that the number of additional migrants who sneaked through the border — dubbed “gotaways” — have dropped : “The estimated number of migrant gotaways – people who crossed the border without encountering [border guards] – has decreased approximately 60% from FY 2023 to FY 2024.” But that statement suggests that 400,000 gotaways successfully crossed the border into American society because the official estimate of 2023 gotaways was 670,000. The gotaways numbers spotlight the reality that Mayorkas has minimized deportations from arrests north of the border. The hands-off policy means the gotaways are welcomed to work once they sneak past the border guards. Overall, the data suggests that Biden’s parallel immigration system welcomed a total of 2.6 million “inadmissible” migrants or gotaways through the southern border in fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, the legal immigration system allows roughly one million legal migrants per year, plus at least 500,000 white-collar and blue-collar contract workers. Together, Congress’s and Biden’s immigration networks allowed roughly 3.6 million legal and illegal migrants in 2024 — or one migrant for every American birth. Just 3.6 million Americans were born in 2023, down from 3.7 million in 2022 and 2021. If elected President, Harris is expected to welcome 12 million illegal and legal migrants, despite the huge pocketbook and civic damage to ordinary Americans. Federal judges have generally refused to block Mayorkas’s parallel migration system, even when asked by members of Congress, former judge Arthur noted: Their attitude is, “Look Congress, if you don’t like it, you can do what you want to do.” In fact, one of the statements that they put into United States v. Texas [a 2022 decision ] was, if the people don’t like it, they could vote out the officials. Mayorkas has repeatedly explained that he supports more migration because of his migrant parents , his sympathy for migrants, his support for “ equity ” between Americans and foreigners, his willingness to put his priorities above the law, and the claimed “needs” of U.S. businesses — regardless of the cost to ordinary Americans, the impact on U.S. children , or Americans’ rational opposition . Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The Extraction Migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . Donald Trump and his campaign team recognize the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, apartment-sharing renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom — even as China leads the world in automated production technology. The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.

It had previously predicted in July that the UK would record 1.1% growth for the year News Lawrence Matheson and Henry Saker-Clark PA Deputy Business Editor 09:07, 24 Oct 2024 View Image The UK economy is set to grow slower than previously expected over the next two years (Image: PA Archive/PA Images) Cautious consumer spending is expected to dampen the UK's economic growth over the next two years, economists have revealed. ‌ The EY Item Club’s latest quarterly economic forecast indicates that slow decision-making by Bank of England rate-setters not to slash interest rates too rapidly will result in ""steady rather than rapid"" growth. This news comes as a potential setback for Chancellor Rachel Reeves before the autumn Budget , especially since the Government counts on future economic expansion to generate funds for its spending ambitions. ‌ The forecast this autumn predicts that UK gross domestic product (GDP) will rise by 0.9% in 2024, a downgrade from July's prediction of 1.1% growth. In contrast, earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) improved its outlook, still expecting a 1.1% growth rate for the UK. Official data from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy grew by 0.7% and 0.5% in the first two quarters of 2024. ‌ A prospective slowdown might be around the corner for the most recent quarter after stagnation in July and just a 0.2% increase in August, slowed by the squeeze on household incomes and lacklustre summer weather . On top of this, EY has also revised downwards its growth prediction for next year, forecasting an uptick to 1.5% in 2025, a step back from a previous 2% growth expectation made in July. The report linked the downgrades primarily to weaker household savings than initially estimated three months ago, causing consumers to limit some spending habits. Matt Swannell, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, stated: ""Following last year’s technical recession , a strong start to 2024 helped establish the UK’s recovery and a return to steady growth is forecast for next year."" Article continues below He added: ""However, lower household savings has reduced the scope of potential consumer spending and sticky inflation means that interest rate cuts are set to occur at a gradual pace. This means that growth in 2025 won’t be as robust as it could have been."" The forecast anticipates UK interest rates – currently at 5% – to drop to 3.5% by the end of 2025. Mr Swannell suggested that cuts to interest rates should provide ""a shot in the arm for the private sector and a pickup in business investment"". Consequently, it projected a 1.3% rise in UK business investment this year, up from a previous estimate of 1%."

UnionBank of the Philippines (UnionBank) and Mercury Drug launched a credit card offering health perks on every health and wellness purchase to “lead a healthier life” on October 18 at the Grand Hyatt Manila in Taguig. The UnionBank Mercury Card includes benefits with no annual fee, such as a free annual physical exam and ambulance service. An immersive active lifestyle experience was featured at the launch, with outdoor yoga sessions, indoor cycling classes by Saddle Row, and massage sessions by the Grand Hyatt Wellness Team. Manoj Varma, consumer bank head of UnionBank, said healthcare has grown beyond medication and drugs to focus on overall wellness in this generation. “Healthcare forms a large part of the consumer’s spending on their everyday spend,” Varma said. “I think it’s growing at about ten percent faster than the average economy is growing.” “Typically, healthcare is about six to eight percent of a consumer’s everyday spending, every month or every year, whichever way you look at it,” he said. Despite healthcare being a large industry, Varma said it still lags behind global growth trends relative to consumer spending. Cardholders will earn five times reward points on all health and wellness purchases, including vitamins, skincare, and fitness classes. The card features the iconic “Mercury Man” design on the front. Mercury Drug president Vivian Que-Azcona said the new card represents more than just a financial tool but a commitment to holistic health and wellness. “We have designed this card to reward you not just for your daily purchases but for the choices you make to lead a healthier life,” Que-Azcona said. Que-Azcona underscored that healthcare should never be a burden as the card seeks to make health and wellness convenient and financially rewarding. “Whether you are focusing on prevention or handling emergencies, we want to ensure that your well-being is safeguarded at every stage of life, keeping with our mission of making healthcare more accessible,” she said. The ON Runway Show The launch featured the inaugural ON runway show, unveiling the latest sportswear collection from the Swiss-engineered apparel brand. Attendees witnessed models walking down the runway in modern running shoes and stylish activewear, showcasing a collection that merges performance with style. Distributed in the Philippines by Dan’s Group of Companies, ON’s latest designs promote the card’s unique value proposition with wellness as an aspirational part of everyday life. Interaksyon"

Article Insights Hall Estill are most popular: within Tax and Privacy topic(s) in United States with readers working within the Construction & Engineering industries In the ever-evolving landscape of commercial real estate, neighborhood retail leasing stands out as a stalwart performer. Despite challenges faced by other asset classes, neighborhood retail continues to exhibit strength and stability. Let us delve into the key factors driving its success. In the first half of 2024, the national retail vacancy rate remained at an impressive 4.1%. This resilience is attributed to increased demand and fewer tenant bankruptcies. Retail space saw a surge in demand, with 54 million square feet (about twice the area of Central Park in New York City) leased, particularly in food and beverage, discount, off-price, and experiential sectors. The sustained demand has kept vacancy rates low, making retail an attractive investment. Robust consumer spending has been a driving force behind neighborhood retail's success. As cities continue to evolve, urban retail experiences a resurgence. Record-low total retail vacancy rates have contributed to a combined 3.3% growth in asking rents in prime retail corridors from 2022 to 2023. Consumers' preferences for local shopping centers and communityoriented experiences have b o l s t e r e d neighborhood retail. D e s p i t e higher cons t r u c t i o n costs, developers have continued to invest in retail spaces. Construction totaled 50.4 million sf, with 6.5 sf million, delivered in the second quarter, focusing on buildto-suits and grocery-anchored centers. Leasing rates remain above average, and net absorption reached 7.2 million sf (about twice the area of a large shopping mall) in the second quarter. Average retail rents rose to $34.12 per sf, indicating sustained growth. Economic uncertainties and interest rate fluctuations impact various asset classes, but neighborhood retail remains resilient. Analysts predict unchanging vacancy rates and moderately positive rent growth for neighborhood and community shopping centers throughout 2024. As consumers seek convenience and local experiences, neighborhood retail leasing is poised to thrive. Some examples of successful neighborhood retail spaces include: 1. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York : Once a primarily residential neighborhood, Williamsburg has transformed into a thriving retail hub. Its mix of local boutiques, specialty stores, and artisanal eateries draws both residents and visitors. 2. The Ferry Building, San Francisco : This iconic space combines indoor and outdoor elements, creating a vibrant marketplace. It features local food vendors, specialty shops and a bustling farmer's market, making it a beloved neighborhood gathering spot. 3. Pike Place Market, Seattle : Pike Place Market is a historic landmark known for its lively atmosphere. It houses a variety of businesses, from fishmongers to craft stalls, creating a unique and authentic retail experience. 4. Lincoln Park, Chicago : Lincoln Avenue in Lincoln Park is a great street to explore. It's home to a variety of shops, boutiques and local businesses. And some successful neighborhood retail areas in Denver include: 1. The Source : The food hall that started the trend in 2013 features local restaurants and food trucks. It benefits both local businesses and consumers. 2. Avanti : Another popular food hall in Denver, Avanti offers a variety of culinary options and supporting local vendors. 3. LoDo District Inc .: Representing the Lower Downtown Historic District, this organization fosters community engagement and supports local businesses. The success of neighborhood retail spaces can be attributed to several key factors: Community - centric approach : Successful neighborhood retail spaces prioritize community engagement. They foster a sense of belonging by hosting events, supporting local causes and collaborating with nearby residents. Curated tenant mix . A wellthought-out mix of tenants is crucial. Combining anchor stores, specialty boutiques and food vendors creates a diverse and appealing environment. Variety attracts different demographics and keeps foot traffic steady. Location and accessibility . Proximity to residential areas, public transportation and pedestrian-friendly streets enhances accessibility. Easy access encourages repeat visits and word-ofmouth recommendations. Unique experiences . Retail spaces that offer unique experiences stand out. Whether through art installations, live music or interactive displays, these spaces create memorable moments for visitors. Adaptability . Successful retail spaces evolve with changing trends. They stay attuned to consumer preferences, adjusting their offerings and services accordingly. When it comes to neighborhood retail leasing, there are several legal challenges that both landlords and tenants should be aware of: Exclusive uses . Exclusive use rights are highly negotiated. Tenants want to protect their specific business niche by preventing landlords from leasing to similar tenants, while landlords aim to maintain leasing flexibility. Ensuring proper enforcement and remedies for exclusivity violations is crucial. Co-tenancy . Tenants often choose locations based on neighboring businesses. To protect against high-profile tenant closures, some tenants seek co-tenancy provisions, so that they can Originally published by Colorado Real Estate Journal The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Against this backdrop, consumer spending growth is likely to slow in the year ahead, says Fitch Ratings. In a new report, the rating agency said consumer spending rose in the first half, largely thanks to strong population growth. In the second quarter, consumer spending was up 0.1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, Fitch reported. On a per capita basis, spending was down 0.5% quarter over quarter, and was down nearly 3% year over year. While household net worth rose by almost 4% in the first half, Fitch said, “Households remain highly indebted, with liabilities equivalent to 177% of income.” The debt service burden, which is already historically high, is expected to rise higher, as mortgages continue to reprice at higher rates in the months ahead, Fitch forecasted. “Despite the [Bank of Canada’s] rate cuts, next year will see a large number of mortgages reset onto higher rates than before, adding to the pressure on homeowners and weighing on consumption,” said Jessica Hinds, director with Fitch, in a release. As a result, Fitch is forecasting that consumer spending growth will slow to 1.1% in 2025 from 1.9% in 2024. Fitch also reported that real household disposable income was up 3.9% year over year in the second quarter, and that the household savings rate climbed to 7.2% in the quarter, “well above the 2015–2019 average of 2.2%.” While households are building savings, “these have largely accrued to the wealthiest households so are unlikely to boost consumption meaningfully,” it said.

Keeping that dream alive for millennials, Gen Z and beyond requires right-sizing it by building more apartments, condos, duplexes and, especially, townhouses. “In an age of tight money and its Toyota Camrys and Kirkland wine, it’s time to readjust the scope … townhouses consume less energy and foster healthy habits and social connection better than single-family homes,” a Washington Post opinion editor added on October 21. The progressive cheerleading for pushing young Americans into small houses with postage-stamp lawns, steep stairs, minimal parking, and little privacy comes as Democrats insist on continuing President Joe Biden’s high-migration policies. Kamala Harris, for example, is promising to build 3 million homes by 2028 — yet her high migration policies are likely to import 12 million more migrants by 2028. Her scheme may get some votes, but it also would help Wall Street investors buy the extra homes for profitable rental back to low-income Americans. Donald Trump, however, promises to cut migration and restore the middle-class American Dream of a family and house , vacations, and retirement. “It’s all about the American Dream,” Trump told a roomful of business elites and billionaires at the Economic Club of New Yor in September, adding : We will make housing much more affordable… [and] we will get [mortgage rates] back down to 3 percent … [so] young people will be able to buy a home again and be part of the American dream …. [Democrats] don’t want to talk about the American dream because they are the exact opposite. Immigration “is a big driver of housing costs,” Sen. JD Vance told a Detroit audience in October: The media, they don’t like to talk about the fact that one of the biggest drivers of housing costs, one of the biggest reasons why our young people can’t afford to buy a home is because under Kamala Harris’s leadership, we have let in millions upon millions of people who don’t have any right to be here. Immigration, Wages, and Housing Reporters at establishment media outlets do not have the authority to describe the establishment’s recognition that President Joe Biden’s policy of welcoming 10 million migrants is suppressing wages , boosting housing costs , and raising mortgage rates . But they are allowed to describe housing-related problems providing there is no link to the establishment’s top priority of doubling the nation’s population growth with migrants, including the “ dreamers ” who are brought to the United States as children by their illegal-migrant parents. “Many swing states, particularly along the Sun Belt, experienced an influx of new residents during the pandemic, driving up demand for housing … That burst of [domestic] demand, combined with constrained supply, led to a rapid run-up in prices,” the Washington Post admitted on October 20. “Higher interest rates have made borrowing more expensive, wages have not kept up with rents and there is a shortage of affordable units, ” the New York Times wrote on October 21: In interviews with dozens of voters in and around Las Vegas, the rising cost of housing was routinely cited as the most persistent financial difficulty weighing on their minds. That was particularly true for Black and Latino blue-collar workers, voters who have moved away from Democrats, according to recent polls . … “The dream of having my own home is not a dream I’ve had since I was 21 [in 2019],” Mr. [Armando ] Garcia said, sitting in his mostly barren living room, adding that it “feels too bold” now. “It just feels unrealistic. It doesn’t feel like I can, like, daydream about it for very long because it just feels like I have realism around me all the time.” Mr. Garcia is unlikely to vote for Ms. Harris next month, he said, though he will support local Democrats, and instead will write in another candidate or simply not cast a presidential ballot. In a separate housing article, the Washington Post offered a quote from Tina Rhodes — a former California liberal now living in Delaware: “I’ve lived both ends of it, and now I’m just a mom who really just cares about being able to afford to live,” Rhodes said. “The only people who can afford to live here now are wealthy or have five roommates.” Yet the Washington Pos t’s cheerleading for small houses excludes any rollback of the post-1990s migration policy that is intended to extract workers, consumers, and renters from poor countries . That inflow is intended to benefit consumer-economy investors on Wall Street, such as Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon.com. Nor does the Post suggest the suggested shift in national economic policy to a low-migration, high-productivity, high-tech economy that would raise Americans’ wages at all levels. Polls show that Americans are increasingly opposed to migration and its economic damage. Sixty-one percent of registered voters told a Washington Post September-to-October survey that illegal migrants “generally make the communities they live in worse .” Just 7 percent say the migrants make their communities “a lot better.” An April-to-October survey by the University of Michigan shows that a plurality of voters now say migration is bad for the economy . The poll asked 5,700 people: “Which would be better for the economy as a whole—if immigration into the U.S. increased, if immigration into the U.S. decreased, or wouldn’t it make much difference to the economy?” The “more” response dropped from 36 percent in 2020 to 26 percent in 2024. The “less” response climbed from 24 percent in 2020 to 43 percent in 2024, marking a 29-point shift over the four years. Democrats shifted by 23 points, college grads shifted by 32 points, and the “middle third” of stock owners shifted by 33 points. Shrinking the American Dream But the Post ‘s op-ed ignores the impact of migration as it tells young Americans to literally shrink their American Dreams , to think small, and to accept cramped living conditions alongside many millions of supposedly vital new migrants: Owning a home has long been a core part of the American Dream. Today, however, there simply aren’t enough affordable options, and that ideal is increasingly out of reach. There’s a sensible way to address this shortfall, but it requires moving beyond the antiquated vision of a big house with a fenced yard in the suburbs. … [Real estate] developers have found a sweet spot with townhouses. They are cheaper to build. They usually face less “not in my backyard” resistance. And buyers love them. Townhouses have all the trappings of a classic dream home, but they cost less to buy, offer a low-maintenance lifestyle and are more climate-friendly. Economics is driving the downshift to cheaper — but denser, smaller, and less private — housing, the op-ed notes: “This is one reason the size of newly built homes has been shrinking for over a decade , and people are moving south and west , where housing is cheaper.” State and local government should accelerate the trend by bulldozing the zoning rules that prevent small lots, the op-ed says: We need to shift that. It starts with zoning. Any lot that currently allows one single-family home should be granted the ability to put two or three homes on the lot, such as a duplex or triplex. “It’s the American Dream, but with a smaller yard,” the pro-migration Post said ."

Δ More homeowners are borrowing against the rising value of their properties and considering spending on home repairs and renovations as interest rates drop, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday (Oct. 22). The home improvement business surged during the pandemic but slowed as borrowing costs rose, according to the report. Consumer spending and home repair and renovation is expected to return to growth next summer, the report said, citing Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies . The slump in the business has been relatively mild, but the decline from record highs has led to closings and curtailments of production at sawmills, a bankruptcy filing by hardware wholesaler True Value and drops in the prices of some stocks in the sector, per the report. The pickup in home improvement spending is expected to be aided by lower interest rates prompting consumers to use home equity lines of credit to fund projects and by homeowners who took out historically low mortgages during the pandemic choosing to renovate their existing homes rather than moving to new ones, according to the report. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The timeline of the recovery is uncertain, though, as homeowners may wait to see how low the interest rates go, the report said. Home Depot said in August that it is working to win over a greater share of the B2B segment — professional builders and contractors — because consumer spending on home improvement projects had dropped amid higher interest rates and concerns that the economy is getting worse. The home improvement retailer said it expects demand to remain tight and it lowered its guidance for the rest of the fiscal year, saying it expects sales at stores open at least a year to fall between 3% and 4% this year compared to last year, down from its earlier estimate that sales would fall around 1%. “The underlying long-term fundamentals supporting home improvement demand are strong,” Ted Decker , chair, president and CEO of Home Depot, said Aug. 13 during the company’s quarterly earnings call. Lowe’s also revised its annual forecasts downward in August, saying a challenging macroeconomic environment was dampening consumer spending on home improvement projects. The decline in Lowe’s consumer segment was partially offset by positive comparable sales in Pro and online. “As we look ahead, we are confident that we are making the right long-term investments to take share when the market recovers,” Marvin R. Ellison , chairman, president and CEO of Lowe’s, said Aug. 20 during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

Mr. Trump is going with his gut, doubling down on the rhetoric that he believes won him the 2016 election and using immigration and the border to form the core of his closing message to voters,” the newspaper reported October 19. Migration ‘“beats out the economy” with voters, Donald Trump told his October 15 rally, the newspaper said. “It’s not even close.” Immigration and the economy are wrapped together, Trump’s campaign told the newspaper: Asked to explain Mr. Trump’s focus in the closing days of the race, a Trump spokesman, Brian Hughes, said: “President Trump rightfully recognizes that Kamala Harris’s porous border is at the heart of so many issues, whether it is high housing prices, low wages or overwhelmed hospitals and schools. An open border means that taxpayer dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants, instead of benefiting citizens. President Trump’s closing message is all about putting Americans first and restoring prosperity.” The Times reporters did not mention that Kamala Harris’ 2024 economic platform requires a huge inflow of migrants . A Democratic-leaning advocacy group, for example, predicted she will import 12.3 million migrants during the next four years. Amazingly, Harris has not tried to revive her campaign with a promise to reduce the inflow of economic migrants , despite her promising to upgrade border security many times. RELATED — CNN’s Zakaria: Biden Should Go Back to Trump’s Immigration Policies A growing number of GOP leaders — including Trump’s pick for Vice President, JD Vance — recognize that the federal migration policy imposes huge pocketbook and civic costs on ordinary Americans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for example, wrote an October 17 article for CompactMag.com, showing that migration has damaged ordinary Americans: … immigration remained within sustainable limits through most of the 1970s and ’80s, and it remained within most Americans’ grasp to make ends meet. My own parents, themselves immigrants from Cuba, earned enough to buy a home and raise four children on the salaries of a hotel bartender and stay-at-home mom who occasionally worked as a maid. As recently as 1985, meanwhile, the average US-born man could afford a middle-class lifestyle for a family of four on about 40 weeks of wages (compared with about 62 weeks today). In other words, the American Dream was alive and well, for immigrants and natives alike. But Washington, DC, changed the rules for ordinary Americans by supercharging global trade and migration, Rubio wrote: The consequences of this for US-born men have been catastrophic. The percentage of prime-age men now working or looking for work is close to what it was in 1940, in the throes of the Great Depression. Meanwhile, one economist estimates that by 2016, immigrants had “increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent.” The Biden-Harris administration has only compounded the problem. By one government count, the administration has admitted at least 6.5 million more illegal migrants since then—and that doesn’t include an estimated 1.5 million “gotaways.” Some Wall Street investors are touting an alternative, low-migration strategy that would expand economic growth and prosperity. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China , and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme. Breitbart News has closely c0vered the federal government’s post-1990 use of migration to boost the U.S. consumer economy by extracting cheap workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates , consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages , subsidizing low-productivity companies , boosting rents , and spiking real estate prices . The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout , slowed high-tech innovation , shrunk trade , crippled civic solidarity , and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded , low-status Americans . Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom . The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants , including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama."

As growth slows, delivery workers face decreased incomes and job instability. Economic slowdown and cost-cutting pressures force these workers to endure longer hours and increased risks, exacerbating their financial struggles. Devdiscourse News Desk | Updated: 20-10-2024 11:25 IST | Created: 20-10-2024 11:25 IST Representative Image (Photo/Reuters). Image Credit: ANI Country: China SHARE The once-thriving $200 billion Chinese food delivery industry, which saw significant growth during the Covid-19 pandemic, is now facing substantial challenges, according to a CNN report. The industry, known for being the largest globally in terms of revenue and order volume, has provided a steady source of income for many casual workers. However, they now find themselves struggling to make ends meet. The situation is further compounded by China's economic slowdown, triggered by a property crisis and weakened consumer spending, which has sharply impacted the incomes and job security of delivery workers. Recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics highlighted a moderation in third-quarter growth, pointing to persistent struggles in consumer spending and an ongoing property market crisis that continues to weigh down the economy. The gross domestic product grew by 4.6% from July to September compared to the previous year, slightly above Reuters polled economists' forecast of 4.5%, CNN reported. Jenny Chan, an associate sociology professor at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, indicated that delivery workers are under continuous pressure due to platforms' cost-cutting strategies. ""They are working long hours under tremendous strain,"" Chan stated, adding their situation won't improve as long as delivery companies focus on keeping costs low. Amid economic pressures, there's a trend toward more budget-conscious meals, reducing the earnings of delivery workers, who are forced to work longer hours to sustain their income levels. These conditions compel workers to meet strict deadlines, sometimes risking safety by speeding or running red lights, creating hazards for themselves and other road users, CNN noted. Paychecks for delivery workers have shrunk significantly, compounded by financial hardships. Last year, their monthly earnings averaged 6,803 yuan ($956), as reported by the China New Employment Research Center—almost 1,000 yuan ($140) less than five years prior, despite longer working hours reported by many, CNN reported. The 1,000 yuan reduction may appear minor in USD terms, but it is significant in China, where the national average monthly wage was just 1,838 yuan ($258) last year, according to NBS data.

Strategic expansion in global consumer services and commercial lending. Investment in technology and digital platforms to enhance customer experience. Competitive pressures and regulatory changes pose potential risks. On October 18, 2024, American Express Co ( NYSE:AXP ) released its latest 10-Q filing, revealing a company that continues to solidify its position as a global financial powerhouse. The filing indicates a year-over-year increase in total revenues net of interest expense from $15,381 million to $16,636 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This growth is underpinned by a rise in non-interest revenues, including discount revenue, net card fees, and service fees. Net income also saw an uptick from $2,451 million to $2,507 million, reflecting the company's ability to translate revenue growth into bottom-line results. These figures set the stage for a comprehensive SWOT analysis, providing investors with a deeper understanding of American Express Co's strategic position and future prospects. Decoding American Express Co (AXP): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Brand Power and Customer Loyalty: American Express Co ( NYSE:AXP ) boasts a prestigious brand synonymous with quality and reliability. The company's brand strength is evident in its ability to command premium pricing, particularly in its discount revenue, which has grown from $8,408 million to $8,780 million year-over-year for the three-month period. This brand power is further reinforced by a loyal customer base, as demonstrated by the increase in net card fees from $1,846 million to $2,170 million, indicating a growing willingness among consumers and businesses to pay for the value they perceive in American Express Co's offerings. Financial Robustness: AXP's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic initiatives. The company's net income growth from $2,451 million to $2,507 million showcases its ability to effectively manage expenses and capitalize on revenue-generating opportunities. The balance sheet strength is further highlighted by a solid net interest income increase from $3,442 million to $4,006 million, underscoring the company's adeptness in navigating the competitive financial landscape. Weaknesses Dependence on Consumer Spending: American Express Co's ( NYSE:AXP ) performance is closely tied to consumer spending patterns, which can be volatile and subject to economic fluctuations. While the company has seen an increase in revenues, any downturn in consumer confidence or spending could adversely affect its discount revenue and service fees, potentially impacting overall profitability. Story Continues Operational Costs: Despite its financial success, AXP faces challenges in controlling operational costs. The total expenses have increased from $11,048 million to $12,076 million year-over-year for the three-month period. This rise in expenses, particularly in areas such as card member rewards and business development, could squeeze margins if not managed prudently in the face of intense competition and market pressures. Opportunities Expansion in Emerging Markets: American Express Co ( NYSE:AXP ) has the opportunity to further penetrate emerging markets, where there is significant potential for growth in consumer and commercial services. By leveraging its strong brand and financial expertise, AXP can tap into new customer segments, driving revenue through increased card issuance and merchant partnerships. Digital Innovation: Investment in technology and digital platforms presents AXP with a chance to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. The company's focus on digital transformation could lead to the development of new payment solutions, improved data analytics capabilities, and more personalized services, fostering customer engagement and loyalty. Threats Regulatory Changes: The financial industry is subject to stringent and ever-evolving regulations. Changes in laws or increased regulatory scrutiny could impose additional compliance costs on American Express Co ( NYSE:AXP ), affect its business practices, and limit its ability to innovate or expand its product offerings. Intense Competition: AXP operates in a highly competitive payments industry. The emergence of fintech companies and alternative payment methods, along with aggressive strategies by traditional competitors, could erode AXP's market share and pressure its revenue streams, particularly in the areas of discount revenue and net card fees. In conclusion, American Express Co ( NYSE:AXP ) demonstrates a strong financial performance with a robust increase in revenues and net income, underpinned by its powerful brand and customer loyalty. However, the company must navigate the challenges of operational costs and dependence on consumer spending. Opportunities for growth lie in expanding into emerging markets and harnessing digital innovation, while regulatory changes and intense competition pose significant threats. Investors should consider these factors in the context of AXP's strategic direction and market dynamics.

The federal government aids illegal migrants because it wants to demolish the once-clear legal borders and dictionary distinctions between Americans and foreigners. For example, the government is granting aid to foreign migrants if they form a business in the United States, the Post wrote on October 18. “These are people [migrants] who are not in the country legally, but their businesses are legal and they’re paying taxes,” Silvia Martín del Campo, the director for programs for Latino students at McDowell Technical Community College in Marion, North Carolina. The aid to migrants would otherwise go to Americans who have lost their homes, land, jobs, and wealth to Hurricane Helene. The vast majority of Americans are personally sympathetic to migrants, most of whom work hard in low-wage jobs where they also need taxpayer aid to keep them out of poverty. Moreover, many of the migrants — like Americans — have lost their jobs, hard-earned possessions, and even homes to the disaster. However, the migrants are in North Carolina only because the federal government has spent many billions of dollars to help smuggle illegal migrants across the border and settle in the states. Roughly $1 billion of that funding has come from FEMA accounts since 2021. The government aid for migrants is part of a post-1990 economic strategy, dubbed “ Extraction Migration .” The strategy seeks to inflate the consumer economy by quietly extracting low-wage workers, apartment-sharing renters, and taxpayer-funded consumers from poor countries. The resulting government inflow of poor migrants blurs the border between Americans and migrants, and it also shrinks Americans’ wages and personal wealth . The policy is very unpopular, so the government hides its role by obscuring the language, loopholes, and funds that help migrants. For example, the Post’s article about aid for migrants uses words that blur the distinction between ordinary Americans and the illegal migrants who sneaked across the border as it describes how the migrants are offered aid: Two of the people [emphasis added] who applied with Martín del Campo’s help are [migrant] sisters who own a cleaning service that specializes in mountain cabin rentals. All those reservations have been canceled, she said, leaving them with no business. They applied for a $30,000 loan, which is about as much as they usually make in six months. “I don’t want to take advantage of the system and I don’t like borrowing money,” one sister said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of her immigration status [emphasis added]. “But my bills are due whether I can work or not. … This kind of loan would help a lot.” Another low-wage migrant, restaurant worker José Elguera-Camacho, told the Post that he was allowed to apply for the fast-track $750 disaster grant offered by FEMA. “I usually work more than 40 hours a week this month,” he said. “Now I’m at zero,” he said. FEMA offers the $750 “ Serious Needs Assistance ” grant to migrants by hiding the loophole in the fine print. The fine print allows paroled illegals to be treated as “qualified non-citizen[s].” The government is also offering benefits to illegal migrants if they have a son or daughter born in the United States: “Most of the people [aid worker Neyda] Juarez sees are parents applying for FEMA aid on behalf of their children, who are U.S. citizens.” Juárez is employed by Centro Unido Latino Americano, which is one of the very many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are being used by the government to fund migrants so they settle in American communities. The NGO is supported by various grants delivered via U.S. charities and the Mexican government . The group has also received taxpayer funding from some of the vast federal spending for migrants and migration. Most of the government funding for migration is hidden by routing it through myriad NGOs for later distribution to smaller NGOs that commingle funds for Americans and migrants . Some of the disaster aid that flows through the NGOs is used to pay their operating costs — and their subsequent lobbying for more migration said Krikorian. This kind of aid run through NGOs is necessary for the NGOs to stay in business. They also are defacto working for more illegal immigration and for allowing the illegal immigrants here already to stay. So even something like disaster aid provided to these nongovernmental groups is helping establish the illegals. The Centro Unido NGO is also helping the North Carolina migrants by funding their transfer to other U.S. communities, said the Post : For [migrant] families who lost homes or jobs and don’t qualify for government aid, Centro Unido is raising money to help them pay rent, put down security deposits for new apartments or trailers or move to cities where there’s more work. The federal disaster aid would be better spent helping migrants return home rather than making it easier for them to illegally stay, “which the disaster aid is obviously meant to do,” said Krikorian. Sending migrants home with some disaster aid in their pockets “would be an efficient use of money” if it allowed officials to avoid deportation costs, said Krikorian. Americans would also be aided once the repatriated illegal migrants were no longer competing for the limited supply of local jobs, homes, and social services, he said. The return of the migrants would also be good for the migrants’ home countries, he added. “Not only would the migrant return home with money, they would also bring their [work skills] … [and] they speak English better,” he said."

The National Retail Federation predicts that sales could hit a whopping $989 billion this season. How is holiday shopping forecasted? ""There's a reason it's an average, so it's going to be a very high spread, so some people won't spend a dime and some people love this time of year and spend a lot and everywhere in between,"" Seth Ketron, assistant professor of marketing at the University of St. Thomas, said. ""Generally, they are pretty accurate overall. They are never going to be 100% perfect, but the goal is to get a sense of what retailers should get prepared for."" Retailers use forecasts to help determine staffing, inventory and to gauge how consumers are feeling about the economy. ""It's a constant process, they might come out with a broad forecast then adjust it as time goes on,"" Ketron said. The National Retail Federation's forecast is based on data from economic indicators, including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment and wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales. Ketron says AI has made forecasting consumer spending habits more accurate, but even then, things can change on a dime, like natural disasters or sudden shifts in the market. Not all forecasts rely solely on data. Deloitte's 2024 holiday retail survey gathered responses from more than 4,000 consumers this year and found that people are looking to spend less on consumer gifts and more on experiences. The National Retail Federation defines the holiday shopping season as Nov. 1 through Dec. 31. In: Holiday Season Featured Local Savings"

Spot gold firmed 0.5% to $2,706.76 per ounce by 0220 GMT, adding nearly 2% so far in the week. U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to $2,722.00. ""Gold has scoffed at a surging dollar and rallies at every chance it gets. It's just a bull market that shows no signs of exhaustion,"" said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader. [USD/] U.S. economic data released overnight pointed to a strengthening economy, which boosted the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields. But traders still see a 90% chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in November. [US/] The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the third time this year as the euro zone economy sags. Gold is expected to trade within the range of $2,500-$2,800 in the coming months, as prices receive support from Fed's rate cuts and high levels of geopolitical tension, BMI analysts said. Hezbollah said it will escalate war with Israel after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Elsewhere, with less than three weeks remaining to cast votes this U.S. presidential election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump are stretching for the support of every last voter. Lower rates increase the non-yielding bullion's appeal, which is considered a safe investment during times of turmoil. Spot silver rose 0.5% to $31.92 per ounce and was headed for a weekly gain. Platinum added 0.5% to $996.85 and palladium increased 0.7% to $1,049.25.

KUALA LUMPUR: BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, has forecast household spending to grow by 5 per cent year-on-year in 2025, in real terms, to a value of RM952.6 billion. This marks a return to pre-Covid growth levels at a real average rate of 5.2 per cent year-on-year during the 2015-2019 period. It has a cautious but positive outlook for consumer spending in Malaysia in 2025, as the economic recovery feeds through to strong real consumer spending growth over the full year. ""Household spending growth will be slower, relative to 2024, although we note that this growth remains robust as economic growth persists and consumption levels normalise,” said BMI in a report today. Spending will, nevertheless, be constrained by a high debt-level environment and debt-servicing costs. Easing inflation and a tight labour market will, nonetheless, support spending, as real wage growth returns to positive territory, supporting purchasing power over the year. Explaining further, BMI said consumer confidence levels have largely been declining, reflecting a weakening consumer mindset as inflationary pressures in certain commodities such as food and fuel continue to weigh on low- and mid-income households. Referring to the latest retail sales, it said in August 2024, retail sales came in at 5.9 per cent year-on-year. ""Although this is the slowest growth in retail sales since April 2024, this growth is due to easing sales in specialised stores. Nevertheless, the August 2024 figure is the fourth consecutive month of retail sales slowdown, the trajectory of this weakening will require further monitoring.” Household debt remains a risk to consumer outlook A high level of household debt remains a risk to its consumer outlook, as this not only constrains future borrowing capacity but impacts current disposable income levels, it said. This is particularly true as debt servicing costs rise in response to increases in interest rates. In many markets, central banks rapidly hiked interest rates during the 2022-2023 high inflationary period, reaching levels most households were unaccustomed to over the past decade, said BMI. Most markets have now reached terminal interest rates, with many central banks expected to start loosening rates over 2025. While interest rates will not reach the previous historical lows of the last decade, easing monetary policy will alleviate some debt servicing cost pressures. Malaysia has witnessed a household credit boom over the past few years. ""We highlight that the rapid unwinding of this could pose a risk to domestic demand. At its last estimate, Bank Negara Malaysia put household debt at 68.5 per cent of GDP in Q3 2023.” Similarly, as repo rates and interest rates begin to rise, so will debt servicing costs; households will increasingly have to allocate disposable income towards debt financing, putting downward pressure on consumer spending going forward, it said. Malaysian households are relatively well insured against rising debt costs. In 2022, household debt in Malaysia totalled RM1.5 trillion (US$330 billion), but household financial assets totalled RM3 trillion (US$861 billion). Considering the financial soundness of these households, liquid financial assets to total debt were recorded at 135.4 in 2022, slightly lower than the 143.3 recorded in 2019. This highlights that households do have additional room to absorb rising debt costs if needed. - Bernama Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

S . stocks close mixed after retail sales report,20241018T000000Z,,thestar.com.my,English,Malaysia,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer spending,"NEW YORK, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Thursday, as the latest retail sales data gave credence to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 161.35 points, or 0.37 percent, to 43,239.05. The S&P 500 sank 1.00 point, or 0.02 percent, to 5,841.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 6.53 points, or 0.04 percent, to 18,373.61. Six of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with utilities and communication services leading the laggards by dropping 0.93 percent and 0.69 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and technology led the gainers by going up 0.44 percent and 0.42 percent, respectively. U.S. retail sales in September rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent month on month, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.3 percent increase, according to data released by the U.S. Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Thursday. This followed an unrevised 0.1 percent gain in August, signaling stronger-than-anticipated consumer spending as the holiday season approaches. The data suggests that despite inflationary pressures, consumers are still willing to spend, providing a positive signal for the broader economy. ""Strong consumer spending in September suggests economic growth in the previous quarter was solidly above trend,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, told Reuters. ""Our baseline remains that the Fed will likely cut a quarter of a percent in both November and December."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 241,000 for the week ending Oct. 12, according to the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday. This decline came alongside a strong labor market report, as nonfarm payrolls for September saw their largest increase in six months. The unemployment rate also improved, dropping to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent in August. These figures indicated continued resilience in the labor market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. A reassuring update from the world's largest contract chipmaker TSMC helped counter some of the negative sentiment caused by ASML's disappointing forecast. TSMC posted strong quarterly results, highlighting robust demand for advanced artificial intelligence microprocessors, which remains elevated. This positive news provided a boost to chip stocks, offering some relief to investors who worried about a broader slowdown in the semiconductor industry.

Worse, their cities are being used as illegal alien dumping grounds. If Kamala gets 4 more years, the Black Community loses its political power forever because their neighborhoods will all be majority migrant. The combined economic and political pitch is mostly likely aimed at voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin where black voters have seen the Democratic politicians lavish attention, funding, housing, and opportunities to Biden’s massive inflow of Latino migrants. Unsurprisingly, 53 percent of blacks want “all” illegal immigrants deported, according to a September to October poll of 179 blacks posted by Marist for National Public Radio. The 53 percent includes 24 percent who “strongly” agree. Just 17 percent strongly disagree. The same poll showed that only 72 of blacks percent have a “favorable impression” of Harris. Nineteen percent said they had a favorable view of Trump, and 9 percent said they were “unsure.” The economic and political pitch seems to have the most appeal to younger black men. For example, Trump has won support from 20 percent of blacks aged 18 to 49 , according to a poll released on October 10 by Pew. Even if Trump’s pitch on migration does not win him votes, it may reduce turnout for Harris, who is expected to import almost 4 million migrants in 2025, according to an October study from the Brookings Institution. “Mass Immigration, Legal & Illegal is destroying Black American Communities b y taking resources, jobs, and opportunities that are severely needed by Black American Citizens,” the Twitter account @nasescobar316 told Breitbart News. The account holder is an advocate for Black Americans or “Foundational Black Americans,” excluding black immigrants. RELATED: Migrants Admitted to U.S. Under Biden-Harris CBP One App Without Any Asylum Questions Video Source: Randy Clark / Breitbart Texas Trump has cited the economic impact of migration to win blacks for months. “The fact is that his big kill on the black people is that millions of [migrant] people that he’s allowed to come in through the border, they’re taking black jobs now,” Trump said in June 2024, adding: [It] could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people, they’re taking black jobs, and they’re taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history. There is much academic research and many polls that show the post-1970 wave of migration has hammered Americans at the low end of the economic chain, especially black Americans. The resulting blue-collar opposition is especially sharp in cities , such as Chicago where the local Democratic leaders are heavily subsidizing the inflow of migrants, many of whom are eager to work at low wages and grateful to Latino leaders in the Democratic Party. The evidence of harm includes comments from Harris’ father, Donald J. Harris, the Jamaican-born immigrant who wrote a 1988 report for the left-wing Joint Center for Political Studies that said: The key to a stronger and more competitive U.S. economy and an improved economic position for blacks, therefore, is policies and programs that increase the productivity of black workers … However,the current immigration policy, which alllows relatively large number sof low-skilled workers to enter the United State, should be supplemented with a set of policies that reduce the burden that this immigration places on lo-eskilled, native-born workers. At the same time that the trends in international trade have moved against U.S. workers, U.S. immigration laws have been modified in ways that increase the influx of low-skilled workers , who compete with native-born youths and low-skilled adult workers for low-skilled jobs … This shift has been a particularly serious problem for blacks , who constitute a high proportion of the low-skilled adult workers [emphasis added]. Since 1988, the federal government has dramatically expanded the inflow of legal and illegal migrants — and the Joint Center has embraced progressive-style support for wage-cutting illegal migrants . The support also boosts the bipartisan economic strategy of Extraction Migration which inflates the U.S. consumer economy with foreign workers, consumers, and renters."

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, would rise 0.3 percent. Estimates ranged from no change to an increase of 0.8 percent. Signs of the economy’s resilience likely will not discourage the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again next month, but will cement expectations for a smaller 25-basis-point reduction in borrowing costs. ADVERTISEMENT The US central bank embarked last month on its easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point cut in its policy rate, lowering it to the 4.75 percent -5.00 percent range, amid growing concerns about the labour market. The Fed hiked rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to curb inflation. Spending and the overall economy are being underpinned by solid income growth, ample savings as well as strong household balance sheets. Though labour market momentum has slowed, layoffs remain historically low, supporting wage gains. “As we have long argued, consumer spending, net hiring, and payroll income have been locked in a resilient and self-reinforcing virtuous cycle throughout this expansion, supercharged by gains in household wealth and labour supply,” said Jonathan Millar, senior US economist at Barclays. “Durable deterioration in consumer spending would require something to meaningfully undermine this cycle, such as increased precaution by consumers that lifts the saving rate or reluctance to hire by businesses, despite solid demand.” Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.7 percent last month after an unrevised 0.3 percent rise in August.

As of the 10/11/24 close, the S&P 500 was up 21.9% for 2024. Capital appreciation for the Nasdaq was 22.2%, meaning the growth index was back on top after lagging the blue-chip index for most of 2024. On a total-return basis (with reinvested dividends), the S&P 500 was up 23.2% versus a 22.9% gain for the Nasdaq. The presidential election appears to be a dead heat, based on polls from across the political spectrum. Wall Street likes gridlock in Washington, but the market will not be happy if a race that is too close to call in October is also undecided after election night. As well, the Fed may be readying a rate cut just after voting finishes. Market Outlook for 2024 In 2023, the stock market broke out of its 2022 funk on the perception that inflation was in retreat, the Fed would complete its rate-hiking campaign, and the supply chain would get back to its own 'new normal.' All of those things happened more or less, and the market rallied as anticipated. The outlook for 2024 was less clear, with inflation and high interest rates causing uncertainty about GDP growth, the jobs economy, corporate earnings, and the timing of any Fed pivot to a new rate-cutting cycle. Inflation concerns were preeminent for the stock market in 2023, but have faded as 2024 has progressed. The new concern is that jobs growth could weaken further (or even turn negative), pushing the economy into a slow- or no-growth phase. Nine months into the year, the stock market had again reached all-time highs, with GDP and corporate earnings accelerating, the jobs economy cooling but still solid, and (perhaps most important)the Fed clearly shifting to accommodative monetary policy. Corporate earnings in 2024 have rebounded from 2023, which was a year of negative EPS comparisons. While equity valuations appear attractive, stocks will seem pricey if earnings fail to grow as anticipated. The major geopolitical event of 2023 -- the war between Israel and Hamas -- has continued into 2024 and is dangerously broadening into Lebanon and Iran. Economic activity in China, the world's second-largest economy, has been tepid. The government in September 2024 launched an ambitious fiscal stimulus program to spur economic recovery. Notwithstanding these and other challenges, the global macro-environment appears moderately positive for U.S. stocks. Measures of the commercial and industrial economy (including PMIs, durable goods orders, industrial production, and small-business confidence) have moderated from high readings in the pandemic-recovery phase, while remaining at levels consistent with low-level growth. The outlook for the consumer economy is mixed. Rising wages and full unemployment are not sufficient to fully offset still-high prices and still-high interest rates. Weariness with inflation and high financing rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence, which recently hit a three-year low. The consumer outlook should begin to brighten as inflation slows and lower rates spur home and vehicle purchases. We expect the U.S. economy to continue expanding in 2024, remaining on a narrow growth path in line with subdued population growth and higher productivity. Following (revised) 2.9% GDP growth in 2023, Argus is modeling 2.1% GDP growth for 2024. Our forecast for 2025 is also in the 2.0% range. The Fed is now ahead of the inflation curve, in our view. The federal funds rate was 4.75%-5.0% as of September 30, 2024, while the core PCE Inflation Index was up 2.7% on an annual basis. With the FF/PCE gap now around the target range of 250 basis points, the Fed may feel increasing confidence in its ability to continue reducing rates. We look for the dollar to continue to ease in 2024 from the cycle-high levels set in 2022, particularly now that interest rates have started to come down. The greenback increased 2% in 2023, yet remains below the 2002 cycle high and generally has been trending lower since October 2023. Energy prices have been volatile: rising in fall 2023, declining in winter 2024, rising again in spring 2024 before falling in 3Q24 and again recently. The yield curve, which was inverted from March 2022 through mid-September 2024, is now normally sloped.

Ideally, we would begin shifting from creating artificial demand through incessant advertising and from built-in obsolescence to more durable and repairable products and more thoughtful purchasing. Research shows that spending more time in nature, and doing more educational, artistic, social, and spiritual activities leads to more well-being and happiness. In the near term, we need to cut back on carbon emissions and resource intensity connected with our consumerism. Ninety percent of the world’s goods are transported by sea, using mostly diesel fuel. Shipping constitutes 3 percent of all global emissions. In Santa Barbara County, shipping through the channel is the biggest contributor to local air pollution. Interest is growing, however, to change our shipping systems. The United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) began this year to grade each ship on cargo carrying capacity and carbon dioxide emissions per nautical mile. The worst rated will be required to take corrective action or forced to cease operation. The IMO’s goal is zero emissions by 2050. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System is requiring shippers to start paying for their carbon emissions starting next year. For more than a decade, some cargo and tanker ships have been experimenting with wind-assisted propulsion as a means of reducing fuel consumption. Of the 30-plus ships piloting such technologies, most are using some form of movable wind wings made from metal and fiberglass. The articulations are fully automated. The concepts have been mostly adopted from high-tech racing boats. A French startup is shifting the paradigm even more. It is presenting a solution that is both novel and based on centuries-old technology. It has built a totally wind-powered cargo ship that has just completed its first transatlantic voyage. Because of recent advances in meteorological modeling, satellite communications, and routing technologies, it can harness winds for reliable propulsion and commercial viability. By using carbon-fiber masts (both lighter and stronger), it can double the area of sails, capture more wind, and significantly increase propulsion. It doesn’t need a team of sailors to manage the rigging; instead, a single remote controller deploys its 30,000 square feet of sail. The company has already built a second ship and has orders for six more. At present, the container capacity is only about a twentieth of large cargo ships. It will undoubtedly increase as have electrical wind turbines. Rates are slightly higher, but those who are shipping are often willing to pay a little more to reduce their carbon footprint. Moreover, wind-powered shippers can offer long-term, fixed-price contracts, thus avoiding the wild price fluctuations of fossil-fuel shipping. It has been more than a century since the last transoceanic cargo shipping powered by wind. It seems possible, however, that wind power may be the future of marine shipping.

The huge and disruptive inflow of migrants, however, will only raise annual economic growth by one cent for every $10, says the report by the business-funded Brookings Institution. “We expect net immigration to be significantly higher under a Harris administration than a second Trump administration,” the report says it describes four alternative scenarios: Net migration in the Harris, high scenario is 3.7 million in 2025 and cumulates to 12.3 million from 2025–2028. … Unlike the other scenarios, the Trump, low scenario yields net negative migration. Net migration is around -740,000 in 2025 and -230,000 in 2026 … Cumulative net migration over the four years is around 410,000. A 2025 inflow of 3.7 million legal, illegal, quasi-legal, and temporary migrants would deliver one migrant for every American birth. So far, the Harris campaign has signaled she will continue the high-migration policies set by Biden. Overall, the report says Harris’s high migration policies would grow the U.S. population by 15 million during her four years, or roughly three million new households. But Trump’s low migration policies would grow the population by almost five million via the rules set for legal migration by Congress in 1990, says the report. The report claims Trump’s focus on Americans will contract the economy by four cents in every $10 during 2025. The report does not mention the expected rise in ordinary Americans’ salaries and wages in a national labor market. Nor does it mention the pro-family, pro-birthrate impact as housing drops in price once migrants exit. It also ignores the likely civic gains from reduced diversity in the United States, the reduced damage to migrant-sending countries , and the reduced migration chaos and deaths south of the border. The damage to foreigners was outlined by The Atlantic — a pro-migration website — when it described the many migrant deaths in the Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama: The morgue is next to the hospital kitchen. [Panamanian doctor Luis Antonio] Moreno said the stench was often intolerable, even before the day this spring when he discovered that the air conditioner had gone out and the bodies inside were decomposing. In March 2023, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has a program to help families track down loved ones who have gone missing while migrating, built a mausoleum in the local cemetery with space for hundreds of bodies, and it’s quickly filling. At a recent burial ceremony, municipal workers wearing hazmat suits placed 12 white body bags into graves. Ten of the bags were labeled desconocido , or “unknown.” One bore the name of a man from Venezuela whose family had confirmed his identity. Just before the last body bag, which was also the smallest, went into the mausoleum, an ICRC worker opened it and placed a dog tag on the wrist of the 8-month-old Haitian girl inside. Instead, the Brookings report focuses on macroeconomics. Without more migration in 2025, “The result would be that investment and hiring would fall more than otherwise after a drop in consumer demand,” the Brookings report said. Also, Because immigrants who come to the U.S. between 2025 and 2034 would require equipment and infrastructure to effectively do their jobs, we expect … Investors would receive greater capital income as a result. The report downplays the likely business reforms that would be triggered by Trump’s reduced inflow of migrants. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Larry Fink, the founder of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment company, said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China , and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Companies and politicians will also be pressured to find and train the roughly five million “prime age” American men who have been sidelined by the easy-migration policies since at least 2000. People say, “Well, Americans won’t do those [low-status, low-wage] jobs.” Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, told a surprised New York Times journalist, adding: [But] Americans won’t do those jobs for below-the-table wages. They won’t do those jobs for non-living wages … they will just do those jobs at certain wages. Think about the perspective of an American company. I want them to go searching in their own country for their own [sidelined] citizens, sometimes people who may be struggling with addiction or trauma, get them re-engaged in American society. We cannot have an entire American business community that is giving up on American workers and then importing millions of illegal laborers. Trump’s reform would also help American families buy homes. For example, Harris has promised to spend $40 billion to help the real estate industry build three million homes during her first term. But her likely inflow of 12.3 million migrants would likely fill up those homes, leaving American families back at Square One. Trump’s low-migration reforms would also be good for white-collar Americans. UnderMayorkas’s rules, C-suite executives are allowed to import huge numbers of disposable, compliant, and cheap visa worker s — such as H-1B workers — for the white-collar jobs needed by U.S. graduates. If Trump reduces the inflow of foreign graduates, the executives would be forced to share profits and workplace power with free-speaking American professionals. Trump’s cutbacks would reverse the federal government’s post-1990 economic strategy of Extraction Migration , which seeks to grow the U.S. consumer economy for investors by pulling human resources — disposable workers, government-funded consumers, and apartment-sharing renters — from poor countries. That investor-first policy is strongly backed by President Joe Biden’s Cuban-born, pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. He repeatedly describes himself as a moral champion for migrants because of his migrant parents , his sympathy for migrants , and his support for “equity” between Americans and foreigners . But Breitbart News covers the sexual trafficking and labor abuse of children and youths enabled by Mayorkas. Breitbart News also covers the thousands of migrant deaths and massive foreign destruction encouraged by Mayrokas and his Extraction Migration economic strategy."

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Oct 15, 2024, 07:00am EDT Share Save Rusty Wiley is CEO of Datasite, a leading SaaS platform used by enterprises globally to execute complex, strategic projects. getty Upward movement on sell-side deal flow in the first half of 2024, compared to the year before, indicates good times are ahead for the M&A market. A core segment of the M&A market spurring this optimism is the consumer sector. Consumer deal kickoffs on Datasite, which annually facilitates nearly 15,000 new deals, shot up 17% globally in the first half of this year. Because these are deals at their inception, rather than announced, it demonstrates a positive pipeline of activity. In the second half of 2024 and the opening months of 2025, there's likely to be an uptick in consumer M&A deals closing and being announced. So why is the consumer M&A market taking off? The Consumer Market Battles Historic Disruption More aptly, perhaps, the consumer M&A market is bouncing back from major disruption caused by the global pandemic. The fallout from the pandemic has had a lasting impact on both consumer spending and consumer preferences. The easing of lockdown measures triggered a surge in spending activities in many consumer subsectors. For example, in the U.S., nominal retail sales grew by approximately 40% from late 2022 through mid-2023. Yet, although the spending rebound did help buoy the economy, it was also one of the contributing factors to high inflation. With prices increasing, central banks have been implementing successive interest rate hikes . Consequently, consumer confidence in the U.K. dropped significantly in the second quarter of 2022. The drop-off in consumer spending then influenced the decline in appetite and volume of completed deals. For example, there was a 34% decrease in U.S. consumer M&A in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period the year prior. Successive interest rate hikes in the U.S. and the U.K. are beginning to curb inflation, as high rates help reduce consumer spending and encourage saving. For consumers with high levels of debt, increased interest payments also limit their spending power. Now, the reverse is happening. Consumer confidence reached its highest level in July 2024 , and although it dropped slightly in August, it’s still three points higher than the number recorded in August 2023. The Factors Fueling The Consumer M&A Bounceback There are three primary factors that have triggered a bounceback in positive consumer sentiment, which in turn is impacting M&A activities. At a macroeconomic level, annual inflation in the U.S. has dropped from 7% in 2021 to around 3% in 2024, and the Fed has responded with a recent rate cut . This could unlock new levels of consumer purchasing power, although that will have to be managed closely, as a spike in consumer spending could lead to an increase in inflation. The consumer sector is also experiencing a significant transformation as brands adapt to new trends and shifting sentiments. The rise of the environmentally conscious consumer means that the sustainable production and distribution of products and services is an important consideration in consumer purchasing decisions. It opens new opportunities for consumer brands and in some instances, has required a complete rethink of supply chains and brand identity. Additionally, from a demographic perspective, the traditional profile of a consumer is changing. The rise of a young middle class in emerging markets in places like Asia and the Middle East means this demographic is playing a greater role in global consumption patterns. This younger generation’s spending power is expected to reach an estimated $12 trillion by 2030. Technological innovation is also transforming how commerce is conducted. The process of buying and selling products online through e-commerce platforms is fast becoming the preferred method of shopping for consumers. The global e-commerce market is expected to grow from $6.3 trillion in 2024 to approximately $7.9 trillion by 2027. Furthermore, the integration of AI by retailers helps reduce operating costs and increase productivity while providing a better customer experience. AI is still in its exploratory stage but I expect it to increase in application across the consumer sector in the coming years. Dealmakers Are Stoking Pipelines For consumer brands, M&A can be an effective way of responding to new trends, particularly consumer spending habits and preferences. Additionally, M&A can be deployed as a means for consumer businesses to enter new regions, diversify their products and enhance the customer experience through the latest technological innovations. Still, global financial markets remain volatile. Although consumer sentiment is positive and inflation seems under control, there's still a need for businesses and dealmakers to act with caution. There are many unknown factors to contend with, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November, which can impact consumer spending and M&A deals in the sector. Yet, the rise in consumer deal kickoffs on Datasite means dealmakers are optimistic about the sector. Should this continue, I expect to see an increase in consumer M&A deal closes in the coming 12 months.

The CBA spending index fell by 0.7% in September, following a gain in August of 1.6%. CBA's chief economist Stephen Halmarick said the results are consistent with the bank's expectation that the necessary conditions will be in place for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lower interest rates by the end of the year. ""We remain of the view that softer economic data, a further deceleration in inflation and the easing of monetary policy by many other major central banks will see the RBA begin to cut interest rates later in 2024, with our base case now for a December rate cut,"" he added. The data supports the view that gains to household income from the income tax cuts delivered at the start of July have not led to a material rise in consumer spending, he said. The RBA has yet to cut interest rates, proving itself a laggard among its global peers, most of which have are now lowering interest rates aggressively, citing the fact that inflation has come back under control. The RBA remains cautious due to concerns that core inflation remains too high. It also harboured fears that the income tax cuts would fuel a resurgence in spending, ""Our analysis indicates that the increase in take-home pay has largely been used to repay debt,"" Halmarick said. Six of the 12 spending categories fell in September, led lower by sectors clearly related to Father's Day activities, with hospitality down 2.8% on-month following 4.3% rise in August, the data showed. Spending on household goods, food and beverage goods and transport all fell in September, according to the report derived from CBA's internal transactions data. Renters had the weakest spending growth, with spending by those with a mortgages only a little higher. Those who have paid off their mortgages posted even stronger growth, the data showed.

The AUD/USD weekly forecast shows a bearish tilt amid strong dollar as US data diminishes hopes for a Fed’s rate cut in November. Ups and downs of AUD/USD The Aussie had a bearish week with no major economic reports from Australia. Meanwhile, the US released several key reports that increased the likelihood of a pause during the November Fed meeting. – Are you interested to learn more about ECN brokers ? Check our detailed guide- The US CPI number came in higher than expected, showing increased price pressure. Although it eased rate cut bets, policymakers are convinced inflation will reach the 2% target. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation missed forecasts, weakening the dollar. Another report showed a higher-than-expected number of jobless claims, indicating weakness in the labor market. Market participants also reviewed the FOMC meeting minutes, which showed a strong dovish stance before September’s robust employment figures. Next week’s key events for AUD/USD Next week, Australia will release employment figures that might impact the RBA’s policy outlook. Australia’s labor market has shown resilience in the past, leading to a hawkish tone from RBA policymakers. In the last report, there were 47,500 jobs, with the unemployment rate at 4.2%. This month’s report might show continued resilience or signs of a cooling labor market. A robust report would boost the Aussie by pushing back the timing for the first rate cut. On the other hand, if there are signs of weakness, market participants will increase bets for a cut in December. Get FREE Forex Signals Now!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Michael writes on high income assets that help people retire early. Follow Author Oct 12, 2024, 07:00am EDT Share Save Comment Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept getty Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT) . It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: They mean lower borrowing costs for investors, allowing them to invest on margin more than they would otherwise. Small cap stocks, which tend to entail more risk than large caps, attract these more-aggressive buyers. They help companies spend more on expansion. This tends to benefit smaller firms more than bigger ones, as smaller companies tend to be more innovative. With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag Ycharts MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) , in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. Lower Rates Boost Spending (But Only at Certain Times) It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher Federal Reserve As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates Federal Reserve As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY Ycharts In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings iShares.com There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one ), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This Small Cap CEF Looks Cheap, but It Could Get Cheaper This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider , in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price Ycharts RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return , which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV Ycharts RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook .

As earnings season kicks off, stocks are on a roll. The benchmark S&P 500 is set to post its fifth straight weekly gain and is hovering near a fresh record high after rising over 21% this year. Driving the gains is a string of encouraging economic data that have all but dispelled the slowdown fears that rocked markets over the summer. Among these was a blowout jobs report earlier this month, the latest sign that the economy is maintaining solid growth as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates - a historically potent combination for stock market gains . ""For the most part, the majority of the economic data stream has been positive,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. ""Hopefully that gets confirmation with some of the more consumer-facing companies that are reporting next week."" Earnings from American Express, Netflix, United Airlines, Procter & Gamble and several major banks will give a broad view of consumer spending , which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Retail sales data is expected on Oct. 17. Live Events Shares of JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo jumped as earnings season got into gear on Friday, after both lenders surpassed estimates. Expectations have firmed that the economy will avoid a downturn despite a long period of elevated interest rates. Goldman Sachs , for example, lowered the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months by five percentage points to 15% following the employment data. Robust data has supported that view. In addition to jobs, reports on consumer prices and the services sector suggest that fears of a rapidly weakening economy - prompted by disappointing labor market reports in August and September - were overblown. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which measures how economic data stacks up versus expectations, turned positive this month after being negative since the start of May. Still, the consumer-spending environment has grown ""murkier"" following layoffs at financial services and technology companies in recent months, back-to-back hurricanes in the Southeast and a brief dockworkers strike, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, raising the stakes for data and company reports to provide clarity. More insight will come from additional banks reporting in the coming days, including Bank of America and Citigroup on Tuesday. American Express' results will offer a read on more high-end consumer spending, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the other end of the income spectrum, investors said they were focusing on how less affluent consumers were grappling with the rise in prices over the past few years. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Milwaukee, said he will be scrutinizing Netflix's results - specifically whether the streaming service is adding or losing customers and at what pace - for insight into how lower-income consumers are reprioritizing spending. Companies will need to top expectations for profit growth in their quarterly reports in order to support the stock market's valuation, which stands well above its historical average. Among the small number of companies that have already reported, 79% have topped estimates, in line with the pace of the past four quarters, LSEG IBES data on Friday showed. More than 150 S&P 500 companies are expected to report results over the next two weeks. Third-quarter results should confirm that large-cap corporate profit growth remains solid, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note on Friday. ""Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans.""

SPOTLIGHT ON UNITED United Airlines delivers its latest quarterly report card Tuesday. Wall Street predicts that United will report lower earnings for the July-September quarter than a year earlier, but higher revenue. The airline’s profit surged 23% in the second quarter, as record crowds at U.S. airports helped the carrier overcome sharply rising costs for fuel and labor. In July, United warned that its third-quarter results would miss Wall Street’s expectation, citing a glut of U.S. flights that led to airlines cutting prices to fill seats. TRACKING RETAIL SALES The Commerce Department releases its monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales Thursday. Retail sales ticked up 0.1% from July to August, after jumping the most in a year and a half the previous month. Online retailers, sporting goods stores, and home and garden stores all reported higher sales. Economists project that retail sales rose 0.5% in September.

Bloomberg Published 11 Oct 2024, 10:15 PM IST US Consumer Spending Is Increasingly Driven by Richer Households (Bloomberg) -- The consumers powering US economic growth are increasingly those who are higher up the income ladder, and likely enjoying a wealth effect from asset-price gains, according to research by Federal Reserve economists. In the two pre-pandemic years, average household consumption was growing at a similar pace across all income groups, the new Fed study of retail spending shows. But since then, spending patterns have diverged sharply. In the initial Covid period through mid-2021, low-income households increased spending faster than others with the help of public stimulus programs. But their consumption fell back after the last pandemic checks went out, while middle- and especially higher-income Americans have powered ahead. Overall, since the start of 2018, high-earning households raised spending more than twice as much as the low-income group. The findings cast new light on the robust US consumer demand over the last couple of years, which has surprised analysts and kept the economy growing at a faster pace than many had expected. The Fed researchers find that Americans across income groups are able to spend more than they did six years ago. But they conclude that recent consumer resilience has been “driven by middle- and high-income households,” while lower earners pulled back and “only recently recovered to their mid-2021 levels of real average retail spending.” The data in the Fed paper is adjusted for inflation. One possible driver of the divergence is that higher-income households are enjoying a “wealth effect” from gains in housing and stock markets, and also “receive more interest and investment income during periods of higher interest rates, all providing a stimulus for sustained level of spending,” the Fed economists Sinem Hacioglu Hoke, Leo Feler, and Jack Chylak write. The Fed’s bottom-up study of retail spending is based on numbers provided by consumer data company Numerator, which collects receipts from a panel of 150,000 representative US households. The Fed researchers say that this dataset on household spending is overall a good match for the retail sales figures that come from businesses, boosting confidence in the distributional breakdown. Analyzing the numbers by demographic segments, the researchers find that retail spending has been stronger among more educated workers — and again they find a divergence from the pre-pandemic years when the growth was more evenly distributed. By housing status, the data show that renters, who tend to be lower-income, experienced the largest increase in retail spending at the onset of the pandemic, but now show the smallest overall gains since 2018. Longer-term homeowners who had the opportunity to lock-in low fixed-rate mortgages in 2020 and 2021 have more disposable income to sustain higher spending on goods and food services. But the study finds that Americans who bought property since 2022 — likely paying a premium and taking on a higher debt-to-income ratio — are not sharing in the overall spending growth. “Real retail spending for these recent-owner households has been declining since mid-2022 to the present, which corresponds to the time when they purchased their homes,” the Fed economists wrote.

American Express' results will offer a read on more high-end consumer spending, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the other end of the income spectrum, investors said they were focusing on how less affluent consumers were grappling with the rise in prices over the past few years. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Milwaukee, said he will be scrutinizing Netflix's results – specifically whether the streaming service is adding or losing customers and at what pace - for insight into how lower-income consumers are reprioritizing spending. Companies will need to top expectations for profit growth in their quarterly reports in order to support the stock market's valuation, which stands well above its historical average. Among the small number of companies that have already reported, 79% have topped estimates, in line with the pace of the past four quarters, LSEG IBES data on Friday showed. More than 150 S&P 500 companies are expected to report results over the next two weeks. Third-quarter results should confirm that large-cap corporate profit growth remains solid, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note on Friday. ""Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans.""

The 2024 presidential election is less than 30 days away. Neither the Trump-Biden debate nor the Harris-Trump debate had much of a lasting impact on the polls, most of which remain locked within a margin-of-error difference. The race will likely come down to a handful of in-play states. Depending on down-ticket Senate and House races, the winner may or may not have a mandate to enact his or her party's agenda. The stock market is doing much better than it would normally do in a presidential election year. That is because the economy, corporate earnings, and even employment remain hale and hearty. The Fed has started cutting interest rates and is likely to cut again in November, December, or both. GDP at mid-year was running at 3.0%; September nonfarm payrolls surprised to the upside, and the third-quarter earnings season may deliver some of the strongest annual EPS growth in 10 quarters (assuming a 'normal' 5%-7% upside surprise to consensus). All of that will take a back seat amid the intensifying atmosphere leading into Election Day. Environment: Third-Quarter 2024 The U.S. stock market extended first-half 2024 momentum into the third quarter, as the widening in sector breadth continued and even accelerated. After advancing 10.6% on a total-return basis (with dividends) in 1Q24 and 4.1% in 2Q24, the S&P 500 delivered 5.9% total return in 3Q24. The stock market raced through the first quarter but struggled some in the second quarter, particularly in April. The third quarter was more akin to the second quarter than the first, with a mid-July to mid-August selloff and early-September weakness on fears the jobs economy was struggling. Despite those stumbles, 3Q gains were measured across all three months, even though August and September historically are two of the worst market months. The S&P 500 posted gains of 1.1% in July, 2.3% in August, and 2.0% in September. During 3Q24, the Federal Reserve's long-running battle with inflation was superseded by mounting worries about recession. The major event of the quarter was the Fed cutting interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) at the September FOMC meeting, for its first rate cut in over four years. In commentary following the September FOMC meeting, Fed Chair Powel noted that recent indicators suggest economic activity has 'continued to expand at a solid pace.' Inflation continues to make 'progress' toward the committee's 2% target. The committee now judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation targets are 'roughly in balance.' Given these factors, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the fed funds rate by half a percentage point, to 4.75%-5.0%. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, rose 0.1% in August and was up 2.7% year over year. The monthly increase was the lowest since early 2021. The core PCE data confirmed inflation inputs from August CPI reported earlier in September. On an annual basis, the August all-items CPI was up 2.5%, sharply down from 2.9% in July and 3.0% in June. Goods inflation has come off markedly, while inflation in services is still stubbornly high. The index for shelter rose 0.5% month over month in August and was the 'main factor' in the increase in all-items CPI, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Fed's rate cut and better inflation readings are allowing market rates of interest to move down, although we expect rates to remain volatile. The 10-year Treasury yield was 3.75% as of the end of September; the cycle peak for the 10-year yield was the 4.9% level in October 2023. The two-year Treasury yield was 3.55% as of the end of September, down from the peak level of 5.2% as of October 2023. The yield curve is back to normally sloped for the first time in two and a half years. While we have likely seen the end to twos-10s inversion in this cycle, two- and 10-year yields could remain in proximity in the near term. The jobs economy was mixed in the third quarter of 2024, with weak July and August readings followed by surprising strength in September. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000 in September, well above the consensus call of 140,000. Given upward revisions in preceding months, the trailing three-month nonfarm payrolls average was 186,000, near the 12-month average of 203,000. The unemployment rate ticked down further to 4.1% in September from 4.2% in August 2024 and a multi-year high of 4.3% in July; unemployment was 3.8% a year earlier in August 2023. Average hourly earnings increased 13 cents month to month for August and were 4.0% higher year over year. Annual wage growth continues to run above inflation, but the premium has narrowed. Industrial production in August rose 0.8%, rebounding from a 0.9% decline in July. Capacity utilization grew to 78.0% from 77.4% for July, but remains two percentage points below the long-run average. Purchasing managers across the industrial economy remains cautious. ISM's manufacturing PMI came in at 47.2% for August 2024, up from 46.8% for July 2024 though still in contraction territory (below 50) for the twenty-first time in the past 22 months. ISM's services PMI was at 51.5% in August, up slightly from 51.4% in July. Services PMI slipped into contraction territory in June but has since rebounded; this series has been in positive territory in seven of the eight months reported for 2024 to date. Signals from the consumer economy also remain mixed. Retail sales for August edged higher 0.1% month over month, after a 1.1% surge in July. August retail sales were up 2.1% year over year, down from mid-single-digit annual growth across 2023. Straddling the commercial and consumer economies is housing. Both existing home sales and new home sales as of fall 2024 were running at less than two-thirds of peak pandemic-infused levels from 2020-22. S&P 500 earnings for 2Q24 rose in low-double-digit percentages year over year, marking a fourth consecutive quarter of annual EPS growth. Around 80% of companies exceeded consensus expectations for 2Q24 EPS versus 70%-75% on average. The magnitude of the beat was at the high end of the 5%-8% historical range. Second-quarter 2024 GDP grew 3.0%, nearly double the 1.6% growth rate (revised higher from 1.4%) reported for 1Q24. Personal consumption expenditures for 2Q24 increased 3.0%, while non-residential fixed investment rose Upgrade to begin using premium research reports and get so much more.

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Criteo Supports Retail Media Network Launch For Department Store Belk by Laurie Sullivan , October 8, 2024 Commerce media company Criteo will support the launch of a retail media network for the Charlotte-based, privately owned U.S. department store Belk. The companies announced Tuesday they have joined forces to launch the retailer’s retail media arm, Belk Media Network. Belk serves customers at nearly 300 stores and Belk Outlet locations spanning across 16 Southeastern states. The partnership will provide customers with a personalized multichannel experience ahead of the upcoming holiday shopping season. National brands across the apparel, accessories, beauty and home categories will have the opportunity to increase awareness and sales on Belk's owned-and-operated properties. Retail media will have a compound annual growth rate of 24.1% between 2024 and 2028, according to data from Emarketer. The analyst firm said retail media search will take more than $1 of every $6 spent on digital ads in the U.S. in 2029. advertisement advertisement Access to Criteo's technology and Belk's first-party data will allow brands and agencies to target a unique audience segment of high-earning, predominately women shoppers. Belk will use sponsored products and onsite display, with plans to expand to additional formats in 2025. Belk is the latest company to capitalize on the opportunity by joining Criteo's network of 225 global retailer and marketplace partners, as the category of retail media is expected to skyrocket this year. Criteo's retail monetization platform, Commerce Yield, will support Belk's network, allowing advertisers to optimize data for display and sponsored product ad campaigns. Brands and agencies also can plan, activate, and report on campaigns in real-time and with closed-loop reporting via Criteo's demand-side platform, Commerce Max for an experience that drives performance across the buyer journey. In July, Microsoft Advertising committed more of its resources to retail with a partnership with Criteo, the company said at the time, to ""chart a new path."" The partnership integrates the Microsoft Advertising Network to provide access to Criteo's retail-media supply. Advertisers will have access to retailers with this integration through one point of entry -- Microsoft's ad platform -- to drive performance and growth. Retail media represents 16% of global advertising spend, according to Magna Global's retail media report published May 2024. Using Microsoft Curate, the company said retailers gain the ability to extend and monetize onsite audience with curated deals made available in any demand-side platform (DSP), making it easier for advertisers to buy offsite retail media in the same place as their other digital ad buys. Some believe Microsoft will exit support for retail media. ""Our partnership with Criteo will allow our advertisers to expand their reach to shoppers at the bottom of the funnel by tapping into Criteo’s rich array of retailer supply – all through a single point of entry via Microsoft Advertising Platform,"" a Microsoft Advertising spokesperson told Media Daily News.

European consumer stocks may continue to benefit from China's policy support, which has bolstered consumer spending during the country's National Day Golden Week holiday. European luxury brands such as LVMH, Hermès, Kering, and Richemont have all risen by more than 10% over the past two weeks, following the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) announcement of several stimulus measures. The Golden Week shopping spree is expected to further boost sales for these popular brands among Chinese consumers. On Monday, the Stoxx Europe Luxury 10 Index climbed 1.76%, outperforming broader markets. Kering, among the hardest hit by sluggish Chinese demand, surged over 4%, most likely to have been driven by optimism surrounding China's holiday spending surge. Chinese stock markets reopened on Tuesday following the week-long holiday, with major indices, including the Shanghai Composite and the CSI 300, jumping 8% and 11%, respectively, at the market open before paring gains. Related Von der Leyen's China policy faces moment of truth as EU countries vote on EV tariffs EU navigates China trade dilemma: Defending against imports, courting investment This optimism may spill over into European consumer stocks, particularly in luxury brand-heavy French markets, as the CAC 40 opened higher. However, other European indices, such as the DAX and Euro Stoxx 50, have been trading lower due to risk-off sentiment amid the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. China's holiday spending surge According to Alipay, China's largest payment platform, overseas transactions by Chinese users increased by over 60% during the first four days of the holiday compared with the same period last year, while spending by international travellers surged 120% year-on-year. The week-long holiday, which runs from 1 to 7 October, significantly impacts China's economy and overseas markets, with a substantial rise in holiday consumption. Following trillions of yuan in easing measures, this year's Golden Week could mark a turning point in Chinese consumer spending, following subdued activity over the past two years due to Covid restrictions and housing market challenges. Additionally, Trip.com reported that long-haul flights exceeded pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019 on the first day of the holiday period. The top outbound destinations were Asian countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, and Singapore, where Chinese travellers frequently shop for European luxury items like handbags, clothing, and accessories. The travel website also highlighted that the most popular European destinations were the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, and Italy, with multi-destination itineraries making up 30% of Chinese travellers' plans, with stays lasting between 10 and 14 days. European cities such as Granada and Seville saw bookings surge by 260% and 144%, respectively. China Central Television also reported a 50% increase in homebuyer visits during the holiday, indicating that China's easing policies are having an immediate effect on consumer confidence. European luxury sector as safe haven amid geopolitical tensions Amid escalating conflicts in the Middle East, the European luxury sector could serve as a safe haven for investors due to its significant exposure to China. Chinese stock markets have outperformed global markets in the past two weeks, as the Chinese government introduced policies such as cutting key lending rates and injecting cash into stock markets to boost consumer spending and the property sector. Major Chinese indices, including the China A50 and the Hang Seng Index, have soared by more than 30% month-on-month. This rally contrasts with the geopolitical tension-led market retreats in the US and Europe, which has provided additional bullish momentum for European consumer stocks.

The British Retail Consortium said spending in shops increased by 2.0% in annual terms in September, the strongest uptick since March when it increased by 3.5% although less of a rise than the 2.7% recorded in September 2023. Reeves took office in July following the Labour government's landslide election win and is set to deliver her first annual budget on Oct. 30. She has warned some taxes will increase, although she has ruled out increases to the rates of income tax and National Insurance social security payments. ""With energy prices having again risen, all eyes now turn to the budget and what impact that will have on household discretionary spending in the final quarter of the year,"" said Linda Ellett, UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at accountants KPMG, who sponsor the data. Regulated energy tariffs rose by 10% on Oct. 1, increasing the typical annual bill to 1,717 pounds ($2,244) A separate survey from Barclays, also published on Tuesday, showed spending on its credit and debit cards rose by 1.2% year-on-year in September, the biggest increase since April after a rise of 1.0% in August. However in real terms this represented a fall as British consumer price inflation held at 2.2% in September, slightly above the Bank's 2% target. Official retail sales data for August showed a 2.2% rise in retail sales in cash terms, and a bigger-than-expected 1.0% volume increase. Barclays said spending on discretionary items last month rose by the most since June, with entertainment jumping by 14.4% - the biggest increase since July 2023 when U.S. singer-songwriter Taylor Swift opened sales for the British leg of her concert tour. Barclays attributed last month's jump in entertainment spending to the opening of ticket sales for concerts by British rock band Oasis, who are reuniting after a 15-year split. In contrast, spending on essential items declined by the greatest amount since April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within that, spending on groceries fell for the first time since June.

This expansion is driven by growing consumer demand, availability of land and a lack of quality retail developments in these markets until a few years back. Developers are capitalizing on these opportunities to meet the evolving needs of these emerging urban centers. It is interesting to note that the upcoming mall supply in these cities will be of a significant scale, with a projected average gross leasable area of approximately 375,000 sq ft. Notably, four of these mall projects are particularly large-sized, each having a gross leasable area 1 million square feet. Most of these urban centers are situated in state capitals or similar large cities with significant potential, serving a broader consumer base that includes many smaller satellite towns. This expansive reach offers developers the opportunity to create mid-scale and large-scale malls, significantly enhancing tenant mix and shopper experience. “North India dominates the upcoming retail supply in Tier II and III cities, accounting for 44% of the total. Ludhiana, Jaipur, and Lucknow are the key cities driving this growth. In this region, a diverse mix of established and emerging regional developers are driving supply. This is followed by Southern India with a share of 30% with cities such as Coimbatore, Mallapuram, Thrissur and Trivandrum leading the supply. The eastern region will see a significant supply of 4.5 million sq ft, primarily led by Guwahati. In West India, major developers are coming up with large-scale, high-quality retail projects in cities such as Goa, Surat, and Ahmedabad,"" said Dr Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research and REIS, India, JLL.

Retailer confidence in these cities has grown due to the influx of high-quality supply from established developers. Premium and bridge-to-luxury brands are also venturing into these cities, driven by rising consumer aspirations and new opportunities for store openings. Developers are also acquiring land parcels in strategic locations in these emerging cities to construct retail projects. “In recent years, leading real estate developers have acquired land parcels in Tier II and III cities for retail development projects. Driven by growing consumer demand established developers have acquired land in these emerging cities.” said Rahul Arora, Head - Retail Services & Office Leasing Advisory, Senior Managing Director (Karnataka, Kerala) India, JLL. In some cases, the developers are planning to develop mixed-use developments which will include retail, F&B, offices and hospitality as part of the developments.

While prime metro cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru emain the focus of retail real estate investment, a substantial portion of institutionally held assets are now also located in emerging urban centers across India. The retail real estate landscape is ever evolving, with over 30% of institutionally held retail assets (approx. 9.12 million sq. ft) now located across 12 Tier II and Tier III cities. These cities include Ahmedabad, Surat, Indore and Nagpur in the West and Bhubaneswar in the East."

As a result, the prospects for dynamic growth in private consumption remain bleak for the remainder of 2024. The cautious approach of consumers is contributing to the negative sentiment within the retail sector. Retail Outlook for 2024 Given the current economic climate and concerns over policy direction, Germany's retail sector is likely to face continued challenges. The slowdown in consumer spending is expected to hinder growth, resulting in a subdued retail outlook for the rest of 2024."

https://news.ufl.edu/2021/02/temporary-termination-framework-/,,temporary termination framework - News | University of Florida,20241004T163000Z,https://news.ufl.edu/media/newsufledu/images/2021/02/Unemployment-STORY-JD-A-resize.jpg,news.ufl.edu,English,United States,XLY,Consumer Discretionary,consumer economy,"A federal layoff law proposal inspired by COVID times The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed pressure points in the U.S. unemployment system as millions of Americans have lost their jobs with no guarantee of reemployment while facing a gap in income as they access overburdened state unemployment systems. Rachel Arnow-Richman, the Gerald A. Rosenthal Chair in Labor & Employment Law at UF's Levin College of Law, proposes a different way to approach situations like this as well as ordinary economic downturns in her article, ""Temporary Termination: A Layoff Law Blueprint for the COVID Era."" The article, to be published in the Washington University Journal of Law & Policy, proposes a federal layoff law requiring universal severance pay and creating a temporary termination status modeled in part on Canadian law. ""One obvious mechanism for addressing the needs of workers in layoffs is bolstering unemployment insurance, but a second mechanism is enhancing employment rights,"" Arnow-Richman said. ""Currently, employers have many obligations to their employees while they are on the job, but when the employee is laid off for economic reasons, we don't have a set of rules that regulate the employer. We instead have a social safety net that helps people who can't find new jobs."" Her proposed layoff law looks to laws in other countries that require employers to pay severance to workers, which ensures basic continuity of income. Adopting such a measure in the U.S. would ease the strain on unemployment networks and ensure that laid off workers are still able to participate in the consumer economy. The model has exceptions for emergency and temporary situations like the sudden economic downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic. If a company has to let workers go to adjust to a short-term economic fluctuation, this temporary termination exception would suspend the severance pay obligation. Instead it would create a more streamlined channel to unemployment benefits separate from those who are permanently laid off, and build in an incentive for employers to return workers to their jobs. If the company finds itself unable to rehire past employees, then Arnow-Richman suggests the company would have to pay its deferred severance obligation. Employers may need help meeting these obligations in emergency situations like the current pandemic, which could come from federal loans or tax credits. Together, these measures protect workers from having a gap in income that could cause them to fall behind on their bills. U.S. law does not currently grant workers a federal right to severance pay and only a limited right to advanced notice. On the federal level, the only law regarding advanced notice is the Worker Adjustment & Retraining Notification (WARN) Act that requires advanced notice of termination from employers who have more than 100 employees under specific layoff scenarios primarily to protect towns whose entire local economies are dependent on that company's presence. A federal layoff law would provide an immediate continuity of pay to all laid-off workers and build a system that protects workers even outside of the pandemic-induced economic downturn. ""Currently there is no meaningful set of laws that set any minimum obligations for layoff. It’s left up to the employer, so the results are unequal, with some employers giving generous termination benefits while others give none,"" Arnow-Richman said. ""People do different work for different companies, but everyone should have the same employment rights."" Emily Cardinali / February 2, 2021"

The Labor Department said Friday that businesses added 254,000 jobs last month, beating economists’ expectations and breaking a cold streak for the job market over the last several months. Unemployment also ticked downward to 4.1% from 4.2% last month. Improving labor conditions are a welcome sign to the Fed, which moved forward with a more aggressive half-percent cut to its benchmark interest rate after signs the market was cooling. The central bank is hoping to nail a “soft landing” where inflation returns to 2% year-over-year without sending the economy into a tailspin under the weight of higher interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell said last month that the central bank wanted to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses to help bolster the employment situation.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) Some economists thought this month’s jobs report will receive greater emphasis from the Fed before their meeting in early November, where governors will make another decision on interest rates. Another jobs report will be released in October but the data is likely to be skewed by Hurricane Helene’s destruction across the South and a labor strike at Boeing, making it harder for the central bank to make big takeaways from the employment situation overall. ""While Fed policymakers appear on track for a 25 (basis point) rate cut in November, any notable weakening in underlying payroll growth, hours worked, or the unemployment rate next month could still tip the scale in favor of another 50bps rate cut by data-dependent Fed policymakers,"" said EY chief economist Gregory Daco. Gains in job openings were widespread throughout the economy. Employment in food services and drinking places grew by 69,000 last month, health care added 45,000 jobs and construction continued an upward trend with a boost of 25,000 jobs. Friday’s report comes on top of other promising move for workers this week after another report found the number of openings rose slightly in August to 8 million, which was the first increase since May. The White House framed the report as a win for Americans in a consistently improving economy under the Biden administration. “Certainly this is good news for American workers, American families, American communities all across the country. And this is the kind of report that quite frankly, we continue to look for, showing that strong, stable, steady job gains,"" said Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Hourly earnings for workers also improved last month, helping bolster purchasing power as prices still remain significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic despite moderating levels of inflation. Average hourly wages grew 4% compared to last year and 0.4% from August, which also beat economists’ expectations. Altogether, the U.S. economy appears to be on solid footing with continued growth, solid consumer spending and a job market that is keeping people employed with opportunities to seek higher wages. Gross domestic product grew at a strong 3% pace in the second quarter, running from April to June, thanks to consumer spending and investments made by businesses. That was a marked improvement from 1.6% growth in the first quarter. Improvements to the employment situation could help turn around lackluster consumer confidence , which had its biggest month-to-month decline since 2021 in the Conference Board’s most recent release a couple weeks ago. Its consumer confidence index fell in September due to concerns about a softening labor market but could improve moving forward after the announcement of an interest rate cut and stronger jobs figures.

Huh) Consumer spending accounts for some 70% of U.S. economic activity and is closely watched by economists and the Fed to help gauge how Americans are feeling. Big declines in spending would lead to economic declines, which the Fed is hoping to avoid by loosening interest rates. Lower interest rates make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money for things like credit cards and auto loans, which helps bolster economic activity. The boost to the labor market could also be helpful for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, helping boost voters’ perceptions of the economy through stable employment and higher wages.

A prominent example includes California's recent move, Senate Bill 553, the Workplace Violence Prevention Act, which made California the first state with a dedicated workplace violence prevention law. The New York Retail Worker Safety Act is among the first comprehensive state efforts to tackle the growing issue of workplace violence in the retail industry. Key provisions So, what exactly do the new rules for retail stores include? Workplace violence prevention policy Retail companies must implement a workplace violence prevention policy within 180 days of the law being signed, making the deadline March 3, 2025. The New York State Department of Labor (NY DOL) will provide a model policy and training program that employers can use or adapt to meet compliance standards. The policy must address risk factors, prevention strategies, and relevant legal protections. It also needs to be provided in writing in both English and the primary language specified by each employee. Training requirements for the New York Retail Worker Safety Act Employers must provide interactive workplace violence prevention training for all employees as well as a notice about the policy and the information presented in the training. This training must be conducted during onboarding and repeated annually, covering topics such as: Information about the Retail Worker Safety Act De-escalation techniques of workplace violence Active shooter drills Emergency procedures Use of security alarms and panic buttons Site-specific emergency exits and meeting locations Panic buttons Employers with over 500 retail employees nationwide must install panic buttons in their New York workplaces by January 1, 2027. These physical or mobile panic buttons are designed to alert emergency services when activated, transmitting the employee's location and contacting law enforcement. Mobile-based panic buttons must only be installed on employer-provided devices and cannot be used for employee tracking unless activated. As New York and California spearhead efforts to legislate workplace violence prevention, other states are likely to follow suit. Retail employers nationwide should prepare for the growing trend toward enhanced safety regulations and consider proactive steps to align with these evolving standards. Implementing the Retail Worker Safety Act highlights the importance of prioritizing employee safety in the retail industry. By setting clear guidelines and requiring mandatory training, the law aims to foster a safer and more secure working environment for retail employees. Employers are encouraged to stay informed on legislative changes and ensure compliance with new safety protocols to protect their workforce and promote a safety culture.

By Hugh Cameron U.S. News Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member Newly released data shows which states spend the most on goods and services, as well as those that continue to suffer from rising prices. Just one month out from the 2024 election , voters' concerns are still centered on the economy, and the high, albeit moderating, rates of inflation. An early September Pew Research Center poll revealed it was the top issue for voters in the home stretch of the election, with 81 percent of respondents considering the current state of the U.S. economy ""very important"" in deciding their vote. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual inflation rate stands at 2.5%. Despite being at its lowest level since February 2021, Americans are still grappling with much higher costs compared to four years ago, which can be attributed to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine , and corporate "" price gouging ."" More From Newsweek Vault: Rates Are Still High for These High-Yield Savings Accounts On Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its annual breakdown of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for all 50 states. The figure, also known as consumer spending, shows how much individuals are shelling out on goods and services throughout the year, and changes are often employed as a litmus test for the effects of inflation. The levels of consumer spending for each state, as well as the percentage increases between 2022 and 2023, can be seen on the map below, created by Newsweek using BEA data. Across all states and the District of Columbia , per capita PCE rose from $53,082 in 2022 to $56,202 in 2023. Among the states themselves, per capita PCE ranged from a high of $69,101 in Massachusetts to a low of $42,131 in Mississippi , while in the D.C., it was $92,037. More From Newsweek Vault: Online Banks vs. Brick-and-Mortar Banks Other high-spending states include Connecticut ($65,128), New Hampshire ($65,098), California ($64, 835), New Jersey ($63,814) and Colorado ($63,781) At the other end, were Arkansas ($44,254), Oklahoma ($44,398) and Alabama (44,529). New England had a PCE of $65,660, nearly $10,000 above the national average, while the Southwestern states of Arizona , New Mexico , Oklahoma and Texas combined for the lowest regional average of $51,547. More From Newsweek Vault: Best Credit Cards for Groceries ... Consumer spending increased across the U.S. by 6.4 percent in 2023, following a 9.8 percent increase in 2022. Among the states, Florida saw the largest increase (8.1 percent) in consumer spending between 2022 and 2023, followed by Maine (7.4 percent), Arizona and New York (both 7.2 percent). According to the BEA, consumer spending on health care, housing and utilities, and food services and accommodation were the greatest contributors to the increase. Of these, heath care increased 8.6 percent nationally between 2022 and 2023, and was the largest contributor to growth in 33 states, while housing and utilities, which increased 7.5 percent, contributed the most to PCE increases in 16 states. Nationally, food services and accommodations increased by 10.4 percent, but this was not the largest contributor to growth in any state. However, gasoline and other energy goods decreased 9.2 percent nationally, tempering the overall increase, albeit slightly. Do you have a story we should be covering?

JD Vance used his time in the vice presidential debate to showcase Donald Trump’s plan to revive the American Dream for ordinary Americans. The idealism has been ignored or missed by establishment reporters, who prefer to focus on narrow issues, such as abortion, that may help Kamala Harris. From start to finish, Vance wrapped many hot-button issues — wages, housing, immigration, women’s rights, health, civic chaos, energy, and even climate change — to the promise of reviving the American Dream. “I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams,” Vance said in his opening statement, adding: And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Donald Trump’s first term in office, he said, produced “an American economic boom unlike we’ve seen in a generation in this country … we’re going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again.” Trump has been pushing the theme for weeks, although unrecognized by the established media. On August 7, Trump declared : People want safety. They want security. They want respect all around the world for our country. They don’t want this horrible culture that is developing — a culture of no commonsense. It’s really a culture of no common sense, and it’s not what anyone wants. On August 12, Trump told Elon Musk: It’s about the American dream. You don’t hear about the American dream anymore, Elon, you’re the American Dream in the truest sense, but you don’t hear about the American dream anymore. Trump is also using Vance’s story to make the pitch: Throughout the debate, Vance kept linking the revival of the American Dream to front-burner political issues. Immigration: Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you’ve got schools that are overwhelmed, you’ve got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border. It is a disgrace. … I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can’t work for less than minimum wage in our own country ….that’ll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day’s work. Family housing: I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there’s so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Childcare: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don’t have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options …. we’re going to have to spend more money. We’re going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it’s so expensive right now is because you’ve got way too few people providing this very essential service. Civic Chaos: We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don’t think it’s the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem …. [We have] terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities, and this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys. Energy: Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices.” Healthcare: Well, of course, we’re going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care. Climate and Jobs: What the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that’s not what they’re doing. “What that has taught me is that we have the greatest country, the most beautiful country, the most incredible people anywhere in the world,” Vance said. “But they’re not going to be able to achieve their full dreams with the broken leadership that we have in Washington.” The American Dream hope for the future is rarely mentioned in the post-1990 government policy of enforced migration and chaotic diversity, slack wages, slumping living standards, and high housing costs. Trump: “Trainwreck” Biden Has Managed to “Kill the American Dream” Video Source: C-SPAN The idea emerged in the early 1930s and then blossomed in the post-war prosperity made possible by low migration and rising productivity. Trump was born in 1946, so he grew up with the American Dream expectation of everyday prosperity. The term was invented by American writer and historian James Truslow Adams, who described it as: That dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement … It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position. Americans’ prosperity grew rapidly after World War II, often allowing the Baby Boomer generation’s families to have several children and a decent house on a single income. But wage growth stalled after Congress restarted immigration in 1965 and doubled it in 1990. The wealth shift was accelerated as high-productivity manufacturing jobs were exported from the 1990s, ensuring that younger American families got a smaller and smaller share of the nation’s new wealth compared to their Baby Boomer parents and politicians. Those policy changes shifted vast wealth from American families to Wall Street, from young strivers to older investors, from the Midwest to the coasts. The changes also shifted vast wealth from future Americans to today’s investors by converting funds needed for scientific gains and productive advances into profits in today’s consumer economy. The changes were turbocharged in 2021 when Biden allowed his border chief to import 10 million migrants in just three years, with the tacit approval of Vice President Kamala Harris. The ruthless policy of extraction migration fueled inflation, spiked housing costs, stalled wages, and retard innovation as it used migrants to create even more profits for CEOs, older investors, and the Baby Boom generation."

The measures, introduced last month, aim to rejuvenate the economy and enhance market and consumer confidence. What Happened : Citi has pinpointed three Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. as potential beneficiaries of China’s recent economic stimulus measures, CNBC reported on Thursday. Last month, China rolled out several policies aimed at revitalizing its economy and boosting market and consumer confidence. These efforts have already led to significant gains in Chinese internet stocks, with the KraneShares China Internet ETF rising by 45%. Despite these gains, Citi analysts, led by Alicia Yap , believe the market has not fully accounted for the potential improvements in macroeconomic conditions and earnings growth. See Also: Odds Of Tim Walz Winning The VP Debate Drop On Polymarket As Bettors Favor JD Vance — Harris Maintains Lead Over Trump The Wall Street bank highlighted Tencent (OTC: TCEHY ), Trip.com Group (NASDAQ: TCOM ) and Meituan (OTC: MPNGY ) as top picks to benefit from the stimulus. Tencent, with its diverse business portfolio, stands to gain from increased consumer spending and online activity. Trip.com Group is expected to benefit from a resurgence in China’s travel industry, while Meituan could see growth in consumer spending on food delivery and local services. Why It Matters : The recent stimulus measures in China have sparked optimism in the markets. Chinese stocks experienced a rebound following the announcement of policies allowing homeowners to refinance mortgages. This move is part of a broader strategy to support the struggling economy. Despite the positive short-term impact, there are concerns about the long-term effectiveness of these measures. Experts hold skepticism about the ability of these stimulus programs to address China’s structural economic issues , particularly in the real estate sector. Nevertheless, the immediate liquidity injections have provided a boost to the markets, with the CSI 300 index rallying by nearly 16% last week.

Restaurant and Catering Australia (RCA) CEO Suresh Manickam warned that the hospitality industry was going through one of its most difficult periods in history. “Higher interest rates, cost of living pressures on the up, more expensive produce and the cost of energy are all having an impact” , Manickam said. Advertisement “People have less money in their pockets and a reduced ability to pay and go out, and there lies the problem the sector is ­facing”. RCA projected that one in eleven hospitality businesses would collapse over the coming year. Data compiled by CreditorWatch showed that the food and beverage services industry is experiencing the highest failure rate in the nation, driven by low levels of consumer spending, high inflation and interest rate increases. Advertisement “The Food and Beverage sector, in particular, is facing a ‘perfect storm’ of continued rising costs as demand declines” , CreditorWatch noted. “At the same time, the ATO is actively chasing tax debts, many of which sit with businesses in this sector”. “And in almost all instances, businesses in the Food and Beverage sector pay rent on retail space that is typically located in high foot traffic retail precincts”. “It is very difficult for restaurants and cafes to move premises to get a better rent deal, therefore rents and the associated increases are an added burden on this industry”, explained CreditorWatch. CreditorWatch CEO, Patrick Coghlan, also warned that businesses desperately need interest rate relief to boost consumer demand. Advertisement “One of the biggest contributing factors to this increase in our business failure rate is the lack of consumer demand” , he said. “This is reflected in the ABS household spending and Westpac Consumer Sentiment numbers”. “Consumers won’t be inclined to open their wallets in any significant way until they get a reduction in their mortgage payments”. “A couple of rate cuts would also mean that credit becomes more affordable for businesses, and they are able to get back on the growth track as well”, Coghlan said. Australia had too many hospitality establishments, like restaurants and cafes, prior to the pandemic. And given the high cost of living, many will be forced to close.

Australia functioned fine 20 years ago when there was a fraction of the number of cafes and restaurants. It will do so again.

The capital and labour could be deployed better elsewhere in the economy."

BEAVERTON, Ore. — Nike sales and profits slumped in its fiscal first quarter as the sportswear giant wrestles with shoppers' sluggish demand for new sneaker models and other products. The lackluster results Tuesday came after Nike announced last month that its CEO, John Donahoe, is stepping down on Oct. 13. Company veteran Elliott Hill is coming out of retirement to head up the company. ""A comeback at this scale takes time, but we see early wins — from momentum in key sports to accelerating our pace of newness and innovation,” said Matthew Friend, executive vice president and Nike's chief financial officer, in statement. “Our teams are energized as Elliott Hill returns to lead Nike’s next stage of growth.” Friend told analysts Tuesday that, given its CEO transition and with three quarters left in the fiscal year, Nike has withdrawn its full-year financial-performance guidance and intends to provide a quarterly outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. It also postponed its investor meeting that had been scheduled for Nov. 19. Nike has been known for its innovation but in recent years, analysts have said that it has lost its focus on coming up with cool products. Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, said that some of the sales decline was due to a weaker consumer economy that has shoppers buying fewer sneakers and not splurging on clothing as they once did. ""Nike has done itself no favors with a lack of focus and oomph in a market where far more effort and exertion is needed to hold onto sales,” he said. “There is a general sense that Nike has lost its edge and that the power of its innovation and the quality of its storytelling have both been faded.” Saunders noted that at the same time, smaller rival brands have moved into Nike's territory and successfully connected with consumers in a way that Nike has failed to do. Nike posted net income of $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter that ended Aug. 31. That compares with $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Sales fell 10% to $11.59 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 52 cents a share on sales of $11.64 billion, according to FactSet. Shares of Nike Inc., which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, were down 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings report. They are down 18% so far this year. Copyright 2025 Associated Press.
