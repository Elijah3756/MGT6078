The rapid evolution of technology is reshaping the way to produce, distribute and consume renewable energy. The ability of developing nations to adopt new technologies will determine their transition acceleration rate. Speaking ahead of the 13th Ghana Economic Forum (GEF) organised by the B&FT, he stressed that key to the National Energy Transition Framework is reliable and efficient adoption of new technologies which can drive the changeover from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Prof. Gyamfi, an expert in energy efficiency and renewable energy, further underscored the pivotal role that harnessing the power of innovation and embracing cutting-edge technological solutions will play in expediting the shift toward a more sustainable and resilient energy system. “Globally, about 84 percent of energy is from fossil fuels – and that brings about high emissions leading to the climate change and environmental issues experienced today. So, we need to shift; but the shift to renewable energy might not happen at the pace we expect because it requires a shift in technology. “For instance, in terms of transport, it is over 90 percent dependent on fossil fuels and oil. So if we want to change to renewable energy, we have to change the vehicle technology system that will be able to use bio-fuels and other renewable energy forms like e-vehicles,” he said. The Ghana Economic Forum (GEF) is an annual event aimed at fostering dialogue among key stakeholders on critical economic issues facing Ghana. The 13th edition is under the theme ‘Unlocking Opportunities: Re-engineering Ghana’s Economic Model for Sustainable Development‘. The GEF provides a platform for policymakers, business leaders, economists and academics to share insights, debate policy directions and explore innovative solutions to drive Ghana’s economic growth and development. This year’s forum is particularly significant as it features keynote addresses and interviews with two presidential candidates, reflecting the intersection of economic policy and upcoming elections. As the world faces pressing challenges related to climate change and sustainability, the pace of energy transition has become a critical focal point for experts and decision-makers. Technology has emerged as a game-changer in the energy transition journey – from breakthroughs in renewable energy generation to advancements in energy storage and grid optimisation. One key advantage of a technology-driven changeover is its reliability in ensuring a smooth and seamless transition. By leveraging data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, energy stakeholders can enhance visibility, efficiency and transparency across the entire energy value chain. From solar panels and wind-turbines to smart meters and energy management systems, the proliferation of innovative technologies is creating new opportunities for both developed and developing nations to make significant strides toward decarbonisation and sustainability. Embracing technology is not just a choice; it’s a necessity in today’s energy landscape. By investing in research and development, fostering collaboration between industry players and academia, and promoting policy support for technology deployment, we can accelerate the energy transition and unlock a greener future for generations to come, Prof. Gyamfi explained. The GEF plenary session on energy, of which Prof. Gyamfi is a panellist, will explore the current state of Ghana’s energy sector, focusing on issues such as energy security, renewable energy adoption and regulatory frameworks.

    "article_text": "Energy storage capacity to see robust uptick By ZHENG XIN | China Daily | Updated: 2024-08-01 09:22 A driver charges his new energy vehicle in Chongqing. [SUN KAIFANG/FOR CHINA DAILY] Fueled by innovative technologies and rapid advances in the renewables sector, China's energy storage capacity is poised for significant growth, the National Energy Administration said on Wednesday. The country's power storage capacity has steadily increased this year, with over 44 million kilowatts already in operation by the end of June, up 40 percent year-on-year, the energy authority said during a news conference in Beijing. The government has been continuously advancing energy storage technologies, with several compressed air energy storage, flow battery storage, and sodium-ion battery storage projects put into operation across the nation, Bian Guangqi, an NEA official, said at the conference. New energy storage, or energy storage using new technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, liquid flow batteries, compressed air and mechanical energy, is an important foundation for building the country's new power system, which enjoys advantages such as quick response, flexible configuration and short construction timelines. According to Bian, new energy storage systems are playing a critical role in ensuring grid connection of renewable energy, with the equivalent utilization hours of new energy storage in the operating areas of State Grid Corp of China, the country's largest power utility, reaching 390 hours during the first half of 2024, approximately doubling from the first half of 2023. Meanwhile, figures for that of China Southern Power Grid's operating areas reached 560 hours, nearly matching the total utilization for 2023, he said. According to Deng Simeng, a senior analyst in renewables and power research at global consultancy Rystad Energy, battery storage is drawing significant attention due to its crucial role and benefits, which include smaller devices, flexible site requirements and shorter construction periods compared to wind, solar and other traditional power sources. As numerous gigawatt-scale renewable base projects come online in Northwest China, the local grid system must integrate this renewable capacity, optimize power output and manage the intermittency issues associated with wind and solar energy, said Deng. Given the rapid expansion of renewable installations, accelerating the development of new energy storage solutions will be a crucial breakthrough for the northwestern region. This will help mitigate renewable curtailment and ensure a more resilient and secure power grid, she added. According to the administration, the northern and northwestern parts of the country have seen the fastest development of new-type energy storage facilities, accounting for over 50 percent of the newly operational energy storage installations nationwide. In terms of application scenarios, independent energy storage and shared energy storage installations account for 45.3 percent, energy storage installations paired with new energy projects account for 42.8 percent, and other application scenarios account for 11.9 percent. The installed capacity of renewable energy has achieved fresh breakthroughs. In the first half of 2024, the nationwide newly installed capacity for renewable energy power generation reached 134 million kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 24 percent, accounting for 88 percent of the total new power generation capacity in the country. The NEA issued a notice in April titled \"Promotion of New Energy Storage Integration and Dispatch Utilization\", aimed at standardizing the integration of new energy storage into the grid and promoting efficient dispatch utilization of new energy storage. The notice outlined specific requirements for grid enterprises, power dispatch agencies and new energy storage project units. The country has also been expanding the scale of charging facilities, with the total number of charging piles nationwide reaching 10.24 million as of the end of June, a year-on-year increase of 54 percent, including 3.12 million public charging piles and 7.12 million private ones. The total rated power of public charging piles exceeds 110 million kilowatts, meeting the charging needs of 24 million new energy vehicles, it said. In the first half of the year, the nationwide charging volume for new energy vehicles was around 51.3 billion kilowatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of 40 percent. Efforts are being made to address the charging infrastructure gap in rural areas, said Zhang Xing, a spokesman of the energy administration. \"We have organized charging infrastructure construction and promotion activities in some counties and towns, and more than one-third of the provinces have extended charging facilities to all townships, strongly supporting the rural adoption of new energy vehicles,\" Zhang said.

Associated press file photo Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save For more than a century, Louisiana has been an energy-rich state and a world leader in energy exploration, production and innovation. We have achieved this success thanks to our state’s abundant natural resources, highly skilled workforce unmatched anywhere else in the world and extensive network of pipelines that supply half America’s refining capacity. As we look to Louisiana’s future, the energy industry’s emerging expansion represents a golden opportunity for us to grow our economy in ways not seen since Louisiana’s first oil boom. The numbers speak volumes: Louisiana's energy sector sustains over 346,000 jobs, contributes $25 billion in wages and generates $54 billion in economic output. Our state provides direct access to America’s only deepwater offshore oil port, produces clean offshore energy supplies for our nation and allies and is home to some of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas export terminals. Marc Ehrhardt Provided photo Today, Louisiana’s robust energy infrastructure and experienced workforce remain an essential national resource, strengthening our state’s economy and supplying both America’s energy needs and global market demands. Right now, America’s energy sector is expanding as the demand for all types of energy production keeps growing. Louisiana is working to fulfill this demand and capitalize on the energy industry’s expansion. Energy producers around the world, like ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and dozens of others are investing billions of dollars into Louisiana’s working energy infrastructure. This includes: $50 billion in new project investment for energy production, manufacturing or related facilities according to Louisiana Economic Development More than $20 billion in clean hydrogen energy production projects with more than 10,000 future job opportunities A $27.5 million investment from Shell that will create the LSU Institute for Energy Innovation to study and direct the future of American energy $46.9 billion for six energy-related projects planned at the Calcasieu Ship Channel $3.6 million from ExxonMobil to lead innovation around future energy projects and educational programs teaching Louisiana students about new technologies such as advanced recycling, carbon capture and clean hydrogen. Tommy Faucheux Provided photo Louisiana can do more if we embrace our position as the leading energy innovation state in America. For example, Louisiana could gain up to $13 billion in private investments plus thousands of new jobs for carbon management and hydrogen energy production. Additionally, one offshore wind farm in the Gulf of Mexico could support 4,400 new jobs and $445 million in new investment. The need for oil and natural gas resources is not going away. By supporting our oil and natural gas investments and new opportunities in energy advancements, Louisiana can lead America’s energy expansion and be at the forefront of the great American energy renaissance. Let’s build on our ability to supply the world’s energy needs by producing even more energy through innovations like hydrogen and offshore wind. Mike Moncla Provided photo This isn't about replacing our traditional energy efforts. It's about enhancing them, while embracing innovation and preparing for the growing global energy demand. We know what the energy industry gives to Louisiana — a robust economy contributing more funding for local schools, police protection and coastal restoration plus an exciting future brimming with in-state, advanced careers. Industry leaders, energy advocates, scientists and local communities are backing the future of Louisiana energy by working together across our state, advocating for pro-energy policies and streamlining regulations to ensure that Louisiana remains at the forefront of energy production. It is vital that we remain firm in our support of Louisiana’s energy expansion for the people of the industry. Our action or inaction today will determine whether Louisiana’s position as a premier energy-producing state will be preserved or threatened. Let us stand united and resolve to do what it takes to not only maintain but fortify Louisiana's exceptional energy culture and way of life, now and well into the future.

    "article_text": "The UK’s renewable energy budget has been increased to a record £1.5 billion, Ed Miliband announced on Wednesday. Of that, £1.1 billion will be allocated for offshore wind , which the government described as “the backbone of the UK’s clean energy mission”. The funding uplift represents more than a 50 per cent increase on the budget previously set in March. The renewable energy industry will bid for the sum in order to deliver clean energy projects in the UK. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the higher budget will “boost energy security, secure cheap power for families, and unlock economic growth and jobs for the country”. It will “accelerate the delivery of clean, cheap, low-carbon electricity to families and businesses, generated by renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels”, the department added. open image in gallery ( James Glossop/The Times/PA Wire ) Firms in the renewables industry will bid for a share of the funding through the government’s sixth renewable auction – known as the Contracts for Difference scheme – which provides developers with initial subsidies for clean electricity projects across Britain. Contracts for Difference works by developers bidding for contracts to help deliver renewable energy projects, with the scheme providing a guaranteed price for the clean electricity they generate. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the scheme gives industry greater certainty to invest, knowing that when electricity prices fluctuate, they will always get a set price for their projects. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband said it demonstrates that Labour is “backing industry to build in Britain”. Contracts are awarded through a series of auctions, where the lowest price bids are successful. open image in gallery £1.1 billion will be allocated for offshore wind, which the government described as “the backbone of the UK’s clean energy mission”. ( PA Wire ) It is aimed at encouraging lower energy bills, as the subsidies are paid back to the government when wholesale electricity prices are higher than the agreed Contract for Difference price. In a statement, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Families across the country have suffered during the cost of living crisis, as the UK’s over-reliance on fossil fuel markets was exploited by Putin. “Investing in clean energy is part of the Government’s plans to make Britain a clean energy superpower. This will boost the country’s energy independence, so that families and businesses are never left that vulnerable again.” In a statement, Mr Miliband said: “Last year’s auction round was a catastrophe, with zero offshore wind secured, and delaying our move away from expensive fossil fuels to energy independence. “Instead, we are backing industry to build in Britain, with this year’s auction getting its biggest budget yet. “This will restore the UK as a global leader for green technologies and deliver the infrastructure we need to boost our energy independence, protect billpayers, and become a clean energy superpower.” Energy Minister Michael Shanks added: “It is our mission for the UK to be more energy secure and to do that we need more renewable energy projects connected to the grid and powering our homes. “Increasing the budget by more than 50 per cent will boost industry confidence to back clean energy, attracting cutting edge clean technologies to Britain as we accelerate to a decarbonised power sector by 2030.” Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments"

Generate Key Takeaways A home energy startup is optimizing energy efficiency with its latest solar valuation software, according to an article published by Canary Media. Balto Energy is a San Diego-based clean energy startup dedicated to helping homeowners transition to renewable energy sources in the most efficient and cost-effective way. One of the biggest challenges for homeowners who switch to solar or electric energy is predicting the value of installing solar-led-electrification. However, Balto Energy's plan is to provide tools for solar contractors and homeowners to do just that. With its Solar-Led Electrification Design tool, Balto Energy can model the outcomes of different energy combinations to determine how they will impact a household's energy usage patterns and costs for years down the line. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Balto's software tool evaluates a variety of key metrics , including data on home energy characteristics, efficiency upgrade impacts, battery algorithms, solar production forecasts, utility tariff engines, and manufacturers' data on appliance performance. Predicting these valuations in the state of California is especially important since energy costs are strongly dependent on the hours in which homes utilize electricity. However, Balto's software has the capability to consider hour-by-hour variations of the equipment it evaluates, allowing homeowners to change and control their energy efficiency over time. ​\"Post-install, there are a lot of things we can do with smart charging for EVs, controls, and feedback from heat pumps — you can calibrate and control the differential accuracy over time, and start to drive to the outcome you want,\" Balto Energy founder and CEO James Quazi told Canary Media. Watch now: Honda reveals how it's rethinking electric vehicles from the ground up with exciting new concept cars Balto's goal is to map out homeowner's transition from non-renewable energy to electricity in a way that optimizes solar power at costs at or below utility rates. Its first deployment partnership is with Northern Pacific Power Systems. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Startups such as Balto Energy are making it easier for homeowners to transition toward renewable energy sources. After installing solar electrification, you can save money on your energy bills while also reducing the amount of harmful planet-warming gases that end up in the atmosphere. \"What [Balto is] building is the opportunity to get precise about cost savings from the interventions, recognizing that every intervention is going to be about as different as every home is,\" said Ashby Monk, one of Balto's lead investors, per Canary Media.

The Challenge Of Energy Consumption AI computing and blockchain mining are notoriously energy-intensive processes. AI algorithms require substantial computational power to train and operate, while blockchain mining involves solving complex mathematical problems, necessitating vast amounts of electricity. Traditionally, this has led to significant environmental concerns, with critics pointing out the substantial carbon footprint associated with these technologies. However, the growing emphasis on sustainability has spurred the search for more efficient and eco-friendly energy solutions . This is where the concept of utilizing wasted energy comes into play. Wasted energy refers to the excess energy produced by industrial processes or renewable energy sources that would otherwise go unused. By redirecting this energy towards AI computing and blockchain mining, we can significantly reduce the environmental impact of these technologies. My Journey Into Wasted Energy Utilization My journey into this innovative approach began while exploring ways to optimize energy use in our AI-driven projects. I realized that a significant amount of energy generated by various industrial processes was being wasted, so I investigated how we could harness this excess energy for our computational needs. The first step was to identify potential sources of wasted energy. We focused on industries known for high energy consumption and significant waste, such as manufacturing and power generation. Partnering with these industries required extensive negotiations. We needed to demonstrate the mutual benefits of redirecting their wasted energy to our operations. This involved detailed presentations on how this approach could enhance their sustainability efforts, improve their corporate social responsibility profiles and potentially offer financial incentives through energy credits or reduced operational costs. The Negotiation Process Negotiating these partnerships was no small feat. It required a deep understanding of both the industrial and technological landscapes. One key challenge was convincing industry stakeholders of the feasibility and reliability of using their wasted energy for our purposes. Many were initially skeptical and concerned about the stability of the energy supply and the technical challenges in transferring energy from their processes to our computing facilities. To address these concerns, we conducted pilot projects demonstrating this approach and the benefits of practical applications. We partnered with several manufacturing plants that produced significant waste heat. By installing heat recovery systems, we will convert this heat into electricity, which will then be used to power our AI data centers. The success of this study provided a compelling proof of concept, which helped gain the trust and cooperation of other industry partners. The Benefits Of Wasted Energy Utilization The benefits of utilizing wasted energy for AI computing and blockchain mining are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with these technologies. By tapping into energy that would otherwise go unused, we minimize the demand for additional power generation, which often relies on fossil fuels. Secondly, this approach enhances the overall efficiency of energy use. Industrial processes become more sustainable as their energy waste is repurposed productively. This not only supports environmental goals but also offers economic benefits. Industries can lower their energy costs and earn incentives for contributing to sustainable energy practices. Moreover, using wasted energy can lead to more resilient and decentralized energy systems. Instead of relying solely on traditional power grids, which can be vulnerable to disruptions, AI and blockchain operations can benefit from multiple, diverse energy sources. This diversification enhances the stability and reliability of the energy supply for these critical technologies. The Future Of Energy Management The successful integration of wasted energy utilization into AI computing and blockchain mining represents a significant step forward in energy management . As the demand for computational power continues to grow, finding sustainable energy solutions becomes imperative. My experience has shown that we can turn potential environmental liabilities into assets with the right approach and partnerships. Looking ahead, I believe this model can be scaled and applied globally. Governments and regulatory bodies can play a crucial role by creating policies and incentives that encourage wasted energy use. For instance, offering tax breaks or subsidies for companies that implement energy recovery systems can accelerate the adoption of this practice. Furthermore, technological advancements will continue to improve the efficiency and feasibility of energy recovery and utilization. Innovations in energy storage, grid integration and heat recovery systems will enhance our ability to effectively capture and repurpose wasted energy.

Energy demand continues to soar while the supply of conventional energy sources remains inadequate. This imbalance has resulted in frequent power outages, which not only hinder economic growth and disrupt daily life but also impede technological advancement. As the gap between energy supply and demand widens, the nation faces escalating power costs and increasing reliance on imports. In October 2023, Pakistan had an energy deficit of 6,000MW, incurring an import bill of $7 billion. According to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) 2022 annual report, Pakistan’s installed generation capacity adds up to 43,775 MW, of which merely 7.0 per cent comes from renewable energy sources. Addressing this crisis requires strategic investments in renewable energy infrastructure and policy reforms to ensure a sustainable energy supply for Pakistan’s future. The origins of Pakistan’s energy crisis can be traced back to the 1970s when Pakistan narrowly averted a major energy crisis when the government launched the Mangla and Tarbela dams. These projects ushered in a brief era of robust hydro-driven energy generation that effectively met the country’s demands. However, the 1980s saw a period of strong economic growth that caused energy demand to surge. Despite government efforts to increase generation, they failed to keep up with the escalating demand. The energy crisis in Pakistan stems from a multitude of interconnected and overlapping factors. Pakistan’s energy crisis is primarily driven by its heavy reliance on non-renewable and expensive fossil fuels, which make up 59 per cent of the energy mix. This dependence is exacerbated by outdated transmission lines, infrastructural flaws, and issues such as line losses, power theft, and inefficient energy usage. The country’s energy infrastructure is further strained by overpopulation, rapid urbanization, and industrialization. A World Bank report projects that Pakistan’s energy demand will increase by 70 per cent by 2030, while supply is expected to grow by only 45 per cent. Economic instability and a shortage of technical expertise compound these challenges. Additionally, systemic corruption and inefficiencies within generation and distribution companies (Gencos and DISCOs) significantly contribute to the crisis. The lack of consistent political will and effective energy policies, coupled with shortsighted commitments to independent power producers (IPPs) and the burden of circular debt, perpetuate Pakistan’s enduring energy challenges. To address Pakistan’s energy crisis, a multifaceted approach is urgently needed. The country must diversify its energy mix by investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Given that only a paltry 7.0 per cent of Pakistan’s energy currently comes from renewable sources, significantly increasing this share is important. This transition not only reduces dependency on costly fossil fuel but also aligns with global trends towards sustainable energy. Additionally, expanding and upgrading the transmission infrastructure is vital to mitigate the chronic issues of line losses and power theft, which have long plagued the system. Modernizing these outdated transmission lines will enhance efficiency and reliability, ensuring that generated power reaches consumers. Addressing systemic corruption and inefficiencies within the generation and distribution companies (Gencos and DISCOs) is paramount. The government must implement stringent anti-corruption measures and overhaul management practices to eliminate waste and financial mismanagement. This should be coupled with a consistent political will to enforce these reforms and hold accountable those who fail to comply. Revisiting and renegotiating short-sighted agreements with IPPs can alleviate some of the financial burdens contributing to circular debt. Such measures would restore financial stability to the power sector. Additionally, the bureaucratic red tape that hinders project implementation must be streamlined to avoid delays and inflated costs, ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. Enhancing local technical expertise is critical for sustainable energy development. Investing in education and training programmes for engineers and technicians will build a skilled workforce capable of maintaining and advancing the energy infrastructure. This long-term investment is necessary to keep pace with technological advancements and ensure the efficient operation of energy systems. Public-private partnerships can attract investment and innovation, leveraging the private sector’s efficiencies and expertise to bolster the public energy sector. Utilizing untapped and renewable energy sources with high potential and capacity -- wind (50,000 MW), solar (40,000 MW), hydro (40,000 MW), and Thar coal (100,000 MW) -- alongside tidal, biofuels, and nuclear potential, would be a great stride in this regard. By harnessing these resources, Pakistan can bolster its energy supply and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The government must also prioritize energy conservation and efficiency measures. Implementing policies that encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices can reduce overall demand. Public awareness campaigns should highlight the importance of energy conservation and the economic benefits it can bring to the country. These efforts, combined with structural reforms, can help bridge the projected gap between energy supply and demand, ensuring a stable and sustainable energy future for Pakistan.

Generate Key Takeaways Rhode Island recently took a monumental step toward committing to a green future. The newly passed Energy Storage Systems Act is a great example of state-based legislation taking the right steps toward a healthy future for all. According to What's Up Newp — a Newport news outlet — the Energy Storage Systems Act was signed into law June 26, with the purpose of enabling an affordable, renewable energy grid through more energy storage capacity. The act \"sets concrete goals and action plans to build a resilient grid that can accommodate the green energy transition,\" stated state Senator Dawn Euer, per the news outlet. Also included in the legislation are requirements of the Public Utilities Commissions to adopt a framework for \"the adoption of electric rate tariffs to apply to energy storage systems connected to the electric grid.\" The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank and the Office of Energy will oversee and fund projects that will help meet the key milestones of storage capacity for renewable energy projects, reported WUN. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Energy Storage Systems Act is highly beneficial to energy transition in that it holds Rhode Island accountable for implementing energy storage infrastructure to ensure affordable clean energy can be used in the most efficient way possible. The adoption rates of renewable energy like solar and wind can be reliant on how well it can be stored. The American Clean Power Association noted that energy storage \"enables us to produce clean energy when it's abundant, store it, and send it back to the electricity grid when needed.\" When states take the lead in creating legislation like this, it benefits energy users as it makes clean energy more accessible and affordable. The Rhode Island legislation follows in step with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act by working to not only produce more clean energy, but also ensure that clean energy is efficiently embedded into existing energy infrastructure so that it is easy to access and affordable, per the Department of Energy. More clean energy means a healthier and safer environment for all. Watch now: Uber-wealthy couple makes unprecedented move with $300 million land Rhode Island Representative Arthur Handy commented on the new legislation, per What's Up Newp: \"This legislation is critical to both take advantage of the renewable energy we have to bring online and to build a sustainable grid in the face of severe storms and other effects of climate change.\" Join our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.

A spring has more potential energy when it is compressed or stretched. A steel ball has more potential energy raised above the ground than it has after falling to Earth . In the raised position it is capable of doing more work . Potential energy is a property of a system and not of an individual body or particle; the system composed of Earth and the raised ball, for example, has more potential energy as the two are farther separated. Potential energy arises in systems with parts that exert forces on each other of a magnitude dependent on the configuration, or relative position, of the parts. In the case of the Earth-ball system, the force of gravity between the two depends only on the distance separating them. The work done in separating them farther, or in raising the ball, transfers additional energy to the system, where it is stored as gravitational potential energy. Understanding potential and kinetic energy in action Learn about how potential energy and kinetic energy are harnessed to generate electricity through facilities such as the Aswan High Dam.

What is commonly known as chemical energy , the capacity of a substance to do work or to evolve heat by undergoing a change of composition , may be regarded as potential energy resulting from the mutual forces among its molecules and atoms . Nuclear energy is also a form of potential energy. Britannica Quiz 27 True-or-False Questions from Britannica’s Most Difficult Science Quizzes The potential energy of a system of particles depends only on their initial and final configurations; it is independent of the path the particles travel. In the case of the steel ball and Earth, if the initial position of the ball is ground level and the final position is 10 feet above the ground, the potential energy is the same, no matter how or by what route the ball was raised. The value of potential energy is arbitrary and relative to the choice of reference point. In the case given above, the system would have twice as much potential energy if the initial position were the bottom of a 10-foot-deep hole. Gravitational potential energy near Earth’s surface may be computed by multiplying the weight of an object by its distance above the reference point. In bound systems, such as atoms, in which electrons are held by the electric force of attraction to nuclei, the zero reference for potential energy is a distance from the nucleus so great that the electric force is not detectable. In this case, bound electrons have negative potential energy, and those very far away have zero potential energy. Potential energy may be converted into energy of motion , called kinetic energy , and in turn to other forms such as electric energy. Thus, water behind a dam flows to lower levels through turbines that turn electric generators, producing electric energy plus some unusable heat energy resulting from turbulence and friction .
