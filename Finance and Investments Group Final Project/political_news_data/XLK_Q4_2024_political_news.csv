Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Gil Press writes about technology, entrepreneurs and innovation. Follow Author Dec 30, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save Comment Israeli food pioneer — using high-tech cultivation methods, tropical greenhouses and a data-guided curing process — says it has cracked its secrets to create the most potent vanilla flavours on earth. (Photo by MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images In 2024, the startup ecosystem in Israel mostly followed global private and public investment trends, a significant achievement given the ongoing war on multiple fronts throughout the year. In 2025, the incredibly resilient Israeli entrepreneurial spirit will produce a startup baby boom—many new company creations, some related to technologies emerging from the war, including new ventures of “retired” successful entrepreneurs. “We're going to see a lot of new company creation after the war, assuming that we are indeed in a de-escalation mode,” says Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central , a non-profit providing access for investors and companies to Israel’s tech economy. “There are reasons to believe that 2025 is going to be a good year for the tech sector and tech investments,” Hasson adds. One reason for cautious optimism is the sector's performance over the last year. It mirrored the somewhat subdued investment environment in the U.S. and did slightly better than Europe’s. Moreover, regardless of the war, 2024 has been a record year for Israel in terms of mergers and acquisitions. “The leading companies in the world, such as Nvidia, showed their confidence in Israeli tech by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire Israeli startups,” says Hasson. Private companies (e.g., Boomi acquiring data integration startup Rivery) and private equity investors also demonstrated their confidence in Israeli startups. Hasson highlights the acquisition by Blackstone of a majority stake in Priority Software for $800 million. Priority derives 80% of its revenues from the Israeli market and Blackstone’s investment will help it expand to other markets worldwide. In addition, Israeli companies showed their confidence in Israeli tech by acquiring Israeli startups, a trend that has accelerated in 2024. “It shows that when these companies think about growing and diversifying and scaling, they see Israel as a key part of their growth strategy,” says Hasson. MORE FOR YOU In 2025, AI will continue to attract top investment dollars worldwide, benefiting Israel due to its strong position in this sector. From 2014 to 2023, top multinational corporations acquired one Israeli AI startup for every four American AI acquisitions, showcasing Israel’s strong global appeal. “A key metric that sets Israel apart is its focus on applied AI solutions in areas like cybersecurity, health tech, and agriculture, which positions it as a leader in practical AI applications,” wrote Arik Kol, Head of Nvidia Inception Startups Program at Nvidia Israel, in the recent Startup Nation Central report on Israeli AI . The defense tech sector is expected to grow rapidly next year, driven by global geopolitical tensions. In Israel, it is driven by necessity and a strong, battle-proven foundation. Earlier this year, Startup Nation Central launched Israel’s first Defense Tech landscape map featuring over 160 companies. Israeli innovators are pioneering technologies that address critical challenges in air defense, homeland security, aviation, dual-use applications, space technologies and more. Startup Nation Central is about to publish an updated version of the map which will include about 300 companies, Hasson reports. Another area in which necessity drives innovation in Israel and war-related experience leads to successful commercial applications is health tech. “In the battlefield and in the hospitals we've seen some amazing technologies being applied in terms of rehabilitation, trauma and mental health to mention a few,” says Hasson. For example, psychiatrists at Israel’s Sheba Medical Center have developed “Liv,” an LLM-based platform that offers an interactive interface, and a personalized patient experience with voice and written communications. The application has been launched commercially by an independent startup with the promise to improve the productivity of mental health professionals while addressing acute understaffing worldwide. “Venture capitalists have been playing defense for the past 24 months,” says Hasson. He sees this changing in the coming year. “Seed activity will go up a notch because you can't play defense for three years.” In Israel, “we're going to see high-quality entrepreneurs going back into the game with good ideas and good teams. And the money will follow.” Consider, for example, Elad Schulman . After selling his cybersecurity startup in 2019, he settled into the comfortable life of an angel investor. The new market opportunity presented by the arrival of GenAI, however, took him out of “retirement” and with three former colleagues he established Lasso, focused on cybersecurity for generative AI. The tech sector is “basically the business plan of the country and the reason the Israeli economy came into the war so strong,” says Hasson. “It's also the source of capital for Israel to fund the growing defense budget in the next decade” and to fund the recovery of the North and South of Israel after the war ends.

That’s why we have them,” Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” Trump told the newspaper.

What Happened : 2024 wasn’t a year of financial prosperity for all, with some billionaires in the luxury retail sector experiencing substantial losses. A recent report revealed that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced growth of 25% and 33% respectively in 2024. This growth significantly benefited the ultra-wealthy, especially those with investments in tech companies. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , the collective net worth of the five wealthiest individuals in the tech sector surged by $542 billion. The rise in AI technology and a post-election rally pushed many tech stocks to record highs. One of the major winners was Elon Musk , whose net worth almost doubled to $468 billion, primarily due to the stock market rally following Donald Trump’s election victory. Musk’s wealth mainly comes from his stakes in Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms Inc saw an $85 billion increase in his net worth, thanks to a strong ad business and AI advancements, pushing the company's stock up over 70%. Similarly, Jensen Huang of Nvidia Corp. became a centibillionaire, gaining $78 billion as the company maintained its dominance in AI chips. Other winners included Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., whose wealth grew by $70 billion, and Jeff Bezos , Amazon's founder, who saw a $69 billion increase as Amazon's stock rose 45% following Trump's election win.

Those with investments in luxury retail saw their fortunes decline significantly due to the struggles faced by the sector in 2024. Billionaires tied to luxury goods and retail experienced significant losses. Bernard Arnault of LVMH lost $31 billion amid struggles in China's economy, while Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of L'Oréal and Francois Pinault of Kering faced losses of $25 billion and $14 billion, respectively, due to a global luxury slowdown. Carlos Slim and Colin Huang also faced sharp declines, with losses tied to telecommunications and fast fashion industries. Why It Matters : The tech sector’s performance in 2024 underscores the growing influence and wealth of tech billionaires. The significant growth in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, coupled with advancements in AI technology, created a favorable environment for tech stocks. This, in turn, led to a substantial increase in the net worth of tech billionaires. However, the luxury retail sector’s struggles highlight the economic disparities among billionaires.

(Brandon Bell/Pool via AP, File) (Brandon Bell, 2024 Getty Images) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. Recommended Videos “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,"" Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,"" Trump told the newspaper.

Trump's hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters. But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump's movement have accused Musk and others in Trump's new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump's “America First"" vision. Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards.

Image Credit: Reuters Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Friday vowed to go to ”war” to defend the H-1B visa program for foreign tech workers amid a dispute between President-elect Donald Trump’s longtime supporters and his most recently acquired backers from the tech industry. In a post on social media platform X, Musk said ”The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.” STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD ”I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” he added. The tech industry has consistently advocated for an increase in H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the United States. However, during Donald Trump’s first administration, the program faced restrictions in 2020, with claims that it allowed businesses to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign labor.

In a post, Loomer expressed concerns about Krishnan’s influence on immigration policies, referring to him as a “third-world invader” despite his status as a naturalised U.S. citizen. “It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda,” Ms. Loomer wrote on X, the social media platform owned by Mr. Musk.

H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Musk’s tweet was directed at Trump’s supporters and immigration hardliners, who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump has so far remained silent on the issue. The Trump transition did not respond to a request for comment on Musk’s tweets and the H-1B visa debate. In the past, Trump has expressed a willingness to provide more work visas to skilled workers. He has also promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens and severely restrict immigration. The issue highlights how tech leaders like Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base. The U.S. tech industry relies on the government’s H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens. The altercation was set off earlier this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration’s immigration policies. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued ”big tech oligarchs” for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization. In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration. Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies. With inputs from agencies.

The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hard-line immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration.

Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Advertisement Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mt. Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man, who has grown close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but also for his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas, used by software engineers and other skilled workers in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.

His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally, but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas. Advertisement As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.

I’d be surprised if it’s true because at any given point there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs in tech.” Responding to Masad, Musk dismissed the notion of job displacement by foreign talent, highlighting the chronic scarcity of skilled engineers in Silicon Valley. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,” he wrote. There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024 Musk’s remarks align with ongoing discussions in the tech industry about the need for diverse talent pools to address a growing demand for skilled professionals in areas like artificial intelligence, software engineering, and data science. Advertisement The conversation gains significance amidst controversy over the appointment of Indian-American businessman Sriram Krishnan as a senior policy advisor on artificial intelligence in the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. While some hail Krishnan’s appointment as a step forward for AI policy, others argue that foreign workers, particularly those on H-1B visas, are being hired at lower wages, allegedly displacing American talent. Musk rejected this perspective, labelling it as a “fixed pie” fallacy. “There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!” he said, urging a focus on innovation and growth rather than competition for existing roles.

Meetings at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate with tech leaders emphasize discussions on policies, manufacturing, and job creation. Musk faces backlash over his support for the H-1B visa program, highlighting the tension between tech industry priorities and Trump’s “America First” agenda. In a surprising development, President-elect Donald Trump shared on social media that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had requested a meeting with him. The post, which appeared to be directed at Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , highlights the increasing number of influential figures engaging with Trump as he prepared to take office. This revelation sheds light on the dynamics of high-profile meetings taking place at Mar-a-Lago , Trump’s Florida estate, which has become a hub for discussions with tech industry leaders. These interactions come amid significant developments in policy, criticism of key figures, and speculation about the influence of such meetings on the incoming administration. Bill Gates requests meeting with Donald Trump addressing Elon Musk In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump disclosed that Bill Gates had expressed interest in meeting him. Addressing Elon Musk in the post, Trump wrote, “Where are you? When are you coming to the ‘Center of the Universe,’ Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates asked to come, tonight. We miss you and X! New Year’s Eve is going to be AMAZING!!! DJT.” The post also made an apparent reference to Musk’s son, X Æ A-Xii, often affectionately called ""X."" Sources close to the situation revealed that Gates had reached out regarding a possible meet-up with Trump. However, no official confirmation about the meeting has been provided. This marks yet another instance of tech industry leaders seeking face time with Trump as he readies his administration for a January inauguration. Elon Musk and the visa program controversy The timing of Trump’s post coincides with mounting criticism directed at Elon Musk, who was recently named co-leader of Trump’s government efficiency program. Musk faced backlash for his support of the H-1B visa program, which facilitates the entry of highly skilled foreign workers into the U.S. While the program has been championed by many in the tech industry, it has also drawn criticism for potentially displacing domestic workers, a concern that aligns with Trump’s “America First” rhetoric. Despite the controversy, Musk has maintained his role in fostering discussions between the tech sector and the incoming administration. His involvement highlights the delicate balancing act faced by tech leaders navigating policy priorities and public sentiment under the new administration. Mar-a-Lago: A nexus for tech and policy discussions Mar-a-Lago has emerged as a focal point for meetings between Trump and prominent figures from the tech industry. In the weeks following his election victory, Trump has hosted several tech CEOs at his Florida estate, many of whom represent Fortune 500 companies. These leaders have reportedly donated significant sums to Trump’s inauguration fund, further emphasizing the high stakes involved in fostering relationships with the incoming administration. Sources familiar with these gatherings told CNN that the meetings often follow a strategic agenda. Many CEOs have tailored their discussions to align with Trump’s priorities, such as revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Amid these discussions, they have also used the opportunity to voice concerns about potential challenges posed by the administration’s policies. These efforts are widely viewed as an attempt to establish favorable relations with Trump before his presidency officially begins. The Gates-Musk-Trump triangle The post by Trump not only revealed Gates’ intention to meet but also underscored Musk’s proximity to the President-elect’s circle. Gates and Musk represent two of the most influential figures in the tech industry, and their interactions with Trump have drawn significant attention. While Gates’ agenda for a potential meeting remains unclear, his involvement adds another layer to the narrative of tech leaders actively engaging with the incoming administration. Similarly, Musk’s dual role as an entrepreneur and an adviser to the administration places him in a unique position. His actions and statements have been closely scrutinized as he navigates the complexities of supporting Trump’s initiatives while addressing the concerns of the broader tech community. Implications of high-profile meetings The ongoing meetings between Trump and tech leaders have sparked widespread speculation about their implications. For Trump, these engagements allow him to project an image of inclusivity and collaboration with industry leaders. For the tech executives, the meetings serve as an opportunity to influence policy decisions and establish rapport with the administration. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the transparency and motives behind these interactions. Questions about whether these meetings prioritize public interest or corporate gain remain unanswered. Furthermore, the involvement of major corporations in funding Trump’s inauguration has prompted scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the influence of money in shaping policy.

(Brandon Bell/Pool vía AP, Archivo) By Associated Press PUBLISHED: December 27, 2024 at 11:25 AM PST | UPDATED: December 27, 2024 at 4:37 PM PST By MICHELLE L. PRICE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Vivek Ramaswamy arrives at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024, to meet with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., and billionaire Elon Musk as they convene a meeting of the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as envisioned by President-elect Donald Trump. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world’s richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump’s movement but his stance on the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations. The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers. That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture ""has venerated mediocrity over excellence,"" leading to a nation that does ""not produce the best engineers."" ""There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,"" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app. Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa. How did the most recent H-1B debate begin? The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be ""not America First policy"" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the ""White House A.I. & Crypto Czar."" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for. Who qualifies for an H-1B visa? U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a ""theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,"" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field. Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working. How many workers receive H-1B visas? The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that. However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program. What countries do H-1B recipients come from? More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report. What's the debate about H-1B visas? Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Some investigations, including a 2017 report from CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers. What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas? Trump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has ""always been in favor of the visas."" ""I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,"" he added.

PRICE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.

But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,” he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump’s own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

PRICE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump’s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump’s movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump’s Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer’s comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump’s world and what his political movement stands for. Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.

As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a “Buy American and Hire American” executive order , which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. Trump’s businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club , and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers. During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country” and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges. “I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” he told the “All-In” podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world. Those comments came on the cusp of Trump’s budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) A ""civil war"" of sorts broke out over the weekend in MAGA world, pitting far-right Trump supporters against the billionaire tech-bro contingent. The fight started Sunday when President-elect Trump announced he'd chosen venture capitalist and India native Sriram Krishnan as a senior policy adviser on artificial intelligence. That ""triggered an anti-Indian backlash,"" per Axios , which notes that part of the pushback against Krishnan has centered on his advocacy for lifting caps on H-1B visas. More: H-1B: CNN notes that this specific visa program allows 65,000 ""highly skilled"" workers into the US annually, with another 20,000 granted the paperwork if they obtained an advanced degree in the US. The tech sector especially makes use of this visa—including Trump ally Elon Musk, who first came to the US as a foreign student and then worked here on an H-1B visa. Ready, set, fight: Newsweek has a timeline, starting with a series of disparaging tweets from Trump loyalist Laura Loomer. On Monday, she called the selection of Krishnan ""deeply disturbing,"" adding that his views are ""in direct opposition"" to Trump's ""America First"" agenda. In a follow-up tweet on Christmas Eve, she noted ""our country was built by white Europeans, actually. Not third world invaders from India."" Musk: The new Trump BFF weighed in next in support of drawing highly skilled workers from other countries, writing on Christmas: ""The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win."" Ramaswamy: Vivek Ramaswamy's comments came Thursday, spurring accusations of ""elitist rhetoric,"" per the Times of India . In a lengthy tweet , Ramaswamy accused American culture of fostering ""mediocrity."" ""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,"" he wrote. ""More movies like Whiplash , fewer reruns of Friends . More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons."" More reaction: Other big names in the GOP sphere pushed back at Musk and Ramaswamy. ""There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,"" posted former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. ""We should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers."" Ex-Rep. Matt Gaetz weighed in on the ""tech bros"": ""We did not ask them to engineer an immigration policy."" Musk turns on Loomer: When Loomer insinuated that a rift was growing between Trump and his Silicon Valley pals, and that DOGE is a ""vanity project,"" Musk called her a ""troll,"" per the New Republic . Loomer also insisted Friday that Musk was retaliating by taking away her blue check and subscriptions on X, the social media platform he owns. Trump's take: The former and future commander in chief slammed restricted H-1B visas somewhat during his first term. However, in a podcast this past June, Trump appeared to have softened his stance, noting that he believed any foreign national who graduated from an American college should be eligible for permanent residency. What's next? Per Axios, this ""tense MAGA vs. DOGE moment"" will ""potentially settle a looming conflict over who has the most influence in Trump 2.0—his historic base or his newfound techno-libertarian allies."" ""It's a sign of future conflicts,"" warns Samuel Hammond, senior economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, per the Washington Post . ""This is like the pregame.""

(AP) — An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House. The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement — wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry — and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies. The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer , a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump’s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Loomer declared the stance to be “not America First policy” and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves. Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns. Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks , whom Trump has tapped to be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar."" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government , weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history. Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect , was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers. Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded. Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,"" he said in a post. “It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.” Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration , including family-based visas. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program “very bad” and “unfair” for U.S. workers.

Tech Leads a Broad Selloff. By Connor Smith The stock market’s declines accelerated in midday trading. The Dow was down 502 points, or 1.1%. The S&P 500 was down 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2%. With virtually no news on the docket and trading thin for the holiday-shortened week, technology stocks were an especially large drag. The S&P’s tech sector was down 1.8%, followed by consumer discretionary with a decline of 1.6%. The communication services sector was down 1.2%. On the flip side, energy was up 0.6%, with WTI crude oil futures up 0.8%. The iShares Semiconductor ETF was down 1.9%, while the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF was down 3%. Wall Street flocked to chips and megacap technology stocks earlier this month, but now the former favorites are leading the rest of the market lower. Citi's U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert writes that valuations and implicit growth expectations have set a high bar for the stock market in the year ahead. ""Overall, this setup, plus the lack of real correction in some time, does leave the market more susceptible to increasing bouts of volatility,"" Chronert writes.

Bloomberg via Getty Images Vivek Ramaswamy got quite a strong reaction from conservatives when he tried to explain hiring trends across the tech sector in a culturally-charged social media post on Thursday. In an extended post shared on X , the tech entrepreneur wrote about how “top companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over ‘native’ Americans,” claiming the imbalance “isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation)” but rather because of differences on the societal level. Advertisement “A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture,” Ramaswamy continued, before telling readers, “Tough questions demand tough answers & if we’re really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH.” The CEO-turned-politician’s assessment? That “American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” Ramaswamy suggested that entertainment has had an outsized impact on shaping mainstream American values “at least since the 90s and likely longer.” Advertisement “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he claimed. The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over “native” Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation). A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if… — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 26, 2024 Comparing and contrasting characters from several popular ’90s sitcoms, Ramaswamy went on to say, “A culture that venerates Cory from Boy Meets World, or Zach & Slater over Screech in Saved by the Bell, or Stefan over Steve Urkel in Family Matters, will not produce the best engineers.” Advertisement His solution? “More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons. More books, less TV. More creating, less ‘chillin.’ More extracurriculars, less ‘hanging out at the mall.’” While Ramaswamy’s point about pop culture seemed reasonable enough, the entrepreneur’s diagnosis veered into problematic over-generalisations when he claimed the difference boiled down to families’ cultural and geographic backgrounds. “Most normal American parents look sceptically at ‘those kinds of parents,’” he wrote. “More normal American kids view such ‘those kinds of kids’ with scorn. If you grow up aspiring to normalcy, normalcy is what you will achieve.” Advertisement “Now close your eyes & visualise which families you knew in the 90s (or even now) who raise their kids according to one model versus the other,” Ramaswamy goaded. “Be brutally honest.” Vivek Ramaswamy ignited a firestorm of debate about the tech industry's reliance on migrant workers with his post. Bloomberg via Getty Images Turning back to America’s supposed inclination toward the average, he said, “‘Normalcy’ doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent” and that “if we pretend like it does, we’ll have our asses handed to us by China.” Advertisement Ramaswamy then tried to rally readers to help shift the status quo by envisioning a future where America “once again prioritizes achievement over normalcy; excellence over mediocrity; nerdiness over conformity; hard work over laziness.” While he pinned demographic disparities across the tech world on supposed cultural differences, the imbalance is more likely about dollars and cents. In 2020, a study by the Economic Policy Institute found that employers that rely on America’s H-1B visa program to recruit temporary employees with “highly specialised” skills and technical education often pay those workers well below the market wages. Advertisement Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook have all made robust use of the program to fill job shortages. With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to implement a draconian deportation strategy when he assumes office next month, conservatives still seem to be at odds over how to approach the labor shortages troubling many of America’s biggest and most profitable businesses. Though Tesla CEO Elon Musk, like Ramaswamy, has vowed to be behind Trump’s harsh immigration policies, on Wednesday he posted that “the number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” and the country needs “to recruit top talent wherever they may be.” Advertisement But Ramaswamy and Musk’s reasoning really seemed to rub some of their conservative peers the wrong way. Trump’s former rival for the 2024 Republican presidential candidacy, Nikki Haley, reposted Ramaswamy’s message saying, “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture. All you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing and prioritising in Americans, not foreign workers.” Far-right firebrand Laura Loomer invoked the racist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory in her criticism, where she claimed, “It’s not racist against Indians to want the original MAGA policies I voted for. I voted for a reduction in H1B visas. Not an extension.” Advertisement Go To Homepage Suggest a correction | Submit a tip"

This boost contributes to a positive outlook within the sector, as other major players like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) show modest gains of 0.19% and 0.95%, respectively. The presence of green across major chip stocks hints at renewed investor optimism fueled perhaps by expectations of robust demand or favorable market conditions. 🔍 Tech Sector: A Mixed Bag The broader technology sector is facing mixed results. Microsoft (MSFT) is down slightly by 0.14%, indicating some investor hesitation. However, Oracle (ORCL) manages a meager uptick of 0.04%. In contrast, software applications see slight positivity with Intuit (INTU) up 0.11%, showing sustained confidence in software solutions. 🚗 Consumer Cyclical & Communication Services: Tesla Triumph In the consumer cyclical sector, Tesla (TSLA) impresses with a 1.13% increase. This gain underscores market confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's outlook amidst increasing global interest in sustainable transportation. Amazon (AMZN) also contributes a positive note with a 0.64% rise, reinforcing strength in internet retail. Communication services present a calm outlook with Google (GOOGL) nearly flat and Meta (META) climbing 0.30%, signaling steady faith in digital advertising prospects. 🏦 Financial Sector: Gathering Momentum Financial stocks exhibit a positive trend with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advancing 0.52%, suggesting optimism in banking resilience. Visa (V) inches up 0.32%, reflecting stability in credit services. 🏠 Softness in Real Estate Real estate continues to face softness, notably American Tower (AMT) dropping by 0.98%, highlighting some investor apprehension possibly due to interest rate concerns impacting real estate investment trusts (REITs). 📚 Overall Market Analysis The semiconductor rally, led by Avago, indicates an uplift driven by potential industry advancements or investor sentiment shifts favoring chip stocks. Mixed trends in the technology and real estate sectors suggest caution, while resilience in consumer cyclical and financial sectors supports a balanced market stance. Investors should monitor semiconductor movements closely for continued growth, while diversification into consumer and financial stocks could hedge against tech sector volatility.

After rising by as much as 13% early, the quantum-computing company's share price was down by 1.3% as of 12:30 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were both up 0.2%. Expand NYSE : IONQ IonQ Today's Change ( -1.72 %) $ -0.95 Current Price $ 54.42 Key Data Points Market Cap $20B Day's Range $ 53.72 - $ 56.03 52wk Range $ 17.88 - $ 84.64 Volume 17M Avg Vol 28M Gross Margin -747.41 % Dividend Yield N/A IonQ stock initially gained ground following bullish coverage from DA Davidson. However, the stock has been highly volatile amid the market's response to Wednesday's interest rate news from the Federal Reserve, and IonQ shares have been down by as much as 2.8% in the session. IonQ started today up big on bullish analyst coverage Before the market opened Thursday, DA Davidson published a note initiating coverage on IonQ stock with a buy rating. The firm's analysts assigned a one-year price target of $50 per share on the stock. As of this writing, that would imply upside of around 35%. DA Davidson sees IonQ as a compelling pure play in the quantum-computing space and thinks that the company is positioned to capitalize on rapid growth in the category. The firm's analysts also believe that its trapped-ion qubit architecture offers advantages compared to approaches used by larger competitors including Alphabet and IBM . IonQ's share price initially surged following DA Davidson's coverage, but those gains evaporated as the market digested the Fed's 2025 outlook for interest rates. Interest rate news is driving a tech-sector pivot On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee served up another 25-basis-point cut to the benchmark federal funds rate, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that investors can only expect two additional rate cuts in 2025. Investors broadly had been expecting four rate cuts next year, and that less aggressive forecast led to big sell-offs in the stock market. While tech stocks are climbing back Thursday, the gains have been concentrated among reliable large-cap names. In response to the softer outlook for rate cuts next year, investors are pivoting away from speculative growth stocks and toward mega-cap names that are considered lower risk and more reliable. Quantum-computing stocks have otherwise enjoyed a recent surge of bullish momentum, with some investors looking to the category as a potential ""next big thing"" in the tech sector. But stocks in that category could be in for high levels of volatility in the near term if concerns about interest rates, inflation, and other macroeconomic risk factors continue to cause investors to lean toward safer tech stocks."

https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366617238/Top-10-women-in-tech-and-diversity-in-tech-stories-of-2024,,Top 10 women in tech and diversity in tech stories of 2024,20241219T104500Z,https://www.computerweekly.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/HeroImages/teamwork-collaboration-brainstorming-Flamingo-Images-adobe.jpg,computerweekly.com,English,United Kingdom,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"Flamingo Images - stock.adobe.co By Clare McDonald, Business Editor Published: 19 Dec 2024 10:00 This year signalled a worrying time for diversity, equity and inclusion in the technology sector as many firms began rolling back their initiatives and efforts. This lack of commitment led many notable diversity organisations to dial back their own efforts, not wanting to contribute to allowing firms to pretend to be making a difference rather than actually turning the dial. As the year bows out, many questions still remain about how the diversity landscape will look next year in the UK’s tech sector. 1. Proposed changes to investment thresholds highlights lack of funding diversity At the beginning of the year, women in the technology and finance sectors mobilised to reverse a government decisions which threatened to cause a diversity rift for startup funding. Following a consultation, HM Treasury decided to change the criteria for what defines a “high-net-worth individual” , making it more difficult for women to become angel investors. MP Caroline Dinenage backed the investHER campaign , which called for a change in the new law, and eventually the decision was reversed. 2. BCS report shows lack of improvement in tech diversity Research from BCS, expanding on the organisation’s study from before the pandemic, found that growth of diversity in the UK’s tech sector has been slow in the past five years. Using women in tech as an example, the research found the number of women who make up UK tech professionals was 20% in 2022, only a 4% increase since 2018. 3. Misunderstanding and underrepresentation blocking tech diversity There is lots of debate about what exactly prevents people from underrepresented groups choosing a tech sector career. The Institute of Coding claimed in some research that people aren’t fully sure what a role in the technology sector involved, and this misunderstanding, alongside the lack of representation of the UK’s general population among those in tech roles, is a huge barrier for those considering a career in tech. 4. Everywoman announces 2024 Women in Tech Awards winners In the summer of 2024, network for women in business, Everywoman , announced the winners of this year’s technology awards, in partnership with Bupa. ‘Empower. Transform. Thrive’ was the theme this year, with much of the conversation surrounding the importance of increasing the visibility and accessibility of female role models in the tech sector to encourage others into tech. 5. Everyone involved – expert advice surrounding D&I in tech Each year, Computer Weekly, alongside its partner Harvey Nash, hosts a diversity in technology event to discuss subjects relating to the topic and to announce its list of the most influential women in UK technology. The writeup from the 2023 event was released this year, including advice from tech experts on how to promote diversity and inclusion in tech businesses and why everyone needs to be involved where diversity, equity and inclusion is involved. 6. Knowledge24: ‘You can’t go it alone’ in life, says actress Viola Davis As part of ServiceNow’s Knowledge24 event, actress Viola Davis spoke on her career, on women in tech, and on the importance of supporting those around you both in your career and in your life. Stating that you “can’t go it alone” in life, Davis explained how mentorship and help from others massively helped her through her career, mirroring the conversation in the technology sector surrounding the importance of role models for encouraging others to pursue a tech role. 7. Having female AI decision-makers is a priority for 37% of UK business leaders Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in both life and business, leaving many concerned about the diversity of the teams who are developing it. Research from IBM found that business leaders in the UK believe that making sure women are in decision-making positions in the technology sector will be vital for ensuring AI and other technologies are developed with everyone in mind. 8. Tech Talent Charter to disband after nearly 10 years of operation After its annual report found that the tech industry is dialling back on diversity initiatives , the Tech Talent Charter announced it would be disbanding after nearly 10 years in operation. As it closed its doors , it issued a call to action to the industry not to go backwards in its efforts to improve the industry, giving advice on what to do next. 9. Women face greater risk of job displacement from automation The industry’s concern that not having women involved in the development of technologies such as AI would have a detrimental affect on some user groups was confirmed by research from Code First Girls and Tech Talent Charter. Job automation is 40% more likely to affect women than men , according to the joint research, though this could be improved with ongoing training. 10. From beauty model to tech role model – this year’s most influential woman in UK tech In 2024, Sheridan Ash, co-CEO of technology education charity Tech She Can, became the 13th person to be named Computer Weekly’s most influential woman in UK tech . The announcement was made alongside the rest of the top 50 , as well as Computer Weekly’s 2024 Rising Stars , and the list of women in tech Hall of Famers .

I recall a key moment in my career when I was part of a team working on a project involving AI in healthcare . The possibilities seemed endless as we explored how AI could revolutionise precision medicine , accelerate drug discovery, and enhance diagnostics. It was then that I realised the immense potential AI holds in personalising treatment options for patients. Emerging trends like IoT, cloud computing, and big data are not just buzzwords; they are transforming how we collect, analyse, and utilise healthcare data. Imagine a future where real-time, data-driven decisions empower businesses to operate with unprecedented efficiency. This is the future I see – where technology converges to make healthcare more effective and accessible. For women aspiring to make their mark in the tech industry, my journey has taught me a few invaluable lessons. Firstly, hold onto curiosity like it’s your compass. Keep asking, keep exploring, keep learning. Early on, curiosity nudged me into unknown territories, fueled by mentors who cheered on my hunger for knowledge. Secondly, build your tribe – a network of support that believes in your potential and stands ready to guide you. With them, you’ll muster the guts to tackle challenges, weather rough patches, and toast to victories. Lastly, see challenges as chances to grow. Don’t dodge tough gigs or unfamiliar turf. For me, seeking mentors was like finding a lighthouse in the fog – they share wisdom, broaden horizons, and guide you to new opportunities.

Companies are introducing unique benefits such as unlimited sick leave, mental health days, and time off to spend with pets or aging grandparents, aiming to boost productivity and retain the young workforce. The India Technology Industry Compensation Benchmarking Survey 2024, conducted by Deloitte India and Nasscom across 200 tech firms, highlights this trend. It reveals that companies are earmarking ""well-being days"" and offering joining bonuses with a two-year clawback clause. ""With Gen Z prioritising work-life balance, mental health, and professional growth, it's essential for companies to adapt their approaches to attract and retain this emerging talent,"" states the report. The initiatives aren't just about attracting talent but also about preventing burnout and promoting long-term productivity. Firms are integrating upskilling programs in AI, improving women’s representation, and aligning rewards with the aspirations of the younger workforce. As per the survey, companies are increasingly flexible, allowing employees to personalise their work hours and locations to strike a better work-life balance. Vishal B, a 27-year-old employee at an MNC in Hyderabad, shared how his company has introduced a ""well-being week"" for mental health. ""We get a day off to take care of ourselves. The company also reimburses gym memberships and provides Rs 25,000 annually for well-being equipment,"" he said. Another IT professional, Saketh S, highlighted how ""live music days,"" ""grandparents' day,"" and ""journaling day"" keep employees motivated. ""These initiatives help us unwind and return to work with pumped-up energy,"" he added. Tech entrepreneurs acknowledge the changing dynamics of the workforce. ""I have noticed that Gen Z needs more emotional support. They need their space. Be it in communicating or vacation hours, we are more flexible with them. It is also true that though they might ask for more leave, they give more than 100% when at work,"" said Gopi Krishna Lakkepuram, founder of Hyperleap AI. Live Events With the younger generation prioritising mental health and flexibility, India’s tech industry is adapting quickly to these demands, creating a healthier and more engaged workforce while redefining what it means to be an employer of choice.

Today, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son pledged a $100 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years. He and Trump appeared together at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Other tech moguls have made trips there, too. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Sam Altman all donated to Trump's inaugural fund. To help us understand what the tech executives might want in return, we're joined by NPR's Bobby Allyn. Hi there. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Let's start with today's news. The chief executive of Japan-based SoftBank stood next to Trump and announced this $100 billion investment. What more can you tell us about him? ALLYN: Yeah, Masayoshi Son, he's known as Masa. He runs SoftBank, which is a very influential investor in the tech world. And like you mentioned, standing alongside President-elect Donald Trump, Son said the $100 billion pledge to invest in artificial intelligence businesses and other ventures was, according to him, an indication of how confident he feels about Trump's economic policies. But pretty immediately, Ari, there were skeptics and questions, right? Bloomberg pointed out that SoftBank has just about $25 billion in cash on its balance sheet - well short of the pledge. Now, SoftBank does have holdings in tech companies that far exceed the pledge amount, but how exactly Son would find the additional capital for the $100 billion is unknown. But the important thing here is that he is the latest tech mogul - as you mentioned, Ari - to make a really big splash with his support for President-elect Donald Trump. SHAPIRO: What are some of the others doing? ALLYN: Yeah, many of them are writing checks for Trump's inaugural fund, which is kind of the slush fund that pays for the swearing-in ceremony, inaugural balls, parties, dinners and the like. So far, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos have each pledged a million dollars - Altman on behalf of himself and the others on behalf of their companies. Now, tech executives have donated to inaugural funds in the past, but what is really different this time is that the companies are trying to draw a lot of attention to the donations with public statements. Whereas, before, Ari, it was just happening kind of quietly behind closed doors. SHAPIRO: Why are they being more public this time? ALLYN: Yeah, well, it appears like an attempt to give the donations more prominence, perhaps with the hope of getting Trump's attention. That's what Margaret O'Mara thinks, at least. She's a Silicon Valley historian at the University of Washington, and she told me tech companies making a big deal about the inaugural donations is something new. And she says it's motivated primarily by two things, right? First, trying to repair relationships with Trump. Remember, many of these CEOs - including Zuckerberg - have sparred with Trump over the years, and they don't want to be in the administration's cross hairs this time around. Secondly, O'Mara says currying favor with Trump could just mean fewer regulations. MARGARET O'MARA: The opportunity to get the regulatory threat off of their backs and go back to being able to self-regulate, which is something that the internet industry generally has been enjoying by-and-large since the 1990s - it's how these companies got so big. ALLYN: Yeah, and she says tech company shareholders are hoping for fewer rules and regulations as well because that could, of course, translate into greater profits. SHAPIRO: Right. Then there's the billionaire with Trump's ear - Elon Musk. How do the other tech execs see him? ALLYN: Yeah. Some see Musk, you know, of course, another tech billionaire, as an ally - a potential line into the White House. Others aren't so sure. Musk runs six companies of his own, and Trump has tapped him to do, you know, these massive federal spending cuts. And the question really is, will Musk push the government to make changes that benefit the entire tech industry, or will Musk push policies that are just tailored to give his own companies, like Tesla and SpaceX, a boost? So definitely some mixed opinions about how Musk might just play into tech policy under Trump. SHAPIRO: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you. ALLYN: Thanks, Ari. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Known for her relentless drive, Su is often seen sending out important memos at midnight and expects her team to engage in detailed discussions of these documents during early-morning meetings. This demanding leadership style is part of her broader approach to transforming AMD into a major player in the tech industry, a feat that earned her the title of Time’s CEO of the Year for 2024. Su's management approach may not be for everyone. Patrick Moorhead, a tech industry analyst and former AMD executive, emphasized that individuals who fail to meet the company's rigorous standards often struggle to thrive. In an interview with Time , he remarked that Su's hard-charging leadership style requires full commitment, and those who don't deliver are unlikely to succeed in her team. A Demanding Culture Fueled by Ambition Under Su's leadership, AMD has become one of the most successful semiconductor companies, expanding its market capitalization dramatically. Her approach is driven by ambitious goals and a clear belief in pushing boundaries. She often stresses that people are motivated by big targets, saying, “People are really motivated by ambitious goals. The previous strategy of, 'Hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there' — that’s actually less motivational.” AMD CEO Lisa Su Su's dedication to excellence goes beyond just setting high standards for her team. She personally reviews prototype chips as soon as they arrive from the factory, displaying a keen attention to detail. Her ability to juggle high-level strategy while staying involved in the minutiae of product development has earned her respect within the company and the tech industry as a whole. Lisa Su's Path to Leadership Su's journey to the top of AMD is as impressive as her leadership style. Born in Taiwan, she immigrated to the United States at the age of three. Raised in New York City, Su was exposed to the world of technology early, and her curiosity in math and programming blossomed at a young age. Her father, a graduate student in mathematics, further fueled her interest in engineering through rigorous sessions at the dinner table. After excelling in her studies in the Bronx, Su pursued a degree in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she completed both her master's and Ph.D. Over the course of her career, she worked at Texas Instruments and IBM, gaining valuable experience before joining AMD in 2012 as a Senior Vice President. Just two years later, she made history by becoming the first female CEO of the company. Su credits much of her success to the diverse roles she took on early in her career. Reflecting on this, she told Time, “I was really lucky early in my career. Every two years, I did a different thing.” Her broad experience allowed her to navigate complex challenges and lead AMD through a period of remarkable growth. As CEO, Su has been instrumental in AMD's rise to prominence, helping the company compete head-to-head with industry giants like Intel and Nvidia. Under her leadership, AMD’s stock price has surged nearly 50-fold, a clear testament to her strategic vision and execution. While some may find her work style daunting, Su believes that leadership is not an inherent trait but a skill that can be developed. “I don’t believe leaders are born. I believe leaders are trained,” she stated. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

These actions reflect a broader trend of escalating trade measures affecting the global tech landscape. This chart, via Visual Capitalist's Kayla Zhu, shows China-specific tariffs imposed by countries on products from China’s tech sector. This does not include other general tariffs which may also apply to Chinese products. The data comes from Rest of World and is updated as of November 2024. China’s EV Sector Under Heavy Tariffs Below, we show tariffs various countries and regions have imposed on China’s tech industry. Tariffs have gained renewed focus ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, and his pro-tariff agenda . The Biden administration hasn’t shied away from trade measures against China either. In May 2024, the U.S. raised tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles from 25% to 100% –as well as several other products–citing concerns over manufacturing overcapacity and its impact on global markets. Four countries or regions, including the U.S., have specific tariffs targeting China’s electric vehicle industry, which is quickly skyrocketing in market share with exports surging 13,300% to $42 billion in 2023. China currently accounts for nearly 70% of global EV production. China’s EV industry success is driven by comprehensive government support, including manufacturer subsidies, a massive domestic market, and vertical integration in the supply chain. The EU’s recent tariff action on Chinese electric vehicles was prompted by the industry’s rapid growth, with its market share rising from 3.9% to 25% between 2020 and 2023, fueling concerns about the future of European automotive jobs and industry sustainability.

An ETF is a basket of securities grouped into a single fund, meaning you can instantly invest in dozens of stocks with just one investment. Whether you're short on time or are simply looking for a low-maintenance way to invest, opting for ETFs can help build a diversified portfolio with far less effort than buying individual stocks. There are countless ETFs to choose from, and the right option for you will depend on your goals and individual preferences. But there's one powerful ETF I'm stocking up on in 2025 and beyond: the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) . A tech powerhouse to supercharge your savings The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a tech-specific fund containing 314 stocks from all corners of the technology industry. This fund is heavily focused on major players in the tech sector, with its three largest holdings ( Apple , Nvidia , and Microsoft , respectively) making up close to 45% of the entire fund. The other 311 stocks, then, each make up a much smaller percentage of the ETF. This mix of industry leaders with smaller corporations can help balance risk and reward. You'll gain a stake in tech titans like Apple and Nvidia, but you can also take advantage of the diversification perks of investing in hundreds of stocks at once. If you're looking for a way to buy into the tech sector with less effort, this ETF could be a smart option. This industry, specifically, has had an enormous impact on the market overall, accounting for much of the gains we've seen in recent years. In fact, over the last 10 years, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has earned an average rate of return of 20.59% per year. At that rate, if you were to invest, say, $200 per month, you could accumulate more than $1.2 million after 25 years. One major risk to consider before you buy Perhaps the biggest risk with investing in a tech-focused ETF is that this industry tends to be more volatile than more established sectors of the market. The tech field often experiences explosive returns when the market is thriving, but the downturns tend to be more severe, too. Case in point: During the last bear market between January and October 2022, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC +0.21% ) fell by around 25%. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF, though, dropped by nearly 35% in that time. ^SPX data by YCharts. Again, though, the good times can often make up for these slumps. Since the new bull market began in October 2022, this ETF is up by 114% compared to around 70% for the S&P 500. ^SPX data by YCharts. Of course, nobody knows whether these returns will stay consistent going forward, and there's always a chance this ETF may not beat the market at all. But when you're investing in more volatile funds, be prepared to ride out lower lows before you reach the higher highs. The easiest way to protect your portfolio If you do choose to invest in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, it's wise to double-check that the rest of your portfolio is properly diversified. Investing solely in the tech sector raises your risk substantially, so you'll want to ensure you're also investing in plenty of stocks from other industries to better protect against volatility. That could mean investing in a broad-market fund like an S&P 500 ETF or total stock market ETF, which would instantly expose you to stocks from a wide range of industries. Or you may choose to build a custom portfolio filled with individual stocks from areas outside of the tech sector. If you're willing to take on slightly more risk for the chance at earning above-average returns, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be a fantastic buy heading into 2025. As part of a well-diversified portfolio, it could potentially supercharge your earnings with practically zero effort on your part."

Seawall won’t stopocean’s relentless march Re: “ Key decision made in battle over seawall construction ” (Page A1, Dec. 1). “The ocean can yawn and snap an aircraft carrier in two,” said my instructor, a senior Navy Commander with over 20 years of at-sea service. Building seawalls to protect houses is a waste of time and an insult to the ocean. Choosing to build adjacent to the coast is fine, but your time will be limited. Eventually, the ocean, ever-powerful, will move in and take your abode. Understand this and know there’s nothing you can do to stop it. James Thurber Half Moon Bay We must make highereducation affordable Re: “ Anti-immigrant efforts will hurt the tech sector ” (Page A6, Nov. 29). The problem for the tech sector is that it costs too much to get an education in today’s America, especially at a prestigious university. College is mostly a luxury for the majority of youth with working-class parents unless they are gifted with a talent. It is hard to prioritize a college education in California if your family needs your help to pay the rent. Silicon Valley presents the perfect opportunity especially when many bright tech leaders are retiring. Too bad these opportunities are not available to more Americans. Patricia Marquez Rutt Redwood City Stop shining spotlighton school shooters Re: “ Today in history ” (Page A2, Nov. 30). Names of vile, children-murdering school shooters should rarely be disclosed or acknowledged in the media. Newsrooms must be more empathetic when mass shooters’ names are printed. Publicizing their identities glorifies their actions, giving these monsters the attention they desperately sought. It shifts focus from the victims and their families, who are left to relive agonizing pain and grapple with unimaginable grief while their loved ones’ names fade from the headlines. By focusing on the shooters, the media inadvertently amplifies their notoriety and grants them further time in the spotlight. It’s time to prioritize the lives lost and the lasting impact on communities, rather than turning tragedies into platforms for killers to gain posthumous fame. Let’s protect and dignify victims by refusing to perpetuate the prestige of their tormentors.

While there's nothing wrong with opting for individual stocks, to do it well, you'll need to heavily research each company you're interested in buying. A properly diversified portfolio should contain at least 25 to 30 stocks, and not everyone has the time or interest to build a personally customized set of investments. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » An ETF's portfolio can contain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of stocks, but these funds trade like stocks themselves, giving investors the ability to get diversified exposure with a single investment. Growth ETFs, specifically, are designed to beat the market over time, and these three funds could supercharge your long-term earnings with practically zero effort. 1. Vanguard Growth ETF The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) contains shares of 182 companies with a median market cap of $1.4 trillion. Around 58% of the fund is allocated to stocks in the tech sector; its largest holdings include industry leaders like Apple , Nvidia , and Microsoft . This particular ETF can be a smart choice for those looking to balance risk and reward. Growth ETFs -- especially those that are heavily weighted toward the tech sector -- are generally riskier than many other types of funds. While this fund is no exception, its top 10 holdings make up more than 57% of the entire ETF's value. Because they are juggernaut companies that are more likely to survive periods of volatility, that can decrease the risk that the ETF will underperform. The other 172 stocks, by contrast, are from smaller companies that have greater chances of experiencing explosive growth. Over the past 10 years, this ETF has earned an average annual return of 15.17% per year -- substantially higher than the market's historic average of around 10% per year. If you were to invest $2,000 in it right now and never make any additional contributions, if the ETF continued to produce a 15% annualized return, in 30 years, your position would grow to more than $132,000. 2. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF The Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHG) is similar to the Vanguard Growth ETF in many ways, but it's slightly broader and more diverse. It contains 230 stocks, with only around 49% of its value allocated to the tech sector. Greater diversification can help reduce your risk, especially when your stocks are more evenly spread across multiple industries. The tech sector, for example, tends to be hit harder than other sectors during periods of economic volatility, and though this ETF still leans heavily on that industry, it's not as tech-focused as some other growth ETFs. Story Continues Despite being slightly more diversified, this ETF still packs a punch. Its average annualized return over the last 10 years was 16.10% per year, which is slightly higher than the Vanguard fund. If it maintains that growth rate, investing $2,000 right now (with no additional contributions) and holding on for 30 years would leave you with a position worth around $172,000. 3. Vanguard Information Technology ETF The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) is a bit different from the other two funds in that it's entirely dedicated to the tech sector. It contains 314 stocks from various areas of the information technology industry, from semiconductors to systems software to technology hardware and more. Many of the largest stocks in the fund overlap with the top positions in the other two funds. Its three largest holdings are Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, but they comprise a larger percentage of the portfolio compared to the other ETFs on this list. In fact, those three stocks alone make up close to 45% of the entire fund. Because this ETF is less diversified than the other two, it's also the riskiest of the three. If you choose to buy shares of this fund, it would be wise to also invest in at least one other ETF that's more diversified, as investing only in the tech sector puts your portfolio at greater risk of steep declines during market downturns. Greater risk can sometimes come with greater reward, however. This ETF's 10-year average annualized return is a whopping 20.37%. If it's able to maintain that level of returns, a single $2,000 investment could grow into around $475,000 after 30 years. Which ETF is right for you? Which funds and stocks you choose to invest in should reflect your risk tolerance and goals. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn higher returns, an industry-specific ETF like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be a good fit for your portfolio. On the other hand, if you'd prefer to limit your risk, recognizing that you're also accepting a less ambitious potential upside, investing in a growth ETF that's broader and more diversified could be a safer move. Funds like the Vanguard Growth ETF and Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF hold positions in large companies from many industries, providing more diversification while still offering above-average returns.

However, technology stocks have a long history of impressive returns. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF ( IGM 0.68% ) at least has an interesting investment focus that hints at the possibility of it being highly rewarding. But there's one problem: What does ""expanded"" mean? What does the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF do? Buying the expanded technology sector sounds like a good thing, but what does that actually mean? It isn't easy to find that information, which is basically hidden three layers deep. On the exchange-traded fund's (ETF's) website, you find that it is meant to provide exposure to the technology sector and, for the expanded part, technology-related businesses in the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. It takes a little bit of effort, and a review of the prospectus, to figure out that the ETF does this by tracking the S&P North American Expanded Technology Sector Index . Image source: Getty Images. As with any index-tracking ETF, the most important thing for an investor to understand is the construction methodology of the index. That is what explains to you what the ETF does, regardless of whether it is expanded or compressed. But you often have to go to the index provider to get more than overly broad descriptions, which is exactly what you'll need to do with iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF. Once you find the methodology document you'll learn that iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF tracks the information technology sector, the interactive home entertainment sub-industry, and the interactive media and services sub-industry, which are all specific sectors within the GICS classification system. Oh, and Netflix . So, that's what expanded means. You get technology stocks and selected stocks from the entertainment and media and services sectors, specifically including Netflix. Fair enough. But is that going to get you to a seven-figure portfolio? The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF: Not a great track record and filled with expensive stocks As the chart above shows, the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF hasn't massively outperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLK 0.85% ) . Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF is basically a technology ETF without the expanded part. So, all in, you aren't particularly getting a massive benefit from reaching beyond technology stocks. But you are paying an expense ratio of 0.41%, which is kind of high considering the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF only charges 0.0945%. That said, both of these ETFs beat an S&P 500 index tracking ETF. However, as Wall Street constantly warns, past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Technology, broadly speaking, has outperformed lately. But it could just as easily end up lagging behind in the future. And a notable reason for that might be that investors have priced a lot of good news into technology stocks. To put some numbers on that, the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF's average price-to-earnings ratio is 41 times compared to a bit over 24 times for the S&P 500 index. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF's average price-to-book ratio is 8.7 times verses about 4.9 times for the S&P 500 index. SPY data by YCharts In other words, the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF looks like it is filled with pricey stocks. It is not uncommon for technology stocks to be expensive, but it heightens risk during market pullbacks. Noting that the broader market and technology stocks are both trading near all-time highs right now, it seems like betting on the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF being a millionaire maker from this (elevated) point is probably a poor risk/reward balance. When, not if, there is a pullback, the drawdown could be severe as investors often dump the most highly valued investments first. Spread out your bets The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF could help you build a million-dollar nest egg. But it doesn't appear that the expanded piece of the puzzle is all that valuable and the overall technology focus is likely adding a lot of valuation risk right now. There's nothing wrong with buying this kind of expensive-to-own ETF, but it might be a better choice to broaden out your portfolio to include more than just technology related investments. And the ""expansion"" offered by iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF isn't going to do that for you, you'll need to consider other investments if you want a truly diversified portfolio ."

Nvidia (NVDA) has taken a significant hit, dropping 2.07%, marking a stark contrast to the generally resilient performance elsewhere. Meanwhile, the utilities and consumer defensive sectors are showing relative strength, offering a safe haven for cautious investors. 📉 Technology & Semiconductors: The tech sector is under pressure, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT) declining by 0.73%, and Adobe (ADBE) slipping by 0.59%. The semiconductor segment is hit hard, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) down 0.68% and Qualcomm (QCOM) losing 0.37%. 🚀 Consumer Defensive & Utilities: In contrast, Walmart (WMT) shows a modest gain of 0.89%, depicting consumer defensive strength, while the likes of Southern Company (SO) up by 0.73% highlight the utility sector's gains. 🌿 Healthcare: Although it's a mixed bag, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up by 0.89%, indicating some positive sentiment in healthcare. Contrastingly, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) remains flat with minimal movement. Market Mood and Trends The overall market sentiment seems cautious amid the continued volatility in the tech sector. Investors appear to be pivoting towards more defensive stocks, perhaps driven by inflation concerns or upcoming economic data. The retreat in semiconductor stocks may be signaling broader industry challenges, amplified by Nvidia's sharp decline. Strategic Recommendations Investors might want to tread carefully and consider increasing their allocations in defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples, which are currently gaining traction. Pay close attention to the tech sector for potential buying opportunities once stability resumes. Staying diversified is key in navigating the current landscape. Monitoring real-time updates will be essential in making informed decisions. Stay connected with ForexLive.com for the latest insights and analyses across the financial markets."

By MarketBeat.com Author Ryan Hasson Stock Markets Published 11/27/2024, 07:14 AM Should Investors Chase Tech Gains Into Year-End? View all comments (2) 2 MarketBeat.com Articles ( 5725 ) | My Homepage Follow US500 0.21% DJI 1.18% MSFT 0.53% AAPL 2.16% NVDA -2.96% XLK -0.85% With just over a month remaining in 2024, the tech sector stands out as one of the year’s top performers. The Technology Select Sector SPDR® Fund (NYSE: XLK ) , which tracks the performance of leading tech stocks, has gained an impressive 21.3% year-to-date. Despite its strong run, XLK shows signs of potential for even more significant gains as it consolidates within an ascending wedge formation, just 1.96% away from its 52-week high. This proximity to a potential breakout raises an important question: Should investors chase further gains in the tech sector as we approach year-end? December’s Seasonal Tailwind Historically, December has been a favorable month for equities. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% gain in December going back to 1928, making it the third-best month of the year for stocks. This seasonal strength could provide the tailwind tech needs to finish 2024 on a high note, particularly now that two key uncertainties, the U.S. election and NVIDIA’s highly anticipated earnings report, are behind us. However, XLK has lagged the broader S&P 500 slightly in recent months. If the tech sector outperforms in December, it would mark its third year of outperformance out of the last four years. However, whether XLK breaks out and rallies further hinges on the performance of its top three holdings: NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) , which collectively account for nearly 41% of the ETF’s weighting. NVIDIA: The Sector’s Torchbearer As the largest holding in XLK, NVIDIA wields significant influence over the ETF’s performance. The company continues to dominate the AI landscape, and its recent Q3 earnings were stellar. NVIDIA reported a 93.6% year-over-year revenue increase to $35.08 billion, beating analyst expectations, while adjusted EPS of $0.81 surpassed estimates by $0.12. Demand for its AI-driven Hopper and Blackwell platforms remains impressive, with the company improving gross margins and maintaining strong profitability. From a technical perspective, NVDA is consolidating near its all-time high, trading just below the $150 resistance level. A decisive breakout above this zone could ignite momentum in both NVDA and XLK, providing a solid catalyst for year-end gains in the tech sector. Apple and Microsoft: The Deciders While Apple and Microsoft have underperformed NVDA and XLK this year, their contribution to the ETF's direction remains critical. Apple has spent much of the year consolidating and is just 3.77% away from its 52-week high. This tight range could serve as a launchpad for a breakout if broader market sentiment remains favorable. A shift in momentum here would significantly bolster XLK’s performance. Microsoft, on the other hand, has been the weakest of the trio. Down 12% from its 52-week high, the stock has struggled with relative weakness throughout the year. However, a breakout above $430 could signal a trend reversal, providing much-needed support to XLK. With MSFT’s historical resilience and dominance in cloud computing, the potential for a short-term recovery cannot be dismissed. Balancing Risk and Reward The setup for XLK heading into December is promising, but chasing gains without clear confirmation carries risks. NVIDIA appears well-positioned to lead the charge, but the underperformance of Apple and Microsoft could temper the sector’s upside potential. Investors looking to capitalize on XLK’s potential breakout may want to wait for signs of strength from its top three holdings, notably Apple and Microsoft. While NVIDIA’s trajectory suggests bullish momentum, the broader sector will need support from these two lagging giants to sustain a rally into year-end.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Like many visa-holding immigrants, a 24-year-old Ph.D. student in upstate New York said she lives in a constant state of anxiety. The student, who asked to be anonymous out of fear of retaliation, is currently on an F-1 student visa and worries that if she leaves the country even on a vacation, she might not be let back in, that her status might suddenly change. With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to retake office with a crew of Cabinet members with anti-legal immigration platforms, she now has an additional worry: it might be impossible for her to get on a more permanent H-1B, a visa for specialized occupations, when she graduates. “I am anxious to know how and what changes he ends up making,” the student said. “In four years, the world could be literally at 180 degrees.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Following Trump’s re-election victory, many immigrants are worried a second Trump term would introduce restrictions on the H-1B visa program, like he attempted to do during his first term. Trump himself, his allies and Cabinet picks have made promises to make cuts to the program, which experts say would have a huge impact on the tech sector. “People are in a state of panic … they are expecting the worst,” said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. “‘Is my application going to be accepted? During the course of my approval process, where do I stand? Can I be deported?” The H-1B, or high-skill visa program, is overwhelmingly used by Indians. They make up about 75% of all petitioners, far outpacing even the next highest group, Chinese workers, who make up under 12%. While the visa program can encompass any field that requires a bachelor’s degree or higher, the tech industry makes up the vast majority and would face the most severe impacts of increased restrictions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Stephen Miller, who is joining Trump’s White House as deputy chief of staff for policy, is expected to be a leader in the administration’s immigration agenda. During his previous role as a senior adviser, Miller took staunch-anti-immigration stances and influenced policy that raised H-1B denials and tightened restrictions on the program. “Stephen Miller has been very effective in the previous administration in cutting down immigration numbers,” said Gaurav Khanna, an assistant professor of economics and an immigration scholar at the University of California, San Diego. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Trump or Miller. Other allies like Vivek Ramaswamy, nominated alongside Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, has in the past said he would “gut” the H-1B program if given the chance. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Ramaswamy’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Trump himself has shared that opinion. Answering a question about H-1Bs during a 2016 Republican presidential debate, he said, “We shouldn’t have it. Very, very bad for workers.” What action has the federal government taken in the past? Immigration experts say that while only Congress can’t set visa caps, the federal government can make the processes for visa applications slower and more difficult. The first Trump administration increased wage requirements for H-1B applicants beyond what citizens working in those sectors would earn, impacting entry-level workers. The rule was eventually shot down by a federal judge in 2020, but it caused tech companies to scramble, according to immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump’s Department of Homeland Security also attempted to narrow the definition of a “specialty occupation” that qualified for an H-1B.

The student, who asked to be anonymous out of fear of retaliation, is currently on an F-1 student visa and worries that if she leaves the country even on a vacation, she might not be let back in, that her status might suddenly change. With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to retake office with a crew of Cabinet members with anti-legal immigration platforms, she now has an additional worry: it might be impossible for her to get on a more permanent H-1B, a visa for specialized occupations, when she graduates. “I am anxious to know how and what changes he ends up making,” the student said. “In four years, the world could be literally at 180 degrees.” Following Trump’s re-election victory, many immigrants are worried a second Trump term would introduce restrictions on the H-1B visa program, like he attempted to do during his first term. Trump himself, his allies and Cabinet picks have made promises to make cuts to the program, which experts say would have a huge impact on the tech sector. “People are in a state of panic … they are expecting the worst,” said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. “‘Is my application going to be accepted? During the course of my approval process, where do I stand? Can I be deported?” The H-1B, or high-skill visa program, is overwhelmingly used by Indians. They make up about 75% of all petitioners, far outpacing even the next highest group, Chinese workers, who make up under 12%. While the visa program can encompass any field that requires a bachelor’s degree or higher, the tech industry makes up the vast majority and would face the most severe impacts of increased restrictions. Stephen Miller, who is joining Trump’s White House as deputy chief of staff for policy, is expected to be a leader in the administration’s immigration agenda. During his previous role as a senior adviser, Miller took staunch-anti-immigration stances and influenced policy that raised H-1B denials and tightened restrictions on the program. “Stephen Miller has been very effective in the previous administration in cutting down immigration numbers,” said Gaurav Khanna, an assistant professor of economics and an immigration scholar at the University of California, San Diego. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Trump or Miller. Other allies like Vivek Ramaswamy, nominated alongside Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, has in the past said he would “gut” the H-1B program if given the chance. Ramaswamy’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Trump himself has shared that opinion. Answering a question about H-1Bs during a 2016 Republican presidential debate, he said, “We shouldn’t have it. Very, very bad for workers.” What action has the federal government taken in the past? Immigration experts say that while only Congress can’t set visa caps, the federal government can make the processes for visa applications slower and more difficult. The first Trump administration increased wage requirements for H-1B applicants beyond what citizens working in those sectors would earn, impacting entry-level workers. The rule was eventually shot down by a federal judge in 2020, but it caused tech companies to scramble, according to immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security also attempted to narrow the definition of a “specialty occupation” that qualified for an H-1B. That was also shot down in court. “They do have the power to heavily audit firms and make life very difficult for companies that are hiring H-1B workers,” Khanna said. “The tech sector is heavily reliant on H-1B workers. If you cut off that supply, the tech sector is going to be unhappy.” During the 2016 presidential debate, Trump admitted he had hired H-1B workers himself. At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump also regularly hires immigrant workers, sponsoring H-2A visas to bring in seasonal employees . “It’s something that I frankly use and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it,” he said. “I’m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.” A possible chilling effect, at minimum While she waits for answers about her place in the U.S., the Ph.D. student from upstate New York says she’s worried that anti-immigrant sentiment will make her life difficult no matter what her status is. “My defenses are always up,” she said.

Ibrahim explained the importance of combining agricultural knowledge with emerging technologies to equip the nation’s youth for the future workforce and address food security challenges, saying that the vast opportunities available to Nigerian youth in agriculture, particularly in the growing Agri-Tech sector, an area where technology and agriculture intersect. Speaking at a stakeholders’ roundtable on Nigerian Youth Development, organized by the Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation in Abuja, he stated that while technological advancements in agriculture are rapidly evolving, the sector has not fully leveraged these innovations. According to him, “The major opportunity for the youth within the agricultural setting lies within the nexus of technology and agriculture, often referred to as Agri-Tech,” Ibrahim stated. “While technology continues to advance rapidly, Agri-Tech is yet to be fully explored and maximized.” The NADF Executive Secretary explained that the NADF is working to bridge the gap by developing frameworks for agricultural skills training that align with global standards, while drawing from his own experience in the sector. Ibrahim said that part of the effort involves a partnership between NADF and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) to implement a National Agricultural Technical, Vocational, and Educational Training Programme, adding that t initiative is designed to address the skills gap in the agricultural sector, focusing on critical areas such as soil science, veterinary medicine, and digital mapping—skills essential for modern farming. He noted that the NADF is working closely with various stakeholders, including the NBTE, to implement a more robust training program that will equip youth with the right skills. He said that the NADF would roll out a pilot scheme across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, saying that the initiative will span six days and focus on agricultural skills tailored to each region’s specific agroecological needs. Ibrahim highlighted the importance of NADF’s efforts to balance commercial and social funding models, stressing that the approach aims to ease the financial burden on smallholder farmers and youth entrepreneurs, ultimately fostering sustainable agricultural growth and job creation.

The Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) has a mere 0.1% expense ratio and a minimum investment of just $1, making it an easy way to dip your toes into the tech sector at a low cost. The semiconductor industry has been the main driver behind the tech sector's sustained rally. But software giant Salesforce ( CRM +1.15% ) just blasted to a new all-time high. And Adobe ( ADBE +1.33% ) is up over 15% from 52-week lows from May. Let's find out if a boom in software stocks could help take the Vanguard Tech ETF to new heights and some risks worth considering before investing in top software stocks. Image source: Getty Images. How enterprise software is investing in AI Talking about the tech sector without mentioning artificial intelligence (AI) is impossible. After all, Nvidia ( NVDA 2.96% ) has become the most valuable company in the world because of the massive growth potential of AI. More computing power is needed to power AI models, and Nvidia is on the cutting edge of making graphics processing units and associated hardware for data centers. But for the AI narrative to last, companies must develop and profit from AI tools. The pressure is on enterprise software companies like Microsoft ( MSFT +0.53% ) , Salesforce, and Adobe to prove that AI spending is worth it. Microsoft's research and development spending has soared as it invests in AI solutions . AI assistants called Copilots are embedded in several applications, such as Microsoft 365, GitHub, Azure, and more. On Oct. 21, Microsoft unveiled new autonomous agents for business processes such as sales, finance, and supply chains. Salesforce has touted the benefits of its Agentforce suite of AI agents . Agentforce could become a lucrative value add for Salesforce's industry-leading customer relationship management platform and Salesforce-owned Tableau and Slack. Adobe has been developing many AI tools , such as its generative AI text-to-image tool Firefly and an AI Assistant for Adobe Acrobat that can give summaries of PDFs. Despite their potential, AI developments have not yet led to blistering growth for Salesforce and Adobe. Adobe's margins have stalled, and Salesforce only recently began generating consistent operating income. Neither company has grown its top line at an impressive rate in recent years. Salesforce's trailing-12-month revenue is up just 37.7% in three years, and Adobe's is up only 32.7%. Enterprise software companies that rely on software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models must balance innovation without reducing their customer base. For example, the Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps business plan is $89.99 per month per license. Suppose Adobe improves its suite of apps by so much that it can charge $135 per month per license. But because each user can accomplish so much more, an Adobe business customer decides it only needs 10 licenses instead of 20. Adobe would end up with higher revenue per license but lower overall sales. In other words, its innovation would lead to a crack in its business model. The biggest question facing enterprise software companies is how they will modernize the SaaS business model in the age of AI so that they aren't so dependent on the number of licenses. The uncertainty facing software companies is one reason why semiconductor companies are leading the tech sector, not software. Software companies face the challenge of monetizing AI without jeopardizing their existing business models, whereas a company like Nvidia benefits from overall AI adoption. So, Nvidia is a safer and more straightforward way to bet on AI than a specific enterprise software company. Breaking down the Vanguard Tech ETF Even if Salesforce and Adobe continue to surge higher, they wouldn't be able to impact the Vanguard Tech ETF meaningfully. As you can see in the following table, a whopping 44.6% of the Vanguard Tech ETF is invested in Apple , Nvidia, and Microsoft -- illustrating the sheer size of these giants compared to other tech companies. Company Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 15.8% Nvidia 15.4% Microsoft 13.4% Broadcom 4.6% Salesforce 1.8% Oracle 1.8% Advanced Micro Devices 1.5% Cisco Systems 1.5% Adobe 1.4% Accenture 1.4% It's also worth understanding how the ETF is allocated by industry. As you can see in the following table, around a third of the ETF is now in semiconductor companies. The semiconductor industry's influence on the tech sector extends far beyond Nvidia . Category Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Application and Systems Software 35.2% Semiconductors and Semiconductor Materials & Equipment 33.1% Technology Hardware, Storage, Distributors, & Periphera 18.3% Electronic Components, Equipment, Instruments, and Manufacturing Services 4.4% IT Consulting & Other Services 3.7% Communications Equipment 3.6% Internet Services & Infrastructure 1.7% Data source: Vanguard. For example, diversified semiconductor, hardware, and networking company Broadcom alone makes up a larger share of the ETF than Salesforce and Adobe combined. A better way to target software stocks The Vanguard tech ETF is a great way to get broad-based exposure to the tech sector, but it isn't the best way to invest in application and infrastructure software companies. Investors interested in top enterprise software companies like Oracle, Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow , and Intuit may prefer to simply buy shares of those individual names or take a closer look at software ETFs like the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV 0.67% ) . By focusing exclusively on software companies and leaving out chip stocks and big hardware companies like Apple, investors get way more exposure to enterprise software names. For example, the ETF has a 9.4% weighting in Salesforce, which is more than five times higher than the Vanguard Tech ETF. In sum, Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft have gotten so big that they will continue driving the Vanguard Tech ETF. Investors who already own these three companies and don't want further exposure may want to consider investing in other tech stocks or ETFs instead."

Consider, for example, how a recipe can be ruined by straying too far from its original list of ingredients -- nobody wants a milkshake made with a heaping helping of brussels sprouts , right? Similarly, investing doesn't have to be complicated. Indeed, by allocating large portions of a portfolio to funds that track major indexes, investors can feel secure knowing that their portfolio will largely capture the stock market's growth. Let's have a closer look at one excellent index-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) and see if it could be a millionaire-maker. Image source: Getty Images. What is the Invesco QQQ Trust Series I ETF? In the simplest terms, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series I ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) is an index-linked ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index . That index, in turn, is made up of the 100 largest non-financial stocks that are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange . Many of the stocks in the index are the mega-cap tech stocks you might expect to find: Nvidia , Microsoft , Apple , and Amazon . However, there are also much smaller, less well-known names like Ansys , MongoDB , and The Trade Desk . Finally, there are also companies from outside the tech sector, such as Starbucks , Kraft Heinz , and AstraZeneca . All in all, this fund offers investors the opportunity to own a broad array of stocks representing many sectors (except for financials ). Granted , the index is heavily skewed toward the tech industry, with roughly 59% of holdings falling within that sector. Yet, given tech's outperformance over the last few decades, investors should ask themselves: Is it a bad thing to be relatively overweight in the tech sector over the long term? I would suggest -- particularly for younger investors -- that it is not. In fact, staying slightly overweight in the tech sector could prove to be a millionaire-making move. Here's why. Large investments in the tech sector have paid off Let's compare the relative performance across four index-linked ETFs: The Invesco QQQ Trust Series I, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust , the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF , and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF . QQQ Total Return Level data by YCharts. As you can see, over the last five years, the Invesco fund has significantly outperformed the other funds with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.5%. What's more, the difference is even more pronounced if we examine the last 15 years -- starting with the end of the Great Recession bear market, which occurred in March 2009. QQQ Total Return Level data by YCharts. Indeed, $50,000 invested in the Invesco fund in March 2009 would have grown to over $1 million today. In comparison, the same amount, invested on the same day, would have grown to only $560,000 in the S&P 500 fund, $454,000 in the Dow fund, and less than $386,000 in the Russell fund. The lesson? Even with near-perfect timing and very similar index-linked ETF funds, there is an enormous amount of difference in performance among these funds -- and the tech-heavy Invesco fund has proven to be the best. All that said, there is no guarantee that the Invesco fund will continue its outperformance. After all, there were periods, such as the dot-com bubble of 2001-2003, where tech stocks severely underperformed the broader market. However, even with that turbulent period included, the Invesco fund has ever-so-slightly exceeded the performance of its major index rivals since the start of this century. No investment is a sure thing, but index-linked ETFs are about as close as you can find . They offer investors a broad range of stocks and have a proven track record of delivering real returns over decades. Moreover, the tech-heavy nature of the Invesco fund offers investors a realistic chance to outperform the market, given the high growth and solid profitability of many of its major components. Investors looking for a smart and simple way to grow their portfolio to over $1 million should consider the Invesco fund."

Nvidia's data center revenue reached a quarterly record on strong demand for its AI chips, and the company said it expects to ship more of its Blackwell AI chips than previously expected. Nvidia's chips could also drive greater spending across the tech sector, Wedbush analysts said. After Nvidia ( NVDA ) reported record quarterly revenue driven by gains in its data center sales and raised expectations for its Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips, several analysts boosted their price targets for the chipmaker's stock. Wedbush analysts lifted their price target to $175 from $160, implying about 19% upside from Thursday's closing price, pointing to strong demand for Nvidia's AI chips and signs production of its next-generation Blackwell chip is “ramping at least as fast as expected.” On the company’s earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia is on track to ship more Blackwell chips than previously anticipated in the current quarter, which runs through January. Analysts at Mizuho raised their price target to $175 from $165 after the call, projecting up to $5 billion in Blackwell revenue in the period. Citi analysts bumped their price objective to $175 from $170, and Goldman Sachs hiked its target to $165 from $150, anticipating gains from “growing demand for AI infrastructure across all customer groups.” Nvidia also appeared to dismiss worries surrounding reported Blackwell issues with overheating , which “should alleviate any lingering investor concerns around Blackwell execution,” Wedbush analysts wrote. Shares of Nvidia wavered between gains and losses in Thursday's session, and briefly climbed to an intraday record before closing 0.5% higher at $146.67. The stock has nearly tripled in value since the start of the year. Nvidia GPUs Could Drive Higher Spending Across Tech Sector, Wedbush Says Wedbush analysts also suggested Nvidia could be poised to lead a tech rally into year-end and 2025 after its strong results, with a ripple effect from spending on its chips that could boost the broader tech industry. The analysts estimated that every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU could have an $8 to $10 multiplier effect across the tech sector.

(NASDAQ: NVDA ) has once again defied market expectations, delivering a blockbuster third-quarter performance that tech analysts are calling a watershed moment for artificial intelligence. What Happened : Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives described the results as a “jaw-dropper,” emphasizing the transformative potential of the company’s AI technology. “This is the fourth revolution playing out in front of our eyes,” Ives told CNN, highlighting the broader implications for the tech sector. Referring to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang as the “Godfather of AI,” he described the company’s performance as a transformative moment. Ives boldly predicted a Nasdaq surge to 25,000, driven by the “fourth revolution” in technology. “This is the rally, get ready,” he emphasized, highlighting an extraordinary economic multiplier where “one dollar spent on GPU chips translates to an $8 to $10 impact across the tech sector.” The analyst believes the market is underestimating demand for AI technologies in the next 12 to 18 months. The analyst addressed potential risks to the AI boom, noting initial market nervousness about high spending and profitability concerns. However, he sees improving confidence, citing companies like Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR ), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE: NOW ), and Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL ) as positive indicators. Geopolitical concerns, particularly around China and potential tariffs, remain a consideration. Yet, Ives found reassurance in diplomatic channels, specifically mentioning Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk ‘s involvement in negotiations, which he believes will help mitigate potential challenges. Nvidia reported third-quarter revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% increase year-over-year, significantly exceeding Street consensus estimates of $33.12 billion. The company delivered earnings per share of 81 cents, beating analyst expectations of 75 cents. Prior to Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings, Ives told CNBC that the company’s pathway to a $4 trillion valuation “begins today” with a “drop the mic performance.” He emphasized Nvidia’s unparalleled market dominance, stating they are “the only game in town” in AI chip development. The company’s Blackwell product line, which Ives highlighted as critical, is now in full production. Why It Matters : The analyst’s commentary went beyond dry financial analysis, sprinkled with his trademark flair. In a moment that captured both his tech insight and unexpected humor, Ives even ventured into fashion advice for President-elect Donald Trump . The earnings report marks Nvidia’s ninth consecutive quarter beating revenue estimates and eighth straight quarter exceeding earnings per share expectations. Price Action : Nvidia’s stock closed at $145.89 on Wednesday, down 0.76% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock dipped further by 2.53%.

Carr, who currently serves as an FCC commissioner, has taken a strong stance against what he calls a ""censorship cartel"" within the Big Tech industry, targeting companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. His bold statements come amid mounting concerns over free speech and the influence of tech giants on American society. In recent remarks, Carr asserted that the monopoly power wielded by major tech platforms poses a grave threat to free expression and democratic discourse. He called for a comprehensive strategy to dismantle what he described as a censorship regime. While his comments have resonated with some as a necessary step to protect First Amendment rights, others view them as a potential overreach that could disrupt innovation and competition in the tech sector. A Clear Mandate on Big Tech Reform Carr’s nomination is seen by many as a signal of the Trump administration’s intention to overhaul the way Big Tech operates. His proposals include increasing transparency around content moderation policies, ensuring fairness in algorithms, and scrutinizing the relationships between government agencies and tech companies. Critics of Carr’s stance argue that the proposed regulations could lead to government overreach, stifling innovation and potentially politicizing regulatory decisions. The FCC nominee has long been a vocal critic of Big Tech practices. In his tenure as an FCC commissioner, Carr championed initiatives aimed at reducing the power of tech monopolies and amplifying voices often censored under vague community guidelines. His focus on dismantling Big Tech’s grip has drawn both praise and skepticism from across the political spectrum. Pushback and Concerns From Industry Leaders Major tech companies have not taken Carr’s remarks lightly. Executives from Facebook and Google have expressed concerns about the potential impact of his policies on their platforms. ""Regulation should aim to protect consumers without stifling innovation,"" one industry representative stated. The tech sector fears that dismantling large companies could lead to unintended consequences, such as reduced access to critical digital services. Despite these criticisms, Carr’s proposals have struck a chord with conservative voters who have long criticized perceived biases in content moderation policies. His remarks align closely with Trump’s broader agenda of confronting corporate power and addressing the influence of technology on public discourse. What Lies Ahead? As Carr prepares for confirmation hearings, his nomination is expected to face significant scrutiny from both sides of the aisle. Questions remain about how his policies would be implemented and whether they could withstand legal challenges. Nonetheless, his rhetoric signals a shift in how the federal government may address the growing influence of Big Tech. With the FCC poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the digital landscape, Carr’s nomination sets the stage for a contentious battle over the future of free speech and corporate accountability in America."

The tech industry is holding its breath to see what Trump's second term will bring when he takes over in January, especially as SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk is expected to have a huge influence on the next U.S. government. During Trump's last term from 2017 to 2021, big tech firms were often at odds the with the president, particularly given his crackdown on immigration and ramping up the trade war with China. The Web Summit, which runs until Nov. 14, will bring together some 70,000 attendees with more than 3,000 startups and 1,000 investors, according to the organisers. Several sessions will deal directly with the fallout of the U.S. election on the sector, but organisers told AFP it was too early to judge how the industry would react. The event kicked off on Nov. 11 night with singer Pharrell Williams bringing star power to the proceedings. Organizers were keen to move on from last year's edition when a string of big firms pulled out after Web Summit chief executive Paddy Cosgrave wrote social media posts accusing Israel of war crimes in Gaza. Cosgrave stepped down but has since returned to his post, making no reference to the controversy in his opening speech on Nov. 11, saying simply: ""It's good to be back."" Cosgrave stressed how the Web Summit is focused on the startup ecosystem first and foremost. But big tech firms have returned to the gathering this year with Meta, Google and others all represented. Microsoft President Brad Smith is due to lay out how the software juggernaut envisages the next phase of its artificial intelligence strategy, after spending billions to infuse the technology into most of its products. AI is expected to be the central theme. Cosgrave commented that there were so many AI startups it was now ""one of the world's biggest AI events."" On Nov. 11, prominent AI critic Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, renewed his warnings that humanity could be on the path to oblivion. He said governments needed to pass stiff regulations to halt the development of artificial general intelligence, a notional superintelligent AI capable of dominating humans. Tegmark criticised the narrative that pitted great powers against each other in a competition to dominate the field, commenting: ""It's not an arms race between the US and China, it's a suicide race."""

Click to play the content 0:00 / 0:00 Amid rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) Yossi Matias - Head of Research and Vice President at Google- has underscored the continued importance of coding as a core skill. Despite the proliferation of AI tools in coding and development, Matias believes human coders remain invaluable, particularly in understanding the fundamentals of programming. In a recent interview with Business Insider , Matias shared insights into AI's role in the tech industry, emphasizing that the technology, while transformative, is not poised to replace human developers. ""The basic notion of learning the basic disciplines remains as important as ever. Everybody should learn how to code,"" he stated, affirming the relevance of coding in today’s tech landscape. Matias’s remarks come as many in the tech field express concerns over AI’s potential to automate coding tasks. Tools like GitHub Copilot have raised speculation about AI’s impact on traditional programming roles, with some suggesting that such tools can cut coding time by as much as 70 percent. However, Matias argued that AI is not yet capable of handling the complexities of the coding process in full, especially given the human intuition and oversight required to refine AI-generated code. ""AI may assist with certain tasks, especially at the junior level, but it is still not taking over the entire coding process,"" Matias explained. He noted that while AI can facilitate repetitive tasks, it lacks the capacity for the nuanced decision-making that experienced programmers bring to software development. Matias acknowledged that recent trends in the tech industry pose challenges for junior developers, who may struggle to acquire the practical experience needed in a field increasingly supplemented by AI tools. In response, Google has been backing initiatives to support emerging talent, helping to bridge the gap between coding theory and practical application. Drawing a parallel between coding and mathematics, Matias suggested that the skill is foundational in the digital age. ""Coding is like basic math,"" he said, explaining that even those outside the software industry benefit from a foundational understanding of programming. The sentiment underscores his view that coding is integral not only within tech sectors but across various fields where digital literacy is now essential.

The country’s tech industry, once nascent and underdeveloped, is now witnessing rapid growth, with startups leading the charge in transforming the digital landscape. This article delves into the evolution of Pakistan’s tech industry, the rise of its startup ecosystem, the challenges it faces, and the opportunities that lie ahead. Historically, Pakistan’s tech industry was largely centered around traditional IT services, with companies providing software development and outsourcing services to clients abroad. However, the landscape began to shift dramatically in the late 2000s and early 2010s as the country’s telecommunications infrastructure improved and internet access became more widespread. The introduction of 3G and 4G services in 2014 marked a significant turning point, enabling more Pakistanis to come online and paving the way for digital innovation. Pakistan’s startup ecosystem has grown rapidly, with a particular focus on sectors such as fintech, e-commerce, health tech, and edtech. Startups like Daraz, an e-commerce platform, and Zameen.com, a real estate portal, have become household names, showcasing the potential of digital businesses in the country. The rise of ride-hailing services like Bykea, which leverages motorcycles to navigate congested urban areas, highlights the innovative solutions emerging from the Pakistani market. The government of Pakistan has recognized the importance of nurturing the startup ecosystem and has taken several steps to support entrepreneurship. One of the key initiatives is the establishment of National Incubation Centers (NICs) across major cities, including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta. These centers provide startups with access to resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities, helping them to scale their businesses and attract investment. Additionally, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced policies aimed at promoting digital financial services and fintech innovation. The SBP’s regulatory sandbox allows startups to test new financial products and services in a controlled environment, encouraging innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Despite the progress, Pakistan’s tech industry still faces several challenges that need to be addressed to sustain its growth. Regulatory hurdles, such as inconsistent policies and bureaucratic red tape, can be a significant deterrent for entrepreneurs. The lack of a robust legal framework for protecting intellectual property rights is another issue that hampers innovation. Another challenge is the digital divide that persists in Pakistan, particularly between urban and rural areas. While cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad have seen significant growth in digital services, rural areas still lag in terms of connectivity and digital literacy. Bridging this gap is essential for the inclusive growth of the tech industry. Despite these challenges, the future of Pakistan’s tech industry looks promising. The increasing interest from international investors and the success of homegrown startups are positive indicators of the market’s potential. As the government continues to implement policies that support digital transformation, the ecosystem is likely to become more conducive to innovation. Pakistan’s tech industry is at a critical juncture, with the potential to become a major player in the global digital economy. The rise of startups and the growing interest from investors are encouraging signs, but sustained growth will require addressing the challenges that the industry faces. By continuing to invest in digital infrastructure, fostering innovation, and supporting entrepreneurship, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its tech industry and pave the way for a prosperous digital future The writer is a 16-year-old student currently pursuing my A Levels at Aitchison College, Lahore, Pakistan"

The leaders of some of the world’s most influential technology companies are now extending their congratulations to president-elect Donald Trump. This show of support comes despite Trump’s history of contentious relationships with many of these same executives during his previous presidency and throughout the recent campaign. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in his message to Trump, emphasized the importance of the United States continuing to lead in innovation and creativity, stating, “We look forward to engaging with you and your administration to help make sure the United States continues to lead with and be fueled by ingenuity, innovation, and creativity.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has had a particularly strained relationship with Trump, also offered his congratulations on his social media platform Threads, saying, “We have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration.” Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai echoed these sentiments, highlighting the potential for collaboration between the tech industry and the new administration. “We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone,” Pichai said. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has been a target of Trump’s criticism in the past, praised the president-elect’s political comeback and expressed hope for the future. “No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love,” Bezos wrote. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella echoed his willingness to work with Trump. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent a terse congratulations, perhaps drafted for him by ChatGPT. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger messaged his hope that Trump would return U.S. manufacturing to its rightful place in the world. Qualcomm CEO Christiano Amon added his voice to the chorus. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi celebrated Trump’s “resounding victory.” However, not all tech executives chose to comment on the election results. Notable absences included NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship."

Nvidia's rise follows a tech rally post-Donald Trump's election win, with the Nasdaq 100 up nearly 3%. Analysts predict Nvidia's valuation could soon surpass $4 trillion amid ongoing AI market growth. Nvidia stock soared as much as 5% on Wednesday to hit a record intra-day high of $146.47. The gains catapulted Nvidia's market valuation to $3.58 trillion, cementing its position as the largest company in the world after it closed ahead of Apple on Tuesday. It's the first time Nvidia has occupied the top spot on the list of most valuable companies since late October . The stock surge came amid a broader rally for the tech sector following Donald Trump's election victory, with the Nasdaq 100 rising nearly 3%. The gains in Nvidia shares on Wednesday significantly outpaced the gains in Apple stock, which was up by just 0.12% at 3:05 p.m. ET. Apple is now the world's second-largest company, worth about $3.38 trillion, or about $200 billion less than Nvidia. The next largest company is Microsoft, which was worth $3.12 trillion on Wednesday. In the two years since ChatGPT's debut, shares of Nvidia, which supplies the tech sector with AI-enabling GPU chips, have added nearly $3.2 trillion to their market valuation. The stock has soared about 800%. Wall Street believes the gains can continue, with some analysts expecting the stock to soon top a $4 trillion valuation. Bank of America analysts raised their Nvidia price target to $190 last week, citing strong upside and a ""generational opportunity"" as it grows its lead in the AI space. Another recent milestone for Nvidia is its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , with the company set to replace Intel on Friday. Nvidia will report third-quarter earnings results after the market close on November 20.

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1578957.html,,Look forward to boost dynamic tech partnership between India - US under Trump : Nasscom,20241106T130000Z,,prokerala.com,English,India,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"New Delhi, Nov 6 : Indian IT industry's apex body Nasscom on Wednesday congratulated Republican candidate Donald Trump on his victory in the US presidential polls, saying they look forward to working closely with the new US administration to strengthen the dynamic tech partnership between the two nations. The tech sector is the key to the US-India bilateral engagement. The US is the largest market for India's $254 billion tech sector where its overall contribution is $80 billion to the US gross domestic product (GDP). ""Importantly, the industry plays a key role in supporting US companies in strengthening the US economy. Conversely, India is a prime destination for American businesses, with over 1,000 US companies that are driving innovation and leveraging India's digital infrastructure to create competitive solutions,"" Nasscom said in a statement. As the tech industry association in India representing Indian and US tech companies, Nasscom said it looks forward to working closely with the government under Trump. ""As the largest and oldest democracies, we look forward to collaborating on various areas including AI and cybersecurity. Nasscom remains committed to advancing this collaboration for a democratic, inclusive and sustainable innovation ecosystem,"" the industry chamber stressed. The US is India's largest trading partner, with annual trade exceeding $190 billion. Trade in services between the two countries expanded 30.3 per cent from $54.1 billion in 2018 to an estimated $70.5 billion in 2024. America is a significant market for Indian goods, particularly in sectors like technology, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and engineering products. Trump made a phenomenal comeback beating back a conviction, three indictments, two assassination attempts, two impeachments, and continuous assault by most of the mainstream media to reclaim the White House. ""We made history"", declared Trump who will become the 47th President. He had won 277 electoral college seats out of the total 538."
https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20241105719/big-tech-stocks-rally-as-tech-now-drives-sp-500-more-than-on-election-day-2016,,"Big Tech stocks rally , as tech now drives S & P 500 more than on Election Day 2016",20241106T011500Z,https://www.morningstar.com/assets/img/marketwatch.dad5abb.png,morningstar.com,English,China,XLK,Technology,tech sector,"By Christine Idzelis 'A lot has happened inside the S&P 500 over the last four and eight years, explaining why the index trades so rich to 2016,' says DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas Big Tech stocks rallied Tuesday as Americans cast their vote for the next U.S. president, fueling the S&P 500's sharp gain. The S&P 500 SPX closed 1.2% higher, with Tesla Inc. (TSLA) jumping 3.5%, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) climbing 2.8%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META) rising 2.1% and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) advancing 1.9%. ""The market setup going into Election Day 2024"" is one in which technology drives the S&P 500 much more than in 2016 and 2020, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in an emailed note. ""We continue to be bullish on U.S. large caps and believe that the most likely path for stocks through year-end is higher regardless of which candidate wins the presidential election."" The U.S. stock market has a much higher valuation compared to Election Day in 2016 based on where the S&P 500 is trading relative to its earnings over the next 12 months, according to Colas. But the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio is now similar to Election Day in 2020. ""A lot has happened inside the S&P 500 over the last four and eight years explaining why the index trades so rich to 2016 and so close to 2020's elevated valuations, driven by fiscal and monetary stimulus,"" said Colas. The S&P 500 has become more expensive since 2016 as the weightings of the technology sector and so-called Big Tech companies have increased in the index, according to DataTrek. Chip maker Nvidia has seen its weight rise to 6.9%, from 0.7% on Election Day in 2016. The market value of Nvidia, a popular artificial-intelligence play in the S&P 500's information-technology sector XX:SP500.45, has surged amid investor enthusiasm for AI. The tech sector's weighting in the index has swelled to 31.7%, from 21.4% on Election Day 2016, the Data Trek note shows. Tech and ""tech-adjacent"" companies have ""such an important weighting"" in the S&P 500, said Dominic Rizzo, a portfolio manager for the T. Rowe Price Technology ETF TTEQ, in a phone interview Tuesday. The fast growth in these areas of the U.S. stock market and their concentration in equities indexes raises the stakes for investors when making allocation decisions around tech, he said. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS - which holds Big Tech stocks including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta - rose a sharp 1.7% on Tuesday, as investors watched for Election Day updates on the tight presidential race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump. DataTrek found that Big Tech companies outside the S&P 500's technology sector - such as Amazon, Meta and Alphabet - also have heftier index weights compared to eight years ago. Tesla, another Big Tech company that falls outside the tech sector, was not even in the S&P 500 in 2016, with the electric-car maker added to the index in late 2020. The S&P 500's technology stocks plus Big Tech names beyond the tech sector, in areas including consumer discretionary and communication services, now account for 43.2% of the S&P 500, versus 39.1% on Election Day 2020 and 27.7% on Election Day 2016, the DataTrek note shows. Check out: Ways to target - or avoid - Big Tech and megacap stocks via ETFs amid AI frenzy The actively managed T. Rowe Price Technology ETF takes an expanded view of technology, meaning that it goes beyond the classification of tech in the S&P 500 to include Big Tech stocks such as Amazon, Meta and other companies globally, according to Rizzo. The fund, which launched in October, invests around 75% in the U.S. and about 25% internationally, he said. The ETF's top 10 holdings on Tuesday included Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Meta, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Tencent Holdings Ltd. (HK:700), Visa Inc. (V) and Mastercard Inc. (MA), according to data on T. Rowe Price's website. Rizzo said he looks for ""linchpin technologies"" when picking stocks, seeking buying opportunities in ""innovative and secular growth markets"" and companies with ""improving fundamentals and reasonable valuations."" Considering the ""spectacular"" growth rate of earnings for Big Tech stocks, valuations across the so-called Magnificent Seven are ""roughly fair,"" he said. DataTrek's note shows the S&P 500's tech sector is valued at 28.4 times forward 12-month earnings, up around 35% from the 10-year average. Colas pegged Nvidia's multiple at 40 times forward-year earnings. ""Common wisdom has, at various points, said that tech-sector valuations would decline in the face of higher rates,"" said Colas. ""Not only has that proved wrong, but tech in fact has seen the greatest multiple expansion of any S&P group relative to its longer-run average.""

Sometimes, those promises are made even when they’re outside the scope of what a president can enact. With Vice President Kamala Harris taking on former President Donald Trump, The Verge ’s election guide attempts to cut through the noise of electioneering to identify the actual policies at stake. For the tech industry, many issues hang in the balance, including the regulatory power to govern AI, monopolies, and cryptocurrency. More broadly, this election will determine the future of electric vehicles and how the US approaches climate change. But The Verge ’s stake in this election is larger than just the tech issues. Every day, we walk our readers through the collective action problems that bedevil hardware, software, the internet, and all the other building blocks that make up our future. Once you start looking for collective action problems, you see them everywhere. What’s at stake in this election is whether it’s the government’s job to solve these problems — or whether anyone should even bother trying.

The layoffs range from large employers to smaller-sized startups that are focused on profitability and efficiency in the wake of increased hiring during the pandemic. It is crucial for tech employers to have a strategic plan for assessing potential reductions in force (RIFs) and the impact on their initiatives going forward. In this Insight, we provide employers with five key considerations you should keep in mind for managing and assessing RIFs in the tech industry. 1. What Does Recent Labor Data Show? According to Forbes, the tech industry has laid off over 124,000 employees so far in 2024. While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the headcount for tech employers will grow twice as fast as the overall U.S. workforce over the next decade, suggesting the industry in the long term, is in good health for the long term, we may see more turbulent times over the next year until the industry fully rebounds. 2. What Are the Critical Legal Issues With RIFs? It’s important to understand the definitions of some key terms before we continue. It is important to understand that RIFs are broad, systemic reductions in your workforce and involve permanent job eliminations and separations from employment. In contrast, layoffs may involve either temporary or permanent terminations and do not necessarily occur on the same scale as a large RIF. Similarly, furloughs may involve the reduction of employee hours or requiring employees to take unpaid leave while they remain employed. These particularities are important because RIFs are subject to specific rules under federal, state, and local laws that you need to consider before you proceed. They include the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, and others. Requirements under these laws will impact your timing, your decision-making, your notification responsibilities, and other aspects of your action and considerations. 3. What’s the Impact of RIFs on Employee Benefits? RIFs, layoffs, and furloughs all may have significant impacts on your rights and obligations with respect to its benefit plans. It is important to consider the benefit obligations in advance, including severance plan triggers, coverage during furlough or COBRA triggers for group health plans, and potential 401(k) impacts relating to partial termination as a result of the event. You must also evaluate your communications regarding the RIF, layoff, or furlough in light of fiduciary obligations as it relates to the rights of employees under your ERISA plans. 4. What Are Some Key RIF Resources? Our Technology Industry Group offers several resources that cover best practices for handling RIFs and can help guide you through the difficult decisions related to reducing your workforce and how to handle them. Read our 7-Step RIF and Layoff Blueprint applicable to employers in any industry. Check out this Q&A on Effective Communication Strategies During a Reduction in Force . Consider our RIF/WARN Toolkit , which provides essential resources to help employers plan and properly carry out mass layoffs. 5. What are Some RIF Issues the Tech Industry Should Especially Care About? In addition, look out for RIF issues specific to the technology industry. For example: Knowledge Loss and Skill Gaps. Reducing your staff risks losing critical internal knowledge and key talent which could impede long-term growth. Layoffs in R&D departments can especially have a long-term impact on innovation and the development of new products or services. You should manage transitions carefully to preserve institutional knowledge and employers with critical skills. Reskilling and Upskilling. You may want to assess whether workforce reductions could be managed by reallocating employees to upcoming initiatives. As tech evolves rapidly, retraining employees for other roles can reduce the need for layoffs and help retain valuable employees. Skilled Labor Shortages. Skilled labor is often in short supply in the technology industry. If you’re planning to implement a RIF, consider the long-term impact of losing skilled workers who may be difficult to replace when demand picks up again. You may want to explore alternatives such as temporary layoffs or furloughs for skilled positions to retain talent and be ready for future projects. Intellectual Property and Confidentiality Risks. In the tech industry, employees often have access to proprietary information, trade secrets, and intellectual property. When conducting RIFs, ensure that you follow proper exit protocols, including retrieving company devices, disabling access to sensitive data, and reminding employees of their ongoing confidentiality obligations. Consider using severance agreements to reaffirm non-disclosure and non-compete clauses where legally permissible. Customer Support and Product Continuity. Reducing staff in customer support, product development, or engineering roles can lead to service disruptions and negatively affect customer satisfaction. Consider whether reallocating resources or delaying certain product launches could minimize the impact of the RIF. It’s important to maintain continuity in essential customer-facing roles to preserve client relationships and avoid reputational damage. Equity and Stock Options. Many tech employees receive a portion of their compensation through equity or stock options. RIFs can trigger the need to address vesting schedules, stock repurchase agreements, and the treatment of unvested options. Ensure your RIF plan includes communication with affected employees regarding their equity compensation and any potential deadlines for exercising stock options. Morale and Public Perception in a Tight-Knit Industry. Tech companies are often closely watched by competitors, investors, and the public. Large-scale layoffs could not only affect morale but also harm your company’s reputation in the industry. Consider internal communication strategies that focus on transparency and support for remaining employees, while externally emphasizing the company’s long-term vision and stability to maintain investor and market confidence.

The launch of this joint protective security guidance aimed at protecting the tech sector from national security threats follows last October's unprecedented summit which brought together the heads of the domestic security and intelligence agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States to announce Five Shared Principles to protect technology companies. Secure Innovation provides the tech sector with a set of cost-effective measures that companies can take from day one to better protect their ideas, reputation, and future success. This announcement demonstrates the increased commitment from all Five Eyes nations to work collaboratively against this shared threat. Businesses in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States can take advantage of a collection of Secure Innovation resources, guidance, and products now available across all Five Eyes countries. This means companies can benefit from consistent and consolidated advice reflecting both the globalized and interconnected tech startup ecosystem, as well as the global nature of the security threats startups face. ""The Five Eyes partners face unprecedented threats to our emerging tech ecosystems. So, today we're arming tech firms across our nations with guidance on how to secure the innovation so critical to our future. This guidance is designed to help tech startups protect their innovation, reputation, and growth, while also helping tech investors fortify their portfolio companies against security risks,"" said Mike Casey, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), a Center within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Secure Innovation materials for the US can be found at NCSC's website. ### NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address"

Tech leads Futures are trading higher Monday morning, led by the tech sector. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, S&P 500 futures rose 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed out a winning week on Friday with a new intraday all-time high. Meanwhile, the Dow and S&P fell on Friday and each snapped six-week winning streaks. With just four trading sessions left in the month, the Dow is down 0.5% for October, the S&P is up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 1.8%. Follow live market updates. 2. Peak week A specialist trader works inside a post on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 23, 2024. Brendan McDermid | Reuters It's the busiest week of Q3 earnings. More than 150 S&P 500 companies are set to report, spanning tech, autos, restaurants, oil and pharma. Here are some of the most-anticipated earnings reports due out this week: Monday: Ford (after the bell) Tuesday: McDonald's, Pfizer (before the bell); Alphabet, AMD, Chipotle, Reddit, Snap (after the bell) Wednesday: Biogen, Eli Lilly (before the bell); Meta, Microsoft, Starbucks (after the bell) Thursday: Bristol Myers Squibb, Comcast, Merck, Peloton, Uber (before the bell); Amazon, Apple, Intel (after the bell) Friday: Chevron, Exxon Mobil (before the bell) Saturday: Berkshire Hathaway 3. Court strike Delta Airlines flights status are displayed for passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on July 22, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Jessica Mcgowan | Getty Images Delta Air Lines is suing CrowdStrike after a July software outage led to thousands of canceled flights. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of breach of contract and negligence and seeks damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars to cover Delta's losses along with litigation costs and punitive damages. ""CrowdStrike caused a global catastrophe because it cut corners, took shortcuts, and circumvented the very testing and certification processes it advertised, for its own benefit and profit,"" Delta said in its complaint. A spokesperson for CrowdStrike said in a statement the claims are ""based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure."" 4. Quarter Pounders return A McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburger and coke, are seen in an illustration picture taken in New York City, U.S., October 24, 2024. Brendan McDermid | Reuters McDonald's is reinstating the Quarter Pounder after it pulled the menu item from certain locations following a deadly E. coli outbreak. The burger will return to roughly 3,000 restaurants — about a fifth of the company's footprint. About 900 of those restaurants will serve the burgers without slivered onions for the time being. ""The issue appears to be contained to a particular ingredient and geography, and we remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants,"" Cesar Pina, chief supply chain officer for McDonald's North American operations, said in a letter Sunday. The impacted restaurants are in Colorado, Kansas and Wyoming as well as portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah. 5. Peddling bikes Source: Greenlight David Einhorn is making his pitch for Peloton. The hedge fund manager last week said the fitness company's shares could trade as high as $31.50, roughly five times their current levels of roughly $6.30 apiece. Einhorn's investment thesis was based on Peloton boosting EBITDA without growing subscription revenue or raising prices for users. ""Peloton has started to right-size and cash burn has stopped. It refinanced its debt to push out maturities. And with a loyal customer base that pays $44 per month, it's a valuable subscription business,"" Einhorn said during his pitch, which he made while riding one of the company's bikes. – CNBC's Tanaya Macheel, Fred Imbert, Jordan Novet, Leslie Josephs, Amelia Lucas and Gabrielle Fonrouge contributed to this report. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that McDonald's is returning the Quarter Pounder to roughly 3,000 locations after pulling the menu item following an E. coli outbreak.

Currently, the seven most valuable companies traded on U.S. exchanges all hail from the tech sector. Those are Apple , Nvidia , Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and those stocks combined have a market cap of roughly $17 trillion, which is more than a third of the entire S&P 500 . The sector has come to lead the stock market because this group of stocks represents the emerging technologies that have become some of the biggest drivers of the economy, including consumer electronics, semiconductors, software and cloud infrastructure, digital advertising, e-commerce, social media, and chip manufacturing. If you wanted to capitalize on that tech boom, the easiest way to do so would be by buying the Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ 0.27% ) , the largest ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which is made up of the 100 largest companies on the Nasdaq Composite , and that would have grown handsomely over the last 10 years. As you can see from the chart, if you had invested $10,000 in the Invesco QQQ Trust a decade ago, you'd now have more than $50,000. QQQ data by YCharts Based on those gains, the Nasdaq-100 grew at a compound annual rate of 18% over the last decade. It's far from guaranteed that the Nasdaq 100 will continue to deliver a CAGR of 18%, but if it does, that kind of growth would allow you to invest $250 a month and grow that investment to $1 million after 25 years. Will the QQQ trust grow that fast? An 18% CAGR over 25 years might seem unlikely, especially as the Nasdaq-100 is now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, meaning that gains from here aren't likely to come from multiple expansion. Still, tech stocks are at a unique point, as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution could arguably be as transformative as the internet, and that could drive accelerated growth, especially from some of the larger tech stocks. For instance, analysts expect Nvidia's earnings per share to double in the current quarter, and in fiscal 2026, which begins in February 2025, the consensus calls for earnings per share to grow 43% to $4.06. Taiwan Semiconductor just reported a 54% increase in earnings per share, showing that the AI growth boom could have a lot of room to run. Additionally, the push to artificial general intelligence, which some tech CEOs expect to be achieved within the next five years, is also likely to drive a boom in the tech sector, as that technology could unlock further gains for the biggest tech stocks. There's also the potential for autonomous vehicle technology to unleash massive gains in stocks like Alphabet, which owns Waymo, and Tesla , as Cathie Wood has speculated that its valuation could reach $5 trillion if its robotaxis take off. Image source: Getty Images. Why the QQQ Trust could continue to be a winner It's impossible to predict the compound annual growth rate of the Invesco QQQ Trust, especially over a length of time as long as 25 years. However, the tech-heavy index looks like a good bet to deliver strong returns and outperform the S&P 500 as the tech industry takes more market share from other industries. Like the S&P 500, the Nasdaq-100 also benefits from refreshing its holdings as companies enter or fall out of the 100 most valuable Nasdaq companies. That formula has been a big winner since the dot-com bubble burst, and it looks poised to continue delivering strong results in the AI era."

Since its 2010 launch, this ETF has delivered consistent market-matching performance through various economic cycles. The fund maintains a healthy 1.23% yield while providing exposure to innovation leaders and stable blue chip companies . Its broad diversification helps reduce individual stock risk. Lastly, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's median market capitalization of $262.2 billion reflects its focus on well-established companies with proven track records. Premium growth at a bargain price The Vanguard Growth ETF ( VUG 0.15% ) targets premier U.S. companies with above-average growth potential by tracking the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index. With a minimal expense ratio of 0.04%, this ETF provides cost-effective access to America's fastest-growing companies. The fund features 183 holdings focused on innovative market leaders across multiple sectors, with a median market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. Performance speaks volumes with this growth-oriented fund, delivering an average annual return of 15.54% over the prior 10-year period.

The Vanguard Growth ETF's holdings demonstrate exceptionally strong earnings growth of 23.5% over the past five years, resulting in an impressive return on investment of 134% over this same timeframe.

Despite its specialized nature, the fund maintains broad diversification with 316 holdings across various tech subsectors, creating a balanced approach to tech sector investing. VGT data by YCharts . According to Vanguard, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF's 0.10% expense ratio remains notably lower than similar sector-focused funds, which average 0.95%. Software, semiconductors, and hardware companies dominate the fund's portfolio, providing exposure to critical technological advancement areas. The fund's holdings demonstrate robust earnings growth of 25.5% and an outstanding return on investment of 176% over the prior five years. The ETF combines established tech giants with innovative emerging players.

SHARE In a significant development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has suspended shipments to Chinese chip designer Sophgo following the discovery of its chips on a Huawei AI processor. This move is linked to potential breaches of U.S. export controls. According to industry insiders, the chip in question matched one found on Huawei's Ascend 910B processor, which is restricted due to U.S. national security concerns. Despite Sophgo's assertions of compliance and lack of ties with Huawei, TSMC initiated investigations and briefed Taiwan and U.S authorities. As the tech sector closely watches, questions loom over supply chain compliance and geopolitical tensions. The U.S. Department of Commerce acknowledged the situation but withheld comments on ongoing investigations, keeping the tech industry on high alert. (With inputs from agencies.)

Gavin Newsom, right, sits beside President Joe Biden, center, and Arati Prabhakar, Ph.D., Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Assistant to the President for Science and Technology at a meeting with AI experts and researchers at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Calif., on Tuesday, June 20, 2023. (Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: October 21, 2024 at 2:00 PM PDT | UPDATED: October 21, 2024 at 2:02 PM PDT As public sentiment toward Big Tech sours in Silicon Valley and across the country, the industry nevertheless had a banner year dodging regulation in the California legislature. Of some 60 bills to rein in the industry, fewer than 20 passed, many watered down, said David Harris, a Chancellor’s Public Scholar at UC Berkeley who studies tech regulation. Among the casualties: Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill to throw up guardrails against the light-speed expansion of artificial intelligence technology , and brokered a deal between lawmakers and Google to kill legislation that would have made the search giant pay the struggling news media for using their journalism. AB 2930, to impose limits on automated-decision-making software, and AB 3172, to boost potential penalties on social media companies for harms to children, were both opposed by tech lobby groups and never made it to Newsom’s desk. It’s an impressive record in a state notorious among business advocates for its heavy regulatory hand. “The tech industry has for decades enjoyed dramatically less regulation than any other large industry even close to its size,” Harris said. Californians have begun to chafe at the industry’s influence. A recent poll by the Bay Area News Group and Joint Venture Silicon Valley revealed a hefty majority of surveyed voters believe the tech industry is too powerful and has lost its moral compass . A Pew Res e arch poll revealed in April that nearly 80% of Americans think social media firms have too much political influence . And a 2023 California-wide UC Berkeley survey found nearly three-quarters of respondents want the state government to protect the public from AI harms . But the tech sector remains important for Californians, said Allie Caccamo, spokeswoman for the Virginia-based tech industry lobby group Chamber of Progress. “California relies on revenue from the tech industry,” Caccamo noted. “It provides funding for schools and hospitals and a social safety net.” The tech industry and the businesses it supports made up 30% of the state’s economy in 2022 , sending $56 billion in taxes — mostly income and corporate levies — into state coffers, the California Chamber of Commerce reported in June. “It’s wonderful they represent such a huge part of the tax bill,” said San Jose State University political science professor emeritus Larry Gerston. “On the other hand, it’s frightening.” Experts chalked up tech’s victories in Sacramento to Silicon Valley’s lobbying, political donations and state tax contributions, lawmakers’ tech investments and a governor with presidential ambitions who, in the words of Sonoma State political science professor David McCuan, “is also a tech bro.” Newsom — who in 2009 launched his bid for governor at Facebook’s former headquarters in Palo Alto, and who co-authored the tech-hyping 2013 book Citizenville — sees leadership on AI as a way to boost his political fortunes, “and he’s also struggling with the budget,” McCuan said. “Tech he sees as a savior.” In May, Newsom announced a $27.6 billion state budget deficit, but summer delivered an unexpected bounty of corporate tax revenue, much of it likely coming from eye-popping gains at Santa Clara’s NVIDIA , whose powerful processing chips are powering the AI boom, CalMatters reported . Cal State East Bay media studies lecturer Nolan Higdon said Newsom “is going to need tech behind him” if he makes a future presidential run. The governor said the deal on news bills would “rebuild a robust and dynamic California press corps,” and in his veto message said the proposed AI regulation would have risked “curtailing the very innovation that fuels advancement in favor of the public good.” That argument “rings hollow,” said Alex Hanna, research director at the independent Distributed AI Research Institute in Oakland, who added that “we’re not really learning anything from the social media era. “If you let AI go unfettered,” he said, “there’s going to be pretty terrible cases of people getting hurt.” But it isn’t just the governor. Hanna noted that many state legislators have substantial stock holdings in major tech firms. About 30% of state legislators reported stock holdings last year , with Apple the top company — investments ranging from $524,016 to $5.2 million — and Google parent Alphabet the third most popular investment, with holdings from $182,008 and $1.7 million, CalMatters reported in June. A Los Angeles Times analysis however found many lawmakers’ votes don’t align with their investments . This year and last, political contributions in California from the tech industry, at $290 million, have dwarfed those from farming — $124 million — and construction’s $122 million, and significantly outstripped the $216 million in donations from the oil and gas, energy and mining sector, according to political-finance research non-profit OpenSecrets , which breaks down the tech industry’s lobbying into two sectors, internet and electronics-manufacturing. The internet industry — which includes Google and Meta — typically spends less money than other sectors on lobbying in California, with its $57 million this year putting it eighth in spending, far behind the nearly $200 million spent by the pharmaceutical and health lobby. However, the electronics industry, including Apple, Oracle, Intel, HP and Cisco, usually comes second in lobbying spending, with $125 million this year, according to OpenSecrets . In 2021, in the run-up to the gubernatorial election in 2022, the internet sector was the fifth-biggest spender on Newsom’s campaign, giving $326,000, OpenSecrets reported . Caccamo of the Chamber of Progress noted that Big Tech, despite its deep pockets, does not always win. “A lot of bills have been enacted that we opposed,” Caccamo said, citing as examples SB 976 to bar social media companies from providing “addictive feeds” to minors without parental consent, and AB 2839 prohibiting distribution of digitally altered election materials. Passage of those bills, along with AB 2655 to force internet companies to block or label deceptive election-related content, and AB 2355 requiring political campaigns to disclose AI use in advertising, showed Newsom and state lawmakers applying a heavier regulatory hand to protect children and elections from tech-related harms. San Jose State’s Gerston believes legislators and Newsom are proceeding with caution on the new AI technology, as is typical with other emerging issues, but will ultimately agree on substantive regulations. “It just takes a while to find that consensus,” Gerston said. “They’re as confused as the rest of us.” Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to print (Opens in new window) Print RevContent Feed"

Listen 0:00 7380 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The European Union is increasing efforts to draw more venture capital (VC) into its tech sector to keep pace with booming innovation in the United States and China. On Oct. 21, EU Commissioner Iliana Ivanova announced the launch of the “Trusted Investors Network” during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The initiative aims to support startups and boost investments in the tech sector across the EU. Source: Iliana Ivanova Boosting EU tech The Trusted Investors Network focuses on attracting venture capital investments, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and semiconductors for artificial intelligence development. According to Reuters, the EU has gathered 71 investors across the continent, with over 90 billion euros ($98 billion) worth of assets signed on to the initiative committing to invest in European deep-tech companies. Ivanova highlighted the development in a series of posts on X. She stated: “The EU joins forces with investors to supercharge deep-tech startups and scale #innovation through co-investment with the #EUeic Fund. Shaping the future of European #DeepTech.” The venture capital agreements align with recommendations from a European Central Bank report, which urged faster and larger investments in Europe’s tech sector to maintain its competitiveness.

(photo courtesy of TechPoint) Venture investments in Indiana’s tech sector dropped significantly in the third quarter as compared with the first half of the year, a new report shows. According to Indianapolis-based TechPoint’s third-quarter venture report, released this week, the state’s tech companies received a total of $51.3 million in venture funding from a total of 27 deals last quarter. That’s down from 46 deals totaling $215.8 million in the second quarter, and 29 deals totaling $348.9 million in the first quarter. During the third quarter of last year, Indiana tech companies received a combined $93.9 million in venture investment from a total of 19 deals. TechPoint CEO Ting Gootee said she’s not surprised by the report’s findings, noting that the third quarter is traditionally a slower period for venture investing activity. “I think the data is actually pretty spot-on in terms of what we’ve been seeing in the trenches across the board, what’s happening with founders and investors,” Gootee said. Gootee said venture investors remain cautious in light of the tech-industry slowdown that began in mid-2022. Investing activity also tends to slow down amidst the uncertainty that surrounds elections, she said. But Gootee said she’s “cautiously optimistic” about the venture market, especially given the network of entrepreneurial support available from the state of Indiana, the state’s universities and other entities, including TechPoint. Carmel-based MBX Biosciences Inc.’s initial public offering last month is also encouraging, Gootee said. The company, launched five years ago, is developing treatments for a variety of endocrine and metabolic disorders. Because MBX is a biosciences company, its public offering is not part of TechPoint’s third-quarter venture report. The deal, though, is a sign of market confidence—and it provides liquidity for MBX’s early investors, who could then use that money to invest in other Indiana companies, Gootee said.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Appearing on stage at the UK International Investment Summit alongside Eric Schmidt , the former chief executive of Google, Sir Keir Starmer made it clear to industry that Britain was open for business. The Prime Minister promised to “make sure that every regulator in this country, especially our economic and competition regulators, takes growth as seriously as this room does”. The words would have been music to the tech industry’s ears. The appearance next to Schmidt was more than just a gesture. Since coming to power, Labour has appointed “big tech” insiders to key advisory positions; it has signalled it favours a data centre building blitz ; and suggested it may take a more laissez-faire attitude towards artificial intelligence (AI). One former government adviser has described relations as “cosy”. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Yet these friendly overtures have raised eyebrows in some quarters after clashes between successive Conservative regimes and the tech sector. They fear the tech industry will run rings around an inexperienced government, winning concessions around AI, social media harms and other contentious areas. “It is naivety more than anything else,” the former adviser says. High on the agenda are potential changes to copyright rules that would allow US tech giants to “train” their AI algorithms using UK intellectual property. Starmer spoke on stage with former Google chief Eric Schmidt at Britain’s investment summit earlier this month - Jonathan Brady/PA Pool Previous talks between the tech sector and the music industry ended in a stalemate, and the Conservatives backed away from making any immediate changes earlier this year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Last month, Feryal Clark, the AI minister, said the Government was seeking a “way forward” before the end of the year. A consultation is now expected in the coming weeks that one industry source said would lay out “a roadmap to a final decision”. This has raised fears among the creative industries that Labour is willing to sacrifice Britain’s powerhouse industry for an uncertain AI future. “Why would you bet against that success, taking a punt on the AI sector that has not proven economic benefits?” says Tom Kiehl, the chief executive of UK Music, an industry body. Max von Thun, of the Open Markets Institute, says: “Labour seems to have confused having a plan for the digital economy with handing the keys to big tech monopolists.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement AI boosters argue that allowing models to be trained on British intellectual property would turn the country into a global hub for the technology of the future, attracting investment and jobs. Critics claim such a change would simply allow companies in California to reap all the benefits while hollowing out the UK’s music, TV and publishing industries by empowering AI rivals. Many in the tech industry worried that a Labour government would have introduced tougher regulations and punitive safety rules. A 2020 technology strategy, published shortly after Sir Keir secured the Labour leadership, warned of the “accumulation of power and wealth in the hands of a shrinking tech industry elite”. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I was shocked when Labour became strongly in favour of growth,” Schmidt told the Prime Minister last week. He could equally have swapped the word tech for growth. Relationship reset Shortly after the general election, Rachel Reeves invited the UK bosses of companies including Apple, Amazon and Meta to a Downing Street breakfast to discuss “ways in which the tech sector and Government can work together”. At the meeting, officials said they wanted a “reset” of relations with the tech industry. Labour has promised a data centre building blitz, overriding red tape and local councils that block new digital infrastructure. Big tech views it as crucial for powering their new AI software offerings. The Government is also planning a new Regulatory Innovation Office specifically launched to “reduce the burden of red tape and speed up access to new technologies”. Perhaps just as important is what has not become policy. Labour has held back on immediately introducing legislation cracking down on the risks of AI technology, insisting any measures will be “highly targeted”. It has also resisted calls to harden the Online Safety Act to block more so-called “legal but harmful” content, despite pressure to take action after August’s far-Right riots. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Sir Keir also told ITV he was against “ simply banning phones for under-16s ”, an issue seriously considered by officials under Rishi Sunak’s government. A former public prosecutor and KC, Sir Keir does not come across as a natural technophile, unlike his predecessor. Sunak confidently rubbed shoulders with venture capitalists and looked the part with his Adidas trainers and hoodies. However, Tory relations with the sector were often fractious. Ministers clashed with Microsoft after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) threatened to block a $69bn (£53bn) takeover of Activision – with one senior executive claiming Britain was “closed for business”. The Conservatives were also critical of the impact of social media on young people and spearheaded the introduction of the Online Safety Act. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement And while Sunak organised an AI Safety Summit in 2023 attended by Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, many were let down by the former prime minister’s overly pessimistic view of the technology. Theo Bertram, a former Labour adviser to Gordon Brown and previously vice president of government relations at TikTok, says: “Industry saw his ‘AI will destroy the world’ speech as doomsterish and eccentric.” AI potential By contrast, Labour seems to be borrowing heavily from the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for its AI ethos. The former Labour prime minister has been unflinchingly optimistic about the prospects of AI for solving all manner of the UK’s problems. His think tank has been funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds by big tech, including donations from Oracle boss Larry Ellison. The TBI even leaned on ChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot, to help research a paper that claimed 40pc of tasks performed by public sector workers could be done by AI . It has also claimed that mass AI adoption could save the Government £12bn per year. Last week, Sir Keir repeatedly labelled AI a “game changer” for the UK. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Von Thun, of the Open Markets Institute, says Labour appears to have “wholly bought into big tech firms’ utopian narratives about the transformative potential of AI, despite many continued flaws with the technology”. Since taking power, Labour has also looked to the tech industry to fill a number of ministerial and advisory roles. Clare Barclay, Microsoft’s UK chief executive, will head a new industrial strategy advisory council, a sign of better relations after the Activision spat. Within No 10, Labour has added former TikTok policy spinner James Lyons to head up its communications. Arguably the most notable appointment is Lord Vallance , once an executive at GSK and the former chief scientific adviser during the pandemic. Labour science minister Lord Vallance has been a proponent of allowing US AI labs to harvest material without prior permission - Jonathan Brady/Reuters Lord Vallance was appointed science minister in July, shortly after joining Isomorphic Labs, a drug discovery company owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and run by Sir Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement His arrival immediately raised worries within the creative community. Lord Vallance previously urged Conservative ministers to carve out an exemption within copyright rules for so-called text and data mining. This would allow US AI labs to harvest material from the web or videos to train AI models without prior permission or payment. Such changes would trigger a fierce backlash. Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative MP for Gosport, last week wrote to Peter Kyle, the Technology Secretary, warning that the Government risked “undermining our cultural and creative industries, which are so fundamental to the success of our national economy”. Lord Clement-Jones, the digital spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said the Government was taking a “minimalist approach to AI regulation” under Lord Vallance and “treating copyright as red tape”. While the music industry has been lobbying against the move – and showering Labour ministers with gifts such as Taylor Swift tickets – the tech sector has also been bestowing its largesse on MPs. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Last year, Jonathan Reynolds, now Business Secretary, accepted tickets worth £3,000 to Glastonbury, courtesy of Google. Earlier this month, industry minister Sarah Jones defended the tickets as “perfectly reasonable”. Honeymoon period Google also donated close to £5,000 to Labour in 2023, according to its company accounts, when it hosted Sir Keir, Rachel Reeves and other senior party figures at its offices. The donation took the form of room hire and refreshments. Elsewhere, Kyle received £36,000 as an in-kind donation from UK technology start-up Faculty, which seconded an expert to his office ahead of the election to brief him on AI developments. Yet while US technology giants may have been won over, smaller UK start-ups and entrepreneurs have been much less satisfied with Sir Keir’s first months in No 10. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Around 1,000 founders have written to the Treasury, warning that proposed increases to capital gains tax risk scuppering London’s position as a European start-up hub. Harry Stebbings, the founder of investment firm 20VC, says: “It is like the Government is choosing every strategy to discourage entrepreneurship.” A decision to scrap £1.3bn in supercomputing spending was also met with dismay. Relations with tech giants may just be in a honeymoon period. Marcus Bokkerink, chairman of the CMA, which has doggedly challenged the tech industry, last week warned it would continue to take action on “entrenched incumbents preventing the next wave of UK tech firms bringing their digital innovations to market”. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Ofcom, meanwhile, is finalising its plans to enforce the Online Safety Act in the spring, which will threaten tech giants with billions of pounds in fines for failing to tackle digital harms. The former government adviser said: “This Government hasn’t had to deal with the tension between the stick and the carrot on big tech yet, but it’s on the horizon.” With AI rules, the Employment Bill and an online safety crackdown all to come, they added: “That’s where a cosy relationship can be used to lean on Government to get changes.” A government spokesman said: “This Government is working in partnership with business to drive economic growth, boost long-term investment and create high-quality jobs. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Our focus is on UK citizens and businesses reaping the benefits of new technologies and innovations. At the same time, we will work to ensure that these technologies are developed safely and responsibly. “We are implementing strong protections in the Online Safety Act and committing to highly-targeted AI legislation, to make sure safety lies at the heart of their development.” Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Photograph: Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters Way back in the 1960s “the personal is political” was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that “the technological is political”, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by N asa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon. There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to because politics wasn’t much interested in it There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were “free”, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that? It took an unconscionable time for this regulatory slumber to end, but end it finally did on Joe Biden’s watch. US regulators, led by Jonathan Kanter at the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), rediscovered their mojo. And then in August the DoJ dramatically won an antitrust lawsuit in which the judge ruled that Google was indeed a “monopolist” which had taken anticompetitive steps to preserve its 90% share of search. The DOJ is now proposing “remedies” for this abusive behaviour, ranging from obvious ones like barring Google from contracts such as the one it has with Apple to make it the default search engine on its devices to the “nuclear” option of breaking up the company. Related: Elon Musk gave $75m to his pro-Trump group in three months The shock of this verdict to the tech industry has been palpable, and has led some movers and shakers in the Valley to think that maybe electing Trump might not be such a bad idea after all. Some of the loudmouths like Marc Andreessen – and, of course, Musk – have explicitly come out for Trump, but at least 14 other tech moguls are providing more discreet support. And although quite a few tech leaders have – belatedly – come out for Kamala Harris, some are doing so with some reservations. Reid Hoffmann, the founder of LinkedIn, for example, donated $10m to her campaign, but says he wants her to fire Lina Khan from the FTC. The most dramatic evidence of how Silicon Valley lost its political virginity, though, comes from the extraordinary amounts of money that cryptocurrency companies have been putting into the election campaign. The New Yorker reports that crypto companies have already sunk “more than a hundred million dollars” into so-called SuperPACS supporting crypto-friendly candidates. The interesting thing is that this money seems to be aimed not so much at influencing who wins the presidency as at ensuring that the “right” people get elected to the House and the Senate. This suggests a level of political nous that would have been disdained by the early pioneers of the tech industry in the 1960s. Technology might not have been political then; but it sure is just now.

Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers. Folks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider. With a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees. Image source: Getty Images. The tech sector has evolved The technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why. Company Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2% Nvidia 14.1% Microsoft 13.9% Broadcom 4.4% Adobe 1.7% Salesforce 1.6% AMD 1.6% Oracle 1.6% Accenture 1.4% Cisco Systems 1.4% Data source: Vanguard. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy. And while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. So, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) , the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile. With the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips. Factors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector. Story Continues Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet , are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. Amazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off. Vanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap. Let ETFs work for you Nvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time. Meanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend. The fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend. The best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.

Hinton doesn't work at Google anymore. Nor did the longtime professor at the University of Toronto do his pioneering research at the tech giant. But his impromptu party reflected AI 's moment as a commercial blockbuster that has also reached the pinnacles of scientific recognition. That was Tuesday. Then, early Wednesday, two employees of Google's AI division won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for using AI to predict and design novel proteins. ""This is really a testament to the power of computer science and artificial intelligence,"" said Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. Live Events Asked about the historic back-to-back science awards for AI work in an email Wednesday, Hinton said only: ""Neural networks are the future."" It didn't always seem that way for researchers who decades ago experimented with interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain. Hinton shares this year's physics Nobel with another scientist, John Hopfield, for helping develop those building blocks of machine learning. Neural network advances came from ""basic, curiosity-driven research,"" Hinton said at a press conference after his win. ""Not out of throwing money at applied problems, but actually letting scientists follow their curiosity to try and understand things."" Such work started well before Google existed. But a bountiful tech industry has now made it easier for AI scientists to pursue their ideas even as it has challenged them with new ethical questions about the societal impacts of their work. One reason why the current wave of AI research is so closely tied to the tech industry is that only a handful of corporations have the resources to build the most powerful AI systems. ""These discoveries and this capability could not happen without humongous computational power and humongous amounts of digital data,"" Wing said. ""There are very few companies - tech companies - that have that kind of computational power. Google is one. Microsoft is another."" The chemistry Nobel Prize awarded Wednesday went to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google's London-based DeepMind laboratory along with researcher David Baker at the University of Washington for work that could help discover new medicines. Hassabis, the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, told the in an interview Wednesday his dream was to model his research laboratory on the ""incredible storied history"" of Bell Labs. Started in 1925, the New Jersey-based industrial lab was the workplace of multiple Nobel-winning scientists over several decades who helped develop modern computing and telecommunications. ""I wanted to recreate a modern day industrial research lab that really did cutting-edge research,"" Hassabis said. ""But of course, that needs a lot of patience and a lot of support. We've had that from Google and it's been amazing."" Hinton joined Google late in his career and quit last year so he could talk more freely about his concerns about AI's dangers, particularly what happens if humans lose control of machines that become smarter than us. But he stops short of criticizing his former employer. Hinton, 76, said he was staying in a cheap hotel in Palo Alto, California when the Nobel committee woke him up with a phone call early Tuesday morning, leading him to cancel a medical appointment scheduled for later that day. By the time the sleep-deprived scientist reached the Google campus in nearby Mountain View, he ""seemed pretty lively and not very tired at all"" as colleagues popped bottles of champagne, said computer scientist Richard Zemel, a former doctoral student of Hinton's who joined him at the Google party Tuesday. ""Obviously there are these big companies now that are trying to cash in on all the commercial success and that is exciting,"" said Zemel, now a Columbia professor. But Zemel said what's more important to Hinton and his closest colleagues has been what the Nobel recognition means to the fundamental research they spent decades trying to advance. Guests included Google executives and another former Hinton student, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist and board member at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Sutskever helped lead a group of board members who briefly ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year in turmoil that has symbolized the industry's conflicts. An hour before the party, Hinton used his Nobel bully pulpit to throw shade at OpenAI during opening remarks at a virtual press conference organized by the University of Toronto in which he thanked former mentors and students. ""I'm particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman,"" Hinton said. Asked to elaborate, Hinton said OpenAI started with a primary objective to develop better-than-human artificial general intelligence ""and ensure that it was safe."" ""And over time, it turned out that Sam Altman was much less concerned with safety than with profits. And I think that's unfortunate,"" Hinton said. In response, OpenAI said in a statement that it is ""proud of delivering the most capable and safest AI systems"" and that they ""safely serve hundreds of millions of people each week."" Conflicts are likely to persist in a field where building even a relatively modest AI system requires resources ""well beyond those of your typical research university,"" said Michael Kearns, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. But Kearns, who sits on the committee that picks the winners of computer science's top prize - the Turing Award - said this week marks a ""great victory for interdisciplinary research"" that was decades in the making. Hinton is only the second person to win both a Nobel and Turing. The first, Turing-winning political scientist Herbert Simon, started working on what he called ""computer simulation of human cognition"" in the 1950s and won the Nobel economics prize in 1978 for his study of organizational decision-making. Wing, who met Simon in her early career, said scientists are still just at the tip of finding ways to apply computing's most powerful capabilities to other fields. ""We're just at the beginning in terms of scientific discovery using AI,"" she said. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Principal Analyst, FinTech for Moor Insights and Strategy Follow Author Oct 10, 2024, 05:02pm EDT Share Save Comment The Fem.AI initiative created by Cadence and joined by Nvidia, Workday and others aims to bring more women into technical and leadership roles in AI. Cadence Design Systems Cadence Design Systems recently launched Fem.AI , an initiative to address the persistent underrepresentation of women in artificial intelligence. Cadence has committed $20 million over the next decade to the program. The program aims to create a more equitable tech sector by focusing on education, career pathways and leadership opportunities for women in AI. The Fem.AI initiative comes at a time when the AI field is experiencing rapid growth yet continues to struggle with a significant gender gap. Cadence’s initial research indicates several “leakage points” in the pipeline where women are disproportionately lost. These include low rates of women in North America graduating with computer science degrees—only 20% in 2021—and difficulties securing AI-related jobs after graduation. Furthermore, 56% of women leave the tech industry before reaching the midpoint of their careers. “Achieving true innovation in the current AI revolution requires the full participation of talented individuals, and too many women are slipping through the cracks of the AI pipeline,” said Dr. Anirudh Devgan, president and CEO of Cadence. “Cadence is committed to shrinking the gender gap in AI through Fem.AI, and we hope to be a catalyst within the tech industry by calling for gender equity in the AI workforce and beyond.” Nicole Johnson, president of the Cadence Giving Foundation, moderates a panel at the Fem.AI Summit in Menlo Park, California on October 1, 2024. Melody Brue Cadence Kicks Off National Women In AI Month At Fem.AI Summit To further solidify its commitment to gender equity in AI, Cadence hosted the inaugural Fem.AI Summit on October 1 in Menlo Park, California, coinciding with National Women in AI Month. I attended this event, which brought together leaders from various sectors, including AI experts such as ethicist Dr. Joy Buolamwini and other prominent figures like Dr. Chelsea Clinton, to foster cross-sector collaboration and address the critical need for greater gender diversity in the field. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Throughout the event and in panel discussions, the overall sentiment was clear: diverse teams are better equipped to identify and mitigate biases in AI systems, leading to fairer outcomes. Many of my conversations and observations at the event underscored the belief that diverse perspectives foster more robust AI solutions and inclusive development practices that ensure AI technologies serve all demographics. The importance of AI literacy for policymakers and developers, along with the need for international standards to ensure responsible AI development, were also key themes discussed. Ultimately, the Fem.AI Summit served as a powerful call to action for the tech industry and beyond, with a clear message: inclusivity in AI is crucial for both innovation and ethics. Cadence’s initiative bolsters efforts such as Unesco's Women4Ethical AI, which strives to ensure women’s full participation in the development and use of technology. Unesco’s research shows that women and girls are 25% less likely than men to have basic digital skills, four times less likely to know programming and 13 times less likely to hold ICT patents. This disparity shows up in the AI field, with women occupying just 20% of technical roles in machine learning, 12% of global AI research positions and 6% of software development jobs. Despite efforts to improve gender balance in the tech industry, progress remains slow. Fem.AI aims to combat these challenges through a multipronged approach. The initiative will focus on building partnerships with organizations that promote women in STEM, providing resources (including mentorships and returnships) to support women in AI careers and funding scholarships for women pursuing AI-related education. Cadence also plans to leverage its existing academic network to create further opportunities for women in the field. Propelling An Industrywide Movement With The Fem.AI Alliance To maximize impact, Cadence has actively encouraged tech industry involvement via the Fem.AI Alliance . Nvidia, Workday, Equinix and NetApp are among the first companies to join, signaling a potential trend of industrywide commitment to addressing gender imbalance in AI. This collaborative approach is crucial in driving meaningful change and creating a more inclusive environment. The potential consequences of failing to address the gender gap in AI also cannot be overlooked. Cadence’s senior vice president of global human resources, Tina Jones, warned, “If women continue to be left out, the effects will hinder innovation and exacerbate current labor shortages in the high-tech sector.” Jones emphasized that Fem.AI is not just a standalone initiative but rather “ part of Cadence’s ongoing commitment to propelling women in STEM and other inclusion initiatives at the core of the company.” She reiterated the company’s belief that “innovation thrives when diverse perspectives come together.” Taking The Fem.AI Movement Forward Fem.AI represents a significant step towards addressing the gender gap in AI, and I found the Fem.AI Summit inspiring. With a substantial financial commitment, strategic partnerships and a focus on industry collaboration, the initiative has the potential to create meaningful change. By investing in programs that support women throughout their AI careers, from college education all the way to leadership roles, Cadence is putting its money where its mouth is to increase female representation and foster a more inclusive AI landscape. The same goes for its partner organizations, and broad industry participation will be crucial to ensure long-term success as Fem.AI’s programs address the complex challenges women face in this field. The initiative’s commitment to ongoing assessment and adaptation will also be key to maximizing its lasting impact. This is more than just an initiative; it’s a spark that could ignite a much-needed transformation in the AI field. I eagerly anticipate witnessing the progress of Fem.AI and the ripple effect it creates, inspiring other industry leaders to embrace the power of inclusivity and unlock the full potential of women in AI and beyond.

Samuel Mungadze, ITWeb Africa editor, was on Saturday named Tech Journalist of the Year at the Empire Partner Foundation (EPF) Tech Awards 2024. The event honours exceptional talent and innovation within South Africa’s rapidly-evolving tech landscape. The event, held in Johannesburg, brought together industry leaders, entrepreneurs and innovators to celebrate ground-breaking technological advancements and highlight the critical role of youth in shaping Africa’s future. Mungadze joined ITWeb in June 2019 as a senior news journalist and was appointed ITWeb Africa editor in March 2023. He previously worked for I-Net Bridge, Business Day, ITNews Africa, SABC Africa and The African Bulletin. See also ITWeb journos scoop excellence in ICT journalism award ITWeb journo wins MTN excellence award At ITWeb Africa, he covers various tech topics, including broadband, emerging technologies, start-ups, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, telecoms and cloud computing. The EPF Tech Journalist of the Year Award recognises a journalist who has made an impact and influenced the tech industry through story-telling that enhances Africa’s technology sector. The award is based on nominations from the tech industry, including executives. Breaking news “This is confirmation of the work we do; we are building a strong African ecosystem and, as journalists, we help bring information to the people,” comments Mungadze. “In the last 12 months, ITWeb and its sister publication ITWeb Africa have broken some of the important tech news that shaped the industry.” He says these include the appointment of Jorge Mendes as CEO of mobile operator Cell C, as well as the biometrics tender irregularities at Airports Company South Africa. “We will continue to tell the tech stories to build South Africa and Africa. I am grateful to the ITWeb family that believed in me and my capability to bring value to the team. Thanks to Glenda van Zyl, Ranka Jovanovic, Adrian Hinchcliffe, Admire Moyo, and the whole ITWeb family. Together we can do more; the award is for the team not one person. “This was a nomination from the tech industry and that makes it special; that shows we are doing something right to build the African tech ecosystem.” Says Hinchcliffe, ITWeb editor-in-chief: “It’s a great achievement and an honour that one of our journalists has been celebrated with this award. I think this recognition from EPF confirms what ITWeb has known for a long time – Sam is an excellent journalist who has a nose for news, follows the story and is at the forefront of setting the standards of journalism in the tech industry.” In her keynote speech during the awards ceremony, Joanna Govender, CEO of EPF, emphasised the importance of youth empowerment, quoting Nelson Mandela’s timeless belief that “the youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow”. She urged the audience to invest in young people by equipping them with the skills and opportunities necessary to lead Africa into a prosperous future. “Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world, and by investing in our youth, we invest in the future of Africa,” Govender stated, reflecting on EPF’s commitment to nurturing talent that will drive the continent’s growth. EPF notes the awards event not only celebrated technological achievements, but also underscored South Africa’s need to foster local talent, encouraging young innovators to create solutions that rival global giants like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Govender highlighted the importance of creating platforms for growth and scalability, to ensure South Africa leads in tech innovation across the continent. Inspiring stories Govender praised previous award winners, saying many have achieved remarkable milestones in their ventures since last year’s event. “Their stories inspire us and affirm that this platform can be a powerful catalyst for growth. Building on that momentum, we are more committed than ever to creating an environment where innovators are acknowledged, empowered and supported.” The theme of collaboration was central to the evening, with Govender quoting the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” She emphasised that EPF’s success over the last eight years is rooted in collaboration and partnerships, which have driven impactful change and lasting success. Govender also announced EPF’s expansion into Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Zambia, marking a milestone in the foundation’s mission to create a Pan-African tech ecosystem. “This is just the beginning,” she declared, as EPF looks to continue its efforts in fostering innovation and supporting youth-led tech solutions across the continent. In her closing remarks, Govender reminded the audience of Africa’s immense potential, driven by the youngest and fastest-growing population in the world. She spoke of Africa’s resilience and the importance of home-grown solutions in overcoming challenges like poverty, inequality and unemployment. “This is a call to action – to unite as Africans and embrace the responsibility of future-proofing our continent together. Let’s rise beyond national boundaries and come together, not just as Mzansi, but as One Africa, working in solidarity to chart our own destiny.” Share"

Among registered voters, 80% of those responding to the poll blamed Silicon Valley’s tech industry for driving up housing and living costs, and 75% said the industry had too much power and influence. Sixty-nine percent said Silicon Valley had lost its moral compass. — AFP/Getty Images/TNS Alex Woods once expected the Silicon Valley technology industry and its world-changing innovations to lift up everyone in the Bay Area. Lately, though, as the region’s cost of living has soared, traffic has worsened, and homelessness and blight have spread, the 38-year-old customer-service representative’s views have changed. “I felt like the tech industry would bring a lot of jobs and resources to the Bay Area as a whole,” said Woods, of East Palo Alto, California, who responded to the survey. “I thought they would do a lot more than they have done.” Despite being the region’s economic engine, a new Bay Area poll by the Bay Area News Group and Joint Venture Silicon Valley found the tech industry is widely mistrusted, with hefty majorities of respondents believing major Silicon Valley companies wield too much power, are largely responsible for the region’s sky-high costs of housing and have lost their ability to tell right from wrong. Among registered voters, 80% of those responding to the poll blamed Silicon Valley’s tech industry for driving up housing and living costs, and 75% said the industry had too much power and influence. Sixty-nine percent said Silicon Valley had lost its moral compass. “I was surprised,” said Russell Hancock, CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a nonprofit think tank dedicated to regional urban policy research. “I didn’t think the percentages would be so high.” Additionally, Silicon Valley’s Next Big Thing, artificial intelligence, is broadly viewed with concern and scepticism. “I don’t feel comfortable about it,” said Ladasha Wheeler, an MRI scheduler from Pittsburg. “We’re playing with things like we’re playing God. Sometimes I think we just need to lay off a little bit.” Silicon Valley is the nation’s largest and most prominent technology hub, employing hundreds of thousands of people throughout the Bay Area. But only 40% of registered voters responding to the survey said the industry’s success delivered benefits for everyone in the region, with 75% worried about a growing income disparity between tech and non-tech workers. “People have finally woken up and are saying, ‘This doesn’t feel like something that contributes to the region and my personal life.’ And it doesn’t – it mostly contributes to people who have invested, or run the companies,” said Steve Blank, a long-time Silicon Valley startup guru and an adjunct professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, of the poll findings. The telephone poll, which surveyed more than 1,650 registered voters in Santa Clara, Alameda, San Mateo, Contra Costa and San Francisco counties, indicated mixed views on tech, revealing pervasive disenchantment with an industry seen as imposing significant social and economic costs on people also beholden to its products and services. Poll respondent Dorian Marquez, 33, a married father with one child from San Jose and marketer for AI startups, said new enterprises are performing a valuable function in democratizing technology, but bad apples like Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes undercut progress, and major tech firms don’t always support growth across the tech industry. “Sometimes these big corporations are almost anti-competition with some of the acquisitions they pursue,” Marquez said. Woods noted that Silicon Valley workforces tend to lack diversity, a problem he believes starts in leadership suites and “trickles down to the bottom level.” He holds the big companies responsible for gentrification and the region’s high cost of living, adding that many tech workers “have the wealth to live anywhere they want and they have access to things that normal people don’t have access to.” “The rich get richer and the poor get poorer,” Woods said. Only 41% of registered voters said their household finances improved when Silicon Valley was doing well. The region’s tech industry attracts ambitious people and generates substantial tax revenue for cities, but because housing prices have skyrocketed from the influx and not enough new housing has been built, companies face public ire, said survey respondent Tyler Cooper, 35, a San Francisco marketing manager. “We’ve created a zero-sum fight when you don’t build apartments and you don’t build homes,” Cooper said. Meanwhile, most Big Tech firms are helmed by “oligarchs” who have created tremendous wealth for themselves. If uber-rich tech leaders contributed more to the communities where they operate, public sentiment could improve, Cooper said. Lawyer, political consultant and poll respondent Rich Robinson, 65, pointed out that tech remains the Bay Area’s driving force, attracting massive capital, pushing technology forward, traditionally leading the way on environmental sustainability, and treating staff well. But Robinson has difficulty reconciling the tech industry’s financial success with the Bay Area’s pervasive homelessness, housing-supply crisis and struggling mass transit systems. “There’s always a push to put the taxes on the residents to build the infrastructure instead of utilising some of their corporate profits to build the infrastructure that we need,” Robinson said. Major tech companies face overwhelming pressure from shareholders “to make money at the expense of absolutely everything”, and what’s best for society and even their users may not lead to growth, respondent Olwen Puralena noted. But the health of millions of Americans’ retirement funds depends on the stock market successes of those companies, which complicates any moral judgments, she added. Puralena, a former worker at Google and Facebook now employed as a user-experience researcher at a Mountain View online-education company, said she admires the problem-solving ethos of Silicon Valley. Tech users need to take responsibility for their own roles in molding Big Tech’s products and services, said Puralena, 34, a married mother of one from Sunnyvale. “Facebook is the way it is because when people interact with it ... they’re more likely to click on things that evoke distrust or anger or shock or horror,” Puralena said. “That’s a choice. We sometimes will blame technology ... but it’s based on our cultural input. Tech companies hold responsibility. But they’re trying to create a sticky product, so you as a user have to decide, ‘How am I going to engage, and am I going to make it worse?'” The industry’s latest big offering, the generative artificial intelligence software pioneered by San Francisco ChatGPT maker OpenAI, has generated a spectrum of worries. Nearly 90% of registered voters surveyed in August worried about realistic fake content, and almost as many had concerns about AI-generated misinformation as the election approaches in November. Cooper sees AI causing “a lot of risk from the misinformation”. “When I try to do a Google image search, a lot of the images that come back are fake,” Cooper said. “By giving you information that is inaccurate it makes you not believe the accurate information. It makes it feel like we lost something that we used to have. That makes me sad.” If Bay Area residents worried about AI and aggravated by social media paid more attention to the region’s innovations in health care, space exploration and national security, they might have a more positive view of the tech sector, Stanford’s Blank said. Hancock believes the Cambridge Analytica scandal – which saw a digital consultancy to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign misuse millions of Facebook users’ data – plus scientific findings of harm from social media, election meddling by foreign powers via social media firms, and the sheer speed of technological development underlie negative sentiments toward tech. Though the poll hadn’t before asked Silicon Valley residents about their feelings about tech, Hancock senses a loss of faith. “The extent of it,” he said, “is deeper and broader than I would’ve imagined.” – The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

While this may seem like a dream salary for many, netizens are divided, with some arguing that the compensation is underwhelming for someone with ten years of experience in the tech industry. The conversation began when Kartik Jolapara, a developer at JP Morgan, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a screenshot of the offer. Jolapara came across the profile of the anonymous individual, who has a decade of experience but hails from a Tier 3 college and does not have a formal computer science degree. The post, captioned “crazy offers,” went viral, sparking reactions across the tech community. The Google Offer: Rs 1.64 Crore Package According to the details shared, the candidate was offered the role of Senior Software Engineer at Google. The package included a base salary of Rs 65 lakh per annum, along with several lucrative perks: a Rs 9 lakh annual bonus, a Rs 19 lakh signing bonus, and a Rs 5 lakh relocation bonus. Together, these benefits pushed the total first-year compensation to Rs 1.64 crore. “What 10 years of experience can get you? Crazy offers,” Jolapara remarked in his post, highlighting the significance of such an offer for someone without a traditional computer science background. — codingmickey (@codingmickey) Mixed Reactions from the Tech Community While many would consider this offer impressive, especially for a Tier 3 college graduate, the reaction online has been mixed. Some praised the candidate for breaking through conventional barriers, while others felt the package was not extraordinary given the industry standards. One user commented, “A tier 3 college graduate without a CS degree landing this role? That's commendable!” Others expressed less enthusiasm. “I’ve seen people with similar experience earning more,” noted another. Some users felt that the offer was underwhelming, particularly for a company as prominent as Google. ""For 10 years of experience, I expected more. This isn’t unusual in tech,"" read one response. Another user echoed this sentiment, saying, ""Am I the only one who's not thrilled by these numbers? Isn't this common in the industry?"" Debate on Tech Salaries The post has sparked a larger conversation about tech industry salaries and the evolving hiring landscape. Many pointed out that salaries for tech roles, particularly at large firms like Google, often seem inflated to outsiders but are increasingly standard within the industry. “Not impressed. I’ve seen better offers from Google for the same role,” said one commenter. Others highlighted that while the offer is significant, tech salaries have become more competitive, making such figures less of an outlier. ""This is becoming normal for those in tech with the right experience,"" another user concluded. This case also raised discussions about how the tech industry is shifting away from traditional credentials. The fact that someone from a Tier 3 college, without a formal computer science degree, secured such a role at Google reflects the growing importance of experience and skills over academic pedigree. As one user put it, ""It’s great to see tech hiring becoming more inclusive. You don’t need to have an Ivy League degree to land a top job anymore."" However, another questioned whether the individual was truly being compensated in line with their experience: “10 years of experience and still a pretty mediocre pay packet. I expected more.” For the Bengaluru techie, securing a Google offer is undoubtedly an impressive feat, especially given their unconventional background. But for many in the industry, the question remains: is this really as exceptional as it seems? Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Inflation was 3% over the same period so that wages are increasing faster than prices are rising. However, wages have been eroded from the previous months - NIS 13,591 in July and NIS 13,924 in June - which can be explained by seasonal factors. The rise in wages is supported by the unemployment data published by the Central Bureau of Statistics, which sees unemployment at a 50 year low of 2.7%. The job market remains tight in part because of a dramatic rise in government spending because of the war and this is also fueling inflation, which has risen to 3.6% over the past year. RELATED ARTICLES August CPI reading far above expectations Israel's average monthly wage still rising In the tech sector the average monthly wage in July 2024 was NIS 31,508, up 7.4% from July 2023, well above the inflation rate. The sharp rise also reflects a widening of the average in the tech sector in Israel from the overall average monthly wage.
