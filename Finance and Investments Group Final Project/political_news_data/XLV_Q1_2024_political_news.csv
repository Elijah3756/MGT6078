Public hospitals and clinics are often overcrowded and understaffed, leading to long wait times and substandard care. Many people in Karachi cannot afford private healthcare services, further exacerbating the issue of access. The distribution of healthcare facilities across the city is uneven, with certain areas having better access to medical services than others. This disparity in access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including low-income neighbourhoods and rural areas surrounding the city. To address these challenges, urgent action is needed. There must be increased investment in the healthcare sector to improve infrastructure, hire more healthcare professionals, and ensure the availability of essential medical supplies and equipment. Efforts should be made to enhance the quality of care provided at public healthcare facilities to make them more accessible and reliable for all residents. Initiatives should be launched to expand healthcare coverage and reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients, particularly for essential services. This could include the introduction of subsidized healthcare programmes or insurance schemes for low-income families.

According to the insurer, more than 40% of this amount has been directed towards safety net hospitals and federally qualified health centers catering to high-risk patients and communities. Change Healthcare, a crucial platform handling approximately 50% of medical claims for nearly 900,000 physicians, 33,000 pharmacies, 5,500 hospitals, and 600 laboratories, fell victim to a cyberattack on February 21 . The attack, attributed to a hacking group identifying itself as “ALPHV” or “BlackCat,” has triggered financial strain among smaller healthcare providers and caused disruptions that UnitedHealth anticipates could take several months to resolve fully. The Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the incident to determine if protected health data was breached. Simultaneously, the State Department has offered rewards of up to $10 million for any information leading to the identification of the hacking group responsible . This significant cyberattack on Change Healthcare has not only impacted the financial stability of numerous healthcare providers but has also raised concerns about data security within the healthcare industry. UnitedHealth’s swift response in providing financial assistance underscores the severity of the situation and the importance of promptly mitigating its repercussions, Reuters noted. In light of this cyber incident, stakeholders across the healthcare sector are reassessing their cybersecurity measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving threat landscape facing organizations that handle sensitive data, prompting calls for enhanced cybersecurity protocols and greater collaboration among industry participants. Wednesday, Medical Properties Trust Inc’s (NYSE: MPW ) tenant Steward Health Care entered a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to UnitedHealth’s Optum Care unit .

Kennedy Federal Building in Boston. Markey said Optum must show it can protect health care access by controlling costs and putting patients and providers first. (AP Photo/Steve LeBlanc) (Steve Leblanc) BOSTON – Financially embattled hospital operator Steward Health Care has struck a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, as it works to stabilize its finances. The move comes as Gov. Maura Healey has said state monitors are keeping eye on the nine health care facilities operated by Steward Health Care in Massachusetts, including hospitals in some of the state’s poorer communities. Recommended Videos The Dallas-based company operates more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Before the sale can be completed, the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission must review the proposal. The commission doesn’t have the authority to block a transaction but can refer findings to the state Attorney General's office, the Department of Public Health, or other Massachusetts agencies for possible further action. The documents filed with the state did not include a cost for the transaction. Under the deal, Optum would aquire a Steward affiliate that includes the company’s primary care doctors and other clinicians in nine states. Health Policy Commission Executive Director David Seltz said the panel is committed to a “rigorous, data-driven oversight of health care market changes to bring important information to the public.” He said details of the proposal will be studied to examine potential effects on health care costs, quality, access and equity. The sale can’t be completed until after the commission’s review and any additional reviews by state or federal antitrust authorities. “This is a significant proposed change involving two large medical providers, both in Massachusetts and nationally, with important implications for the delivery and cost of health care across Massachusetts,” Seltz said in a statement. Emails to Steward Health Care and Optum seeking comment were not immediately returned. The commission's review of the transaction shouldn't delay state and federal antitrust authorities from doing their own review to protect patient access and affordability, Democratic Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald Mariano said. Once all required information has been provided about the sale, the commission will have 30 days to assess any potential impacts of the transaction. If the sale is anticipated to have a significant impact on health care costs and market functioning, the commission can begin a fuller cost and market impact review. Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey said for-profit companies that participate in the health care system must understand that their decisions have direct impacts on patients and communities. “With this announcement, Optum must demonstrate that it can meet the even greater responsibility to preserve and protect health care access,” Markey said at a Wednesday press conference in Boston. “I hope they will live up to that responsibility by controlling costs and putting patients and providers first.” Markey, chair of the senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security, said he plans to hold a congressional hearing in Boston next week on the impact of for-profit companies on health care access. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, said her top priority is making sure Steward’s hospitals in Massachusetts stay open. “After years of gross profiteering and mismanagement, Steward’s latest plan raises more serious questions about the future of the Massachusetts health care system,"" Warren said in a written statement. “Steward executives have no credibility,” she added. “It would be a terrible mistake for Steward to be allowed to walk away while looting Massachusetts one more time.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Role of Incentives in Driving Digital Health Adoption Worldwide,20240327T093000Z,https://yoursay.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/03/Health-Incentives-scaled.jpg,yoursay.plos.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"Image credit Image by ijeab on Freepik Author: Deepali Kausshik, National Health Authority. Deepali is a dedicated public health and policy professional with experience in public health research, monitoring & evaluation, and digital health. With expertise in public health and a passion for driving positive change, she has collaborated with various organizations to drive innovation and develop effective healthcare policies aimed at enhancing public health outcomes. Currently, she is working with the National Health Authority under the ABDM Scheme. The global healthcare landscape is experiencing a real transformation, driven by the integration of digital technologies into patient care and healthcare management. From electronic health records (EHRs) and telemedicine to mobile health apps and wearable devices, digital health has the potential to improve patient outcomes, enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery, and reduce costs. However, despite the promise of these technologies, achieving widespread adoption among healthcare providers and stakeholders has been a complex challenge. With time, incentivization has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome these obstacles and drive the digital transformation of healthcare. To address the persistent issues, many countries have devised incentivization schemes to promote the adoption of digital health technologies. The Role of Incentives in Healthcare: Incentives play a pivotal role in motivating stakeholders to embrace and adopt digital healthcare technologies. These incentives can take various forms, including financial rewards, recognition, regulatory compliance, and improved workflow efficiency. By aligning the interests of different stakeholders, incentives create a sustainable environment for digital adoption in the following ways- Provider Adoption: Healthcare providers are essential actors in the adoption of digital technologies. Incentives such as financial rewards, training opportunities, and simplified documentation processes can encourage providers to integrate electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, and other digital tools into their practice. These incentives not only streamline workflows but also improve the quality of care and patient outcomes. Patient Engagement: Patients are increasingly becoming active participants in their healthcare journey. Incentives such as access to personalized health data, remote monitoring capabilities, and telehealth services empower patients to take charge of their health. By incentivizing patient engagement, healthcare organizations can enhance patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Interoperability and Data Sharing: Interoperability remains a significant challenge in the digital healthcare landscape. Incentives that promote data standardization, interoperability frameworks, and secure data exchange protocols incentivize healthcare organizations to share data seamlessly. This fosters collaboration, improves care coordination, and enables holistic patient management across different healthcare settings. Innovation and Research: Incentives stimulate innovation and research in digital healthcare technologies. Funding opportunities, grants, and recognition programs encourage researchers, startups, and healthcare organizations to develop and implement cutting-edge solutions. These incentives drive continuous improvement, foster collaboration between academia and industry, and catalyse the development of breakthrough technologies. Regulatory Compliance: Regulatory requirements often serve as both barriers and incentives for digital adoption in healthcare. Compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA in the United States or GDPR in Europe incentivizes healthcare organizations to prioritize data security, privacy, and ethical use of technology. Meeting regulatory requirements not only mitigates legal risks but also builds trust among patients and stakeholders. The comprehensive review of digital health incentive programs in several countries showcases examples of incentivization in different forms (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Canada, and India). By examining these programs, we aim to gain insights into their objectives, implementation, and impact on healthcare delivery. Various forms of Incentives in Healthcare Technology Adoption: United States: Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program – The Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, also known as the “Meaningful Use” program, was launched to encourage healthcare providers to adopt and effectively use certified EHR technology. [1] By meeting specific criteria, providers could qualify for financial incentives. This program played a pivotal role in accelerating EHR adoption across the United States, driving improvements in healthcare data exchange and patient care. United Kingdom: Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) – In the United Kingdom, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) incentivizes general practitioners to achieve certain quality and outcome targets in patient care. While not solely focused on digital health, the QOF includes digital health-related metrics. [2] This program has spurred innovation in primary care and incentivized the use of digital tools to improve patient management and health outcomes. [2] Australia: Practice Incentives Program (PIP) Digital Health Incentive – Australia’s PIP Digital Health Incentive encourages general practices to embrace digital health solutions, including electronic prescribing and My Health Record integration. By participating in this program, practices receive financial incentives, driving the adoption of digital health technologies and improving patient data accessibility. [3] Singapore: National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) Incentive Program – Singapore’s NEHR Incentive Program aims to create a comprehensive national electronic health record system. Healthcare institutions are incentivized to contribute data to the NEHR and adopt digital health systems. This initiative has fostered data sharing and improved healthcare coordination, ultimately benefiting patient care. [4] Canada: Digital Health Investment Review Program (iHRP) – Canada’s iHRP supports healthcare providers and organizations in adopting digital health solutions. It provides funding and resources for innovative digital health projects. By investing in digital health initiatives, Canada has enhanced healthcare access and improved patient outcomes. [5] India: Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) – The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) in India seeks to create a digital health ecosystem. It incentivizes healthcare providers and other relevant stakeholders through its Digital Health Incentive Scheme (DHIS) [6] to participate in ABDM initiatives, such as the creation of Health IDs and linking the patients’ health records. Such incentivization would help in building a patient-centric digital health ecosystem in the long run. This program holds the potential to transform India’s healthcare landscape, fostering patient-centric care and data interoperability. Challenges and Opportunities While digital health incentive programs have made significant progress, they face common challenges, including concerns about data privacy and security, interoperability issues, and resistance to change. Overcoming these challenges requires concerted efforts and innovative solutions. However, there are opportunities to enhance these schemes further: Data Standardization : Establishing global data standards can facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability among digital health systems. Patient Engagement : Incentivizing patient participation and engagement in digital health can lead to better health outcomes and improved data accuracy. Emerging Technologies : Leveraging emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things can revolutionize healthcare delivery and data management. Future Directions International Collaboration : Encouraging international collaboration and knowledge sharing to learn from each other’s successes and challenges can prove beneficial. Policy Innovation : There is a need to continuously adapt and refine incentive schemes to keep pace with evolving digital health technologies and emerging healthcare needs. Research and Innovation : By embracing new ideas, we can help in increasing research and innovation in digital health to uncover new ways to incentivize stakeholders and providers effectively. Conclusion Incentivization plays a pivotal role in driving the adoption of digital health technologies, ultimately benefiting patient care and healthcare delivery. The global digital health landscape is evolving rapidly, and incentive programs are adapting to meet new challenges and opportunities. By aligning incentives with stakeholders’ interests, healthcare organizations can overcome barriers, stimulate innovation, and improve patient outcomes. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, effective incentivization strategies will play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital healthcare delivery. By reviewing the experiences of different countries, we gain valuable insights into what works and where improvements are needed. Policymakers, healthcare leaders, and industry stakeholders must recognize the importance of incentives and utilize their power to drive meaningful changes in healthcare. As we look to the future, international collaboration, policy innovation, and continued research and innovation will shape the future of incentivization in the digital health ecosystem, ultimately improving healthcare for individuals worldwide.

https://borgenproject.org/womens-health-care-in-liberia/,,Improving Women Health Care in Liberia - The Borgen Project,20240325T164500Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Health-Care-in-Liberia.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"With a poverty rate of 27.6% , access to adequate health care facilities in Liberia is limited for many citizens. The statistics are alarming , with Liberia ranking fifth in maternal mortality rate and 18th in infant mortality rate globally. Moreover, fewer than 55 physicians are available to serve the entire population, making access to health care even more challenging. The Birth of Healthy Women Healthy Liberia The Foundation for Restoring Women’s Health Care to Liberia, also known as Healthy Women Healthy Liberia, was established in response to these pressing health care issues. This initiative, led by Dr. Chris Hena, a Liberian-born medical missionary, aims to develop improved health care tailored to address the needs of women in Liberia. With her extensive experience implementing community-based health care programs in various countries, Hena recognized the urgent need to reform Liberia’s health care system. Armed with a medical degree from Kuban Medical College in Russia and a Master’s in Public Health from Emory University, United States, Hena embarked on a mission to promote the health of the Liberian people through sustainable, community-based primary health care. Mission and Focus A clear mission drives Healthy Women Healthy Liberia : to promote people’s health and educate patients through comprehensive, sustainable, community-based primary health care. With a vision to transform communities using community-based health care models, mainly focusing on women and children, the initiative aims to improve the health and welfare of the people of Liberia.

CPD serves as a vital mechanism for medical professionals to stay abreast of advancements in medical science, technology, and healthcare practices. In a rapidly evolving field like medicine, where new research, treatments, and technologies emerge regularly, CPD provides healthcare practitioners with the necessary tools to adapt and integrate these innovations into their clinical practice. Through CPD, medical professionals engage in lifelong learning, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation within the healthcare system. Moreover, CPD ensures that healthcare practitioners maintain competency and proficiency in their respective specialties. By participating in CPD activities such as workshops, conferences, online courses, and hands-on training sessions, medical professionals enhance their clinical skills, critical-thinking abilities, and problem-solving aptitude. This continual skill development not only benefits individual practitioners but also enhances the quality and safety of patient care, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes. Furthermore, CPD plays a crucial role in addressing healthcare disparities and promoting inclusivity within the medical profession. By offering diverse CPD opportunities tailored to the needs of healthcare professionals from various backgrounds and specialties, CPD programmes facilitate equitable access to learning resources and career advancement opportunities. This inclusive approach not only fosters diversity within the medical workforce but also ensures that all patients receive culturally competent and sensitive care. The impact of CPD extends beyond individual practitioners and patients to the broader healthcare system and society as a whole. Through CPD, healthcare organisations can foster a culture of continuous improvement, innovation, and accountability, leading to more efficient healthcare delivery and resource utilisation. Additionally, CPD enables healthcare professionals to adapt to evolving healthcare policies, regulations, and ethical standards, thereby ensuring compliance and promoting ethical conduct in clinical practice. In conclusion, CPD is indispensable in modern medicine, serving as a catalyst for lifelong learning, skill enhancement, and quality improvement within the healthcare profession. By embracing CPD, medical professionals can stay at the forefront of medical advancements, deliver high-quality, patient-centred care, and contribute to the advancement of healthcare globally. As the landscape of medicine continues to evolve, the role of CPD will remain essential in shaping the future of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. DR NEIL ADRIAN SINGH via e-mail"

The adoption curve of AI in health care mirrors the classic early adopters versus late adapters scenario seen in technology uptake. As an emergency room (ER) doctor with a futurist outlook, the comparison between human roles and AI is intriguing and pivotal for understanding and navigating the future of medical care. Early adopters. These pioneers integrate new technologies into their practice ahead of the curve. They embrace the uncertainties of innovation, driven by the potential to enhance patient care and streamline operations. Late adapters. This group cautiously approaches new technology, waiting until it’s proven and risks are mitigated. Their cautious stance ensures stability but may delay access to the benefits of innovation. The critical role of AI in modern health care AI in health care is a collaborative tool that augments human capabilities. It offers unprecedented insights for improving diagnostics, personalizing treatments and predicting patient outcomes. Its role ranges from improving diagnostic accuracy to personalizing patient care plans. The imperative of AI knowledge in health care Enhancing patient care. AI’s ability to analyze extensive health data can lead to early diagnoses and timely interventions, crucial in the high-stakes ER environment. Streamlining operations. AI applications can optimize hospital operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and patient flow, vital in emergency care. Personalizing treatment. By leveraging vast datasets, AI enables treatments tailored to individual patient profiles, improving outcomes and satisfaction. Addressing challenges Despite AI’s potential, integrating it into health care has challenges, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and algorithmic bias. Addressing these requires collaboration between health care professionals and technologists. Human vs. AI in health care Unlike AI, human decisions in health care are influenced by experience, empathy, and the complexities of human interaction. While AI can provide data-driven support, it cannot replicate the compassionate aspects of patient care. The envisioned future is one where AI supports rather than replaces health care professionals. Conclusion Integrating AI into health care is a journey from early adoption to widespread acceptance. This journey emphasizes AI’s potential to enhance care, improve efficiency, and personalize treatments, all while navigating ethical and practical challenges. As an ER doctor with a forward-looking perspective, I view AI as an invaluable partner in improving patient outcomes. Understanding and engaging with AI is crucial for unlocking its full potential in enhancing patient care, marking a step towards a future where technology and human compassion converge to transform health care.

In November, the government announced plans for a refocused health care system to ensure patients are receiving the care they need, where and when they need it. A refocused health care system includes creating four new organizations, one for each of acute care, primary care, continuing care and mental health and addiction. Health care workers, patients, families, caregivers and community leaders across Alberta have been helping shape the future of health care by participating in what is one of the largest in-person public engagements ever undertaken by Alberta’s government. To date, more than 2,500 people have participated in the in-person sessions, with an additional 18,000 Albertans providing their feedback through online tools and almost 10,000 participating in virtual town halls. In response to requests for more opportunities for face-to-face conversations about the issues and potential solutions to current health care challenges, Alberta Health has added 22 more sessions. “Our goal is to build a stronger health care system informed by Albertans with real stories and real experiences. These engagement sessions have highlighted the importance of ensuring the new health care system is informed by front-line health care experts, as they have the most knowledge of the current system and the challenges and gaps that exist. With Albertans’ help, we will build a refocused health care system that better supports the well-being of front-line workers and prioritizes the needs of patients.” These engagement opportunities are taking place in every corner of the province for residents to share their unique and diverse perspectives on how to address the health care challenges they face in their communities. Common themes emerging from the engagement sessions include the need for strong system integration to drive seamless patient experiences, more opportunities for local decision-making and the need for more health care workers. Current in-person engagement sessions will wrap up in mid-April. As the work to refocus Alberta’s health care system continues, new engagement opportunities will be developed for front-line workers and Albertans to continue providing input and feedback on shaping the future of health care. “Refocusing the health system has brought Albertans together – all coming to the table and voicing what is working well in the current system, what are the challenges, and how it can be improved. We applaud government on the largest public engagement in recent history, as well as listening and actioning the advice of Albertans. Covenant is looking forward to transforming the health care system together with a focus on holistic system outcomes where our patients and residents are at the core of all decision-making.” “We know the current health care system is not meeting the needs of rural communities, but I'm encouraged by the changes being made to refocus the health care system. From a new branch dedicated to prioritizing rural health care to the engagement opportunities in rural and remote communities, we see efforts being made to ensure Albertans get the care they need no matter where they live. We are hopeful that as the restructuring continues, further engagement will take place specifically with rural municipalities."" Alberta’s government is committed to ongoing engagement with health care workers and Albertans throughout the refocusing process and beyond. Premier Danielle Smith has appointed Chelsae Petrovic, MLA for Livingstone-Macleod, as parliamentary secretary for health workforce engagement to support this work. “Engaging with Alberta's health care workers has been a cornerstone of our health system's refocusing efforts since its announcement last fall. This engagement is vital. The voices of our front-line workers are essential for understanding the realities they face, identifying areas for improvement, and gaining insight into the patient experience."" As the new organizations come into place, Alberta Health will keep conversations about health care ongoing with a variety of engagement opportunities. This will include visiting regions where there have been or will be sessions on refocusing over the coming weeks. The goal is to empower front-line workers and Albertans to help shape a health care system that meets the needs of Albertans today and for generations to come. Quick facts Sixty-five in-person engagement sessions will be held by the time in-person engagement wraps up in mid-April. The government anticipates there will be no job losses for AHS staff working in front-line positions directly delivering care to patients in all health sectors. Alberta’s health care workforce continues to grow with the addition in 2023 of 331 physicians, an increase of 2.9 per cent, and more than 7,500 regulated nurses, an increase of 11 per cent.

En novembre, le gouvernement a fait part de son intention de transformer le système de soins de santé afin de garantir que les patients reçoivent les soins dont ils ont besoin, à l’endroit et au moment où ils en ont besoin. Afin de le réorganiser, il est nécessaire de créer quatre organisations : une pour les soins de courte durée, une pour les soins primaires, une pour les soins continus, ainsi qu’une pour la santé mentale et la toxicomanie. Les professionnels de la santé, les patients, les familles, les personnes soignantes et les leaders communautaires à travers l’Alberta ont contribué à façonner l’avenir des soins de santé en participant à l’une des plus vastes consultations publiques en personne jamais organisées par le gouvernement. À ce jour, plus de 2 500 personnes ont pris part aux séances en personne, tandis que 18 000 autres ont fait part de leurs commentaires par l’intermédiaire d’outils en ligne et près de 10 000 ont pris part à des assemblées générales virtuelles. En réponse aux demandes de discussions en personnes concernant les problèmes et les solutions potentielles aux problèmes actuels en matière de soins de santé, Alberta Health a ajouté 22 séances supplémentaires. « Notre objectif est d’établir un système de soins de santé plus solide, en nous appuyant sur les récits et les expériences réelles des habitants de l’Alberta. Ces séances de mobilisation ont mis en avant l’importance de garantir que le nouveau système de santé bénéficie de l’expertise des experts en soins de santé de première ligne, car ce sont eux qui connaissent le mieux le système actuel ainsi que les problèmes et les lacunes qui existent. Avec l’aide de la population albertaine, nous construirons un système de santé recentré qui favorisera le bien-être des travailleurs de première ligne et qui priorisera les besoins des patients. » Ces séances se déroulent dans toute la province afin que les habitants puissent faire part de leurs diverses perspectives personnelles sur la façon de relever les défis en matière de soins de santé auxquels ils sont confrontés dans leur communauté. Les thèmes communs qui ressortent des séances de mobilisation sont la nécessité d’une forte intégration des systèmes pour permettre aux patients de vivre une bonne expérience, l’augmentation des possibilités de prise de décision au niveau local et le besoin d’un plus grand nombre de travailleurs de la santé. Les séances en personne actuelles se termineront à la mi-avril. Durant la réorientation du système de santé de l’Alberta, de nouvelles séances de mobilisations seront mises en place pour les travailleurs de première ligne et la population albertaine afin qu’ils puissent continuer à apporter leur contribution et leurs commentaires pour façonner l’avenir des soins de santé. « La restructuration du système de santé a uni les Albertaines et les Albertains. Tous ont pris part à la discussion et ont précisé ce qui fonctionne bien dans le système actuel, quels sont les défis à relever et de quelle façon il serait possible de l’améliorer. Nous félicitons le gouvernement pour la plus importante mobilisation publique de l’histoire récente, ainsi que pour avoir écouté et mis en œuvre les conseils de la population. Covenant se réjouit à l’idée de transformer le système de soins de santé en mettant l’accent sur des résultats holistiques où nos patients et nos pensionnaires sont au cœur de toutes les décisions. » « Nous savons que le système de soins de santé actuel ne répond pas aux besoins des personnes vivant en région rurale, mais je suis encouragée par les mesures prises pour restructurer le système de soins de santé. De la mise en place d’une nouvelle direction ayant pour mission de donner la priorité aux soins de santé en milieu rural aux séances de mobilisation dans les villages et les régions éloignées, nous constatons qu’on déploie des efforts visant à garantir que les Albertaines et les Albertains reçoivent les soins dont ils ont besoin, peu importe l’endroit où ils vivent. Nous espérons qu’au fur et à mesure que la restructuration se poursuivra, d’autres engagements seront pris, notamment avec les municipalités rurales. » Le gouvernement de l’Alberta s’engage à continuer à travailler en étroite collaboration avec les travailleurs de la santé et les habitants de l’Alberta tout au long du processus de restructuration, et même au-delà. La première ministre Danielle Smith a nommé Chelsae Petrovic, députée de Livingstone-Macleod, secrétaire parlementaire pour la mobilisation du personnel de santé afin de soutenir ce travail. « La mobilisation des travailleurs de la santé albertains est la pierre angulaire des efforts de recentrage de notre système de santé depuis l’annonce de sa nomination l’automne dernier. Leur participation est essentielle. Les opinions de nos travailleurs de première ligne sont essentielles pour comprendre leurs réalités, savoir quels domaines il faut améliorer et avoir une idée de l’expérience des patients. » Au fur et à mesure que les nouvelles organisations seront mises en place, Alberta Health continuera d’entretenir des conversations sur les soins de santé en proposant diverses options de mobilisation. Pour ce faire, il faudra se rendre dans les régions où des séances sur le recentrage ont eu lieu ou auront lieu dans les semaines à venir. L’objectif est de donner aux travailleurs de première ligne et aux habitants de l’Alberta les moyens de contribuer à l’élaboration d’un système de santé qui réponde aux besoins de la population d’aujourd’hui et des générations à venir. Faits en bref Soixante-cinq séances de mobilisation en personne seront organisées d’ici la fin de la mobilisation en personne à la mi-avril. Le gouvernement prévoit qu’il n’y aura pas de perte d’emploi pour le personnel de première ligne de Services de santé Alberta qui prodigue directement des soins aux patients dans tous les secteurs de la santé. En 2023, le nombre de professionnels de la santé en Alberta continue de croître avec l’ajout de 331 médecins, soit une augmentation de 2,9 %, et de plus de 7 500 infirmiers réglementés, soit une hausse de 11 %.

Oneview Healthcare PLC develops and sells software and related consultancy services for the healthcare sector in Ireland, the United States, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East. On 31 December 2023, the AU$194m market-cap company posted a loss of €8.9m for its most recent financial year. The most pressing concern for investors is Oneview Healthcare's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Oneview Healthcare According to some industry analysts covering Oneview Healthcare, breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2025, before generating positive profits of €1.8m in 2026. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 2 years from today. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 75% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected. ASX:ONE Earnings Per Share Growth March 21st 2024 Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Oneview Healthcare's upcoming projects, though, bear in mind that by and large healthcare tech companies, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments. Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. Oneview Healthcare currently has no debt on its balance sheet, which is rare for a loss-making healthcare tech company, which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity. This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company. Next Steps: There are too many aspects of Oneview Healthcare to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Oneview Healthcare's company page on Simply Wall St . We've also compiled a list of essential factors you should further examine: Valuation : What is Oneview Healthcare worth today? Has the future growth potential already been factored into the price?

An additional 1m residents will come under medical insurance from January 2025 Last updated: March 21, 2024 | 06:30 Manoj Nair , Business Editor 5 MIN READ UAE’s medical insurance for all employees can create one of the biggest build ups in healthcare facilities across northern emirates. Shutterstock Also In This Package Can Riyadh’s new downtown add $50 billion to economy? Photos: Diriyah unveils The Arena in Saudi Arabia Photos: UK's modern-day green airship takes shape Photos: Top 10 must watch Indian entrepreneurs in 2024 Dubai: With the UAE extending compulsory medical insurance for all private sector employees, the healthcare sector in the northern emirates could be in for a substantial increase in private sector led investments. While Abu Dhabi and Dubai already have private sector hospital operators with entrenched presence, the same will now happen across the other emirates too, say industry sources. Currently, government-owned or government-affiliated healthcare operators dominate those markets. “There have also been cases where residents in a northern emirate would seek treatment at a private healthcare facility in Dubai,” said a senior industry source. “Because there is the impression that doing so could lead to lower cost of treatment, or simply because there was no private sector option available in the other emirate.” What will change now? Effective January 1, 2025, all private sector employees in the UAE will need to have insurance cover provided by their employer. This requirement has already been there for some time in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, within and outside of their free zones. Group medical insurance will thus have to be provided by all private sector entities in the other emirates from next year. (The UAE law also applies to domestic workers.) What this would do is bring, potentially, another 1 million residents across the northern emirates into universal health insurance coverage. Many UAE insurers have been working on new medical insurance schemes to cover residents in the northern emirates Supplied M. Rajendran of Burns & Wilcox MENA Government organisations there already provide such protection to staff, and lots of privately-owned businesses also have such schemes. But the January 1, 2025 cutoff means there can be no more exemptions henceforth. “This step has been on the anvil for a long time and many UAE insurers have been working on new schemes to cover residents in the northern emirates,” said M. Rajendran, President and CEO of Burns & Wilcox MENA. “This will be a relief to many who currently do not have any medical coverage. From an employer perspective, while it may increase their operational costs, in the long run it will help them have a stable - and healthier – workforce.” How will medical plans be priced? The mention about insurers working on creating new plans specific to the northern emirates is on point. Other insurers also say that recreating the same pricing and benefits available in Dubai and Abu Dhabi may not work. Apart from the basic plan, which ranges between Dh550-Dh750 annually, the others will need some extensive reworking, they add. This initiative holds the promise of catalyzing increased investments in healthcare infrastructure, thereby enhancing the system and elevating public health standards across all the Emirates. By ensuring universal access to essential healthcare services through comprehensive insurance coverage, the resultant surge in demand for healthcare facilities is anticipated to attract fresh capital investments For insurers, one thing is clear – starting January 2025, they will have a much bigger base for their medical insurance portfolio. This is also what healthcare operators are eyeing. A bigger base of the insured will mean more people approaching healthcare providers for treatment consultations. And much more regularly at that, which has been the experience in Dubai and Abu Dhabi when universal coverage was introduced. “This initiative holds the promise of catalyzing increased investments in healthcare infrastructure,” said Dr. Thumbay Moideen, founder President of Thumbay Group. What the new law does is integrate healthcare into a broader economic diversification strategy as part of the UAE's Vision 2030 Supplied Dr. Thumbay Moideen of Thumbay Group When that happens, this translates into new hospitals, specialty care facilities and clinics multiply in the northern emirates. “The implementation of medical insurance for all in the UAE marks a monumental shift towards enhancing healthcare accessibility and quality,” said Dr. Jamil Ahmed, founder and managing Director of Prime Health. “It's a catalyst for increased healthcare spending, especially in the northern Emirates, (and) promising to elevate our healthcare system's infrastructure and services to new heights.” Implementation of medical insurance for all marks a monumental shift towards enhancing healthcare accessibility and quality. Supplied Dr. Jamil Ahmed of Prime Health Look at the numbers Any healthcare operator mulling an investment in one of the northern emirates must go over these numbers. “With a population of 10.5 million in the UAE, approximately 9.5 million individuals have insurance, leaving around one million without coverage, primarily in the northern emirates,” said Dr. Raza Siddiqui, Executive Director for RAK Hospital and CEO of Arabian Healthcare Group.(The group is working on a new 200-bed hospital in Ras Al Khaimah.) “In the absence of insurance, many companies failed to provide the necessary healthcare services. While some companies provided insurance, many did not, leaving a gap in access to proper care. In the absence of insurance, many companies failed to provide the necessary healthcare services, leaving individuals to fend for themselves. . It's crucial to understand that when bringing in expatriates, regardless of their employment level, we bear a responsibility for their healthcare Supplied Dr. Raza Siddiqui of RAK Hospital “Often, individuals sought treatment from general practitioners at low cost but received inadequate care. There have been some incidents where individuals experiencing serious medical emergencies were only given basic pain medication, leading to consequences due to delayed proper medical intervention. “It's crucial for us to understand that when we bring in expatriates, regardless of their employment level, we bear a responsibility for their healthcare. Unfortunately, until it became mandatory, this responsibility wasn't consistently met. “Although there may be initial challenges with supply and demand, the new UAE Government decision presents a significant opportunity for investment in healthcare services in the northern emirates.” Sign up for the Daily Briefing Get the latest news and updates straight to your inbox SIGN UP Up Next Related Stories Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix: Hotel rates surge to Dh172,487 3 m read UAE sets its 6G plan in motion 2 m read Dubai Taxi aims for 72% ride-hailing market share 4 m read ADNOC L&S posts strongest 9-month results since listing 2 m read"

If you do not want to learn about the global healthcare market, head straight to the 5 Countries With Limited Access To Healthcare . Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many countries around the world grapple with limited access to essential medical services. This critical issue spans across various regions, affecting millions who lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, resources, and affordability. From remote rural areas to densely populated urban centers, disparities in healthcare access persist, posing significant challenges to public health and well-being. Understanding the complexities of healthcare accessibility in these nations sheds light on the urgent need for global initiatives to address disparities and ensure equitable healthcare for all. Overview of the Global Healthcare Market and Analysis of the US Health Market The global healthcare market is a significant and rapidly growing industry, valued at approximately $7.7 trillion and reached $8.5 trillion by 2020. This sector is undergoing a transformation driven by technological advancements, demographic shifts, and evolving patient needs. Key trends shaping the future of healthcare delivery include the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for streamlining processes, sustainability practices, remote technologies for care delivery, and innovative cost management strategies. In several countries, limited health access poses significant challenges. Brazil, for instance, has universal healthcare covering 75% of the population, with the remaining 25% relying on a private system primarily funded by employers. Medical inflation in the private sector is high at 17.3%, prompting the need for solutions to manage costs effectively. Similarly, China is expanding its healthcare infrastructure, aiming to add 20,000 hospitals within the next decade and double healthcare spending from 5% to 10% of GDP. Financial statistics and data points reveal insights into the US healthcare industry. In 2020, US healthcare industry revenue totaled $1.27 trillion but experienced a significant drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2021, the industry is worth $808 billion in the US, with 65% of revenue coming from patient care. Globally, the healthcare industry is valued at $12 trillion, showing consistent growth rates over recent years. Employment in healthcare occupations is expected to grow by at least 16% between 2020 and 2030 in the US. Unveiling the Veil: Untold Realities of Global Healthcare Inflation hits global healthcare hard, particularly in the US. From 2000 to June 2023, while all goods and services rose by 80.8%, healthcare costs surged by 114.3% , reports the Bureau of Labour Statistics. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies healthcare spending. Even as the world moves towards endemicity, COVID-19 remains a significant expense. McKinsey projects an extra $200 billion annually for COVID-19 treatment and prevention in the US. Despite escalating healthcare costs, outcomes in the US don’t match the investment. In 2020, the US spent nearly 20% of its GDP on healthcare, surpassing most nations. However, the system fails to deliver proportionate results. Life expectancy plummeted by 2.4 years from 2019 to 2021, compared to just 0.3 years in other OECD countries, per the Peterson Centre on Healthcare. Women face unequal access to quality healthcare, leading to adverse outcomes. West Virginia and Mexico have alarming mortality rates among reproductive-age women, preventable with better healthcare access. Racial disparities worsen outcomes, especially in prenatal care. Shockingly, in states like Texas and Florida, nearly 29% of females missed crucial prenatal care in 2021, worsening the situation. Misunderstanding healthcare’s role in retirement planning is dangerous. Despite 84% of working Americans underestimating its impact, 38% of retirees aged 45 to 75 retired due to health issues. This discrepancy could lead to skyrocketing healthcare costs during retirement, demanding immediate attention and planning.

Our Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the countries with limited access to health care based on Physicians per million people. For the accuracy of data, we relied on World Atlas . Here is our list of the 25 countries with limited access to health care. 25. Guinea Physicians per Million People: 100 Guinea’s healthcare system faces challenges including high injury mortality (72.8 per 100,000) , diverse causes of death (infectious diseases, maternal conditions, neonatal issues), and rising non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Limited funding ( $2,580 per capita income) hampers healthcare investment. However, efforts by the CDC, including the President’s Malaria Initiative, aim to improve disease surveillance and control, despite infrastructure constraints. 24. Ghana Physicians per Million People: 96 Ghana’s healthcare system shows progress with a 7% decrease in institutional mortality rates from 2014 to 2018. In 2018, Ghana recorded a 66.3% rise in total deaths compared to 2017, with non-communicable diseases and maternal mortality as leading causes. Malaria prevalence in children under five decreased significantly from 26.7% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2022, but HIV/AIDS rates remain high among key populations. USAID’s support has contributed to a 50% reduction in under-five mortality between 2008 and 2022, focusing on COVID-19 response, reproductive health, nutrition, malaria, HIV/AIDS, health system strengthening, WASH, and social protection. 23. Congo Physicians per Million People: 95 The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) struggles with limited healthcare access due to financial constraints and lack of universal coverage. Hospitals detain patients for unpaid bills, with over 60% of Congolese living on less than $2.15 a day. Despite allocating $42 million for maternal and neonatal care, financial challenges persist, impeding healthcare improvements. 22. Zimbabwe Physicians per Million People: 83 Zimbabwe’s healthcare system faces challenges due to economic crises, resulting in poor infrastructure and limited medical supplies, especially in rural areas. Common causes of death include HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and non-communicable diseases. Healthcare spending is low at $21 per citizen in 2020, far below international recommendations. Rural health centers receive inadequate funding despite serving a significant population. 21. Mali Physicians per Million People: 83 Mali’s healthcare access is limited, especially in maternal and child health, leading to high mortality rates. Maternal deaths are mainly due to hemorrhage and obstructed labor, worsened in rural areas with scarce interventions like caesarian sections. With a low per capita income of $2,160 , Mali struggles with limited healthcare resources. The CDC and UNICEF support Mali’s healthcare, focusing on diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and meningitis, while improving laboratory systems, surveillance, and workforce capacity. 20. Cameroon Physicians per Million People: 80 Cameroon faces significant healthcare challenges, including a critical shortage of personnel, low funding (only 4% of the national budget allocated to healthcare), and widespread corruption. Mortality rates remain high, with child mortality at 122 deaths per 1,000 live births, primarily due to infectious diseases like malaria. Health expenditure stands at around US$61 per capita, higher than the sub-Saharan African average but still insufficient. 19. Timor Leste Physicians per Million People: 73 Timor-Leste has made progress in healthcare since gaining independence but faces challenges in equitable access to hospital care. The health system operates on a constrained budget of US$8 per capita annually, with 75% of services provided by the public sector. Lack of patient transport, financial barriers, and socio-cultural factors hinder access to hospital care. 18. Senegal Physicians per Million People: 59 Senegal struggles with healthcare access, particularly in rural areas and among low-income groups, exacerbated by a shortage of healthcare professionals and low government spending. Common diseases like cardiovascular diseases, injuries, neonatal disorders, and communicable diseases contribute to excess mortality due to poor quality healthcare services. 17. Benin Physicians per Million People: 59 Benin’s healthcare system faces significant challenges, resulting in high mortality rates, particularly among mothers and newborns. In 2020, maternal mortality stood at 397 deaths per 100,000 live births, well above the global average of 223 deaths. Common diseases like malaria further strain the system, with 30 neonatal deaths per 1,000 births compared to the global average of 18 deaths. 16. Papua New Guinea Physicians per Million People: 58 Papua New Guinea grapples with significant healthcare challenges, including shortages of staff, underfunded facilities, and poor infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. This leads to limited access to essential medical care and high mortality rates, especially among mothers and children. Common diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory infections further strain the healthcare system. Efforts are underway, including the US$30 million IMPACT Health project and support from the Australian Government, to improve healthcare delivery, particularly in rural regions. 15. Rwanda Physicians per Million People: 56 Rwanda faces challenges in providing quality healthcare, particularly inequitable access. However, Rwanda has achieved remarkable health improvements, with significant drops in HIV, TB, and malaria deaths, and a 60% decrease in maternal mortality. Life expectancy has doubled, despite spending only $55 per person annually on healthcare. Rwanda’s primary health strategy aims for people to access facilities within 24 minutes by 2024 , with innovative measures like establishing over 1,000 health posts closer to communities. 14. Togo Physicians per Million People: 53 Togo grapples with significant healthcare challenges, including high mortality rates among women and children. With 368 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and a child mortality rate of nearly 1 in 10 not reaching their 5th birthday, access to quality healthcare remains limited. Mortality rates among older adults are notable, with 93.7% of deaths occurring in hospitals. Togo’s social health system covers only 7.6% of the population, highlighting the need for improved access. 13. Central African Republic Physicians per Million People: 50 The Central African Republic (CAR) grapples with severe healthcare challenges, primarily due to limited access to medical services, exacerbated by conflicts and a struggling health system. CAR has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in Central Africa , and tuberculosis is a significant concern. The World Bank approved a $138 million grant for the Electricity Sector Strengthening and Access Project (PARSE) and allocated $70 million to restore and protect essential health services, including the COVID-19 response. 12. Burkina Faso Physicians per Million People: 47 Burkina Faso, a low-income Sahelian country, grapples with significant healthcare access challenges despite ongoing reforms. Common diseases like malaria and malnutrition contribute to high mortality rates. Over 40% live below the poverty line, exacerbating budget deficits, while inflation fluctuates due to insecurity and global events. 11. Guinea Bissau Physicians per Million People: 45 Guinea-Bissau grapples with dire healthcare challenges, including limited access, high mortality rates, and prevalent diseases. Maternal mortality is alarmingly high, reaching 549 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015. Malaria is a major concern, deadlier than AIDS, with cholera outbreaks adding to public health threats. 10. Mozambique Physicians per Million People: 40 Mozambique grapples with healthcare access and mortality challenges despite initiatives like the COMSA project and community health worker deployments. Mortality rates vary by age, with neonatal and under-five mortality rates at 23 and 80 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively. Financially, Mozambique’s GDP per capita was $504 in 2019, with health expenditure accounting for 8% of GDP. 9. Gambia Physicians per Million People: 38 Gambia faces significant challenges in healthcare access, highlighted by high mortality rates among children under 5. A tragic incident involving contaminated cough syrups from India led to the deaths of at least 70 children, sparking legal actions. Financial constraints, with an average monthly salary of $68 and half the population living below the poverty line, hinder access to necessary medical care. 8. Chad Physicians per Million People: 37 Chad struggles with limited healthcare access, characterized by a shortage of professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and financial constraints, resulting in poor health outcomes and high mortality rates. The country reports a death rate of 163.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, signaling an inefficient healthcare system. Out-of-pocket healthcare payments are high, covering around 60% of costs, imposing a significant financial burden on the population. Chad spends approximately $30 per capita on healthcare, leading to poorly equipped facilities and difficulties in paying healthcare workers. 7. Somalia Physicians per Million People: 35 Somalia struggles with healthcare access, with less than 30% of the population able to access services, mainly centralized in major towns. Dire health outcomes include high neonatal mortality (40 deaths per 1000 live births), under-5 mortality (137 deaths per 1000 live births), and maternal mortality (732 per 100,000 live births). A study in 2022 estimated 43,000 “excess deaths” due to drought, further straining the healthcare system. Somalia allocates minimal budget to healthcare, resulting in poor infrastructure and limited rural access ( 15% ). 6. Tanzania Physicians per Million People: 30 Tanzania’s healthcare system faces significant challenges with limited access and high mortality rates. Between 2006-2015, 247,976 deaths were recorded, with malaria, respiratory diseases, and HIV/AIDS among the leading causes. Despite declines in some diseases, neonatal disorders saw a 128% increase. Over 60% of healthcare facilities are government-run, with low health insurance coverage (32%). The government allocated substantial funds, but private health insurance covers only 1%. Tanzania aims for universal healthcare, receiving support from donors like the US government through USAID and CDC.

One significant stride in this direction is the adoption of digital health records, which offers various benefits for patients. Let's understand how going digital with health records is revolutionizing patient care. Firstly, digital health records streamline the healthcare journey for patients. With traditional paper-based records, patients often face delays and inconvenience in accessing their medical history or test reports. However, with digital health records safely stored on an app like DRiefcase, accessible through Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA), patients can conveniently view and manage their health records all in one place anytime, anywhere. This accessibility allows patients to take charge of their health and make informed decisions for themselves. Once the health records are linked with the patient’s ABHA Card on DRiefcase, the patient’s medical data is also easily accessible by authorized healthcare providers with the patient’s consent. This seamless sharing of information facilitates better coordination among healthcare professionals, ensuring that patients receive good care. Whether it's a doctor consultation or a visit to a different healthcare facility, patients can expect continuity in their treatment journey. In fact, a remarkable 57.97+ Crore ABHA accounts have already been created, showcasing the widespread adoption of digital healthcare solutions. Furthermore, an impressive number of over 35.47 Crore health records have been seamlessly linked with ABHA, highlighting the effective integration of digital health records and there are more than 2.38 Lakh verified facilities on HFR (Healthcare Facility Registry), further emphasizing the extensive utilization of digital healthcare platforms. Digital health records also contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. With accurate and up-to-date information available through ABHA, healthcare providers can make more informed diagnosis and treatment decisions. This reduces the likelihood of medical errors and ensures that patients receive the most appropriate care tailored to their individual needs. Moreover, with the ABDM focusing on universal health coverage, digital records also play an important role in reaching the underserved population and remote areas. In conclusion, the transition to digital records signifies a notable advancement in healthcare delivery. It enhances accessibility, ensures continuity of care and improves healthcare outcomes. Embracing the digital era and moving to digital health records are crucial steps towards providing patient-centered, efficient and quality healthcare services for all. https://www.driefcase.com/create-abha-abdm-ndhm-health-id/ (Disclaimer: The above press release comes to you under an arrangement with PNN and PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same.).

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Thirteen years ago this month, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare. In theory, the ACA shouldn’t have affected public school districts all that much. Most already offered health care plans that met the ACA’s requirements to at least cover 10 “ essential benefits ,” and a “Cadillac Tax” on high-cost plans that had been included in the original bill was delayed and then eventually repealed . Teachers were and remain more likely than other workers to have access to health care benefits. They also are more likely than private-sector professionals to receive ancillary benefits, like coverage for dental, vision and prescription drugs, and continued benefits after retirement.

According to a survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics called the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation , the price tag for teacher health insurance benefits was rising at a rate of nearly 6% per year. In contrast, inflation was growing at just over 2% a year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Observing these patterns in the broader economy, ACA champions talked about “bending the cost curve” and reducing the rate at which health care expenses would grow over time. It worked. Within public education, district health care costs immediately began to slow. And, in the last three years, the relationship has flipped entirely, with teacher health care costs growing considerably more slowly than inflation. It’s not just happening in education. Private-sector employers are seeing similar improvements, as are other government-provided health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. One explanation for the slower rates of growth for employers might be that they have simply shifted more of the costs onto the backs of employees. Within education, for example, the share of medical care premiums for a typical individual health care plan picked up by employers has fallen from 89% in 2010 to 85% in 2023. The comparable rate for family plans has also dipped, from 69 to 65%. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In other words, school districts are asking teachers to pick up a slightly higher share of their health care benefits. By my rough calculations, that has cut the average educator’s take-home pay by a little more than $300 per year for those covered by individual plans and almost $900 for those using family plans. It’s also possible that the plans themselves have changed and shifted more costs onto workers through higher deductibles and co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses. That’s hard to prove for teachers specifically, but per-person out-of-pocket expenses nationally have risen by about $175 since 2010, in real terms. That’s not nothing. But it pales in comparison to the savings on the employer side. According to the bureau’s data mentioned above, districts are saving a little over 9% of each teacher’s salary thanks to the slowdown in health care costs post-ACA. That works out to an average saving of more than $6,000 per teacher, or roughly $25 billion nationwide. Of course, districts haven’t passed all those health care savings on to teachers, at least partly because districts have chosen to stretch their budgets over more employees . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Moreover, while districts may have seen their health care costs slow down, employee benefit costs overall continue to rise, thanks to large increases on the retirement side. As I noted in a piece for Bellwether last summer, teacher pension costs are rising about 8% every year, and they have shown no signs of slowing down. In other words, district budget officials have gotten a measure of relief from the slowdown in health care expenses. But the average school employee may not be seeing or enjoying the benefits of these trends. About Our Ads"

By Christopher Snowbeck The Minnesota Star Tribune March 18, 2024 at 4:03PM UnitedHealth Group has its headquarters in Minnetonka. (Provided by UnitedHealth Group/guest) Comment Gift Share Listen UnitedHealth Group, in a public update Monday, says it’s provided more than $2 billion to health care providers that have suffered financial disruption in the fallout of a wide-reaching cyberattack. The cyberattack against its Change Healthcare subsidiary at the end of February had a cascading effect on hospitals, clinics and health care providers across the country that relied on the company’s medical information services for billing. The Minnetonka-based health care giant said Monday it continues to make progress towards relaunching those information technology systems this month. The update comes after health care providers last week told the Star Tribune about their challenges accessing assistance funds from the company. The American Hospital Association earlier this month blasted UnitedHealth’s initial financial relief program as insufficient. “We continue to make significant progress in restoring the services impacted by this cyberattack,” Andrew Witty, the chief executive at UnitedHealth Group, said in a statement. “We know this has been an enormous challenge for health care providers and we encourage any in need to contact us.” The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services met with health insurers Monday to push other companies on making advance funds available to struggling health care providers. So far, the cash crunch has not resulted in access to care problems, HHS officials say, although the department continues to hear that some small, rural and safety net providers need financial help. Getting funding to these groups is key to making sure clinics can keep providing care, HHS says. UnitedHealth Group has been asked to serve as a central clearinghouse for information and support, so that providers get connected with resources to prevent cash flow problems, the government says. UnitedHealth is continuing to enhance and expand funding support for health care providers, the company said, while making it easier for them to access those funds. In its statement, UnitedHealth said it “recognizes the high level of fragmentation of the U.S. health system can result in uneven experiences.” There’s been significant progress over the past week in getting more claims processed, officials say. The current volume of claims making it through the system, including through workarounds, is back to about 95% of normal. The cyberattack last month targeted Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary that runs a widely used clearinghouse for electronic claims data that processes 15 billion health care transactions annually . The systems are involved in one out of every three patient records in the U.S. UnitedHealth Group is cooperating with a federal investigation into the cyberattack while scrambling to restore the systems at Change Healthcare it was forced to shut down to contain the threat. On Monday, Change Healthcare started releasing medical claims preparation software, an important step toward restoring services. The company expects to provide third-party verification about systems being ready. The company’s electronic payments platform was restored Friday. UnitedHealth Group launched a temporary financial assistance program March 1 that used historical claims to evaluate need. This was incomplete for some health care providers and, as a result, the help offered was far too little for some. On March 7, UnitedHealth announced improvements to the initial program and a last-resort offer that could give advanced funds for health care groups without other options. “The company has launched a series of educational on-demand webinars to help providers and customers learn how to reconnect to our claims and payment networks and to explain how to take advantage of the temporary funding assistance programs,” UnitedHealth Group said Monday in a statement.

The healthcare sector mutual funds have emerged as the third best equity category, with 59% average return in the past one-year period, marking a swift turnaround from losses in the previous 12 months. Though the recent positive performance may tempt investors eager to capitalise on this structural trend, there are various nuances in ‘healthcare’ funds that investors must consider before laying their bets on these sectoral offerings. Decoding healthcare Managing over Rs.23,000 crore in assets, there are 22 healthcare sector funds today. Eight of these are passively managed, which means that they track indices such as the Nifty Healthcare, BSE Healthcare, Nifty Pharma, and others. These cost 8-40 basis points in expense ratio. Best MF to invest Looking for the best mutual funds to invest? Here are our recommendations. View Details » Of the 14 actively managed funds, 10 (higher expense ratio of 50-100 bps) have at least one-year NAV track record, while the rest are relatively new. UTI Healthcare, SBI Healthcare Opportunities and Nippon India Pharma are among the oldest schemes. Although labelled as healthcare funds , the majority (70-80%) of their assets are invested in pharmaceutical stocks. The remaining portion (15-20%) is allocated to healthcare-associated stocks, including hospitals, diagnostic chains, insurers, chemical companies, pharmacies, and others. Such companies operate under dynamics that differ from those of diversified or domestic pharma firms. Despite this, the equity market has re-rated them, following the pandemic. “Spirited stock market performance of healthcare companies (hospital and diagnostics) after Covid has resulted in higher allocation to the sector by pharma funds,” says Chandrachoodamani N.V., Senior Equity Analyst, PrimeInvestor. This segment can provide enhanced exposure to domestic businesses, including services, compared to the majority of pharmaceutical companies, which primarily focus on exports. Don’t be blinded by high 1-year returns Live Events The stock universe of healthcare funds consists of about 70 stocks (excluding overseas firms), with roughly 50% being large caps and the remaining categorised as mid and small caps. Market capitalisation distribution closely mirrors that of the BSE Healthcare index. However, certain newly launched schemes, such as Quant Healthcare and WhiteOak Capital Pharma and Healthcare, exhibit higher exposure to mid and small caps. Across actively managed healthcare funds, top holdings (in % terms) are Sun Pharma, Cipla, Apollo Hospitals, Lupin, Max Healthcare, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma, Suven Pharma, KIMS, Divi’s, Rainbow Children’s Medicare, Gland Pharma, Abbott India and Fortis Healthcare. Most funds have 58-70% of their holdings in 10 stocks. While investing in sectoral funds, the investor wants to maximise the potential of the sector by allocating higher amounts to the best players in the sectors. “Hence, it’s fine for funds to have concentration of funds in the top 10 stocks,” points out Anand K. Rathi, Co-Founder, Mira Money. Tracking returns The recent performance surge has lifted the category scorecard of healthcare funds, with an average return of 59% over a one-year period, a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a three-year period, and 23% CAGR over a five-year period. This is as per the latest data from Value Research. However, investors should note that, historically, healthcare has been a ‘defensive’ play, and tends to do well during market corrections. Data indicates that the BSE Healthcare index managed to mitigate losses during challenging years, such as 2008 and 2011. Further, if we divide the last 10 years of the BSE Healthcare index into five phases, it’s observed that healthcare funds underperformed during three rising periods, but outperformed during the two declining phases. “Instead of looking at just returns, healthcare portfolios can provide a low-correlated return stream compared with the broader markets. This can potentially boost the overall risk-adjusted return,” says financial planner Karthik Jha. A few funds, such as DSP Healthcare and ICICI Prudential Pharma Healthcare and Diagnostics (P.H.D), use the overseas route for diversification. Overseas stocks include the likes of Globus Medical, TARA, Abbott Labs, Illumina, Viatris, Intuitive Surgical and Lonza. “For a fund aiming to invest in the sector and invest in companies best positioned to grow with the current opportunity cycle, it makes sense to do the same in a geography-agnostic manner,” says Nirav Karkera, Head, Research, Fisdom. In India, the healthcare sector has been trading around long-term averages in terms of valuations. “We turned bullish on the entire pharma and healthcare space in January 2024. The sectoral funds are a good addition to the tactical portfolio allocation of MF investors who are looking to enhance returns through concentrated bets,” says Gautam Kalia, Head, Super Investor, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. Supported by a decent earnings outlook, driven by factors such as a long growth runway, healthcare funds have the potential to perform well if the markets continue to rise, while also providing a cushion against any potential declines. Analysts see an uptrend in this space due to the launch of new products in the US and India markets, loss of exclusivity opportunity across regions for generic players, priority to healthcare spend by the Indian customer, and cash-rich position of many firms.

The RFI seeks ""public comment regarding the effects of transactions involving health care providers . . . facilities, or ancillary products or services, conducted by private equity funds or other alternative asset managers, health systems, or private payers"" during a 60-day public comment period, which closes on May 6. The RFI seeks information from all health care industry ""stakeholders"" on the following topics: The effects of consolidation on patients, public and private payers, providers, health care workers, support staff, and employers that provide health insurance for their employees Claimed business objectives for health care transactions and whether or not those objectives were realized post-transaction Notable transactions and buyers that have been associated with adverse impacts in the past The need for government action The RFI was issued pursuant to the White House's December 2023 action plan to ""lower health care and prescription drug costs by promoting competition."" It is also consistent with the FTC's and DOJ's 2023 Merger Guidelines that target PE buyers. Shortly after the RFI was issued, FTC Chair Lena Khan spoke at the FTC's March 5 virtual workshop on the impact of PE in health care. Khan's remarks echoed language previously used by the White House in expressing concerns over the ""growing financialization"" of the health care industry and the impact of ""anticompetitive roll ups"" and other transactions that are not reportable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The DOJ has also articulated similar concerns. The FTC, DOJ, and HHS are already sharing information with each other about non-reportable transactions to help crack down on any transactions they believe could potentially pose a risk to competition in health care. Going forward, it's important to remember that the agencies are following public statements made by market participants about health care deals. Also, it is plausible that nonpublic communications by market participants could be reported to the agencies by competitors or others in the industry.

Patients and health care practitioners face the challenge of securely accessing, managing, integrating, and sharing health records . While blockchain is gaining attention in various industries, its application in health care and population health is still preliminary. Data security and interoperability By combining data security measures with innovative approaches to interoperability, blockchain technology offers a promising solution for overcoming the challenges inherent in traditional health care data management. Embracing digital transformation is an initiative-taking way for the health care industry to evolve and put patients first. Blockchain stands out as a beacon of security and interoperability, paving the way for a more connected and secure health care ecosystem . It can enhance data security in health care and help explore the role of decentralized ledgers in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of health information across different health care systems. Patient-centric health records on blockchain In the traditional health care model, patient data is often scattered across various providers and systems, so it is challenging for individuals to manage and control their health information. The emergence of patient-centric health records stored on the blockchain promises a transformative shift that empowers people with unprecedented control over their health data . Decentralized ownership. In a blockchain-based system, patients own their health records, which health care providers securely store in a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger . This decentralized ownership grants individuals control over who accesses their health information and ensures that only authorized entities, such as health care providers and patients, can view and update the records. User-managed access control. Blockchain technology employs advanced techniques to enable control mechanisms. Through private keys, patients can manage and control who has permission to view specific parts of their health records . This user-managed access control ensures privacy and allows patients to share relevant information with health care providers while securing sensitive details. Interoperability and seamless data exchange. Patient-centric health records on blockchain facilitate seamless data exchange between health care providers. Smart contracts are created to allow automated data-sharing agreements and authorize the release of relevant health information . This protocol ensures that the entire care team can access comprehensive and up-to-date records to coordinate patient care. Immutable patient history. Blockchain’s immutability ensures that it cannot be altered or deleted once health data is recorded . A system for the promotion of traceability and ownership of health data using blockchain. This feature contributes to the creation of a comprehensive and unchangeable patient history. Health care providers can trust the accuracy and integrity of the information, leading to more informed decision-making and improved patient care. Empowering patients for better health outcomes. Patient-centric health records enable individuals to engage actively in their health care journey. With greater control over their health data, patients can actively participate in decision-making, monitor their health status, and even contribute data to research initiatives, leading to more personalized and effective population health management strategies. Challenges and future developments. We must acknowledge regulatory considerations, interoperability standards, and user education challenges that may delay future development. Considering ongoing efforts to address these challenges and explore potential developments in patient-centric health records on the blockchain is essential, including integrating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and decentralized identifiers. Smart contracts for public health interventions Traditional public health interventions often need more transparency with fewer bureaucratic inefficiencies and instances of delayed execution. The integration of smart contracts into public health initiatives, powered by blockchain technology, offers a novel approach to addressing these issues and streamlining the execution of programs for improved population health outcomes . ADVERTISEMENT Smart contracts on the blockchain offer a transformative solution for automating and executing public health interventions with transparency and efficiency. As we navigate an era of increasing complexity in health care, embracing blockchain-powered smart contracts is a technological advancement and a paradigm shift toward more effective, accountable, and community-driven public health interventions. Addressing health disparities Health disparities persist globally, with underserved populations facing challenges in accessing quality health care. Blockchain technology emerges as a potential catalyst for addressing these disparities by providing a decentralized and secure platform to facilitate access to health information and resources. Blockchain technology can be a transformative force in addressing health disparities by creating decentralized, transparent, and accessible health care ecosystems . As we explore innovative solutions, blockchain stands out as a promising tool to empower underserved populations. It ensures that access to health information and resources becomes a fundamental right for everyone regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location . Challenges and ethical considerations in implementing blockchain in population health Blockchain’s transparency, while an asset in many contexts, poses challenges for health care, where patient data is sensitive . The open and immutable nature of blockchain raises concerns about balancing transparency with the need to protect individual privacy. As blockchain technology evolves in the context of population health, addressing these challenges and ethical considerations is essential. A thoughtful and ethical approach to implementing blockchain can lead to a more transparent, secure, and patient-centric health care system that prioritizes privacy, compliance, and universal access to the benefits of innovative technologies. Real-world examples of blockchain implementation Vaccine distribution tracking Background: Several initiatives have explored the use of blockchain to track the distribution of vaccines, which is particularly relevant in global health and public health campaigns. Implementation: Blockchain creates an immutable record of vaccine shipments, from manufacturing to distribution points . Smart contracts can automate processes, ensuring vaccines are handled and transported according to established standards. Outcome: By using blockchain in vaccine distribution, these initiatives aim to reduce fraud, ensure the integrity of the supply chain, and improve the tracking of vaccine coverage, contributing to global public health efforts. The Estonian e-health system Background: Estonia has implemented a comprehensive national health information system that utilizes blockchain technology. Each citizen has a secure, blockchain-based digital identity that provides access to their health records, prescriptions, and other medical data . Implementation: Blockchain ensures the security and integrity of health records, allowing health care providers to access relevant patient information seamlessly. Patients have control over who can access their data and can track who has accessed it, which promotes transparency. Outcome: The Estonian e-health system has streamlined health care services, reduced administrative overhead, and empowered citizens with greater control over their health information. Conclusion: prospects and industry adoption Blockchain is poised to play a pivotal role in overcoming interoperability challenges . The future of population health management will involve patient-centric ecosystems where individuals have unprecedented control over their health data. As such, blockchain’s role will expand. This change will empower patients to actively engage in their health care journeys, make informed decisions, and contribute valuable data for research. Regine Severe is a graduate student.

This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only CA$634.6k. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director John Montalbano bought CA$525k worth of shares at a price of CA$7.00 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being CA$4.05). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. In the last twelve months Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

TSX:EPRX Insider Trading Volume March 14th 2024 Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying. Insider Ownership Of Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 8.4% of Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals shares, worth about CA$11m, according to our data. Overall, this level of ownership isn't that impressive, but it's certainly better than nothing! So What Do The Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Indicate? The fact that there have been no Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Insiders do have a stake in Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals and their transactions don't cause us concern.

This annual gathering has consistently proven to be a catalyst for positive change and advancements in the healthcare sector. This year's theme ""Arogya Bharat: India's journey towards health for all and the crucial role of the private sector"" has been chosen in continuation of the previous years, reflecting the ongoing commitment to critical healthcare priorities in India. India has a huge disease burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and need for quality, affordable healthcare, covering most vulnerable population. The Government has announced the Health for All agenda and the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, promising comprehensive, last mile healthcare delivery for an Arogya Bharat. The private sector also has a legitimate role as a key stakeholder in amplifying the efforts towards achieving health for all. Private players within the ecosystem have unique contributions and skills, however they remain fragmented. The Summit, therefore, strives for convergence, to deliberate on where and how private sector can align with Government to build a healthier and more prosperous India. The purpose of the event is to dwell upon inter-sectorial conversations and facilitate collective efforts to achieve the goal of Universal Health Coverage. The Summit also touches upon vital aspects that demand immediate attention. These aspects include five key areas crucial in India's healthcare sector: healthcare financing, MedTech, digital health, patient safety and digital health CXO Course. By delving into these areas and releasing whitepapers, the summit aims to not only understand the current state of each but also promote collaboration and innovation. This collaborative approach, specifically between the public and private sectors in areas like healthcare financing and MedTech, is crucial to address the diverse needs of the Indian population and ensure equitable access to quality healthcare. The various outputs planned, such as whitepapers and courses, offer valuable insights and practical tools to stakeholders, ultimately aiming to accelerate advancements in healthcare delivery and infrastructure across the nation. In healthcare financing, the private sector plans to invest through public-private partnerships (PPP) outside metro areas. NATHEALTH will release a paper emphasising PPP models and new infrastructure, aligning with Niti Aayog's policy to encourage private sector participation. The paper on MedTech 2.0 will emphasize its connection to the health financing segment, and drive home the point that the goal is to make it a story tied to the demand of what happens in MedTech, rather than a story of MedTech itself. Another significant output will be a whitepaper on patient safety, developed with QCI and NABH. A digital health paper anchored by ADL will focus on end-user cases for the uptake of digital health, especially in providers' diagnostic and other evolving areas. Besides these papers, NATHEALTH will also roll out a unique digital health CXO course, developed in collaboration with the Koita Foundation. This course, to be presented at the AGM, aims to contribute to the uptick of digital health. Dr. Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, President, NATHEALTH, Managing Director & CEO, Fortis Healthcare said, ""The 10th NATHEALTH Arogya Bharat Summit 2024 provides an important platform for industry leaders and policymakers to engage and deliberate on India's healthcare priorities. As we tackle the pressing issues of non-communicable diseases, maternal and infant mortality, and the overall inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure, this summit becomes a catalyst for transformative interventions. The summit aims to not only address the current challenges but also pave the way for a healthier and more prosperous India. By encouraging collaboration and innovation in the healthcare sector, we can contribute not only to increased life expectancy but also to economic growth and global competitiveness."" Ameera Shah, Senior Vice President, NATHEALTH, Managing Director, Metropolis Healthcare said, ""Private healthcare players play a defining role in shaping the future of healthcare in India. This summit serves as a vital platform, promoting discussions on their role in realizing Universal Health Coverage. The summit will center on forging a collaborative strategy to tackle the intricate challenges hindering healthcare accessibility nationwide. By engaging the private sector, we aim to chart a path that ensures comprehensive and inclusive healthcare solutions for all. This summit becomes a center for innovation, where stakeholders unite to shape a future where quality healthcare is not just a privilege but an accessible and universal right for every citizen in India."" The summit also aims to establish a working group/steering committee comprising government and industry representatives. This committee will work towards expediting decision-making, implementing public health schemes, encouraging collaborative models, and building lasting relationships in the healthcare sector. The long-term objectives include increased engagement and dialogue for policy consensus, enforcement of necessary mechanisms, and efficient healthcare service delivery within an established framework to achieve national health objectives.

Δ This surge in healthcare innovation is fueled by several factors. First, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the aging population have put immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide, prompting the need for more efficient and accessible care. Additionally, rising consumer expectations for personalized and convenient healthcare experiences have pushed providers to rethink traditional approaches and embrace digital solutions. As a result, there’s been a proliferation of digital tools and technologies aimed at revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered and experienced. Telemedicine , for instance, has been a game-changer in providing remote access to healthcare services, enabling patients to consult with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their homes. Wearable devices and health apps have empowered individuals to monitor their health in real-time, facilitating proactive healthcare management and preventive interventions. Unified digital platforms are also enhancing the healthcare journey by offering users a centralized hub for managing medications , making payments, communicating with insurers and providers, and accessing comprehensive coverage information, all within a single platform. This not only saves patients valuable time but also alleviates the frustrations often encountered when navigating complex healthcare systems . Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are transforming healthcare by enabling data-driven decision-making, predictive analytics, and personalized treatment recommendations. These technologies hold immense promise in optimizing clinical workflows, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving patient outcomes. As evidence of the growing trend, Salesforce recently introduced an AI-powered platform designed to leverage data from healthcare organizations. The platform aims to enhance and personalize patient care while simultaneously alleviating the administrative and operational burdens faced by healthcare providers and care teams. Commenting on the news, Amit Khanna , Salesforce SVP and general manager for health said the “new data, AI, and CRM [customer relationship management] features help reduce the administrative and operational burden for healthcare providers and care teams, leading to better outcomes for their patients.” In a November interview with PYMNTS, Kalle Conneryd-Lundgren , COO at healthtech firm Kry , echoed similar sentiments, describing a portion of the tasks performed by clinicians as “complete waste” of their time, contributing little to patient care. “About 70% of all the tasks they do could be handled by someone other than a highly trained clinician,” Conneryd-Lundgren told PYMNTS, citing nonessential administrative duties such as researching referral addresses, scheduling appointments, or consulting clinical guidelines. He said AI eliminates the time lost to low-value, non-medical tasks that restrict patient interactions with clinicians, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on delivering quality care and fostering meaningful patient relationships. “Freeing up capacity for patients leads to high-quality care, happier patients and happier clinicians. And that’s exactly what we are seeing as a result of utilizing new technologies in our systems,” he said.

Advertisement With the government likely to face constraints in implementing any extensive healthcare measures due to the budget deficit , we should direct attention towards enhancing the efficiency of existing services and plans. Healthcare underfunding ultimately leads to higher costs. The pressure on hospital stays and emergency services, and the ripple effects of an under-resourced healthcare system serve as a wake-up call. We must recognise the importance of shrewdly investing in our healthcare system so it can flourish and help sustain Hong Kong’s development. The city’s healthcare system, with its heavy reliance on public services, faces challenges in financing , service provision and maintaining an adequate workforce . One effective approach outlined in the Primary Healthcare Blueprint is strategic purchasing , an approach endorsed by the World Health Organization. This involves more than just saving money; it is a resource allocation philosophy that demands thoughtful procurement decisions that reflect evolving health needs. Advertisement Strategic purchasing requires the government to consider the capacity of both the public and private sectors to allocate resources more effectively. This can help ensure the sustainability of healthcare services. As a tool, it can aid development of primary healthcare.

While many Americans worry about retirement , lack a sound savings plan and are not even sure if they’ll have enough money to ever retire, some baby boomers are at a disadvantage depending on where they live. Check Out: 8 Ways Baby Boomers Become Poor in Retirement Read Next: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money Tallying 46 metrics (everything from adjusted cost of living to healthcare facilities per capita as well as violent crime rate to mildness of weather) across three primary dimensions (affordability, quality of life and health care), WalletHub found that the worst state for retiring boomers in 2024 is Kentucky, which ranked low in all three dimensions. Many states — such as West Virginia (No. 5), Tennessee (6) Mississippi (12), Arkansas (13), Louisiana (16) and Oklahoma (17) — had comparatively positive affordability rankings, but were punished by poor quality of life and health care dimension scores. Conversely, New York had strong quality of life and health care ratings (Nos. 10 and 12, respectively), but it costs so much to live there, its affordability score brought it down to 44th overall — or the seventh worst state in which to retire. Not surprisingly, many states in and around the Northeast region of the country shared a similar fate and saw their rankings hurt by factors such as cost of living and tax-friendliness. The best place for boomers to live is Florida, bar none. While its 29th ranking for health care is surprising given its population’s age, as detailed by Consumer Affairs , maybe Floridians are healthier and live longer due to not having to pay estate, inheritance or income taxes and getting to bask in year-round ideal weather. Living by the ocean and participating in a wealth of senior-centric activities may also be a factor here. WalletHub’s report found the top five best states to retire were Florida, Colorado, Virginia, Delaware and Wyoming.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Mar 13, 2024, 08:45am EDT Share Save Erez Meltzer, CEO & Board Member of Nanox , is a prominent Israel business leader with 35+ years experience leading various global companies. getty In 2015, world leaders committed to providing health services for all people by 2030. However, as the World Health Organization (WHO) reported in 2023, we're only halfway toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target of achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Progress is slow, and the field of healthcare is presented with the challenge of not only continuing to innovate disease therapies, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, treatment machinery and other cutting-edge medicines but also finding a way to share these developments with people across the world, of all socioeconomic statuses. Geographic, infrastructural and socioeconomic divides highlight stark disparities in healthcare access. As we strive for global health equity, innovation, particularly in medical technology, therapeutics and AI, becomes paramount. Inequities in healthcare access directly impact patient outcomes. Early detection, precise diagnoses, effective treatments and ongoing medical monitoring can be life-changing. Yet, many communities worldwide lack these essential healthcare resources. To bridge this gap, we must strengthen networks of healthcare professionals, payers and companies, ensuring access to valuable treatments and tools globally. For instance, AI offers the potential to enable physicians to interpret radiology images without requiring specialized expertise. AI-powered clinical decision support tools are paving the way for doctors to provide accurate interpretations quickly, even in regions where access to specialized radiologists is limited. This widening access to expertise has the potential to significantly transform healthcare delivery globally, especially in underserved regions. To achieve equitable healthcare outcomes, we must prioritize global healthcare investments. This necessitates increased government funding and public spending on healthcare infrastructure, bolstering both domestic and international programs. Tackling global health disparities requires a collective effort, recognizing that no single country can accomplish this monumental task alone. Funding should primarily support primary healthcare initiatives, such as local clinics staffed with health professionals capable of delivering about 90% of essential health services, as reported by the WHO. Investment in global health benefits not only struggling regions but also stimulates widespread economic growth and social development. According to the WHO, ""While public spending remains the primary source of health funding, countries struggle to find the funds needed for universal health coverage. Simultaneously, the world economy and national budgets are under strain. Development assistance faces constraints. Health services require new funding sources and innovative products to leverage private sector resources."" This underscores the global appetite for innovation, extending healthcare advancements to all corners of the world. Technology Progresses While Healthcare Lags Behind Another point to consider is that the United States, despite its considerable resources, has yet to fully harness the potential of AI innovation and technology to restore its antiquated healthcare system, which currently lags behind. While the nation possesses the means to drive AI advancements, there is room for improvement in integrating these technologies into healthcare systems effectively. In recent years, the U.S. has made substantial strides in AI research and development. However, these advancements have not been seamlessly integrated into the nation's healthcare infrastructure. Despite having access to cutting-edge technology and an abundance of healthcare data, the implementation of AI-driven solutions in clinical practice remains somewhat fragmented. The healthcare system continues to grapple with interoperability challenges, data privacy concerns and the need for standardized protocols. To fully realize AI's potential, the nation must take a comprehensive approach, addressing not only technological innovation but also the necessary regulatory frameworks and workforce training. Additionally, while AI has the potential to enhance healthcare accessibility and quality across the board, the U.S. and global healthcare systems have faced hurdles in ensuring equitable distribution of AI-enabled tools and services. Disparities in access to care persist, with marginalized communities often having limited access to the benefits of AI-driven healthcare. Recent examples of healthcare companies focusing on equity-driven initiatives highlight the transformative power of technology. Pfizer's four-year partnership with Zipline harnesses drone technology to enhance global access to care. Zipline's drones deliver vital supplies like blood, vaccines and essential medicines, showcasing modern technology's potential in global healthcare delivery. This initiative targets ""last mile"" communities in resource-limited rural areas, aiming to close health equity gaps. Similarly, the WHO's Be He@lthy, Be Mobile (BHBM) initiative, which has been ongoing since 2012, has already reached millions worldwide. BHBM collaborates with governments to scale up targeted client communication messaging services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors. This initiative illustrates the positive impact of mobile and wireless technologies, paving the way for accessibility to essential early detection tools, such as medical imaging for diagnoses and treatment. Addressing global healthcare equity gaps may appear daunting, but practical approaches offer tangible progress. Technology, innovation and partnerships are pivotal in enhancing healthcare access. Numerous initiatives, like the Johns Hopkins Innovation + Design Enabling Access (IDEA) Initiative , are already underway. These efforts focus on expanding healthcare infrastructure, deploying new technologies and building workforces in underserved regions. Collaborative endeavors among stakeholders, including governments, regions and innovative companies, are essential for driving sustained progress toward global healthcare equity. AI To Help Everyone—Not Just Those At The Top The quest for global health equity remains a pressing challenge. While the world grapples with disparities in healthcare access, technological innovations, partnerships and increased investment hold the promise of bringing transformative change. The potential for AI to bridge gaps in healthcare, empower physicians and improve outcomes is substantial. To achieve universal health coverage by 2030, nations, organizations and innovators must continue their collaborative efforts to ensure healthcare becomes accessible to all, regardless of geographic or socioeconomic constraints.

The report outlines underinvestment in health systems results in a vicious cycle of unpaid health and care work, lowering women’s participation in paid labour markets, harming women’s economic empowerment and hampering gender equality. Women comprise 67% of the paid global health and care workforce. In addition to this paid work, it has been estimated that women perform an estimated 76% of all unpaid care activities. Work that is done primarily by women tends to be paid less and have poor working conditions. The report highlights that low pay and demanding working conditions are commonly found in the health and care sector. Devaluing caregiving, which is work performed primarily by women, negatively impacts wages, working conditions, productivity and the economic footprint of the sector. The report illustrates that decades of chronic underinvestment in health and care work is contributing to a growing global crisis of care. With stagnation in progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), resulting in 4.5 billion people lacking full coverage of essential health services, women may take on even more unpaid care work. The deleterious impact of weak health systems combined with increasing unpaid health and care work are further straining the health of caregivers and the quality of services. “The ‘Fair share’ report highlights how gender-equitable investments in health and care work would reset the value of health and care and drive fairer and more inclusive economies,” said Jim Campbell, WHO Director for Health Workforce. “We are calling upon leaders, policy-makers and employers to action investment: it is time for a fair share for health and care.” The report presents policy levers to better value health and care work: Improve working conditions for all forms of health and care work, especially for highly feminised occupations Include women more equitably in the paid labour workforce Enhance conditions of work and wages in the health and care workforce and ensure equal pay for work of equal value Address the gender gap in care, support quality care work and uphold the rights and well-being of caregivers Ensure that national statistics account for, measure and value all health and care work Invest in robust public health systems Investments in health and care systems not only accelerate progress on UHC, they redistribute unpaid health and care work. When women participate in paid health and care employment, they are economically empowered and health outcomes are better. Health systems need to recognize, value and invest in all forms health and care work."
https://borgenproject.org/health-care-in-colombia/,,Health Care in Colombia : Improving Accessibility - The Borgen Project,20240310T101500Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Improving-Health-Care-Accessibility-in-Colombia-845x684.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"The nation of Colombia operates a mixed public-private health care system that boasts a 95% coverage rate for its population of nearly 52 million in 2023 . Despite this metric, the country’s vastly varying topography across the Amazonian rainforest, mountainous and coastal regions presents a significant challenge in access to care for the 18% of the population living in these areas. Health care accessibility in Colombia remains a critical issue to address. There are also only 2.4 doctors per 1000 residents with a larger concentration in urban areas. The widespread health care coverage applies to a core set of services. However, some required out-of-pocket expenses still present a barrier to the 37% of the population living in poverty in both rural and urban areas. Addressing this inequity demands infrastructure improvements, technological advancements and investment. Fortunately, thanks to efforts from emerging health care technology companies and humanitarian aid organizations, Colombia is making progress in enhancing health care accessibility. Health Care Technology Companies Colombia has seen a rise in health care technology startups with $39.4 million being invested in the “health tech” sector according to a 2022-2023 technology report. This investment was spread across 93 startups that aim to increase access to hospitals, specialized services and medical records. Salvva, initially known as TuMedico and founded in 2021 as a spinoff of the leading Colombian health tech company SaludTools, leads the way in connecting patients with health care providers. This company aims to link low-income patients with health care providers through an easy-to-use and affordable app that simplifies the process of diagnosis and treatment. It became a finalist in the MIT Solve program in 2022 after connecting more than 7,000 residents with providers through top-tier telemedicine. To date, its website reports more than 24,000 consultations with health care companies and providers. Another pioneering woman in health tech founded Yo Puedo Sentirme Bien, a tele-mental health platform for students in Colombia. From 2021 to 2023, the platform engaged 2,730 students at no cost to their respective universities. Although still in its infancy and primarily serving the academic community, this initiative marks a significant step toward addressing underserved health issues within underserved populations. Humanitarian Aid Organizations In addition to technology solutions improving health care accessibility in Colombia, there have been major humanitarian aid projects addressing infrastructure challenges and driving improvement in rural communities specifically. World Bank One of the biggest challenges in accessibility is the sheer distance that must be traveled to facilities. According to an analysis from the World Bank, 10.6 million people need to travel more than 60 minutes for essential health care services. Rudimentary road systems mean that many isolated regions are more effectively traveled by water transportation, but those trips can cost patients up to 11% of their monthly wage. The World Bank has partnered with the Government of Colombia on multiple initiatives to address travel issues. Todos Somos PAZcífico is improving dock infrastructure in the Pacific region to increase mobility for these populations. The organizations are working directly with local communities in their implementation and will create employment opportunities as the hubs drive commercial activity. The improved infrastructure will also drastically reduce the travel time for these communities to access critical services. While water transportation is critical for coastal communities, the road infrastructure confines the inland populations. Caminos Comunitarios de la Paz Total is another initiative from the World Bank and the Colombian government with an investment of $8 billion for road improvement and rehabilitation. In improving accessibility to health care, Colombia must reduce the travel time and difficulty for isolated populations. These initiatives are addressing the challenges on both land and sea to open pathways for hundreds of thousands of people. The European Union (EU) The EU supports multiple humanitarian organizations in the region and provided €28.5 million in humanitarian aid in 2023. Médecins du Monde is one organization receiving support from the EU for its work in Colombia. The France-based organization aims to provide quality health care access to the most vulnerable populations. While the World Bank is allowing people to travel to access already existing health care facilities, Médecins du Monde is bringing health care to these confined populations. In 2022, the organization worked with a confined population in the Chocó region to organize mobile clinics, rehabilitate previous health posts and educate people on disease prevention. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Colombia has seen a rising Venezuelan migrant population that is especially vulnerable in terms of accessing health care. The USAID’s Local Health System Sustainability Activity (LHSS) aids the Colombian Ministry of Health in assisting this group by utilizing funds from the private sector to finance health services. Colombia has achieved significant progress in enhancing its health care system over the last few decades, particularly in coverage. However, there is still room for improvement, with health tech companies and humanitarian aid playing key roles in continuing to improve health care accessibility. – William Galante Photo: Unsplash March 10, 2024 https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg 0 0 Precious Sheidu https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg Precious Sheidu 2024-03-10 01:30:11 2024-05-30 22:32:52 Health Care in Colombia: Improving Accessibility"

But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Company Limited ( ASX:HPC ), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Hydration Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Hydration Pharmaceuticals The insider Geoffrey O'Brien made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$500k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.045 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being AU$0.016). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. In the last twelve months Hydration Pharmaceuticals insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! ASX:HPC Insider Trading Volume March 7th 2024 Hydration Pharmaceuticals is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket. Insider Ownership Of Hydration Pharmaceuticals For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Hydration Pharmaceuticals insiders own about AU$1.0m worth of shares. That equates to 24% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders. So What Does This Data Suggest About Hydration Pharmaceuticals Insiders? It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Hydration Pharmaceuticals shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Hydration Pharmaceuticals insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Hydration Pharmaceuticals has 6 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these. Story Continues Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies. For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Mar 07, 2024, 07:00am EST Share Save Rahul Saluja, Executive Vice President & Head of Sales, Healthcare Life Sciences Division, Cyient. getty With the advent of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence (AI), we are not merely witnessing a change in how healthcare is delivered; we are at the dawn of a new era where the boundaries of what is possible are being redefined. As a senior executive of an organization delivering intelligent engineering and technology solutions to healthcare entities and beyond, I have a front-row seat to this transformation. In this article, I'd like to share more about how these technologies are pioneering innovation in the healthcare space and how healthcare organizations can practically leverage them to differentiate themselves. These technologies are not just altering existing paradigms; they are redefining the realms of possibility. Robotics: Precision And Excellence In Patient Care Robotics in healthcare is a current reality, not just a future possibility. The likes of the da Vinci Surgical System exemplify this, offering unparalleled precision and redefining patient care standards. However, the journey to robotics adoption isn't without its challenges. High costs and technical complexities are significant barriers. To mitigate these, healthcare organizations can explore phased implementation, leveraging partnerships and potential government incentives. Furthermore, specialized training for staff is vital to maximize the benefits of this technology. When considering robotics, factors like organizational size, budget and readiness must be evaluated. While larger institutions may have the resources for immediate adoption, smaller entities might benefit from a more gradual approach. In cases where the cost outweighs the benefits, it might be prudent to delay investment. Automation: The Key To Efficiency Automation's role in enhancing healthcare efficiency and care quality cannot be overstated. However, the transition to automation must be approached with caution. To build trust in automated systems, a balance between technology and human oversight is essential. Implementing automation in non-critical tasks first can help staff adapt to new workflows and build confidence in the system's reliability. For organizations looking to begin automating tasks, it's important to prioritize areas that will benefit most from efficiency gains. Selecting the right technology partners and investing in staff training are crucial steps in this journey. AI: A Revolution In Diagnosis And Treatment Artificial intelligence in healthcare is a game-changer. Through AI, we can analyze vast amounts of data in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago, leading to earlier diagnoses, personalized treatment plans and, ultimately, better outcomes for patients. AI is not just a tool; it is a partner in healthcare, offering insights and solutions that enhance the capabilities of healthcare professionals. AI stands as a transformative force in healthcare, providing unprecedented data analysis capabilities for better patient outcomes. To get started, healthcare decision-makers should begin by identifying critical areas for AI application. Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and securing data privacy are crucial steps. Pilot programs can provide valuable insights before a full-scale implementation. The Future Is Integrated The future of healthcare lies in the integration of robotics, automation and AI. This is not a distant dream but a reality we are building today. We are committed to developing solutions that leverage these technologies to create a healthcare ecosystem that is more efficient, effective and patient-centered. These technologies not only enhance patient care but also drive business development. They offer long-term cost savings, operational efficiency and improved patient outcomes, essential for growth in the healthcare sector. Adopting these technologies positions an organization as a forward-thinking leader, attracting more patients and partnerships. In Conclusion The transformation of healthcare through robotics, automation and AI is not just inevitable; it is essential. I am confident in our ability to leverage these technologies to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. The future of healthcare is bright, and the future looks promising.

https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5e56b43f-4036-483b-acb0-d57dcc0f3969,,FTC Hosts Panel and Launches Public Inquiry with DOJ and HHS on Private Equity and Health Care,20240307T104500Z,,lexology.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"As part of the Biden administration’s State of the Union blitz, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) convened a workshop on private equity (PE) investments in the health care industry on March 5, 2024. Immediately prior to the workshop, the FTC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a joint request for information (RFI) on the effects of PE transactions in the health care industry. During the workshop, regulators asserted that enforcing antitrust law against PE investments in the health care space is a top priority for both the FTC and DOJ. FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter called on fellow enforcers “to attack the underlying model…not just the name of ‘private equity.’” Comments on the RFI may be submitted through this web portal and are due by May 6, 2024. Given the stated priority that the antitrust enforcement agencies are giving to scrutinizing PE transactions, as reflected in the recently revised merger guidelines , interested stakeholders are highly encouraged to closely track developments related to and participate in the RFI. In a clearly choreographed roll out in connection with President Biden’s State of the Union address, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) convened a workshop on March 5, 2024, to examine “the role of private equity investment in health care markets.” Hours before the workshop began, the FTC, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a public inquiry on “private-equity and other corporations’ increasing control over health care.” It is not surprising that the current antitrust regulators have been concerned with the competition effects of private equity transactions and “roll-ups.” These concerns are reflected in the revisions in the new merger guidelines specific to private equity and the now pending FTC enforcement action in Texas . [1] Much of the regulators’ stated concerns have dealt with private equity (PE) activity in the health care sector. Through both the cross-agency RFI and the workshop on March 5, 2024, regulators indicated that they will continue to subject this activity to great scrutiny. Cross-Agency Inquiry on PE and Health Care Launched by FTC, DOJ, and HHS In their request for information (RFI), the FTC, DOJ, and HHS are seeking public comment on “the effects of transactions involving health care providers… facilities, or ancillary products or services, conducted by private equity funds or other alternative asset managers, health systems, or private payers.” In other words, the focus goes beyond private equity firms to include other types of investors, health systems, and private payer transactions. With respect to health systems and private payers, the agencies expressed concern about vertical as well as horizontal integration and their effect on pricing, referral patterns, and incentives to compete. The RFI notes that the agencies involved are “particularly interested” in hearing about the impact of those “transactions that would not be noticed to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act…” The RFI provided a laundry list of providers and other types of businesses that could be at issue. A review of that list seems to indicate that the agencies are focused on smaller transactions that are part of an overall roll-up strategy. The comments submitted pursuant to this RFI “will inform the agencies’ identification of enforcement priorities and future action, including new regulations, aimed at promoting and protecting competition in health care markets and ensuring appropriate access to quality, affordable health care items and services.” The agencies are requesting input from stakeholders across the health care industry, including “patients, consumer advocates, doctors, nurses, health care administrators, employers, private insurers, PBMs, GPOs, nursing homes, hospices, home health agencies, hospitals, and other health care providers, facilities, providers of and entities that provide ancillary health care products or services.” Comments are also welcomed from “academics and other experts who have studied market consolidation, corporate control in health care, and related issues.” In particular, the agencies are seeking input from patients and health care workers regarding their experiences after an acquisition or merger. The RFI poses five questions related to investments involving health care providers by PE funds, alternative asset managers, health systems, and private payers. Effects of Consolidation : How will a transaction involving health care providers, facilities, or ancillary products or services “by private equity funds or other alternative asset managers, health systems, or private payers” impact patient care, the treatment of public and private payers, employers who provide health insurance for their employees, and the conditions under which providers, health care workers, and support staff work? Claimed Business Objectives for Transactions : What were the claimed business goals for a transaction (efficiencies of scale, innovation in providing care, increased business valuations), and have these objectives been realized post-transaction? Who benefited from the realization of the claimed business goals of the transaction? Did the transaction require the acquired entity to take on additional debt or undergo restructuring? If the transaction generated surplus profits, were those profits reinvested in the acquired business or paid out to shareholders? Notable Transactions : “Are there particular types of entities, such as private equity funds or other alternative asset managers, health systems, or private payers, most associated with transactions that result in adverse impacts” on patients, public and private payers, health care providers, or employers who provide health insurance for their employees. “Are there particular facilities, providers, payers, and ancillary products or services that are most often the targets of these harmful transactions? Who are these targets?” Need for Government Action : What actions should the FTC, HHS, and DOJ take “to identify and address transactions that, due to market consolidation or corporate control issues, may have major adverse impacts” on patients, public and private payers, health care providers, or employers who provide health insurance for their employees? “Should the agencies promote greater transparency and enhanced availability of information to the public on mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions involving health care facilities, providers, payers, and ancillary products or services, and if so, how?” Other Impacts : Are there any other impacts from health care market transactions that agencies should be aware of? The tone of the RFI and accompanying press releases display a suspicion — if not hostility — toward PE transactions in the health care industry. Again, this posture is not new, and should not lead one to assume that any concrete actions will emerge from the RFI process. However, as three agencies with different jurisdictions are involved in this RFI, continued scrutiny and monitoring is required. Comments on this RFI can be submitted through this web portal and are due by May 6, 2024. As this RFI may inform future enforcement actions on the part of FTC, DOJ, and HHS, interested stakeholders are highly encouraged to comment. FTC Hosts Workshop on PE and Health Care The remarks by antitrust enforcers at the FTC workshop that followed the announcement of the RFI conveyed their skeptical attitude towards PE activity in the health care space. Chair Lina Khan of the FTC opened the proceedings by asserting that “private equity acquisitions of health care service providers” is a “top of mind” area for the Commission. While acknowledging that “private investments can sometimes be an important source of capital” for small and medium health care service providers, Chair Khan condemned what she called a “growing financialization in the health care industry [that] can force medical professionals to subordinate to corporate decision-makers [and] profit motives, at the expense of patient health.” With regard to the conduct of PE firms in the health care industry, Chair Khan discussed three “concerning extractive practices” to which the FTC is paying particularly close attention: “Flipping and Stripping” : Chair Khan argued that a “short-term, high-risk, and low consequence ownership” model could encourage a “flip and strip approach,” whereby portfolio companies are purchased on debt, stripped of their assets, and then sold. These “short-term profit extracting strategies,” contends Khan, can “undercut long-term value” and “worsen patient care.” As such, she asserted that the FTC will continue to scrutinize this business practice. Serial Acquisitions : “By consolidating power gradually and incrementally through a series of smaller deals, firms have sometimes sidestepped antitrust review,” argued Khan. As discussed in our report on the 2023 Merger Guidelines , new portions of the Guidelines specifically focus on private equity and indicate that the FTC and DOJ “may look at past and concurrent acquisitions by a firm as part of the analysis of whether a particular deal may substantially lessen competition in a given market.” Interlocking Directorates : Chair Khan expressed the view that PE firms are “buying up significant stakes in rival firms that compete within the same industry, reducing competition by softening firms’ incentive to compete.” This so-called “common ownership” problem is, contends Khan, subject to regulation by Section 8 of the Clayton Act. In August 2023, the FTC brought its first case enforcing the Section 8 prohibition on interlocking directories in four decades. “We will continue reinvigorating the full scope of Section 8’s prohibition on interlocking directorates,” asserted Khan. Khan closed her remarks by warning that while the workshop’s proceedings and the cross-agency RFI principally concerned PE activity in health care, “firms of all types should be on notice that we are on the lookout for these strategies and will continue to deploy the full scope of our authority to protect the American public from anticompetitive and unlawful tactics.” Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter echoed Chair Khan in the panel’s closing remarks, asserting that health care is “not the only market where there is a private equity problem…it’s all over the place.” Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter began his statement by asserting that the FTC and DOJ are, through their enforcement actions and inquiries, “taking on the entire health care sector…” With regard to applying antitrust law to PE transactions in the health care space, Kanter asserted that “the antitrust laws can make our health care system more free, more functional, and more fair…” He characterized the cross-agency RFI on PE and health care as a means to give the agencies involved “the information to tackle private equity…head on.” Conclusion: PE Health Care Transactions in the Crosshairs During the FTC’s workshop, regulators struck a combative tone, asserting that their respective agencies would fully utilize the tools at their disposal to scrutinize, prevent, and, if needed, undo certain PE investments in the health care space. “We need to attack the underlying model,” stated Commissioner Slaughter, “not just the name of ‘private equity.’” Along with the convening of the panel and RFI on PE and health care, the Biden administration has recently launched a DOJ- and FTC-led “ Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing .” The regulators’ vehemence with regard to PE activities in the health care space during the recent workshop and concurrent actions taken by the Biden administration suggests that these actual and planned enforcement activities will play a role in the upcoming State of the Union address. The pending FTC enforcement action in Texas against US Anesthesia Partners will, as explained in a September 2023 report, serve as “an opportunity for the FTC to test its policy positions in court” and will, therefore, play a significant role in determining the course of future enforcement actions against PE firms. In this enforcement action, the FTC has alleged that a PE roll-up strategy led to market power, higher prices, and other anticompetitive effects. The points at issue in the case are being hotly litigated, including the appropriateness of naming the PE firm involved as a defendant."

By Mark Brakke and Cassie Heide March 6, 2024 at 11:30PM Something we need, the writers say, is access: ""Rural and small-town Minnesota needs and deserves good health care. The University of Minnesota needs to produce enough primary care physicians for our state."" (TNS/Tribune News Service) Comment Gift Share Listen Opinion editor’s note: Star Tribune Opinion publishes a mix of national and local commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute, click here . ••• With the start of the 2024 legislative session, there have been multiple articles in the Star Tribune about health care, all indicative of a failure to effectively manage it in Minnesota. We should ask “What do we need?” then build it. Despite the Star Tribune Editorial Board saying that “[n]one of these questions have easy answers” ( “A public option? In Minn.? Well … maybe?” Feb. 13), it is a fact the answers are well-known but are being opposed by the health care industry, since the answers will decrease profits. Let’s start with “What do we need?” Sooner or later, everyone needs care. So: We should all have access to good health care. We should not be economically punished because we have the misfortune to become ill. Affordable health care should be a given. We need to have a system that is administratively efficient and works for all Minnesotans, not just the health care corporations. There is no sensible reason for U.S. health care costs to be double that of Australia while having worse health care outcomes. We need the ability to plan wisely. Rural and small-town Minnesota needs and deserves good health care. The University of Minnesota needs to produce enough primary care physicians for our state. Should Minnesota have a public option? The public options mentioned by the Milliman consulting report referred to in the editorial would expand coverage, but the state needs to be looking at a comprehensive approach that gets to the heart of the issue, the cost of health care, not just premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Should Minnesota deal with medical debt? Yes, but we need to move beyond so we are not burdening people with medical debt in the first place. Should the city of Fosston have obstetric care? You bet it should, and we need to have effective statewide planning to accomplish that. Regarding markets, the Minnesota and U.S. health care situation is a clear example of a market failure from the perspective of the insured and the society. Markets are complex. The term “free market” is nonsensical. Markets are not “free.” Markets are structured to produce desired outcomes. If one looks at the health care marketplace, it is a failure for many people (buyers — i.e., patients), but works pretty well for most of the sellers. A satisfactory health care marketplace would provide all people with excellent health care, have enough doctors and other health care providers, and have costs that are affordable for society. Just look at other industrialized countries and you will see we are behind. The health care market is unique. Health care consumers are driven by need, not by want. Put yourself in the patients’ shoes. You get chest pain. You go to the nearest ER. No price shopping, no Yelp reviews. You simply need care now . What about competition? Health care businesses avoid competition. Hospital companies create regional monopolies. Allina hospitals are never across the street from Essentia hospitals. Pharmaceutical companies never post ads saying their insulin is cheaper than the other guy’s insulin. Another market issue should be examined. Since the 1970s we have seen a series of insurance schemes: HMOs, ACOs, Medicare Advantage, Value Based Care. Each has claimed to be the answer to controlling cost. Each one is based on the flawed idea that people need to be prevented from getting too much health care. We know people are not going to their doctor and saying, “How about an extra colonoscopy?” During the 50 years the U.S. has been fiddling with these schemes, our health care costs have steadily grown faster than the costs in other modern countries. The U.S. now pays almost twice as much per year for medical care than these other countries, while having a lower life expectancy. As a result of ignoring other countries’ experiences and listening to the medical industry resist sensible reform, we now have a health care situation with a super-premium price producing an inferior product. Is it wise to have the fox design the chicken coop? When you read or listen to health care discussions we suggest you use a few rules: Ask who created the message. In a market driven by the search for profit, will the pharmaceutical industry be looking out for the economic interest of the patients? Is the message about a comprehensive, workable plan or is the message performative (sounds nice but lacks substance)? Has the proposal been economically modeled? If it cannot be modeled, it is not credible. The 2023 Legislature passed a bill to fund a study of a health care system for Minnesota. The study is due to be delivered in 2026. It will show the ability to achieve better outcomes for less expense. The question for Minnesotans will be: Is the goal of health care to provide large profits for health care businesses or to provide excellent affordable care for patients? We can have affordable health care for patients and society and still have thriving health care businesses. Other countries have proven it works. Be prepared to support the change that serves patients best. Dr. Mark Brakke, of Coon Rapids, is a family physician and board member of Health Care for All Minnesota ( hca-mn.org ).

If you do not want to learn about the global health insurance market, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Best Public Health Systems in the World . Countries with the best public health systems in the world like Germany, Switzerland, and UK, among others, are those that prioritize the well-being of their citizens through comprehensive healthcare policies, accessible services, and robust infrastructure. These nations are committed to ensuring universal access to healthcare, disease prevention, and promoting healthy living standards. By investing in healthcare advancements, education, and infrastructure, these countries have achieved remarkable outcomes in disease control, life expectancy, and overall population health, setting exemplary standards for the rest of the world. Global Healthcare Insurance Market Overview The global healthcare insurance market witnessed substantial growth, reaching a value of $1,899 billion in 2021 and projected to escalate to $3,948.7 billion by 2030, reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6%. This expansion is attributed to several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, rising disposable income, and advancements in claim settlement services. The market is predominantly categorized into public and private segments, with the public sector holding a significant 56% revenue share in 2020, a trend expected to persist due to heightened confidence in government-backed insurers such as Medicare in the US. The healthcare insurance market exhibits high concentration levels within the US, with approximately 95% of markets considered ""highly concentrated"" in 2022. This concentration results in reduced competition and limited patient choices, with a single health insurer commanding a market share of at least 50% in nearly half of the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The dominance of major players like Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealth Group significantly influences commercial markets. Challenges concerning healthcare accessibility and equity persist, as highlighted by the American Medical Association's (AMA) study . The study underscores limited competitive options for health insurance in Medicare Advantage and public health exchanges, affecting millions of Americans. Market concentration poses risks by potentially elevating insurance premiums beyond competitive levels. Efforts are underway to scrutinize and potentially restrict detrimental insurance mergers to bolster competition and safeguard patients from anti-competitive practices. Story Continues Advancements and Trends in Healthcare Technology and Investments Financial statistics reveal that North America dominates the healthcare market, propelled by initiatives like Medicare and Medicaid. Key players in the health insurance arena include United Healthcare, Anthem Inc., Aetna, Cigna, and Humana, among others, contributing to the sector's growth and evolution. The Cigna Group (NYSE: CI ) caters to over 100 million customers worldwide with tailored international health insurance plans and access to a vast network of healthcare professionals.

With over 60 years of experience, The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) serves customers in more than 200 markets and territories worldwide, focusing on creating healthier futures through intuitive offerings and hassle-free customer experiences. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG ) revolutionizes global healthcare with robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, setting standards for improved outcomes. Their da Vinci systems are widely adopted, enhancing procedures like bariatrics and colorectal surgeries. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)'s recent achievements include significant revenue growth, with 415 da Vinci systems placed in Q4 2023 and CE mark certification for the da Vinci single-port (SP) system. Financially, Q4 2023 revenue reached $1.93 billion, with an installed base of 8,606 systems. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)'s dedication to innovation and strategic investments solidifies its pivotal role in advancing minimally invasive care worldwide. The healthcare technology sector presents significant investment opportunities and is experiencing notable trends in 2024. Despite a cooling effect observed in 2022, with venture capital funding dropping by approximately 30% from US$39.3 billion in 2021 to US$27.5 billion in 2022, investments remained higher than in 2020 and more than doubled from 2019. The median health tech deal in 2022 reached a valuation of over US$57 million, significantly surpassing previous years, with late-stage companies attracting the majority of investments (75%) compared to early-stage counterparts (25%). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a pivotal innovation in healthcare technology, facilitating diagnostics, disease detection, and enhancing patient care. Additional trends shaping the sector include the proliferation of telehealth services, mobile health (mHealth) applications, modernization of legacy healthcare software, emphasis on data security, and blockchain integration for safeguarding patient health records. According to a report by Markets and Markets , the global AI in healthcare market size is expected to reach USD 45.2 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 44.9% from 2021 to 2026.

By harnessing the power of analytics, healthcare organizations can improve clinical outcomes, identify trends, and personalize patient care strategies. The Healthcare Cloud Computing Market caters to a wide range of stakeholders, including hospitals, clinics, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies. These entities rely on cloud computing to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and drive innovation in healthcare delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of cloud computing in healthcare. With the sudden surge in demand for telehealth services, healthcare providers turned to cloud-based platforms to deliver remote care effectively. This trend is expected to persist post-pandemic, driving continued growth in the Healthcare Cloud Computing Market. Looking ahead, the Healthcare Cloud Computing Market is poised for further expansion with the emergence of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These technologies, coupled with cloud computing, hold the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, offering predictive analytics, remote patient monitoring, and personalized treatment plans. In conclusion, the Healthcare Cloud Computing Market represents a transformative force in the healthcare industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation and efficiency.

The foundation I have the privilege of leading, The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts , is one of several “ health care conversion foundations ” in Massachusetts and one of hundreds across the country. These foundations are created when nonprofit health organizations are sold to for-profit entities and the assets, which have benefited from tax exemptions, favorable treatment, and tax-deductible contributions, are set aside to fulfill the original nonprofit organizations’ charitable purposes. Yet the regulatory review and outcomes of such conversion transactions have been highly variable, sometimes resulting in a loss of the original charitable purposes and of valuable community assets. Advertisement This calls for greater standardization, oversight, and long-term planning at the state level to avoid the potential shortfalls that can occur with conversion transactions, which are bound to continue in a rapidly changing health care sector. Historically, many health care institutions were structured as nonprofit organizations because of their charitable missions. This landscape changed with a wave of nonprofit health care organizations selling to for-profit entities beginning in the 1990s. A prominent example is Steward Health Care, which owns nine community hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts — and dozens more across the country — and which is now facing serious financial crisis . State officials are wrestling with how to prevent hospital closures, maintain safety and quality, and preserve access to vital health care services. As reported in the Globe , Steward first entered the Massachusetts health care landscape in 2010 with the sale of the nonprofit Caritas Christi Health Care system to the private equity firm Cerberus. The hospital system was renamed Steward Health Care. Such conversion transactions primarily fall under state law, with oversight by the courts, attorneys general, and state regulators. Advertisement In the case of Caritas Christi, the original asset purchase agreement was executed in March 2010. Seven months later, in October 2010, then-Attorney General Martha Coakley issued a statement on the transaction, writing, “The Transaction complies with applicable general non-profit and charities law,” and the Supreme Judicial Court approved it. Coakley deemed that the transaction served “the public interest,” and it was expected that Steward would spend “no less than $400 million in capital expenditures to promote the financial health, well-being, or growth of the health system post-Closing.” Furthermore, the statement noted, “If Steward fails to spend or commit to spend no less than $400 million, then Steward shall donate such shortfall to a charitable foundation selected by the Attorney General.” In the years that followed, the promise of a stronger hospital system that would serve the public interest did not come to fruition, as Steward engaged in financial transactions that undermined its financial stability, including selling (and leasing back) physical hospital assets that were once considered charitable assets benefiting the community. In contrast, hundreds of other health care conversions across the country have generated positive and enduring outcomes through philanthropic organizations dedicated to improving the health of their communities, including the MetroWest Health Foundation and the Atrius Health Equity Foundation . Nationally, health care conversion foundations have assets ranging from a few million to several billion dollars, with geographic focus areas ranging from local to statewide and beyond. Many have prioritized their philanthropic investments to address social determinants of health. The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts was established in 1999 with assets resulting from the sale of Central Massachusetts Health Care, a physician-initiated, nonprofit health maintenance organization. Upon realizing that CMHC was no longer sustainable as a standalone nonprofit entity, its trustees envisioned a philanthropic organization dedicated to improving health in the region as a fitting legacy to the physicians who founded and supported the original organization. Advertisement Though the sale of Central Massachusetts Health Care was initiated in 1995, it was subject to review by the attorney general’s Division of Public Charities , and the foundation was only able to launch approximately four years later, following an intensive, community-based planning process and approval by the Worcester Probate Court. Since its launch with initial assets of about $60 million, The Health Foundation has dedicated its resources to improving the health of those who live or work in Central Massachusetts. Over the past quarter century, the foundation has granted more than $56 million to over 230 nonprofit organizations seeking to improve health, broadly defined. It has been successful in achieving significant and sustained policy changes in diverse areas including children’s behavioral health, housing and homelessness, oral health, and re-entry after incarceration. The foundation operates with a small but dedicated professional staff, a committed board of directors, an ethos of continuous quality improvement informed by evaluation, and a spirit of partnership and community engagement. Financial statements are audited every year, and best practices are shared with other grantmakers. The Health Foundation also plays an active role in advocating for regional equity and health equity . As a state, we will be challenged in the coming months to stabilize an already strained health care system. State officials and health care leaders must center community needs and health equity in charting the best path forward and reappropriate the term “steward” so that it harkens back to the original meaning of good stewardship of health care resources: To protect community assets, earn the public’s trust, and foster an accessible, affordable, high-quality, and equitable health care system. Amie Shei is the president and chief executive officer of The Health Foundation of Central Massachusetts . Advertisement"

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced that it has been recognized as one of the 2024 World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. HCA Healthcare has been recognized 14 times and is one of only four honorees in the Healthcare Providers category this year. “Being named as one of the World’s Most Ethical companies for the 14 th time is a reflection of our commitment to the values on which HCA Healthcare was founded,” said Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare. “We are proud of the culture we have built and will continue to strive to make a positive impact on our patients, colleagues and communities.” Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical assessment is grounded in their Ethics Quotient, which requires companies to provide over 200 proof points on their culture of ethics, including environmental, social and governance practices, ethics and compliance program, diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and initiatives that support a strong value chain. That data then undergoes further qualitative analysis by Ethisphere. The process serves as a framework to capture and codify leading ethics and compliance practices from organizations across industries and from around the world. “Our comprehensive, values-based ethics and compliance program encourages the highest standards of ethical conduct for our approximately 310,000 colleagues,” said Kathi Whalen, senior vice president and chief ethics and compliance officer at HCA Healthcare. “It is an honor to be recognized by Ethisphere year over year for our dedication to doing what is right.” HCA Healthcare strives to make the communities where we live and work stronger.

https://www.kevinmd.com/2024/03/medical-debt-driven-homelessness.html,,Medical debt - driven homelessness,20240303T204500Z,https://www.kevinmd.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_139022972-21.jpg,kevinmd.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Share Tweet Share The fictional 2007 television story depicting the plight of a widow with two daughters who, as a family, became homeless due to medical debt incurred during her since-deceased husband’s health care, is an eye-opener and heartbreaking. However, nowadays, the fact is emulating that fiction when statistics of homelessness risk due to medical debt are bewildering and shocking. As compared to credit card debt, where buyers can at least gauge the maximum retail prices for received services and goods before paying with credit cards, even estimates of to-be-incurred medical debt remain undiscoverable to patients when being billed weeks to months after receiving services and procedures for their health care. Disclosures about to-be-incurred health care charges have not been available to patients until now, although the process of preauthorization has been available to their health care payers. The process of preauthorization tries to balance the health care costs of allowing the health care services and procedures with the medicolegal costs of denying the health care services and procedures. If preauthorization is all about containing the costs to health care payers, health care providers and their health care places uniting against the cumbersomeness of preauthorization processes should not forget that patients are payers too, often paying partly when covered by high-premium low-deductible health plans, while sometimes paying fully when covered by low-premium high-deductible health plans. Providers may think that their sole focus should be on the science of delivering health care to patients irrespective of its costs to patients and payers. However, their thinking may flip over when facing dwindling reimbursements and compensations secondary to unmanageable health care costs. Their oblivion might have been permissible if patients were to be commonly covered by low-premium low-deductible health plans because, as compared to individual patients, their health plans’ carriers have way stronger socioeconomic buffers to absorb the shocks of soaring health care charges and way powerful negotiating skills to disperse the aftershocks of dwindling health care reimbursements. Essentially, even though the final health care charges can never be gauged preemptively due to the volatile fluidity of patients’ health care states and health care demands under the care of health care providers and their health care places, the best guesstimates should not be withheld from the patients, even when worrying that patients might choose to delay or even avoid receiving their health care. Socioeconomic hardships are sufferings too, which may routinely get overlooked and may often get worsened with undisclosed health care costs. Physically and maybe psychologically healthy patients may not survive their socioeconomic illnesses, and thus, patients needing health care services and procedures have the right to choose which illnesses they must overcome first and which illnesses they must not allow to worsen at certain points in their lives. Health care providers and their health care places, well-accustomed to managing the chargeable services and procedures for only physical and maybe psychological health of patients, may have to disclose their own conflicts of interests if they are not able to address socioeconomic sufferings originating or worsening during health care delivery focused only on patients’ physical and maybe psychological health. The bottom line is that preauthorization by patients themselves, as the evolving health care payers in the environments of high-premium high-deductible health plans, warrants preemptive disclosure to the patients about health care provider-place charges to the best of their guesstimate abilities while utilizing data-mined historical health care charge summaries to corroborate with artificially intelligent health care charge forecasts.

As chief strategic officer of Millbrook Support Services, a health care staffing and workforce solutions firm for government agencies and commercial clients, James Paterek is keeping a close eye on the market’s future. Industry experts predict significant growth for the healthcare staffing market by 2030. As such, Paterek looks back on recent issues in the industry, emerging trends and the future of this crucial business sector. What is health care staffing? The health care staffing industry is a major player in both the private and public sectors, Paterek explains. Firms exist to assist health care facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient facilities, in-home and others with vital staffing needs. Services range from recruiting candidates for open positions and managing the interview and hiring process, to screening for necessary accreditations and licenses, and assisting with technical training. As the health care industry can fluctuate wildly with labor needs, health care staffing firms have become a vital part of the U.S. health care industry over the past century. Why companies partner with health care staffing firms Staffing and workforce solutions firms are experts in matching qualified candidates to short- and long-term needs, which can save busy health care facilities time. As Paterek notes, these firms can tap into a massive network of health care professionals to fill open positions around the country, which comes in handy when roles need to be filled on short notice. Most medical facilities wouldn’t have access to the same types of resources. By partnering with staffing firms such as Millbrook, they can access a large, widespread labor pool filled with highly qualified providers while devoting their resources to running their facility. Labor categories include physicians, nurses, advanced practice and allied health professionals. Whether you’re a single health care provider or an entire team, health care staffing firm’s recruiters stand ready to address client’s needs. Recent issues in the health care industry Paterek notes that the health care staffing industry has faced some challenging times during the pandemic. One challenge was finding health care providers due to demand outweighing supply. COVID-19 was and is particularly difficult for the health care industry, with many medical providers questioning where they fit in the field entirely. The pandemic put a massive strain on the U.S. health care system, leading many professionals to experience burnout. This, in turn, led to high turnover rates and put even more stress on the people choosing to remain working in the sector. Today, difficult working conditions remain despite the slowdown of COVID illnesses. The impact of health care industry trends on staffing firms Current developments within the health care industry have initiated both market growth and fluctuations affecting staffing firms. With the escalating turnover, health care staffing agencies have risen to the occasion by leveraging technology for the recruitment of candidates to fill vacant positions. Paterek emphasizes that the demand for health care workers will continue to increase, and healthcare staffing agencies are perfectly positioned to respond to this rising call. Additionally, the pandemic led many workers across industries to explore remote work. As such, many health care professionals now prefer to work fully remote or hybrid-remote, utilizing “telehealth” tools to meet with patients. This gives staffing firms access to an even wider pool of candidates, as geographical location is less of a barrier when remote work is an option. One significant challenge in the commercial telehealth sector pertains to state licensing requirements, which dictate that healthcare professionals must hold valid licenses or certifications in the state where they offer their services. However, in the case of federal government contracts, such regulatory hurdles do not apply. As long as a health care provider holds the necessary licensure or certification in any U.S. state, they can work for federal facilities or on federal contracts without restriction in any state or U.S. territory. Moreover, federal contract assignments offer the advantage of longer-term commitments, typically spanning one to five years, in contrast to the relatively short-term nature of commercial contracts, especially prevalent in fields like travel nursing, where assignments often last just 13 weeks. Nevertheless, the growth of telehealth is expected to persist, particularly with the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, AI technology has proven invaluable in supporting medical professionals, but it’s also making its mark on healthcare staffing agencies. These agencies have been quick to embrace AI, and it’s clear that it’s been a fruitful decision. When applied thoughtfully, AI can handle tasks like screening candidate resumes and advertising job openings online, resulting in significant time and energy savings for recruiters. As AI technology continues to evolve, staffing agencies are poised to become even more adept at fulfilling the requirements of their clients, enhancing their overall efficiency in the process. The future of the U.S. health care staffing market The future of the health care staffing industry holds several key trends and challenges as it continues to evolve in response to the changing landscape of healthcare. A new marketing report by Coherent Market Insights indicates that the U.S. health care staffing market is on track for exponential growth over the next seven years. On the other hand, while certain industry authorities anticipate a potential slowdown in the nursing sector, Paterek remains optimistic about the ongoing demand for clinical providers, and thus staffing firms. This optimism is rooted in the persistent labor shortage resulting from an aging population and health care professionals exiting the field. Forecasts from industry analysts suggest that per diem opportunities, or the ability for healthcare workers to fill in for shifts as needed, will expand, as will the utilization of locum tenens. Furthermore, there is an anticipated growth in the demand for various Allied Health professions, covering a broad spectrum of healthcare roles. Overall, the future of the health care staffing industry is closely tied to the evolving needs and dynamics of the healthcare sector. Adapting to changing demands, embracing technology and responding to a shortage of health care professionals will be key to the industry’s continued growth and success. James L. Paterek was the founder and former chairman of Comforce Corporation, a publicly traded human capital business, and is currently the chief strategy officer of Millbrook Support Services. Millbrook supplies physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers and allied health staffing services to government agencies and commercial clients nationwide.

Among these, the rise of e-health startups in Southeast Asia stands out as a critical development, leveraging technology to bridge significant gaps in health care services. Furthermore, this surge reflects a broader trend of digitalization in the health care sector, driven by the urgent need to improve access, affordability and the quality of health care services across diverse populations. New Path to Health Care: E-Health Startups E-health startups in Southeast Asia are pioneering a variety of solutions that address the region’s unique health care challenges. These innovations range from telemedicine platforms that connect patients with medical professionals remotely, to AI-driven diagnostic tools that provide faster and more accurate assessments. The accessibility of mobile technology and internet connectivity has been a key enabler, allowing these startups to reach underserved communities in remote areas. In addition, one of the most significant impacts of e-health startups is its ability to provide essential health care services to those who previously had limited or no access. By offering consultations, health monitoring and access to medical information through smartphones and computers, these startups are making health care more inclusive. This is especially critical in regions with a shortage of health care professionals and facilities. Case Studies of E-Health Startups Impact Halodoc, Indonesia. Halodoc is a leading example of how e-health startups are revolutionizing health care in Southeast Asia . It offers an online platform where patients can consult with doctors via video calls, purchase medication and even book hospital appointments. Halodoc has made health care services more accessible and convenient for millions of Indonesians, significantly improving patient outcomes. MyDoc, Singapore. MyDoc is a digital health platform that simplifies the health care journey for patients by offering a seamless connection with health care providers, diagnostic services and pharmacies. It emphasizes preventive health care, managing chronic conditions and facilitating efficient health care delivery through technology. Docquity, Regional. Serving as a specialized social network for doctors, Docquity provides a platform for health care professionals across Southeast Asia to share knowledge, discuss cases and stay updated with the latest medical advancements. This not only enhances professional development but also improves the quality of care provided to patients. Challenges and Limitations Despite the promising growth, e-health startups in Southeast Asia face several challenges . Regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns and the need for digital literacy among both health care providers and patients are significant barriers. Additionally, ensuring the quality of health care services delivered through digital platforms remains a priority.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Service members will have another way to save money on their taxes in 2025, as defense officials are working to offer health care flexible spending accounts. Defense officials are currently coordinating with the Office of Personnel Management and aim to offer these accounts to eligible service members by Jan. 1, 2025, said Susan Mitchell, Department of Defense Tax Counsel, and executive director of the Armed Forces Tax Council. As with DoD’s new dependent care flexible spending accounts , enrollment for the new accounts would be during this year’s open enrollment season from mid-November to mid-December, likely Nov. 11 to Dec. 9. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Those who participate can save an average of 30% of the cost of these unreimbursed expenses, according to the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program, known as FSAFEDS. Savings depend on each individual’s tax situation. The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program, which also administers the service member dependent care flexible spending accounts, is sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management. Eligibility rules likely will be similar to the rules for the dependent care flexible spending accounts for service members, Mitchell said — service members in the active component and Active Guard Reserve members on Title 10 orders. These health care flexible spending accounts, already available to Defense Department civilians and to many employees in the private sector, will allow service members to set aside pretax dollars in an account. The money can be used to help pay for health care expenses that are not covered by Tricare or other health care. The maximum amount that can be set aside each year depends on the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. In 2024, for example, the maximum is $3,200. The minimum is $100. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “While Tricare provides health insurance for service members and family members, the health care flexible spending accounts can help reduce the costs, the burden of paying out-of-pocket health care expenses,” said Mitchell. The pretax dollars are deducted from the service member’s gross pay and deposited into the account. The service member can then submit health care receipts to be reimbursed for things like co-pays for prescriptions and health care visits, orthodontia, contact lenses, glasses, prescription sunglasses, in vitro fertilization and more. Many over-the-counter items and medicines such as sunscreen, bandages and hearing aid batteries, antacids, allergy medicines, cold medicines and aspirin and other pain relievers are among the qualifying expenses, with itemized receipts. Family advocates applaud the offering of the health care flexible spending accounts.

Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments drive diversified revenue streams, reinforcing the company's market position. Strategic investments in healthcare services and technology position UNH for future growth. Regulatory challenges and competitive pressures remain key threats to UNH's operational landscape. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with RBA. On February 28, 2024, UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ), a leading entity in the healthcare and well-being sector, filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its financial and operational performance. As a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives, UnitedHealth Group operates through two distinct yet complementary businesses: Optum and UnitedHealthcare. These segments work synergistically to improve access, affordability, outcomes, and experiences within the health system. With a significant market capitalization of $444.6 billion as of mid-2023, UnitedHealth Group serves approximately 53 million members globally, demonstrating its expansive reach and influence in the healthcare industry. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of the company's strategic positioning and potential future trajectory. Decoding UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Financial Robustness and Market Leadership : UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ) has cemented its position as a market leader in the healthcare insurance sector, with a substantial market capitalization reflecting investor confidence and a strong financial foundation. The company's diversified revenue streams, driven by its UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments, contribute to a stable financial outlook. This financial strength enables strategic investments in healthcare services and technology, further solidifying UNH's competitive edge. Innovative Healthcare Solutions : Innovation is at the core of UNH's strengths, with the company's continued investments in Optum franchises creating a healthcare services colossus. This spans medical and pharmaceutical benefits, outpatient care, and analytics, serving both affiliated and third-party customers. The integration of advanced analytics and technology in healthcare delivery positions UNH as a forward-thinking leader in the industry. Weaknesses Regulatory Compliance and Litigation Risks : UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ) operates in a highly regulated industry, which necessitates stringent compliance with healthcare laws and regulations. The complexity of these regulations poses a challenge, with potential for increased liability and litigation risks. These factors could impact the company's financials and reputation if not managed effectively. Story Continues Dependency on Government Healthcare Programs : A significant portion of UNH's revenue is derived from government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Changes in government funding or policy can directly affect the company's profitability and growth prospects. This dependency on government programs exposes UNH to political and fiscal uncertainties that could disrupt its operations. Opportunities Expansion into Global Markets : UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ) has the opportunity to further expand its international presence, leveraging its expertise in managed care and healthcare services. With a footprint in over 5 million members outside the U.S., UNH can capitalize on emerging markets to drive growth and diversify its revenue base. Technological Advancements and Data Analytics : The company's ability to analyze complex data and apply deep healthcare insights presents significant opportunities for growth. By harnessing technological advancements and data analytics, UNH can enhance patient outcomes, streamline operations, and develop innovative healthcare solutions that meet evolving consumer needs. Threats Competitive Pressures : The healthcare industry is characterized by intense competition, with numerous players vying for market share. UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ) faces the challenge of maintaining its leadership position amid rising competition from both traditional health insurers and new entrants leveraging technology to disrupt the industry. Healthcare Reform and Policy Changes : Legislative and policy changes, particularly those related to healthcare reform, pose a threat to UNH's business model. The uncertainty surrounding healthcare policies can lead to market volatility and necessitate adjustments in the company's strategy to comply with new regulations. In conclusion, UnitedHealth Group Inc ( NYSE:UNH ) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market leadership, bolstered by its innovative healthcare solutions and strategic investments. However, the company must navigate regulatory complexities and dependence on government programs, which could pose risks to its operational stability. Opportunities for global expansion and technological innovation present pathways for growth, while competitive pressures and healthcare reform remain significant threats. As UNH continues to adapt to the dynamic healthcare landscape, its strategic focus on improving access, affordability, and outcomes will be crucial in maintaining its competitive advantage and driving long-term success.

Host Geoff Bennett: We have long known about racial and ethnic bias in health care, but now we're getting some firsthand knowledge of how pervasive it is from people within that system through the largest study of its kind . The report was based on interviews with doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health workers. William Brangham breaks down the study's findings, part of our ongoing coverage of Race Matters . Reporter William Brangham interviewed Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, “senior vice president for advancing health equity at The Commonwealth Fund.” One hint about the left-wing nature of this enterprise came from the source -- the actual study hosted at The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation with a long liberal reputation , was tucked under the subhead “ Advancing Health Equity ,” “equity” being a left-wing buzzword. Another clue was the blunt way Commonwealth put its far-left finger on the survey scale: The survey oversampled Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) health care workers (n=450), Black health care workers (n=549), and Latino health care workers (n=550). It also included a robust white health care workers sample (n=1,266). Brangham summarized the study by claiming “nearly half of health care workers in the U.S. say racism against patients is a major problem.” His guest, Zephyrin of the Commonwealth Fund, outlined the slanted findings: Zephyrin: ….Previous research really tells us that racism and discrimination impact health care outcomes, especially for people of color. This study goes a step further, really spotlighting the voice of health care workers who have witnessed racism and discrimination and also experienced it themselves…. William Brangham: One of the more striking disparities in this was the perspective of black health care workers. And I'm going to put this graphic up. While half of all health care workers said doctors are more accepting of white patients advocating for themselves compared to Black patients, it was 70 percent of black workers who said this. I mean, that kind of perspective just has to really leap out at you. The actual survey results , as opposed to PBS’s spin, revealed vague, leading questions that predictably got the Commonwealth Fund the results they wanted, the ones Brangham found striking: “Medical providers can be more accepting of White patients advocating or speaking up for themselves than patients of color doing so.” Even with that leading question, the results weren’t overwhelming: 49% of all health care workers surveyed agreed. His guest used the dubious study to speak out for more useless DEI-style measures. Zephyrin: ….training is going to be very critical, not just anti-bias training, but also training recognizing that discrimination can be a game changer in health care, that it can impact quality of health care outcomes, and also be able to recognize the signs of discrimination. One suggested solution: “Review what vendors a health care provider currently uses to support more businesses owned by people of color.” Seriously? Other concerns boiled down not to racism per se but to a language barrier, which could be mitigated by legal immigrants learning English….but don’t expect liberals to be arguing that anytime soon. This segment was brought to you in part by Consumer Cellular . A transcript is available, click “Expand.” PBS NewsHour 2/2/24 7:33:50 p.m. (ET) Geoff Bennett: We have long known about racial and ethnic bias in health care, but now we're getting some firsthand knowledge of how pervasive it is from people within that system through the largest study of its kind. The report was based on interviews with doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health workers. William Brangham breaks down the study's findings, part of our ongoing coverage of Race Matters. William Brangham: In this study from The Commonwealth Fund, nearly half of health care workers in the U.S. say racism against patients is a major problem, and equal numbers report that they have personally witnessed discrimination against patients in their workplace. Employees at facilities that mostly serve Black or Latino patients reported higher instances of discrimination. To expand on the study's findings and why it matters, I'm joined by one of its co-authors. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin is senior vice president for advancing health equity at The Commonwealth Fund. Dr. Zephyrin, so good to have you on the ""NewsHour."" So half of health care workers say racism is a major problem, they have seen it in their own workplaces. I'm curious why you chose to look at this issue from this perspective. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, The Commonwealth Fund: Thank you, and thanks for having me. Previous research really tells us that racism and discrimination impact health care outcomes, especially for people of color. This study goes a step further, really spotlighting the voice of health care workers who have witnessed racism and discrimination and also experienced it themselves. In terms of why health workers, health care workers, understanding what health care workers are experiencing and what they need from their employers and colleagues to address discrimination is really critical to successful and sustainable change. Health care workers are a key part of the health care system, and they can be a part of the solution. We do know that the perspective of patients and providers are incredibly important, but for this study, we decided to focus on health care workers because they're on the ground. They impact the day-to-day care of people. And health care workers are living and breathing in the health care system every day. They really experience the realities of what it is to provide health care firsthand. William Brangham: One of the more striking disparities in this was the perspective of Black health care workers. And I'm going to put this graphic up. While half of all health care workers said doctors are more accepting of white patients advocating for themselves compared to Black patients, it was 70 percent of Black workers who said this. I mean, that kind of perspective just has to really leap out at you. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: Yes, it does. It does leap out at you. Where you come from is important. Diverse experiences are incredibly important. The data are clear just in general on the importance of a culturally diverse work force. It has a really profound impact on the health care system, on the patients served. I'm sure you have seen the data about diverse work force. It can address cultural needs, language needs, improve communication, improve patient status satisfaction. And there also may be more awareness of the impacts of discrimination and bias because of lived experience. William Brangham: There was also similar disparities when it came to language differences, with over 70 percent of Latino workers saying that non-English-speaking patients just don't get the same kind of care as English-speaking patients. Do these disparities, do you believe, actually impact patient outcomes? Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: There are data that support the linkage between discrimination and impact on quality of care. So we do know that there are significant disparities and inequities and outcomes, whether we're talking about maternal mortality and the crisis we're experiencing in this country or we're talking about inequities in life expectancy. We do know that where you live, work, play impacts your outcomes, right? And there's impacts of discrimination and racism on the social determinants of health. So we certainly have data that support this linkage. And to your point earlier, for people that have lived experience, whether it's race, ethnicity, language, other aspects of culture, there just may be more of an understanding, more of a recognition, more of a sensitivity to witnessing and discrimination within the health care system. William Brangham: There was also an interesting generational divide, with older health care workers not seeing quite as striking a level of crisis as younger workers did. What do you attribute that to? Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: Yes, we didn't ask why in the study. And so you don't know what you don't know. But a few things come to mind in terms of why younger people, younger health care workers are seeing more. This could reflect a generational shift in health care workers being more equity-oriented and younger workers who recognize equity as a key component of health care outcomes. So we need more research to clarify these generational differences. And more research could be potentially important to inform efforts to really prevent younger health care workers from leaving the profession. William Brangham: On that issue, you talked with workers about what they would like to see done to make things better. What were the sort of general principles they articulated? Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: Creating a safe reporting environment was one that came up as crucial. So, the study found that witnessing discrimination creates stress and also that helped care workers fear retaliation. So having a safe reporting environment that not only supports reporting, but also helps with reconciliation, is really important as well. I think education also remains crucial to engendering reform, and training is going to be very critical, not just anti-bias training, but also training recognizing that discrimination can be a game changer in health care, that it can impact quality of health care outcomes, and also be able to recognize the signs of discrimination. William Brangham: All right, Dr. Laurie Zephyrin at The Commonwealth Fund, thank you so much for being here. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: Thank you. Thanks so much for having me."

Host Geoff Bennett: We have long known about racial and ethnic bias in health care, but now we're getting some firsthand knowledge of how pervasive it is from people within that system through the largest study of its kind . The report was based on interviews with doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health workers. William Brangham breaks down the study's findings, part of our ongoing coverage of Race Matters . Reporter William Brangham interviewed Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, “senior vice president for advancing health equity at The Commonwealth Fund.” One hint about the left-wing nature of this enterprise came from the source -- the actual study hosted at The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation with a long liberal reputation , was tucked under the subhead “ Advancing Health Equity ,” “equity” being a left-wing buzzword. Another clue was the blunt way Commonwealth put its far-left finger on the survey scale: The survey oversampled Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) health care workers (n=450), Black health care workers (n=549), and Latino health care workers (n=550). It also included a robust white health care workers sample (n=1,266). Brangham summarized the study by claiming “nearly half of health care workers in the U.S. say racism against patients is a major problem.” His guest, Zephyrin of the Commonwealth Fund, outlined the slanted findings: Zephyrin: ….Previous research really tells us that racism and discrimination impact health care outcomes, especially for people of color. This study goes a step further, really spotlighting the voice of health care workers who have witnessed racism and discrimination and also experienced it themselves…. William Brangham: One of the more striking disparities in this was the perspective of black health care workers. And I'm going to put this graphic up. While half of all health care workers said doctors are more accepting of white patients advocating for themselves compared to Black patients, it was 70 percent of black workers who said this. I mean, that kind of perspective just has to really leap out at you. The actual survey results , as opposed to PBS’s spin, revealed vague, leading questions that predictably got the Commonwealth Fund the results they wanted, the ones Brangham found striking: “Medical providers can be more accepting of White patients advocating or speaking up for themselves than patients of color doing so.” Even with that leading question, the results weren’t overwhelming: 49% of all health care workers surveyed agreed. His guest used the dubious study to speak out for more useless DEI-style measures. Zephyrin: ….training is going to be very critical, not just anti-bias training, but also training recognizing that discrimination can be a game changer in health care, that it can impact quality of health care outcomes, and also be able to recognize the signs of discrimination. One suggested solution: “Review what vendors a health care provider currently uses to support more businesses owned by people of color.” Seriously? Other concerns boiled down not to racism per se but to a language barrier, which could be mitigated by legal immigrants learning English….but don’t expect liberals to be arguing that anytime soon. This segment was brought to you in part by Consumer Cellular . A transcript is available, click “Expand.” PBS NewsHour 2/2/24 7:33:50 p.m. (ET) Geoff Bennett: We have long known about racial and ethnic bias in health care, but now we're getting some firsthand knowledge of how pervasive it is from people within that system through the largest study of its kind. The report was based on interviews with doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health workers. William Brangham breaks down the study's findings, part of our ongoing coverage of Race Matters. William Brangham: In this study from The Commonwealth Fund, nearly half of health care workers in the U.S. say racism against patients is a major problem, and equal numbers report that they have personally witnessed discrimination against patients in their workplace. Employees at facilities that mostly serve Black or Latino patients reported higher instances of discrimination. To expand on the study's findings and why it matters, I'm joined by one of its co-authors. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin is senior vice president for advancing health equity at The Commonwealth Fund. Dr. Zephyrin, so good to have you on the ""NewsHour."" So half of health care workers say racism is a major problem, they have seen it in their own workplaces. I'm curious why you chose to look at this issue from this perspective. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, The Commonwealth Fund: Thank you, and thanks for having me. Previous research really tells us that racism and discrimination impact health care outcomes, especially for people of color. This study goes a step further, really spotlighting the voice of health care workers who have witnessed racism and discrimination and also experienced it themselves. In terms of why health workers, health care workers, understanding what health care workers are experiencing and what they need from their employers and colleagues to address discrimination is really critical to successful and sustainable change. Health care workers are a key part of the health care system, and they can be a part of the solution. We do know that the perspective of patients and providers are incredibly important, but for this study, we decided to focus on health care workers because they're on the ground. They impact the day-to-day care of people. And health care workers are living and breathing in the health care system every day. They really experience the realities of what it is to provide health care firsthand. William Brangham: One of the more striking disparities in this was the perspective of Black health care workers. And I'm going to put this graphic up. While half of all health care workers said doctors are more accepting of white patients advocating for themselves compared to Black patients, it was 70 percent of Black workers who said this. I mean, that kind of perspective just has to really leap out at you. Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: Yes, it does. It does leap out at you. Where you come from is important. Diverse experiences are incredibly important. The data are clear just in general on the importance of a culturally diverse work force. It has a really profound impact on the health care system, on the patients served. I'm sure you have seen the data about diverse work force. It can address cultural needs, language needs, improve communication, improve patient status satisfaction. And there also may be more awareness of the impacts of discrimination and bias because of lived experience. William Brangham: There was also similar disparities when it came to language differences, with over 70 percent of Latino workers saying that non-English-speaking patients just don't get the same kind of care as English-speaking patients. Do these disparities, do you believe, actually impact patient outcomes? Dr. Laurie Zephyrin: There are data that support the linkage between discrimination and impact on quality of care. So we do know that there are significant disparities and inequities and outcomes, whether we're talking about maternal mortality and the crisis we're experiencing in this country or we're talking about inequities in life expectancy. We do know that where you live, work, play impacts your outcomes, right? And there's impacts of discrimination and racism on the social determinants of health. So we certainly have data that support this linkage. And to your point earlier, for people that have lived experience, whether it's race, ethnicity, language, other aspects of culture, there just may be more of an understanding, more of a recognition, more of a sensitivity to witnessing and discrimination within the health care system. William Brangham: There was also an interesting generational divide, with older health care workers not seeing quite as striking a level of crisis as younger workers did.

The report, issued by Chongqing-based healthcare research institute VCBeat Research and JDH Online Healthcare, showed that China's online healthcare services grew in 2023, with high-quality hospitals and online healthcare platforms showing remarkable progress. Apart from basic services such as online follow-up visits, they have been constantly enriching their service content to satisfy the diversified needs of users. In 2023, China's online healthcare sector demonstrated new features. According to the report, the users of online healthcare are mainly distributed among users who use online consultation services. Although young people took up a great share, aged users account for a major percentage, and the ratio has been growing year by year. Some users choose multiple online follow-up visits, which suggests that their online healthcare habits are forming. According to a survey conducted by VCBeat Research and JDH Online Healthcare, 23.76 percent of users hold online consultations two to four times a year, while 16.11 percent go to the same online department two to four times a year. ""Only when they acknowledge the quality of service of the online healthcare platforms do they turn to the platform and even the same department again,"" said Zhang Xiaoxu, a healthcare analyst at VBData.cn, the parent company of VCBeat Research. Data from the e-commerce research institute of digital economy media 100ec.cn showed that in the first half of 2023, China's online healthcare sector scale touched 173.4 billion yuan ($24 billion), growing 21.18 percent on a yearly basis. The sector was estimated to surge 24.25 percent year-on-year to 385.4 billion yuan by the end of the year.

Change Healthcare, which handles orders and patient payments, said the attack began on Wednesday (February 21). ""At this time, we believe the issue is specific to Change Healthcare, and all other systems across UnitedHealth Group are operational. The disruption is expected to last at least through the day. We will provide updates as more information becomes available,"" the company said on Friday morning . In an SEC filing about the incident , UnitedHealth Group said it has ""identified a suspected nation-state associated cyber security threat actor"" that has ""gained access to some of the Change Healthcare information technology systems."" Change Healthcare has taken steps to disconnect dozens of systems following the attack. The cyberattack impacted numerous healthcare providers, including Tricare, which provides healthcare for active-duty military personnel. As a result of the attack, Tricare said that military clinics and hospitals will use manual procedures to process prescriptions. A spokesperson for CVS told Fox Business that the cyberattack is not impacting their ability to fill prescriptions , but it is causing issues with processing insurance claims. ""We're continuing to fill prescriptions, but in certain cases, we are not able to process insurance claims, which our business continuity plan is addressing to ensure patients continue to have access to their medications,"" the spokesperson said."

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Feb 23, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save John Erwin is the Chief Executive Officer at Carenet Health . getty In the healthcare industry, our central mission is to improve lives through better health outcomes and better care access. Yet, we must remember that hospitals and health systems must stay financially sound to provide life-saving care. The past few years have been challenging for many hospitals and health systems financially, and as healthcare costs continue to accelerate at incredible rates, 2024 is likely to bring continued financial challenges. As healthcare organizations think about the market in the coming year, they need to focus on laying out a multi-faceted strategy to save costs. Consumers Drive The Healthcare Revenue Engine If there’s one key to improving finances for payers and providers, it’s prioritizing the consumer experience . The average American is spending north of $13,000 per year in insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs on their healthcare, so attracting and retaining members and patients is of high value to healthcare organizations to grow revenue. Keeping consumers’ attention is a much different ballgame than it was a couple decades ago. Today’s healthcare consumers pay for a larger portion of their health insurance and copays than in the past, so they are that much more invested in their own care and health spending decisions. The "" patient-member-consumer"" of 2024 also expects more individualized attention from their plans and providers. While the standard for customer service in healthcare has historically lagged behind industries like ecommerce and hospitality, this is poised to change, and change fast. With new healthcare and health insurance options like Amazon Health and CVS Minute Clinic, providers and payers must make consumer experiences more convenient and affordable to compete. In 2024, I believe smart healthcare organizations will embrace technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) , machine learning (ML), digital voice analytics and voice response to increase efficiency and create a better consumer experience. For patients and health plan members, this could mean a significantly enhanced and streamlined experience. When patients have a more seamless visit—filling out forms, providing their payment information and more before the appointment takes place—the appointment time can be used more efficiently. This enables the patient to spend more time with their provider, ask more questions and be more proactive and involved in their own care. The result? More satisfied and engaged patients who are more likely to return to the hospital or health system the next time they need care. And in 2024, patient loyalty is a rare and valuable commodity. Treat Patients Early To Reduce Costs Engaging patients and members and streamlining the healthcare consumer experience is also key to reducing avoidable emergency department (ED) visits—a significant driver of U.S. healthcare costs. According to a study conducted in 2019, avoidable visits make up two-thirds of all ED visits by patients with private insurance. Directing patients and members to preventative and primary care is key to reducing preventable ED visits, thereby reducing costs for the patient, hospital and health plan alike. Payers and providers must engage with patients and members and connect them to timely care so that conditions are diagnosed and treated before they progress to the point of an ED visit. Alternative care options such as telehealth visits, nurse advice lines and urgent care clinics can increase access to preventative, cost-saving care. Implementing these types of care and educating patients and members about the care types available to them will be critical to both saving costs and improving health outcomes in 2024. Addressing Healthcare’s Biggest Challenge The rise of U.S. healthcare costs is not a problem to be taken lightly. Legendary businessman and investor Warren Buffet once stated that rising healthcare costs are the number one problem facing American businesses, calling medical costs “the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.” Today’s healthcare consumers have more care options available to them than ever before, and AI and ML are poised to revolutionize patient and member experiences. Yet, we’re still struggling as a nation to provide affordable and accessible healthcare and manage our mounting healthcare spend. Prioritizing the healthcare consumer experience and connecting consumers to preventative care will be key to controlling costs in 2024.

However, things could change in 2024. The drugmaker is awaiting a major catalyst that could send its stock price soaring. What's more, Wall Street has high expectations for Madrigal. The average analyst price target for the stock currently is $318, representing about 40% upside from its current price. Will Madrigal Pharmaceuticals justify the Street's optimism in the next year? And more importantly, is the stock worth buying and holding onto for long-term investors? A breakthrough in the making Last year, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for resmetirom, a medicine for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The agency is expected to complete the review of Madrigal's application next month. There are several reasons why an approval here could be a big deal. First, there is a significant unmet need in the NASH market. Obesity is thought to be a major contributing factor and with obesity reaching epidemic levels worldwide, the prevalence of NASH could continue growing. Analysts predict the NASH market will skyrocket in the coming years. Some see it hitting as much as $108 billion by 2030. Second, there are no approved therapies specifically for this disease, which means resmetirom could be the first. Third, while many biotechs are trying to develop drugs that treat NASH -- including some of the largest in the world, such as Novo Nordisk -- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals could beat them all to the punch and launch a product in this market before them. That says a lot about Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' innovative abilities. Lots of potential and lots of risk If Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is racing toward this important approval, why have the company's shares failed to keep pace with the market in the past year? Of course there is the risk that the FDA will decline to approve the treatment, a possibility every biotech company has to deal with. The risk is even greater with smaller drugmakers that have less experience navigating this highly regulated industry, like Madrigal. Still, resmetirom aced clinical trials, so unless something unforeseen happens, it should earn the nod from the FDA. There is another potential problem with Madrigal Pharmaceuticals: The company's shares might be a bit overvalued, even after the recent sell-off. It's always hard to predict how much revenue new drugs will bring, but some analysts see resmetirom reaching $3.6 billion in annual sales by 2033. Even if we assume the biotech can get there three years earlier, by 2030, that still makes Madrigal stock seem too pricey. Story Continues Let's assume the company can generate $1 billion in revenue in the next year -- an optimistic estimate. The company ended the third quarter with about 18.3 million shares outstanding, so that would work out to $54.65 of sales per share if it had $1 billion in revenue. If you divide the current stock price of $230 by $54.65, you'd get a price-to-sales ratio in this scenario of 4.2 and I'd consider the ""undervalued"" threshold starting at 2 and under. And again, this analysis isn't adjusted for potential risk. Will resmetirom actually generate $1 billion in sales in the next year? Will other drugs enter the market soon enough to take away some market share? These questions would complicate calculations and likely make Madrigal Pharmaceuticals look far less attractively valued than it already does. That is, after all, the opinion of some analysts who have estimated a valuation for this company that has notched no sales yet. MDGL PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts You could argue that Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is worth a premium given the breakthrough it is potentially making in the NASH market. But how much of a premium is the company worth when better-established biotech stocks like Novo Nordisk are hot on that trail in the NASH market and have proven they can deliver solid financial results and stock market performances over long periods? Madrigal Pharmaceuticals might be the better choice for investors who want absolutely explosive returns in the next few years. On the flip side, the investment also carries much more risk. So, is Madrigal Pharmaceuticals likely to hit the Street's price target in the next year? My view is that there is a decent chance that it will, although it is by no means a guarantee. But the catalyst from the potential FDA approval for resmetirom could lead to substantial gains for the stock. As a long-term option, however, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals still looks a bit too risky and overpriced. It's worth keeping a close eye on the company given its obvious innovative prowess, but long-term investors should wait for a better entry point.

In a bold move aimed at bolstering the healthcare workforce in Johor, Gleneagles Hospital Johor (GHJ) has proudly announced its commitment to sponsoring students pursuing a Diploma in Nursing at the Institute of Science and Technology Darul Takzim (INSTEDT). This initiative marks a pivotal moment in the region’s healthcare landscape, underlining GHJ’s dedication to healthcare sustainability by nurturing young talents within the industry. The partnership between GHJ and INSTEDT signifies a collaborative effort to address the pressing need for skilled healthcare professionals. Through a memorandum of understanding (MoU), both institutions have solidified their commitment to education and on-the-job training, particularly in nursing — a field forecasted to face a shortfall of around 8,000 professionals by 2024. With healthcare institutions experiencing a surge in demand for experienced nurses, GHJ aims to inspire a new wave of individuals to pursue nursing studies through this initiative. During the recent MoU signing ceremony, Gleneagles Hospital Johor chief executive officer Dr Kamal Amzan, who is also IHH Healthcare Berhad (IHH) Malaysia’s regional chief executive officer for its southern and eastern hospitals, shared the hospital’s vision. “Our aim is to empower students to excel in their studies and make significant contributions to the community while addressing the nationwide issue of inadequate nursing staff. “As we embark on this journey towards a more sustainable healthcare future, we invite other industry players to join us in nurturing young talents, ensuring accessibility and sustainability in Malaysia’s healthcare sector. “This effort is to also ensure that healthcare remains accessible, equitable, in a bid to make it sustainable for Johoreans and Malaysians.” Marking the pivotal MoU signing ceremony with a few of Gleneagles Hospital Johor’s sponsored students. GHJ’s investment in more than 100 students over the next three years covers not only their education fees, but also a monthly allowance and medical coverage. The first cohort of 40 students is poised to graduate by the end of 2025, with guaranteed employment opportunities within the IHH Healthcare Group — a testament to GHJ’s commitment to fostering career advancement. Moreover, GHJ has partnered with INSTEDT to offer internship opportunities within the hospital, ensuring students receive practical training and valuable experience in the dynamic healthcare environment. INSTEDT chief executive officer Datin Hariza Hashim emphasised the significance of addressing the shortage of healthcare professionals in both private and public sectors. She highlighted GHJ’s sponsorship initiative as a pivotal step in meeting this challenge and ensuring a steady supply of trained professionals for Malaysia’s healthcare future. Beyond INSTEDT, GHJ’s sponsorship programme also extends to higher education institutions nationwide, reinforcing its commitment to addressing the nursing shortage across Malaysia. Dr Kamal reiterated that collaboration among healthcare organisations is essential for the industry’s growth, accessibility, and sustainability in Johor and beyond. As GHJ spearheads talent development and strengthens Malaysia’s healthcare system, it paves the way towards a brighter, more accessible healthcare future for everyone.

Preston Battle IV , Caldwell Collins , Christy Tosh Crider Baker Donelson + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Baker Donelson secured a win before the Tennessee Supreme Court when, on February 16, 2024, the Court issued a ruling supporting health care providers and those who seek to secure health care for a loved one. In Williams v. Smyrna Residential , No. M2021-00927-SC-R11-CV (Tenn. Feb. 16, 2024), the Court ruled that when a person chooses an agent they trust to make decisions for them through a General Durable Power of Attorney, that agent may exercise those powers to sign an arbitration agreement when admitting their principal to a long term care community and will not be stripped of that authority simply because they are contracting with a health care provider. Further, the Court held that wrongful death beneficiaries are bound by that arbitration agreement because the decedent's claim, including the agreement to arbitrate that claim, passes to the wrongful death beneficiaries. This is a victory for all Tennesseans who have chosen an agent to make decisions for them and for health care providers who work with those agents to admit individuals needing care into their communities. The Court ruled that the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Act does not strip a General Durable Power of Attorney of the right to choose arbitration as the forum to resolve disputes with a health care provider. Of note, the Court chose not to address the issue of whether a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care may still sign an arbitration agreement that is provided as an option when securing health care for her principal. The Court reasoned: To the extent we are leaving questions unanswered, that is because we may only decide the questions that are presented by this case. . . . ""We have neither constitutional authority nor inherent power to give advisory opinions"" on other issues that are not before us. . . . Chief Justice Kirby's dissenting opinion asserts that it ""would be much more practical for the Court to just overrule"" Owens [a prior Supreme Court opinion holding that a health care decision maker has the authority to sign arbitration agreements on behalf of their principal] rather than distinguish it. But no party has asked us to overrule Owens , let alone briefed the issue of whether Owens should be overruled. In fact, when asked at oral argument whether the Court should overrule Owens , counsel for defendants insisted that Owens is distinguishable and need not be overruled to resolve this appeal. Deciding whether to overrule a precedent entails consideration of several factors, not simply whether that outcome would be ""more practical."" . . . Accordingly, that question is best addressed in a case where it is raised by the parties and developed through adversarial presentation. [Citations omitted.] In declining to address a health care agent's authority to sign an arbitration agreement that is part of the admission process to a long term care community and choosing not to overrule Owens , the Court referenced its holding in that case: We acknowledged that signing an arbitration agreement is a ""legal decision"" but rejected as ""untenable"" an approach that would allow ""the attorney-in-fact [to] make one 'legal decision,' contracting for health care services for the principal, but not another, agreeing in the contract to binding arbitration."" . . . ""Holding that an attorney-in-fact can make some 'legal decisions' but not others,"" we explained, ""would introduce an element of uncertainty into health care contracts signed by attorneys-in-fact"" that could make it harder to obtain health care. Because the Court chose not to overrule Owens , it is logical to infer that the Owens holding – that a health care agent can bind her principal to an arbitration agreement – remains the law. Indeed, as Justice Lee's dissent points out, since not overruled, Owens and its progeny remain the law governing a health care agent's authority to sign an arbitration agreement as part of an admission to a long term care community: Whether the arbitration agreement in Owens was optional was irrelevant to the issue before the Court – whether a durable power of attorney for health care authorized the attorney-in-fact to sign an arbitration agreement as part of a contract for admission to a nursing home. . . . The decision to admit a person to a health care facility is not a single admission decision; it involves many decisions about living arrangements, services, and numerous other aspects of the person's life. Some directly pertain to health care, and some do not. Similarly, many decisions are not required to be made in a certain way, but they are still required to be made upon admission. The arbitration agreements in Jones , Watson , Bockelman , Mitchell , and Barbee were all optional, yet the court in each case held their execution to be a 'health care decision.' . . . Thus, these Tennessee courts have held that signing an arbitration agreement is a health care decision, even where the arbitration agreement is described as 'separate' or 'stand-alone.' [Citations omitted.] It seems likely that, given the opportunity, the Tennessee Supreme Court would grant review on a case in which the agent held only a health care power of attorney and signed an optional arbitration agreement. Until then, Owens and its progeny should guide trial courts to find that health care agents maintain the authority to execute both mandatory and optional arbitration agreements with health care providers. When the Tennessee Supreme Court is presented with the case of an optional arbitration agreement signed only by a health care decision maker, the Court could reconcile Williams and Owens by recognizing that the decision to sign an arbitration agreement as part of admission to a long term care community necessarily involves legal and health care decisions and falls within the authority of both a legal decision maker and a health care decision maker (as opposed to one or the other). That result would be consistent with its rulings and reasoning in Williams and Owens and would prevent the ""untenable result"" warned against in Owens . It would give clarity to those seeking to admit loved ones to long term care communities, and to health care providers attempting to help those agents secure much needed health care for their loved ones. That said, the majority's opinion in Williams makes clear that the Court will closely examine the specific language of any power of attorney that it is reviewing. And while the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care Act states that only an authorized attorney-in-fact for health care may make a ""health care decision"" as defined under that act, the Tennessee Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act does not have the same restriction. Thus, it is logical that a health care attorney-in-fact could have the authority to enter into an optional arbitration agreement with a health care facility under the terms of an otherwise valid power of attorney for health care.

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! As the cost of living continues to be a crucial concern for voters, there’s an urgent need for candidates to present viable solutions for making health care both affordable and accessible. Here are five fresh principles for health care reform that can resonate across party lines. Address root causes, not just symptoms . One of the biggest reasons major Washington-led health care reforms have failed to lower health care costs is because they focus on health insurance instead of health care, and very little on health itself. ObamaCare and the Inflation Reduction Act are perfect examples. Every year, these programs give more money to health insurance companies to offset the costs of higher premiums for people with larger incomes. A better approach is to fund American patients, not health insurance companies, by giving them direct control over the subsidy they qualify for and let them use it to buy the care and coverage that works best for them. Fund American patients, not health insurance companies, and let them use their subsidy to buy the care and coverage that works best for them. (Martin Barraud via Getty Images) To further stop this doom loop, lawmakers must shift their focus from merely subsidizing insurance premiums to addressing the underlying issues of high health care prices and excessive demand. Lower prices and lower demand will lead to lower premiums. HERE'S HOW AI WILL DRIVE HEALTH CARE TO MEET CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS Localize health care . The challenge for Washington in focusing on health and health care is that they are both local issues, not national. Health care is delivered in a local setting, and the quality of care you receive is largely linked to what is available locally. Meanwhile, population health is much more influenced by local conditions than national ones. This means a command-and-control approach from Washington to improve the health of our people and the quality of care they receive is doomed to fail. Instead, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should leverage its position to be a facilitator of change at the local level rather than an imposer of change. Video One example of how this could be done is block grants and waivers in Medicaid , which would empower states and local communities to best cover and improve the health of vulnerable populations. Eliminate the middleman. The current health insurance, big government-dominated system is your old cable bundle. The health care system of the future is streaming on demand. We need reforms to move us toward on demand, and that means enabling patients to cut out the middleman. Direct care clinics allow patients to cut out the insurance middleman and pay doctors a monthly fee that gives them on demand access to their services. This arrangement is better for patients and doctors. By eliminating insurance company paperwork and getting doctors off the revenue cycle roller coaster, doctors can have smaller patient panels and spend more time with patients. TO BEGIN TO FIX HEALTH CARE START BY FIXING THIS NONSENSICAL RULE Video Washington can support the growth of direct care by allowing Direct Primary Care memberships to be paid for with Health Savings Accounts funds. We should also make them available to Medicaid, Medicare and ObamaCare patients using their benefit dollars. Demand transparency. We are conservatives committed to free market principles, but we also recognize that a successful market for health care needs very strong rules in place to protect patients. This is because health care is not your prototypical, Adam Smith-style marketplace. The asymmetry of information between patients and doctors is enormous, and the presence of the third-party payer means patients have no concept of the value of the care they receive. Video Transparency can help even the playing field, bringing much needed accountability to the health care system. This means strengthening price and quality transparency for providers, so patients and self-insuring companies can find the best value for their health care dollars. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It also means transparency into the business practices of the health care middlemen like managed care companies, wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers. For instance, self-insured companies must have the right to see their claims data so they can audit their expenses. Drug manufacturer rebates to pharmacy benefit managers must be exposed and the savings should be passed on to patients at the pharmacy counter. We also need visibility into provider network contracts to see if hospitals are leveraging their size or position to force coverage of low value procedures (such as in-hospital imaging) and shut out competition. Video Health care is a moral issue first, economic second . Finally, candidates must remember that as much as voters are demanding solutions to make health care more affordable, these solutions cannot come at the expense of patients getting the care they need. Americans view health care primarily as a moral issue, and an economic one second. Rationing from the government or private sector is not an acceptable solution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By treating the underlying issues of high costs and inefficiencies, localizing health care solutions, eliminating the middleman when possible, demanding transparency, and recognizing health care as a moral imperative , we can create a system that truly serves the needs of all Americans. This is an approach to health care reform that could transcend party lines and genuinely serve the American people.

Before making any commitments to invest in a pharma fund, thorough research is imperative. Abeer Ray Published 21 Feb 2024, 10:10 AM IST There are many mutual funds in the pharma and healthcare sector that investors may put their money in. Numerous experienced market participants are expressing support for the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, asserting that they are poised for future success. This sentiment is unsurprising, given the impressive outperformance of the Nifty Pharma Index compared to the broader markets. As the world contends with emerging diseases and viruses, the focus remains on the healthcare sector. While many other industries faltered amid the instability of global economies, the healthcare sector persists in providing returns to its investors. This is evident in the performance of diverse healthcare stocks and the remarkable earnings reported by pharmaceutical and healthcare mutual funds. A glimpse at pharma sector performance Access to healthcare is an essential requirement, not a luxury. The consistent increase in demand for medical services and products is driven by various factors. Furthermore, during times of economic uncertainty, investors frequently gravitate towards “defensive” sectors characterized by consistent demand and reliable income streams. Healthcare aligns with these criteria, positioning it as a relatively stable investment choice. The table below presents several well-known pharmaceutical and healthcare funds, along with their respective five-year and 10-year returns, for your reference. Name of the fund Five-year returns (in %) 10-year returns (in %) ICICI Prudential Pharma Healthcare and Diagnostics (P.H.D) Fund 29.22 - Mirae Asset Healthcare Fund 27.55 - ITI Pharma & Healthcare Fund 27.15 - SBI Healthcare Opportunities Fund 26.68 17.16 Tata India Pharma & Heathcare Fund 26.40 - Source : AMFI (As of February 20, 2024) Should you invest in pharma and healthcare funds? The ongoing surge in the Indian pharmaceutical sector has created wealth for investors, especially those invested in healthcare companies. Additionally, the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector serves as a defensive theme as people persist in seeking medical assistance and taking medications even during challenging times. The spotlight will remain on healthcare, and numerous companies within these sectors are striving to perform optimally within the given constraints. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical sector has exhibited robust performance in the Indian stock market. This can be attributed to factors such as the worldwide demand for generics, government backing, and the defensive characteristics inherent in the sector. Those looking to invest in this sector should be mindful of the stringent regulations governing the pharmaceutical industry, as alterations in these regulations may affect profitability. Given the high level of competition both domestically and internationally, Indian companies must consistently innovate and enhance efficiency to sustain their market presence. Additionally, the Indian government enforces price controls on certain essential drugs, potentially restricting profit margins for companies. A cautionary note for investors Examining the holdings of diversified equity funds , it is evident that large-cap-oriented portfolios typically have a moderate average exposure of 2-5% to the pharma/healthcare sector. In contrast, multicap and mid-cap funds exhibit a higher allocation to the pharma/healthcare sector. Large-cap funds concentrate on established companies with proven track records, while multicap and mid-cap funds encompass a broader spectrum, investing in mid-sized and smaller firms. The growth potential of the pharma/healthcare sector in these segments catalyzes increased allocation in these funds. Investors must recognize that this is a sector-specific fund, necessitating a long-term investment perspective. The presence of a high-risk factor underscores the importance of having a higher risk tolerance . Engaging in investments in this thematic fund category should be approached with careful due diligence and consideration to prevent potential long-term losses.

https://borgenproject.org/microfinance-and-health-care/,,Microfinance and Health Care Accessibility in Sub - Saharan Africa,20240220T014500Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Microfinance-and-Health-Care-Accessibility-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-845x684.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant health care challenges , including limited access to medical facilities, a shortage of health care professionals and high treatment costs. Microfinance and health care initiatives have emerged as powerful tools to address these issues, providing financial support and a beacon of hope for communities traditionally marginalized from conventional health care systems. The Link: Microfinance and Health Care Microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Sub-Saharan Africa are not just about small business loans anymore; they have expanded their services to include health care financing. MFIs offer small loans , savings and other financial services to individuals and communities who lack access to traditional banking. This shift is a response to the acute need for accessible health care services, especially in rural and impoverished urban areas. These services enable people to invest in health-related expenses, such as medical treatments, health insurance and preventive care, thereby improving overall health care accessibility. Furthermore, by offering loans, savings products and health insurance, MFIs are enabling low-income individuals and families to afford medical treatments and preventive care that were previously out of reach. The impact of microfinance on health care accessibility is profound. In countries like Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda, microfinance initiatives have been linked to improved health outcomes, including increased rates of immunization, better maternal health services and reduced incidence of common diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Case Studies of Microfinance in Action Microfinance and Health Protection (MAHP). Launched in January 2006 with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the MAHP initiative by Freedom from Hunger represents a landmark effort to blend microfinance with health services , aiming to mitigate the harsh impacts health issues can have on the financial stability of the very poor. By developing and testing an array of integrated products and services, MAHP has been able to reach nearly 2.3 million microfinance clients across ten countries, offering health education, financing and micro-insurance, alongside innovative linkages to health care providers and access to essential health products. These offerings are designed to enhance knowledge, change behaviors and provide financial tools that enable poor families to better manage health-related expenses, ensuring that health care is more accessible and affordable. The initiative’s comprehensive approach not only safeguards the health of clients and their families but also contributes to microfinance institutions’ sustainability and social mission, demonstrating a scalable model for improving health outcomes and financial resilience among the world’s impoverished communities. Advans Nigeria . In Nigeria, despite the launch of a microfinance policy aimed at enhancing financial inclusion, a significant portion of the adult population remains excluded from formal financial services. To address this, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revised the Microfinance Policy, Regulatory and Supervisory Framework in 2011, recognizing and bringing informal financial institutions under its supervision to improve the delivery of financial services. Advans La Fayette Microfinance Bank, leveraging this regulatory environment, partnered with AXA MANSARD to launch innovative micro-health insurance products in February 2021. These products, including ‘Advans Malacare’ for malaria treatment and ‘Advans Medic’ for general medical consultations and treatments, aim to provide affordable health care access to their clients. This initiative underscores Advans Nigeria’s commitment to financial inclusion by ensuring their clients’ welfare through accessible and affordable medical coverage, aligning with their broader strategy to support clients’ financial security and independence, while fostering the growth of small businesses. Limitations and Future Perspectives Microfinance holds promise for enhancing health care accessibility in Sub-Saharan Africa, but it faces challenges such as high interest rates that may burden borrowers and a narrow focus on financial products at the expense of comprehensive health care solutions. Additionally, MFIs often encounter funding and scalability issues that curb their reach and effectiveness. Furthermore, a more integrated approach combining microfinance with health care services could significantly benefit Sub-Saharan Africa. This strategy would involve health education, preventive care and collaborations with health care providers to boost MFIs’ impact. The success of integrating health care and financial services into the region’s future hinges on cross-sector collaboration. Governments have a vital role in fostering regulatory environments conducive to this integration, while international agencies and NGOs can offer essential technical support and funding for pilot projects. Crucially, the engagement of local communities is paramount to ensure the initiatives align with their health and financial needs. To maximize the potential of microfinance in transforming health care accessibility , further research and investment are essential. This will help scale up successful models and address the health and economic challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa more effectively. Looking Ahead Microfinance initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa play a crucial role in bridging the gap between underserved communities and health care services. Despite facing challenges, the potential of microfinance to facilitate better health care outcomes is immense. With continued innovation and support, microfinance can significantly contribute to the health and well-being of Sub-Saharan African communities. – Hosna Hossain Photo: Unsplash February 19, 2024 https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg 0 0 Precious Sheidu https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg Precious Sheidu 2024-02-19 15:00:55 2024-05-30 22:32:50 Microfinance and Health Care Accessibility in Sub-Saharan Africa"

Funding healthcare: Stable investment in a volatile market Investors are increasingly focusing on India’s healthcare sector for stable returns, with promising growth and investment opportunities By Nishant Sharma Updated - February 18, 2024 at 07:35 PM. × Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/pulse/funding-healthcare-stable-investment-in-a-volatile-market/article67853729.ece Copy Balancing scales: By addressing the challenges and leveraging opportunities, India can chart a course for transformative healthcare system In the current economic landscape, investors are increasingly focusing on India’s healthcare sector for stable returns in a volatile market. This surge in interest extends across diverse segments, including health providers, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, health insurance, single-specialty providers and other health technology enabled services. In 2022, the healthcare sector witnessed deals worth $4.3 billion, constituting approximately 8 percent of total investments. In 2023, with 22 transactions totalling $4.6 billion, the Indian healthcare sector showed promise for investors due to economic growth, business-friendly government, maturing pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape and burgeoning middle class with a keen interest in investing in quality healthcare. The post-Covid era has also witnessed a surge in both government and private spending on healthcare coverage with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare receiving a 16.5 per cent boost in the 2022-23 Union Budget at ₹86,200 crore. Private Equity The role of private equity in healthcare champions technology-driven solutions, investments leveraging AI and data for improved decision-making, diagnostics, prevention and treatment. Drawing attention to these burgeoning investment opportunities contributes significantly to the growth and evolution of the healthcare sector. Looking ahead, the government could provide further support to the medtech sector by contemplating reductions in import duties for components and lowering GST on locally procured raw materials, particularly for critical medical devices such as stents, heart valves, knee and hip implants. Acknowledging the limitations of super-specialty hospitals in effectively managing the entire healthcare landscape, there is a resounding call for a more specialised and cost-efficient approach. A model focusing on single specialties — including eye care and dental care — is deemed a more scalable and capital-efficient means of delivering quality healthcare. Striking a balance between single and multi-specialty models presents multifaceted opportunities for growth and an overall enhancement in healthcare delivery. While there is a glaring gap in urban vs rural private equity investments in healthcare, incentivising private equity in rural settings — through budget allocations, support for insurance coverage and the establishment of feeder hospitals for basic healthcare, emerges as a strategic approach to promoting rural healthcare. By adeptly addressing challenges and astutely leveraging opportunities, India can chart a course towards a transformative healthcare system that caters to the diverse needs of its population.

(Christopher Anderson/The Spokesman-Review) Buy this photo X Email Reddit SMS By Ellen Dennis and Lauren Rendahl The Spokesman-Review Eight health care systems own more than 90% of the hospital beds in Washington. And one health care system owns 100% of the hospital beds in six counties. Right now, Democratic lawmakers in Olympia are pushing for legislation to ensure hospital mergers don’t limit patient access to abortions, gender-affirming care or medically assisted suicide. The bill was partially inspired by concerns over access to abortion and gender-affirming care in hospitals with religious affiliations, especially in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade. Sen. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, sponsored Senate Bill 5241 , also called the Keep Our Care Act. If passed, the bill would prohibit health care system mergers that would “detrimentally affect accessible, affordable health care.” The proposal would require hospitals, clinics and health care systems to meet new requirements when reporting a proposed merger or purchase to the state, including increasing the required notice period to 120 days. Most notably, however, the bill would give the Washington attorney general the power to grant permission or veto a proposed merger, if they find a consolidation would harm patient care. The bill passed 28-21 in the state Senate on Feb. 8. The vote was divided across party lines, with Sen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah, the only Democrat to vote against the proposal. It still has to make its way through the House and get passed before it sees the top of Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk. Nearly half of the hospital beds in Washington are in medical centers that do not offer abortion care. Supporters of Randall’s bill argue this figure harms patients, both those who live in the state and those who travel from other states for abortions. “This number is unacceptable and limits access, especially in rural areas,” said Nicole Kern, the government relations manager at Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “Many health system mergers also lead to restricted access to contraception, medical aid in dying and gender-affirming care.” Those opposed to the bill argue the proposed law would burden smaller hospitals with bureaucracy, and that the cost incurred by hospitals to meet the bill’s standards would fall on the backs of patients. Some say the bill grants too much power to the state attorney general. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, spoke at a House Civil Rights & Judiciary Hearing Committee public hearing, saying the proposal would hurt the competitive nature of the current health care marketplace. “Some of us are concerned that the use of the state’s Consumer Protection Act to restrict transactions actually limits consumer choice,” Walsh said. “Especially in an area as critical as the delivery of health care services.” Randall responded by saying her bill would help consumers by providing commonsense oversight for health care providers. “When we are treating our health care system like a business proposition, we see decisions made to close wings and departments that are no longer performing financially,” Randall said, “which leaves communities without access to labor and delivery, or surgical wings, or comprehensive reproductive health care.” Randall added that hospital mergers have affected the health care system in the region she represents. In 2017, Washington’s attorney general sued CHI Franciscan over health system consolidations that the state said hurt thousands of patients living on the Kitsap Peninsula. The patients “faced higher prices, increased wait times, difficulty in scheduling procedures, and a reduction in their choice of services and locations,” the attorney general’s office found. “As a result, CHI Franciscan has netted well over $1 million in ill-gotten gains so far.” “These are unintended consequences to unchecked and unregulated consolidation,” Randall said. “Those consequences sit on the shoulders of patients, they sit on the shoulders of providers. They sit on the shoulders of folks who are trying to pay their health care bills.” Randall said Washington has one of the most consolidated health care systems in the country. A 2023 report by the Seattle Times found more than 48% of the hospital beds in Washington are tied to a religious organization. Arguments on both sides Along with Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates of Washington, a number of local organizations sent representatives to testify at Wednesday’s hearing in favor of the proposal. Justin Gill works as an urgent care nurse practitioner at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. Gill is the president of the Washington State Nurses Association, an organization advocating for more than 20,000 nurses . Gill said the organization he leads supports the proposal. “I’ve seen the direct impacts on care access and decreased options for my patients,” Gill testified. “Unchecked health care consolidations are problematic. When hospitals consolidate, we as nurses have seen decisions go from the hands of health care experts to oftentimes far-removed executives that might prioritize profits over patient care.” Gill added that the bill would not prohibit mergers from happening, but rather make sure the mergers won’t harm patients. Farther north in Snohomish County, Kirk Normund said hospital mergers are preventing first-responders from being able to do their jobs. Normund, a fire captain with North Snohomish County Professional Firefighters, testified on behalf of the Washington State Council of Firefighters in support of the bill. All the hospitals Normund serves in the region have been subject to mergers, he said, and ever since, fire crews can no longer meet patient demands. The firefighter reported he has seen patients get treated in hallways while they wait for beds, with a line of 12 more ambulance crews waiting with patients. “That time it takes our crews to return from the hospital is untenable,” Normund said. “A normal 15-minute transfer is taking upward of four hours before a hospital will receive a patient. … It’s only a matter of time before a major emergency is met with a region devoid of firefighters able to respond.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington also has been outspoken in its support of the proposal. ACLU health policy program director Leah Rutman said research shows that health care consolidations drive up costs, decrease access to services and decrease the quality of care patients receive. Hospital consolidations can drive up costs more than 20%, according to a 2019 study presented before the U.S. House of Representatives. Black and Latino people are more likely than white people to miss a doctor’s visit due to the cost . Diane Blake, CEO of Cascade Medical, the critical access hospital and public hospital district in Leavenworth, testified at the hearing in opposition of the bill, calling it “harmfully restrictive.” “The scope of this bill goes far beyond the stated focus and threatens access to crucial health care services,” Blake said. “Especially in rural communities like mine.” Blake added that nearly half of the people in the service region of her health care district live in poverty and said costs incurred by health care systems like hers to meet the standards in the bill would fall on the backs of patients. “Sometimes partnerships are necessary to maintain existing access or stabilize cost,” Blake said. “But those partnerships may not be approved.” Dave Hargreaves, the board chair of Yakima Memorial MultiCare Hospital, also testified against the bill. Hargreaves said the Yakima Hospital’s merger with MultiCare last year was their “lifeline.” “Without this partnership done quickly, we could not have survived,” Hargreaves said. “(SB)5241 does not allow for the necessary discretion and flexibility, and one size of oversight does not fit all.” If the proposal makes it out of committee, it will then move to the House floor for a vote. The state’s legislative session this year lasts until March 7. Protections exist Randall’s bill is among a collection of legislation introduced the past two years intended to uphold abortion access in Washington. A bill last year made it illegal for health care professionals to be punished or denied a professional license for performing abortions, administering reproductive health care or offering gender-affirming care (such as gender reassignment surgery). A hiccup with the language used in the final version of the bill last year spurred Rep. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, to propose a complimentary bill this year to mend the mistake. “If you’re doing things that are consistent with the standard of care in Washington around reproductive health and gender-affirming care, you should be protected as a provider,” Riccelli said during a House floor debate in January. Last year’s bill didn’t clearly state that health care professionals who handle reproductive and gender-affirming care are protected from both disciplinary action and license-related penalties. Riccelli’s new bill works to harmonize the language so health care professionals are equally protected in each area under the Uniform Disciplinary Act. This year’s “technical cleanup” passed the House in a 56-37 vote with five representatives excused, and Joe Schmick, R-Colfax, as one of the nay votes. He urged lawmakers to be respectful of other states’ laws and hold health care workers to the standards of care they’re originally licensed in. “We expect professionals to follow the laws here, so I believe we should expect professionals to follow the laws that they are licensed in. Professional ethics matter,” Schmick said. If a health care worker in Texas faced disciplinary action for performing an abortion, relocating to Washington wouldn’t result in license denial or further punishment, Riccelli said in an interview. Since abortions are a standard measure of care in Washington, their previous discipline wouldn’t be taken into consideration when issuing a license. Riccelli’s bill passed out of the Senate Committee on Health and Long Term Care on Friday and now moves to another Senate committee."

News Flag Status - HALF STAFF Listen NEW CASTLE (February 12, 2024) – The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Delaware Health Care Commission have launched the Benchmark Trend Report Dashboard to further support the State’s efforts to improve health care quality for all residents, while simultaneously working to monitor and reduce the economic burden of health care spending. This dashboard allows an interactive view of Delaware’s health care spending and quality data comparing across multiple years. Users can directly interact with the data and visualizations, allowing a customizable journey through the dashboard. Information is broken down by state-, market- and insurer -level spending as well as type of insurance and total healthcare enrollment. The spending and quality benchmarks were originally developed to support Governor John Carney’s vision for the State. In November 2018, Governor Carney signed Executive Order 25, establishing a state health care spending benchmark, an annual per-capita-rate-of-growth benchmark for health care spending, and multiple health care quality measures that are to be evaluated and adjusted every three years. The benchmarks were subsequently codified in August of 2022 through House Bill 442. “Our goal of ensuring that Delawareans can access and afford quality health care is only possible when agencies across the State work collectively to pursue answers and solutions,” said DHSS Cabinet Secretary Josette Manning . “The benchmarks are a means to continue the conversation about how to decrease the cost of care and improve quality for the individuals we serve.” To learn more about Delaware’s health care spending and quality benchmarks, visit the Delaware Health Care Commission website at https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhcc/ .

Deep dive into the financials, market position, and strategic initiatives of HCA Healthcare Inc. Expert evaluation of the competitive landscape and future outlook for HCA Healthcare Inc. Identification of key factors influencing HCA Healthcare Inc's operational and financial performance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HCA. On February 16, 2024, HCA Healthcare Inc ( NYSE:HCA ), a leading healthcare services provider in the United States, filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC. The filing provides a detailed overview of the company's financial performance and strategic direction. As of December 31, 2023, HCA Healthcare Inc reported operating 186 hospitals and 124 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and England, showcasing a robust network of healthcare facilities. The company's commitment to delivering high-quality, cost-effective healthcare services is reflected in its financial tables, which reveal significant revenue generation and a solid balance sheet. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that HCA Healthcare Inc faces in the dynamic healthcare industry, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's market position and future prospects. Decoding HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA): A Strategic SWOT Insight Strengths Extensive Network and Market Presence: HCA Healthcare Inc's expansive network of hospitals and outpatient facilities is a cornerstone of its strength. With 186 hospitals and a plethora of other healthcare services, the company has established a significant presence in the healthcare market. This extensive network not only facilitates a wide-reaching service area but also enables HCA to cater to diverse patient needs, from acute care to specialized treatments. The company's strategic locations across multiple states and in England provide a competitive edge in terms of accessibility and market penetration. Financial Robustness: The financial tables in the 10-K filing underscore HCA Healthcare Inc's financial robustness. The company's revenue streams are diverse, stemming from its various healthcare services, which include inpatient care, outpatient surgery, diagnostic services, and emergency services. The financial data indicates a strong balance sheet, with substantial revenue growth and profitability. This financial health enables HCA to invest in new technologies, expand its services, and weather economic downturns more effectively than its competitors. Story Continues Weaknesses High Levels of Indebtedness: Despite its financial strengths, HCA Healthcare Inc carries a significant amount of debt. The 10-K filing reveals that the company's indebtedness could limit its ability to raise additional capital and may expose it to interest rate risks. High debt levels also impose restrictions on the company's operational flexibility, potentially hindering its ability to quickly adapt to market changes or invest in growth opportunities. Workforce Recruitment and Retention Challenges: The healthcare industry faces a persistent challenge in recruiting and retaining experienced nurses and other healthcare professionals. HCA Healthcare Inc is not immune to this issue, as indicated in the filing. The competition for staffing and the shortage of qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's operational efficiency and quality of care, ultimately impacting its reputation and financial performance. Opportunities Technological Advancements and Digital Capabilities: HCA Healthcare Inc's strategy emphasizes investments in clinical systems, digital capabilities, and innovative care solutions. The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving with the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. By staying at the forefront of these technological advancements, HCA has the opportunity to enhance patient care, improve operational efficiency, and differentiate itself from competitors. Expansion and Development: The company's growth agenda includes expanding its presence in existing markets and pursuing a disciplined development strategy. With a strong financial foundation, HCA Healthcare Inc is well-positioned to acquire new facilities, enter new markets, and form strategic partnerships, which can drive long-term growth and stockholder value. Threats Regulatory and Legal Risks: HCA Healthcare Inc operates in a highly regulated industry, and the 10-K filing highlights various risks related to government regulation and legal matters. Changes in healthcare laws, compliance failures, or government investigations could result in penalties or necessitate significant operational changes. Additionally, the company faces risks from litigation and payer audits, which could have material adverse effects on its financial position and operations. Public Health Crises: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the vulnerability of healthcare providers to public health crises. HCA Healthcare Inc acknowledges that future pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks could adversely affect its operations. Such events could lead to decreased patient volumes, increased uninsured patients, and disruptions in staffing and supply chains, posing significant threats to the company's business and financial health. In conclusion, HCA Healthcare Inc ( NYSE:HCA ) exhibits a strong market presence and financial stability, which are counterbalanced by challenges such as high indebtedness and workforce recruitment issues. The company's opportunities lie in technological innovation and market expansion, while regulatory pressures and public health crises pose significant threats. Overall, HCA Healthcare Inc's strategic focus on operational excellence, physician recruitment, and service development positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities effectively while addressing its weaknesses and mitigating threats.

The research says that employees at health care facilities with a high percentage of Black or Latino patients witnessed higher rates of racism, and it finds that 52% say racism against patients is a major crisis or problem. Black, Latino and younger workers are more likely to report witnessing such an incident than older workers and whites. The report, “Revealing Disparities: Health Care Workers’ Observations of Discrimination Against Patients,” is based on a survey of over 3,000 health care workers — including physicians, nurses and dentists — across the United States. It seeks to understand the effect of discrimination on health care professionals and their patients. In hospitals with a majority of Black patients , 70% of workers reported seeing discrimination against patients because of their race or ethnicity. At facilities with a majority of Latino patients, the rate was 61%. But if the center had a majority of white patients, the percentage dropped to 43%. Nearly half, 48%, believe that medical providers are more tolerant when white patients talk about their cases and make demands than when Black patients do the same. The report notes that racism also extends to how workers themselves are treated. Forty-four percent of these workers say they have observed one of their colleagues being discriminated against. The majority of Black professionals (58%) and more than four in ten Latinos (49%) and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI, 44%) say they have been discriminated against at work because of their race or ethnicity. Although most health care workers see positive efforts by employers to address discrimination, most Black, Latino and AAPI health care workers are concerned about retaliation if they report discrimination problems. The report recommends a number of steps to address discrimination, from creating a system for reporting discrimination anonymously to including training to identify racism in professional development courses. “Understanding what health care workers experience, and what they want and need from their employers and colleagues to take action against discrimination, is critical to successful and sustainable change,” said Laurie Zephyrin, the executive vice president of the Commonwealth Fund’s Advancing Health Equity program and a co-author of the study.

By Skylar Zander PUBLISHED: February 16, 2024 at 1:21 PM EST | UPDATED: February 16, 2024 at 1:25 PM EST We’re all aware that Florida’s population continues to grow rapidly as our state welcomes over 1,000 new residents each day. With this growth comes many challenges, and perhaps the most urgent is the shortage of health care professionals who can meet the needs of this expanding population. Fortunately, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and other state leaders are determined to do something about it. The Senate has already unanimously approved legislation under the banner of “ Live Healthy ,” a transformative package that offers a comprehensive solution to this worrisome problem. By removing regulatory barriers and expanding access to care, this set of proposals will chart a path toward a healthier and more prosperous future for Florida. Skylar Zander is the state director of Americans for Prosperity Florida. (courtesy, Skylar Zander) Once these important measures are enacted into law, Florida will be able to welcome into its health care system experienced physicians who were trained in other countries to help offset our shortage of skilled physicians. Tapping into the talent pool of internationally trained doctors is a necessary and effective move, and by streamlining the process for these qualified professionals to practice here, we can enrich our medical community with diverse expertise and perspectives. Moreover, the Live Healthy initiative features a game-changer by establishing limited licensure for graduate assistant physicians. This will recognize the valuable contributions these health care practitioners can make, while ensuring that they operate under appropriate supervision. Empowering these individuals to work within a structured framework will accelerate their professional growth and significantly contribute to meeting the health care needs of communities across Florida. Another important provision will reduce regulations on autonomous nurse midwives. These dedicated professionals play a crucial role in maternal care, particularly in underserved areas. By loosening unnecessary constraints, Live Healthy will enable them to practice to the full extent of their expertise, expanding access to quality care for expectant mothers and families across Florida. The legislation also includes “hospital at home” services in Medicaid, reflecting a clear commitment to innovative health care delivery. This approach not only ensures patient comfort but also potentially reduces health care costs by providing effective care in familiar and supportive environments. It’s a win-win for patients and the health care system alike. By combining these initiatives and others, the Live Healthy package tackles some of the greatest challenges facing Florida’s health care system, helping to create an environment where health care professionals can thrive and more Floridians can access the care they need and deserve. This isn’t just about policy — it’s about people. It’s about helping a Floridian in need find a skilled physician, a family welcoming a new child getting the support of a skilled nurse midwife, a patient recovering from illness being able to do so in the comfort of their own home, and more. The Senate’s quick and unanimous approval of this Live Healthy legislation reflects a genuine commitment to unlocking the full potential of Florida’s health care workforce, to ensure that no one is left behind in pursuit of a healthier life. Soon, we hope, all Floridians will be able to see enhancements in access to cost-effective health care and an expansion in innovation in workforce, technology and health care delivery.

Here what they mean for you . ,20240216T150000Z,https://kvia.b-cdn.net/2024/02/Medbill5OQW_0-860x613.png,kvia.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Stacker-Science By Stacker Published February 16, 2024 2:20 AM Canva New laws are increasing price transparency in health care. Here’s what they mean for you. A stethoscope sitting on top of a medical bill. Health care is one of the most burdensome expenses saddled on Americans. Half of adults in the U.S. report struggling to afford health care , and about the same portion says a $500 medical expense would push them into debt. A quarter of adults put off getting the care they need because of that financial cost, according to surveys from KFF, the organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. What’s more, being insured often isn’t enough to soften the blow. The majority of people in medical debt today actually have health insurance, medical billing analysts report. Workers and employers have seen their costs for health insurance plans rise significantly since the pandemic began in 2020, a trend that had already been playing out long before. Costs are projected to rise another 6.5% in 2024, according to benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. Rising drug costs, a growing elderly population, pent-up demand post-pandemic, shortages of care workers, and expensive technologies all factor into the increasing expense of health care. A slew of new rules has been signed into law in the last several years to help Americans, as well as the publicly funded Medicare and Medicaid programs, save money on health care expenses. Broadly, the new laws pertain to prescription costs, price negotiations, surprise billing, and cost transparency. These measures have largely been championed by politicians on both sides of the aisle. Care Better analyzed information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and major hospital systems to compile this explanation of what Americans can expect from new health care cost transparency laws. The Trump administration previously enacted rules through executive order requiring hospitals to publicly post the costs of certain services online and another that requires health insurers to share the costs of services covered under their health care plans, which was rolled out in phases under the Biden administration. A study from the University of Minnesota published in 2023 estimated that price transparency rules for health plans alone could lead to “substantial savings,” potentially in the tens of billions of dollars, benefiting consumers, employers, and even insurers. The most recent effort to boost health care transparency is making its way through Congress this winter. It’s H.R. 5378 , nicknamed the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act. The resolution was voted through the House of Representatives in December and now awaits consideration from the Senate. The bill is an amalgamation of many existing draft bills championed by Republican and Democratic Congress members who argue the new resolution will empower consumers to make informed decisions related to their health care, lower drug costs, and end overcharging for services by hospitals. It would build on previous transparency measures enacted prior to the pandemic. Health care executives and for-profit hospitals have been critics of the legislation, arguing the changes to Medicare reimbursements will hurt hospitals, particularly those in rural areas where consumers have few other options for care. Read on to learn more about the changes that could be coming if the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act becomes law. Canva Site-neutral procedures for Medicare Two female health care professionals looking at X-rays. Implementing what are known as “site-neutral” procedures for Medicare is one area that hospital executives have pushed back against in particular. This part of the legislation would make it so that hospitals can’t charge Medicare more for the same procedures and services provided at lower expense to the program by physicians’ offices. A 2021 estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget organization projected that eliminating the cost of the unequal charges at hospitals could save Medicare more than $150 billion by 2030. Canva Spread pricing under Medicaid is out An older African American man holding a bottle of medication in a pharmacy. Spread pricing is a practice where pharmacy benefit managers—some of the most recognizable names being CVS Caremark and OptumRx—charge Medicare or Medicaid more for a drug than it was charged by the pharmacy. Studies have highlighted the potential for the practice to be very profitable for the organizations charged with negotiating drug prices for health plans. The new resolution would ban the practice under Medicaid reimbursement. Canva Hospital price transparency A closeup of a page of a medical bill in a folder. All hospitals would be required to make public the cash and insurance-adjusted costs of at least 300 health care services. It also requires them to provide those prices in a single file that can be read by popular programs so that entrepreneurs might be able to develop shopping services for consumers, promoting healthy competition among health care providers. Studies show that compliance rates for existing rules are low , and hospitals are struggling to get in compliance due to a lack of standardization, according to KFF. Canva Public lab test and imaging pricing An African American female holding a blood sample in a lab. Part of the proposed resolution would require diagnostic labs to publish the cash costs of specific clinical tests as well as the minimum and maximum insurer-negotiated rates under Medicare and Medicaid. Imaging services like MRIs and X-rays would be subject to similar requirements. Canva Additional funding for health care worker training programs Two female young nurses and two young male nurses in a circle listening to the nurse talking to them. The resolution would also add around $5 billion in funding for programs that work to expand the pipeline of professionals going into health care careers. The Health Resources & Services Administration estimates that in regions of the U.S. deemed Health Professional Shortage Areas by the federal government, the public needs nearly 13,000 more primary care practitioners , almost 10,000 dental health care workers, and more than 6,000 mental health practitioners. The shortage of workers isn’t just about making services easier to access; it’s partly responsible for higher health care costs for consumers, studies have found . Canva Extending the ban on pharmacist gag clauses A closeup of hands writing holding a pen and two orange bottles of medication on the table. Private health insurance plans use legal agreements known as “gag clauses” to prevent pharmacists from disclosing when a cheaper drug is available to a patient. The resolution would clarify earlier rules so that the ban on these clauses applies to all private health insurance plans. Canva Health care coverage price transparency A stethoscope sitting on top of health insurance benefits document. Similar to hospital transparency rules, the resolution also builds on previous efforts to require health care plans to be transparent about the rates they charge for in-network and out-of-network services as well as prescription drugs. The price info shared would also have to be posted in an accessible, machine-readable file. Story editing by Ashleigh Graf. Copy editing by Tim Bruns. Photo selection by Ania Antecka.

The survey also found that 44 percent of healthcare workers have witnessed a colleague suffer discrimination based on race or ethnicity. The rate at which healthcare workers witness racism and discrimination at work is most likely underrepresented in the survey. Nearly half of healthcare workers in the United States have seen a patient experience discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, according to a new survey from The Commonwealth Fund. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The 3,000-person survey found that 47 percent of doctors, nurses, dentists, physician assistants and other health workers witnessed a racist incident toward a patient last year. Data show that both intrapersonal and structural racism negatively impact the mental and physical health of millions of people in the United States. Healthcare workers said Black patients were the most likely to be discriminated against because of their race when seeking or receiving care. According to the survey, 55 percent of healthcare workers said Black patients are very or somewhat discriminated against in the healthcare system. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Fifty percent of healthcare workers said the same for Hispanic patients and 41 percent did so for Asian patients. Meanwhile, just 19 percent of workers said white patients are very and or somewhat discriminated against in healthcare. The survey also found that 44 percent of healthcare workers have witnessed discrimination or racism against a colleague. But the number of healthcare workers who witness discrimination against patients or colleagues based on their race or ethnicity is most likely higher than is reflected in the survey. This is because some healthcare workers might struggle to identify subtle expressions of racism or discrimination, according to Senior Vice President of Advancing Health Equity at The Commonwealth Fund Laurie Zephyrin. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Sometimes people may not have the language of seeing discrimination or racism play out and really know what to say it is,” she said. This happened at least once when The Commonwealth Fund conducted the survey, she noted. As part of the survey, the foundation held six focus group interviews with healthcare workers in 2022. When some focus group members said they had not witnessed any discrimination against a patient or a colleague, focus group leaders gave members a series of examples of racism or discriminatory practices. Some of those examples included hearing a patient speak negatively about a provider because of their race or ethnicity or witnessing a patient request a new provider based on their race, Zephyrin said. “When given those examples some of them said ‘oh yeah, I have observed negative comments or abusive behavior,’” she said.

Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Share Save for later Please log in to bookmark this story. Log In Create Free Account Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew have announced more than $633 million in health-care funding. Manitoba and Ottawa announced a deal Thursday to infuse $633 million into the province’s health system, much of which they say will go toward hiring more front-line workers and improving care for seniors. Almost $434 million is through a bilateral agreement to support Manitoba’s three-year plan to improve health care. It’s the seventh such deal to be signed between Ottawa and the provinces and territories. The governments say the funding is to support Manitoba’s goal to hire 400 more doctors, 300 more nurses, 200 paramedics and 100 homecare workers. The provincial and federal governments also say they are also working to remove barriers for internationally trained doctors and health professionals to practise in Manitoba. “One of the things that we’ve learned through the pandemic, through difficult times, is conditions of work dictate conditions of care. And the people who step up to be health-care workers do so because they believe deeply in serving their communities and in helping their fellow citizens,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Winnipeg. “And when they can’t, when the circumstances of their job, or the pressures that are on them or the resources they have access to are interfering with their ability to give their very best to their patients, that’s when they get most frustrated, that’s when they most need our support. “The people of Manitoba deserve a system that is there for them, that they can rely on. That’s what every Canadian deserves.” About $199 million under a separate agreement is to go toward Manitoba’s five-year-plan to bolster home, community and long-term care for seniors. Manitoba’s NDP government was elected last October and one of its main campaign promises was to improve health care and hire more professionals. “It’s time for us to take better care of the people who take care of us,” Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew told the news conference. “And that’s what this partnership with the federal government is all about.” Just over a year ago, Ottawa announced $196 billion in funding over the next 10 years for provinces and territories to improve access to health care — about $46 billion of that new money. That funding includes increases to the federal health transfer and $25 billion for tailored one-on-one agreements targeting specific needs in different jurisdictions over a decade. In exchange, provinces and territories were asked to improve data sharing and measure their progress. Manitoba’s deal follows ones Ottawa inked with British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario and the Northwest Territories. All provinces and territories have agreed to the health accord in principle except for Quebec, which has balked at being accountable to Ottawa for how money is spent. The federal government has also set aside $5.4 billion to improve senior care, and so far Manitoba, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories have signed “aging with dignity” agreements."

THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods All provinces and territories have agreed to the health accord in principle except for Quebec, which has balked at being accountable to Ottawa for how money is spent. The federal government has also set aside $5.4 billion to improve senior care, and so far Manitoba, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories have signed “aging with dignity” agreements.

The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents 18,000 health-care support workers in Manitoba, said in a release that it welcomes the new funding commitments. “Health-care support workers are the pillars of the health-care system, but are often left without much support,” said Gina McKay, president of CUPE Manitoba. “Funding that focuses on recruitment and retention for health-care support workers and others in health care is critical to ensuring quality health services and staff who feel supported.” — with files from Lauren Krugel in Calgary This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 15, 2024.

In Montana, a phlebotomist said fellow health care workers often made ""ignorant comments"" about the hospital's Native American patients. Both of these accounts surfaced in a report this week from the Commonwealth Fund and the African American Research Collaborative, based on interviews with thousands of workers who shared their experiences at hospitals and health facilities under the condition they not be identified in the groups' findings. Researchers surveyed 3,000 health care workers in what authors described as a first-of-its-kind effort to quantify whether employees see discrimination within their workplace. The five categories of health facilities included hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient care such as urgent care centers, mental health and addiction treatment centers and community or school health centers. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Nearly half of health care workers at these facilities witnessed discrimination against patients in their workplace. Younger and Black or Latino health care workers were more likely than their older or white counterparts to say they noticed discrimination against patients. Among the key findings in the survey: 47% of U.S. health care workers said they witnessed discrimination against patients, and 52% said that racism against patients was a major problem. In addition, employees at health facilities with a higher percentage of Black or Latino patients witnessed higher rates of discrimination. At hospitals with a majority of Black patients, 70% of workers said they witnessed discrimination against patients based on their race or ethnicity. For hospitals with mostly Latino patients, that figure was 61%. The report's findings show that discrimination against patients is a problem, said Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, a senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund who co-authored the report. ""It is something that needs to be addressed,"" said Zephyrin. ""It is something that not only affects patients but also affects health care workers. It creates stress."" Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund, co-authored a report that found discrimination against patients and health care facilities. Doctors not involved in the report said the effort to quantify discrimination in health care settings is important. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Yolanda Lawson, a Dallas obstetrics and gynecology specialist, is president of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians. She said the report validates what many physicians and other health care workers know to be true – that discrimination and bias exist in health care settings. ""It's important to quantify it and put it in a more credible format,"" Lawson said. For ""many physicians and health care workers of color, it's not uncommon for us to recognize it or call it out."" Younger workers more likely to spot discrimination The phone and online survey was conducted from March 14 through April 5, 2023. It collected replies from more than two dozen types of health care workers, including doctors, nurses, licensed practical nurses, dentists, medical assistants, dental hygienists, physician assistants, mental health workers and administrators. The survey ""oversampled"" Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander health care workers to ensure a large enough sample size to yield a smaller margin of error, said Henry Fernandez, chief executive officer of African American Research Collaborative and lead author of the report. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Among other findings, the report's authors said the generational divide among health care workers was telling, with 59% of workers younger than 40 facing stress due to discrimination compared with 26% of workers 60 or older. Younger workers were more aware of discrimination or more likely to see signs of it. Zephyrin said discrimination is a ""critical area to address"" to attract and keep workers during a widespread shortage of health care workers. Fernandez said the likelihood that younger workers notice discrimination against patients is ""one thing that really stood out for me."" He described it as a pivotal area to focus on, especially as the health care industry hires and trains young workers to address chronic workforce shortages. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The report suggested several fixes to address discrimination in health care, including training medical staff to spot discrimination and requiring nursing, medical and other health schools to require classes about discrimination. Another proposal: create a method for patients and health care workers to anonymously report discrimination. The report suggested health care systems take on this task to encourage workers and patients to report instances of discrimination and racism while protecting the identity of the person who complains. Hospitals and other facilities also should examine how they treat non-English speakers. Latino health workers said patients who speak languages other than English are not always treated equally, the report said. A lesson in respect Another finding has also resonated for many from the study: Nearly half of the health workers surveyed said their colleagues are more accepting of white patients when they advocated for their care than of Black patients. Overall, 48% of health care workers cited the disparate treatment for patients who advocated for themselves, the report said. Zephyrin said differing treatment for patients who advocate for themselves is concerning. In an ideal setting, patients should be encouraged to ask questions and notify a supervisor when a doctor or nurse isn't responding to their needs, Zephyrin said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But the report suggests that when patients attempt to advocate for themselves, they may be treated differently based on their race. Lawson, the Dallas specialist, said when she was in her third year of medical school, she noticed how some doctors talked over patients and failed to listen to their concerns. As a student, she was with a group of other medical students, young doctors and a teaching physician at a Veterans Administration hospital. Yolanda Lawson, president of the National Medical Association, an organization representing Black physicians, said a report quantifying discrimination at health care facilities is an important step. The doctor instructing the medical students and resident doctors described the medical care at the bedside of an elderly Black veteran. The veteran was confused by what the doctors were discussing, and nobody took the time to explain any of it to him, Lawson recalled. As the group of resident doctors and medical students rounded to the next patient, the man held out his hand for Lawson, the only Black person in the group. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""He asked, 'What did they say?'"" Lawson said. She explained the results of the man's X-Ray and other details of his treatment for multiple chronic conditions. It's a lesson she retained and applied throughout her professional career – and one she relays to young doctors. ""You talk to the patient. You include them in their care,"" Lawson said. ""That's all I really hope for, (that) everyone who interfaces with the health care system is respected.""

Dr. Brian Postl, left, seen in this 2019 file photo, supported the NDP's pledge to reopen three emergency departments during last fall's election campaign. (Tyson Koschik/CBC) Social Sharing A high-profile doctor who endorsed the Manitoba NDP's plan to fix the health-care system during the recent election has been selected to lead the board of directors of a provincial health organization that's occasionally been in the crosshairs of the same party. Dr. Brian Postl will chair Shared Health, the province announced Wednesday in a news release. Postl is the former dean and vice-provost of the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba. He's also served as CEO of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. ""I recognize what an important task we as health-care leaders have ahead of us and am proud to lend my experience to help lead the work of Shared Health in the coming years,"" Postl said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with government to support and improve health-care services for Manitobans."" The mandate letter to Shared Health — an entity created by the former Progressive Conservative government during its overhaul of the health-care system — asks Postl and his board to embrace a ""culture shift that puts patients at the heart of every decision and focuses on solutions over excuses."" Bureaucracy remains a target The letter also hints at future changes to Shared Health's administration by stating that resources should be directed to the front lines ""rather than the excessive health care bureaucracy."" Before last fall's election, Kinew had promised to cut administration at the organization. The NDP has since walked back that pledge, promising to reduce bureaucratic costs in health care but not singling out Shared Health specifically. The health authority's board is also being asked to develop a budget that puts the organization on a ""stronger financial footing,"" in light of ""consistent overspending."" The government recently launched a financial review of the organizations under its purview that are overspending their budgets, particularly in health care. Packed hallways, standing room only at Winnipeg ERs as wait times climb Manitoba's largest hospital moving staff around due to high numbers of sick kids: Shared Health Other commitments in the mandate letter reaffirm some of the NDP's election pledges around health care. The board is being asked to work with front-line health-care workers to reduce wait times, improve patient experiences and support primary and preventative care. They're being asked to add more staffed personal care home beds and to work toward more direct hours of care for seniors. The board will also be tasked with developing metrics that evaluates its progress on these and other goals and publicly reports the results. Other new board members are Roustam Souleymanov and Lois Stewart-Archer from Winnipeg, Stacy Senkbeil of Brandon and Melanie MacKinnon of St. Laurent, Man. Former board chair Brenna Shearer, a previous CEO with Pharmacists Manitoba, is beginning a new three-year term as a board director. The government ended the term of Brenda Martinussen, chief operating officer of Nurse Next Door, a private home-care provider. The Manitoba Health Coalition and a few unions previously called for her removal from the board, saying a private competitor to public home care shouldn't be on the board of an organization governing that system. Manitoba Health Coalition, unions call for removal of Shared Health board member Winnipeg ICU doctor who blasted PCs' health management named adviser to NDP health minister Postl is the second high-profile doctor to be given a plum post after endorsing the NDP during last year's campaign. A month ago, Dr. Eric Jacobsohn was named special adviser to Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara. The anesthesiologist and intensive care physician had been critical of the former PC government and joined several other doctors in endorsing the NDP's health-care platform in the run-up to the Oct. 3 vote.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of America's staggering expenditure, retirement challenges, and global perspectives, you may go to 5 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare . America's Staggering Expenditure, Retirement Challenges, and Global Perspectives According to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker , the United States of America spends a greater amount on healthcare as compared to other high-income nations, underscoring the substantial investment in the healthcare sector relative to its economy. As of 2022, the health expenditures in the US were $12,555 per person, which is a staggering $4,000 higher than any other high-income nation. Despite this considerably higher spending on healthcare, health outcomes in the country seem rather bleak. As Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC ) rightly asserts, healthcare is the single biggest expense that any individual needs to plan for retirement. Even though the country is spending more on you than you might acknowledge, it is the single biggest cost that is going to keep you on your toes in retirement. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TROW )’s Retirement Savings and Spending Study (2022) seems to agree, stating that long-term care services and out-of-pocket health care expenses are the top two spending concerns of retirees. In this regard, the Fidelity Retiree Healthcare Cost Estimate even warns that a typical retired couple can expect an estimated health expenditure of $315,000 as of 2023. This “modest” sum doesn’t include most dental services, over-the-counter medications, and even the cost of long-term care. For the average or potential retiree reading this, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) offers hope. According to them, estimating your healthcare costs in lump sums isn't going to serve any use for budgeting or planning purposes. This is because healthcare expenses aren't incurred as lump sums anyway. Moreover, combining both premiums and out-of-pocket costs can potentially distort financial planning in the process. Therefore, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) indicates that separating premiums from out-of-pocket costs is the right way to go about planning health expenses. Studies aside, the average American in the USA is not able to afford the burgeoning healthcare costs. Due to inflation, many workers in the country are downgrading their health insurance and even delaying medical care as they are losing their confidence in being able to afford the same. Story Continues “Considering the amount of anxiety we see from survey respondents about planning for health care expenses in retirement, plan sponsors should work with their record keepers to ensure the educational resources they offer to take this challenge into account.” Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation further reveals that as of 2021, over 100 million people were living with medical debt. To tackle the future uncertainties that you’re going to face as a retiree, the only good idea, according to the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), is to start now. Another strategy that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) proposes is to consider a Health Savings Account. HSAs allow individuals to put away money tax-free, and it is also withdrawn tax-free provided that it is used for qualified medical expenses. It is one of the top retirement saving tips that financial advisors propose since they help manage both spending and saving, and even have the potential to gradually increase in value over time. While many Americans are following these strategies to make the best use of their money, yet many others are jumping ship and retiring to countries with the most affordable and efficient healthcare. 20 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare Methodology To compile the list of the 20 cheapest places to retire with good healthcare , we have used our list of countries with the most affordable healthcare for US retirees . Countries in the list have been evaluated on healthcare costs, quality of healthcare, and affordability as compared to the US. Next, we used the countries in the list and rounded up some of the best places within these affordable countries. Each country was assigned a score based on their cost of living and the scores were added to the previously generated Insider Monkey scores. Total sums have been arranged in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years ( see the details here ). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders. 20.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here . The stock market recovered in the last quarter of 2023. The market regained all that it lost in the steep decline in 2022. The fund generated 13.21% (13.10% net) compared to 11.15% and 11.53% for the MSCI All Country World Index and MSCI World Index, respectively. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023. Global Equity Strategy featured stocks such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX ) in the fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotechnology company. On February 8, 2024, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock closed at $423.06 per share. One-month return of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) was -2.39%, and its shares gained 42.25% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has a market capitalization of $109.015 billion. Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “Health Care outperformed due to a strong showing by US-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals, even as other holdings in the sector posted weak returns. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) reported positive phase 2 trial data for a drug to address diabetic neuropathic pain. The potential for technological innovation to create shareholder value goes far beyond the effects of Al, of course. For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is building a significant competitive advantage through its unique approach to drug discovery. Unlike most drug developers, which focus on mitigating symptoms of an illness, Vertex seeks to understand and address the causal biology of a disease more fully. This approach has helped the company establish a wide lead in treating cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease that causes mucus buildup in organs such as the lungs. Vertex’s research and treatments have targeted the root cause of CF, which is that a particular protein becomes misfolded and unable to move chloride out of a cell, resulting in an imbalance between salt and water. Its scientists have been able to do this by working with the lung cells of real CF patients, an advantage over using engineered animal cells to simulate the disease-causing mechanism to determine which drug candidate is most promising for humans. Vertex’s latest therapy, approved in 2019, is Trikafta, a combination of three medicines that targets a mutation found in 90% of CF patients. Vertex is now using the same approach to address other illnesses. In 2023, Casgevy, its treatment for sickle cell disease, became the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy to receive regulatory approval. (CRISPR, a technology honored by the Nobel Prize in 2020, allows scientists to make precise changes to parts of the genome, the set of DNA instructions found in a cell.) By correcting the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, Casgevy could offer a one-time therapy to cure approximately 16,000 patients who have the red blood cell disorder-a significant improvement over the usual course of treatment, which is merely to manage symptoms through blood transfusions and pain medicines…” ( Click here to read the full text ) A biotechnologist in a lab wearing an apron and safety glasses, working on a biopharmaceutical process.

Countries across the Gulf are shaping a future where cutting-edge therapies and transformative healthcare solutions are readily accessible. In pursuit of this healthcare excellence, Gulf nations have launched various ambitious initiatives that serve as roadmaps for their transformative journeys. The UAE's ‘We The UAE 2031’ initiative, for example, envisions a healthcare system focused on enhancing the quality of life for residents and achieving the highest levels of future readiness and quality in specialized care. Get exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel Kuwait's 'New Kuwait 2035' emphasizes ‘high-quality healthcare’ as a core pillar of its National Development Plan, and Qatar's National Vision 2030 underlines a physically and mentally healthy population with effective and affordable healthcare services. Full speed ahead on healthcare reach Gulf nations have made substantial progress in achieving the goals outlined out in these initiatives, further solidifying the region’s position as a global hub of healthcare innovation. The UAE stands as a shining example, having invested heavily in research, infrastructure, and talent, that today attracts patients from all over the world, seeking advanced treatments unavailable elsewhere. The construction of 11 new hospitals in Oman, and Bahrain's digital bridge between patients and doctors via platforms like Saleem Telemedicine showcase a concerted effort to modernize healthcare delivery. Qatar, with Sidra Medicine's ambitious newborn genomic screening program, and Kuwait upgrading its healthcare facilities as part of its $104 billion National Development Plan, illustrate the region's commitment to creating a dynamic and inclusive healthcare environment. Such progress is significantly accelerated by several strategic public-private partnerships between governments, private enterprises, and non-profit organizations that are working together to address unmet medical needs, break down barriers to access, and promote equity in healthcare delivery. Build on alliances An example of this is the partnership between Novartis and the Emirates Oncology Society, which targets critical areas in breast cancer diagnosis, management, patient journeys, and local data generation. Similarly, Novartis’s partnership with the Emirates Dermatology Society is helping to raise awareness about Hidradenitis Suppurativa, while also delivering vital insights to support affected patients. Moreover, collaborations with academic institutions, like Novartis' cooperation agreement with Oman’s Sultan Qaboos University, are pivotal in reducing the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases through targeted interventions. Collective efforts such as these have also been key in driving digital health initiatives, leveraging technology and data analytics to enhance healthcare accessibility, efficiency, and improve patient outcomes across the region. Through continued investments, greater collaboration, and a determined focus on innovation, it is clear that the future of the Gulf region’s healthcare sector shines more brightly than ever. We are committed to utilizing our robust pipeline of innovative healthcare solutions to drive impact across various therapeutic areas, including oncology, neuroscience, immunology, and cardiovascular disease. This year will see us continue to invest in these areas, supporting patient and provider communities across the region to enhance patient care and pave the way for a healthier and happier future for all.

https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=897176BC1A1A9-FBB9-2F20-B1F13359C2B37166,,Helping primary care providers support patients,20240208T234500Z,,alberta.ca,English,Canada,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Some parts of this page will not display. JavaScript is not available in this browser or may be turned off. Alberta’s government is pulling out all the stops to stabilize, strengthen and improve Alberta's primary health care system. Part of this commitment includes the Panel Management Support Program, designed to help offset costs for primary care providers to provide comprehensive care as their patient panels grow. The program is part of the Modernizing Alberta’s Primary Health Care System (MAPS) initiative and is an opportunity to provide additional aid to the primary health care sector. In October, the government committed to providing $57 million over three years to support family practitioners in managing their increasing number of patients. The first allocation of $12 million for 2023-24 has been given to the Alberta Medical Association (AMA), which will administer the program. This is in addition to $200 million over two years through the new Canada-Alberta Health Funding Agreement to help stabilize primary health care and improve access to family physicians, which will be available in April. “This funding will help family practitioners manage their growing number of patients and is another way we’re taking action to stabilize and strengthen primary health care. We continue to collaborate with the AMA at various working tables to address challenges facing the system and to do what is necessary to make primary health care the foundation of the entire health care system.” Payments through the program will vary depending on the number of patients on a physician’s panel. Physicians who have a patient panel of more than 500 patients are eligible for a quarterly payment between $1,000 and $2,500. Each provider has the potential to receive up to $10,000 annually. “We appreciate the ongoing discussions with the minister and the funds that are being announced. This and the federal funding will, when paid out, be a down payment to help stabilize physician practices. Immediate stabilization is just the first phase, requiring additional support of practices until they can transition to a new model for funding comprehensive, lifelong care for our patients. We look forward to more details around the timing of the rest of the budget.” Growing and managing a panel of patients in primary care generates costs that are not faced by all practice environments. Recipients are expected to use the money to fund staff, technology and other practice resources to reduce the time, cost and effort spent on administrative tasks involved with providing comprehensive primary care, allowing family practitioners to spend more time with patients. Nurse practitioners will also be eligible to receive this funding once the new funding model for nurse practitioners is finalized in the coming weeks. Quick facts Other recently announced supports for primary health care include: Ongoing base compensation for primary care physicians is expected to be $1.76 billion in the current fiscal year. Committing to create a primary care organization within the refocused provincial health care system to coordinate primary health care services and provide transparent provincial oversight, with the goal of ensuring every Albertan will be attached to a family physician or primary care provider. Investing $40 million over two years to support Primary Care Networks. Investing $12 million for the Community Information Integration and Central Patient Attachment Registry, enabling doctors and their teams to share patient information from their electronic medical record to Alberta Netcare. Committing to implement recommendations from the Modernizing Alberta's Primary Health Care System initiative through a phased approach. Creating a primary health care division within Alberta Health.

Union members, who represent a wide range of specialized health care professionals, responded with frustration to the premier’s recent recruitment trip. AAHP was angered by the “celebratory tone” used to position the trip as a “demonstration of government’s commitment to strengthening” the health care system. Andrew Furey says despite making progress in recruitment and retention of health care professionals, gaps remain and different solutions must be found to address what he calls a complex situation. He says the province is no longer losing health care professionals but is adding “home grown medical professionals” to the local health care system, but certain roles still need to be filled. He says the province has adopted “national leading incentives” to retain Newfoundlanders and Labradorians “we also must look elsewhere to fill the void.” NDP Leader Jim Dinn meanwhile says scouring the world the recruit health care workers is the wrong answer and government must retain the people it already has. Recruitment Results The province says the Dubai trip resulted in 81 offers made to a number of health care professionals including 68 nurses, three radiation technologists, three pharmacy techs, five IT professionals, one cook and one pharmacist. Of the 68 nurses who were offered jobs in this province, 29 have completed the requirement exam for licensure."

We lost our manufacturing capability, and no country can be considered safe or secure unless it has an ecosystem that allows patients to have easy and reliable access to life-saving pharmaceuticals. We used to be a continent that was on the industrialization path, particularly in Nigeria during the 1960s and 1970s. Then, in the 1980s, with the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Policy, things began to change, enterprises began collapsing and departing Nigeria. We transitioned from a manufacturing nation to one those imports almost everything and developed a taste for imported items, including critical medicines. As a result, the event of COVID-19 was a wake-up call for us all. Everyone panicked, developed countries prioritized their country’s needs over everyone else’s. Africa had to wait till everyone was sorted out before receiving diagnostic tools and vaccines. Its position was worsened by weak purchasing power and poor logistics infrastructure. In response to the challenges that Africa and other Low and middle-income countries faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the area of accessing vital vaccines, medications, and healthcare products, the World Health Organization (WHO) took a proactive step. They set up the World Local Production Forum with the aim of formulating effective strategies and fostering collaborative partnerships. The primary goal is to catalyze local production and facilitate technology transfer, empowering these nations to build capabilities that enhance their responsiveness to future pandemics and healthcare challenges. As a novel industry where there is limited expertise in the continent, partnering with global pharmaceutical companies to facilitate technology transfer from them to local manufacturers is very vital, as these technologies can be leveraged to solve neglected disease problems peculiar to Africa. However, despite all these measures being put in place to help with the localization of healthcare in Africa, and to ensure the preparedness and capability of the continent to tackle any future emergency healthcare challenges, there are still some significant hurdles that African healthcare entrepreneurs will have to face. One of which is funding. Firstly, being a continent where capital is expensive, funding to invest in healthcare projects to drive such initiatives is extremely tough to obtain due to exorbitant interest rates on credit facilities. This puts African healthcare entrepreneurs at a disadvantage when compared to peers in the Western world, where lending facilities have lower interest rates. While conversations with multilateral financial institutions to access cost-effective and flexible funding are ongoing, the success of such discussions is not guaranteed as the overall loan amount requested does not align with the lending parameters of the bank. Another obstacle is assuring product quality, stemming from the dearth of skilled and experienced human capital. This necessitates investment in human capacity and skillset to ensure continuity and drive sustainability of such initiatives through training of scientists and researchers to meet industry needs. The third and most critical challenge to resolve in achieving African healthcare self-reliance is ensuring that local production facilities adhere to the standards required by prospective buyers. This is critical because the complexity of manufacturing in Africa necessitates large-scale production to overcome these challenges. Donors are typically the greatest buyers of healthcare products from such manufacturers, but for procurement to occur, these manufacturing facilities must be WHO-prequalified, ensuring the quality of the healthcare products. In recognition of the difficulty of obtaining prequalification approval, a journey that typically takes several years before being granted, and specifically for drug production, the WHO has established its WHO LA, i.e. listing authorities, ensuring that upon a facility being approved by an LA, donors will be assured of the products from these facilities. These are all the measures being put in place to help with the localization of healthcare in Africa and to ensure the preparedness and capability of the continent to tackle any future emergency healthcare challenges. The scheme aimed at enhancing African manufacturing capacity for the production of healthcare products and reducing dependence on global supply chains provides the opportunity for the production of customized solutions for African healthcare needs. However, despite these daunting challenges, I believe that dedicated African healthcare entrepreneurs will capitalise on this to chart a transformative pathway in the African healthcare ecosystem. These are exciting times, and I am hopeful for the future of the African healthcare system.

Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST SINGAPORE: A new not-for-profit private acute hospital model introduced last month can increase options for lower-cost private healthcare to better complement public healthcare, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday (Feb 5). Mr Ong was responding to a parliamentary question filed by Member of Parliament Dr Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) on the existing not-for-profit private acute hospital model in Singapore in comparison to those in other advanced economies, as well as whether additional diversity in acute hospital models will complement the country’s existing care landscape. Dr Tan also asked about the factors that may constrain the viability of entrants to the new industry locally and how these can be mitigated. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Jan 8 that acute hospital bed capacity needs to be increased in both the public and private healthcare sectors amid increasing demand for healthcare services due to Singapore’s ageing population. “The new not-for-profit private acute hospital model is meant to provide more options for Singaporeans who wish to seek care in the private healthcare sector,” MOH said then. The Health Ministry also invited private healthcare operators to participate in an industry consultation for the new model, which will run until April. During parliament on Monday, Mr Ong noted that the public healthcare system is complemented by a private healthcare system, where there is a range of hospitals. “Most are quite high in cost, and you need to … either be able to afford or be well-insured to access them, with little or no wait time,” he said. Mr Ong added that there are a few private hospitals that are lower in cost, such as Mount Alvernia Hospital - Singapore’s only private, not-for-profit hospital. “MOH’s view is that we can increase options for lower-cost private hospitals so that private healthcare better complements public healthcare and we have a more adequate range of options for Singaporeans.” 09:10 Min The Ministry of Health (MOH) is consulting the healthcare industry to establish a next private hospital, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. Replying to an MP’s questions in Parliament on Monday (Feb 5), he said much attention has been given to the proposed not-for-profit feature, but that is not the key feature. Instead, the more important features are serving primarily Singaporeans, stronger governance and cost-effective care. Mr Ong said the Government wants to establish a new private hospital model with these key features to provide a better range of options in the healthcare landscape. MOH believes it can increase the options for lower-cost private hospitals so that private healthcare better complements public healthcare and provides a more adequate range of options for Singaporeans. He said Singapore is better off with a “variegated” system. Mr Ong said MOH has received good responses from professionals and industry. He added that he is sure that it will receive many useful inputs and suggestions on how Singapore can improve and refine its model and “make it a success”. FEATURES OF NEXT PRIVATE HOSPITAL Mr Ong also pointed out that hospitals may run as not-for-profit organisations as it is “more in line” with the institutions’ public health mission, and it helps them access philanthropic funds. “Apart from that, there are no major inherent differences in the way good for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals are run, in terms of quality of care, attention to value-based care, talent recruitment and development,” he said. Noting that MOH is consulting the industry to establish a next private hospital, Mr Ong added that the proposed not-for-profit aspect is “not the key feature”. He said that the “more important features” are that the hospital is required to serve primarily Singaporeans. There will also be stronger governance, whereby the hospital will only have one healthcare license. This means that the hospital operator needs to have strong oversight and control of its doctors’ clinical practices, said Mr Ong. The various professionals in that hospital - specialists, surgeons, general physicians, pharmacists, rehabilitation professionals - will have to work closely as a team to serve patients. For cost-effective care, Mr Ong said: “We intend to impose bill size restrictions on the private hospital as we do not want a high-cost care model.” “We intend to specify all these as conditions that potential hospital operators who are bidding will have to meet and will be evaluated on,” he added. This means that land price “will not be the sole (criterion) in determining the hospital operator”, Mr Ong highlighted. Establishing a new private hospital model with these features provides a better range of options in Singapore’s healthcare landscape, he said. “Today, we have public healthcare which is heavily subsidised by the government, and which we are trying to make as affordable to Singaporeans as possible. “But the nature of subsidised care is that there is a wait time, which can be quite lengthy for non-urgent electives.” Related: Singapore’s public hospital bed crunch: Are radical solutions needed? IN FOCUS: How can Singapore ensure it has enough hospital beds to meet demand? “BETTER OFF” WITH VARIED SYSTEM On Monday, the Health Minister noted a shift in the share between public and private hospital workload, with the ratio moving towards public hospitals. “This is good in a sense that it is a demonstration of the public’s confidence in public hospitals, but it is not so positive because it adds considerable load to the public healthcare system,” Mr Ong said. “We are better off with a variegated system, where residents who are well-insured with private policies, have less need for subsidies, can opt for a lower-cost private hospital care if they wish to.” He added that private hospitals will also bring new insights and ideas to the management and delivery of healthcare, and the additional diversity will enrich and improve the quality of Singapore’s healthcare system. On Dr Tan’s question about constraints on the new model, Mr Ong said: “I prefer not to make any pre-judgements on the constraints or success factors that the member asked for on this new private hospital model.” In a supplementary question, Dr Tan asked why there has not been a second Mount Alvernia Hospital or a similar model in Singapore so far if such models of care are already viable and have an existing market niche. In response, Mr Ong said that Singapore has been expanding its public healthcare and hospitals and that there is a need for manpower, which takes time to develop. “The resource, in terms of manpower and talent … is limited. If we over push this, we can end up having a bidding war of our healthcare professionals and talent, which is why we are always careful as we develop our healthcare capacity.” Having said that, Singapore is developing and building more public hospitals between now and the end of the decade, Mr Ong noted. “But in addition, we think we can, we should be able to accommodate one more, more affordable private hospital,” he added.

A glaring manifestation of this challenge is the insufficient healthcare infrastructure, notably in rural regions. While urban areas tend to have a relatively better distribution of healthcare facilities, rural locales face a stark scarcity. Many villages and remote areas lack even the most basic healthcare centers, posing a significant hurdle for residents seeking medical assistance. Moreover, transportation issues and long distances exacerbate the problem, making it costly and time-consuming for individuals to reach the nearest healthcare facility. Inadequate road infrastructure in some regions further compounds these difficulties, making accessing medical assistance in emergencies nearly impossible. In addition to infrastructure deficiencies, Pakistan grapples with a severe shortage of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and support staff. This scarcity is particularly acute in rural areas, where medical practitioners often prefer urban settings due to better career prospects and living conditions. Consequently, rural communities are left underserved and struggle to access essential healthcare services. The shortage of healthcare professionals also strains urban healthcare systems, where large populations rely on a limited number of medical experts, resulting in long waiting times, reduced quality of care, and sometimes inadequate attention. Financial barriers present significant obstacles to healthcare access in Pakistan. With a high poverty rate and a large population, many cannot afford basic medical services. Private healthcare is often costly, while public facilities, though more affordable, may suffer from resource shortages and long waits. The absence of comprehensive health insurance exacerbates these financial barriers, as individuals and families must bear the full burden of medical expenses, often leading to financial hardship and deterring them from seeking necessary medical care. It’s crucial for policymakers to prioritize healthcare, understanding that health is a non-negotiable aspect of human life. Inadequate healthcare facilities can lead people to rely on unreliable alternatives, such as unlicensed practitioners, highlighting the urgency for government intervention to bolster institutional reputations and ensure equitable access to quality healthcare nationwide.

Steward Health Care is a for-profit health system that serves thousands of patients at nine hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts, mostly in Boston suburbs and in underserved communities. According to recent media reports, state regulators are working to avoid hospital closures, which could lead to long wait times and could overwhelm other area hospitals. Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health experts including John McDonough , Jose Figueroa , and Ray Campbell have been quoted in media outlets about the crisis. In response to reports that Steward representatives are interested in transferring ownership of hospitals, McDonough, professor of the practice of public health, said in a January 19 Boston Globe article that there is concern over further consolidation of the hospital market. “But [the concern] has to be balanced with the other potential of losing all of these facilities, and the impact that would have,” he said. In a January 25 Boston Globe article, Figueroa, assistant professor of health policy and management, noted that underserved communities would be most affected by any hospital closures. “Wealthier people are more readily able to find alternative options to get health care,” he said. “Lower-income populations with less education are more likely to have issues accessing the health care system at baseline. Even in their local area, they are going to be left behind.” He also noted that Steward and other hospitals that serve lower-income communities tend to be less financially stable because they rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements, which pay less than private insurers. McDonough and Campbell, instructor in the Department of Health Policy and Management , both raised questions in a January 25 WBUR article about the role of private, for-profit companies in health care—particularly those backed by private equity. Campbell said that the state should be allowed to see Steward’s corporate financial data—which the company has long kept private—and should improve how for-profit health care facilities are regulated. “Private equity and for-profit investments in health care need to be scrutinized very carefully because the objectives and the dynamics aren’t necessarily the same,” he said. “It’s not clear that what private equity is really good at is what health care needs to be good at.” McDonough concurred. “If there’s a lesson from this, it is that the entire state health system and state government need to be much more wary of all for-profit entrants—particularly of the private equity brand.” Read the January 19 Boston Globe article: Steward Health Care’s financial issues could spell catastrophe for the state Read the January 25 WBUR article: Mass. leaders scramble to plan for potential Steward hospital closures Read the January 25 Boston Globe article: Brockton, other lower-income communities on edge as hospital chain faces financial crisis Photo: iStock/sshepard Related Topics Health Policy Last Updated November 22, 2024 Related News How Lucian Leape inspired a patient safety movement Health Policy October 30, 2025 In the Media Assessing the fallout of MA hospital closures after Steward bankruptcy Health Policy October 28, 2025 In the Media Opinion: Equipping public health students to navigate controversy, uncertainty Health Policy October 22, 2025 Get the latest public health news Stay connected with Harvard Chan School Subscribe to our newsletters Unleash your potential at Harvard Chan School.

White House leaders last fall said they hoped to accelerate portions of the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act — better known as the PACT Act — passed by Congress in 2022 which expanded medical care and benefits eligibility for millions of former service members. In the last 16 months, about 100,000 veterans have enrolled in VA health care thanks to provisions in the legislation, and more than 697,000 have received benefits claims approved. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But several other sections of the law were scheduled to be phased in over coming years, including language extending health care to all veterans stationed in Iraq after August 1990 or in Afghanistan after September 2001, many of whom were exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits. Concern about military toxic exposure injuries remains high among vets Under Secretary for Health Dr. Shereef Elnahal told reporters on Jan. 22 that officials are confident they can handle the influx of new patients now, and so will move ahead with some of those requirements early. The move will make free health care options available to some veterans years sooner than advocates had anticipated. “It’s a substantial number of veterans who will be eligible for VA health care,” Elnahal said. “But as a reminder, we hired more external folks into the VA health care system last fiscal year than we ever had before.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Despite the large number of newly eligible veterans, department planners expect about 21,000 to take advantage of the free health care this year. That’s because many of the newly eligible are already using private health care options through work or family. About 85,000 additional veterans are expected to enroll in VA health care over the next decade as a result of the PACT Act changes. The new eligibility groups include: Veterans who “participated in a toxic exposure risk activity” while on active-duty or active-duty training; Veterans assigned to a duty station in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or the United Arab Emirates after Aug. 2, 1990; Veterans assigned to a duty station in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, or Syria after Sept. 11, 2001; Veterans deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, Operation Inherent Resolve, or Resolute Support Mission. Under the law, the VA Secretary has the authority to expand that list to include additional countries or operations in the future. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The new cohort of veterans will be placed in priority group 6, putting them in line for care ahead of individuals with no service-connected disabilities but still behind veterans with severe injuries and illnesses from their time in the military. Staffing and appointment availability will determine whether the new group of veterans can receive some or all of their health care through VA. The designation will also drop co-pays for most inpatient care and some outpatient medical visits. Officials said veterans will remain in that priority group unless VA determines they are eligible to be moved up into a more advantageous category. Details on the changes will be outlined on the department’s website in early March. About Our Ads"

We lost our manufacturing capability, and no country can be considered safe or secure unless it has an ecosystem that allows patients to have easy and reliable access to life-saving pharmaceuticals. We used to be a continent that was on the industrialization path, particularly in Nigeria during the 1960s and 1970s. Then, in the 1980s, with the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Policy, things began to change, enterprises began collapsing and departing Nigeria. We transitioned from a manufacturing nation to one that imports almost everything and developed a taste for imported items, including critical medicines. As a result, the event of COVID-19 was a wake-up call for us all. Everyone panicked, developed countries prioritized their country’s needs over everyone else’s. Africa had to wait till everyone was sorted out before receiving diagnostic tools and vaccines. Its position was worsened by weak purchasing power and poor logistics infrastructure. In response to the challenges that Africa and other low and middle-income countries faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the area of accessing vital vaccines, medications, and healthcare products, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) took a proactive step. They set up the World Local Production Forum with the aim of formulating effective strategies and fostering collaborative partnerships. The primary goal is to catalyze local production and facilitate technology transfer, empowering these nations to build capabilities that enhance their responsiveness to future pandemics and healthcare challenges. Read Also; Alia: I need prayers to survive landmines by anti-people forces As a novel industry where there is limited expertise in the continent, partnering with global pharmaceutical companies to facilitate technology transfer from them to local manufacturers is very vital, as these technologies can be leveraged to solve neglected disease problems peculiar to Africa. However, despite all these measures being put in place to help with the localization of healthcare in Africa, and to ensure the preparedness and capability of the continent to tackle any future emergency healthcare challenges, there are still some significant hurdles that African healthcare entrepreneurs will have to face. One of them is funding. Firstly, being a continent where capital is expensive, funding to invest in healthcare projects to drive such initiatives is extremely tough to obtain due to exorbitant interest rates on credit facilities. This puts African healthcare entrepreneurs at a disadvantage when compared to peers in the Western world, where lending facilities have lower interest rates. While conversations with multilateral financial institutions to access cost-effective and flexible funding are ongoing, the success of such discussions is not guaranteed as the overall loan amount requested does not align with the lending parameters of the bank. FG reaffirms focus on preventive healthcare with 2025 national health promotion day Health insurance: NHIA seals data, service delivery deals with NBS, SERVICOM Why pharmacists must embrace technology to drive change, by public health experts Another obstacle is assuring product quality, stemming from the dearth of skilled and experienced human capital. This necessitates investment in human capacity and skillset to ensure continuity and drive sustainability of such initiatives through training of scientists and researchers to meet industry needs. The third and most critical challenge to resolve in achieving African healthcare self-reliance is ensuring that local production facilities adhere to the standards required by prospective buyers. This is critical because the complexity of manufacturing in Africa necessitates large-scale production to overcome these challenges. Donors are typically the greatest buyers of healthcare products from such manufacturers, but for procurement to occur, these manufacturing facilities must be WHO-prequalified, ensuring the quality of the healthcare products. In recognition of the difficulty of obtaining prequalification approval, a journey that typically takes several years before being granted, and specifically for drug production, the WHO has established its WHO LA, i.e. listing authorities, ensuring that upon a facility being approved by an LA, donors will be assured of the products from these facilities. These are all the measures being put in place to help with the localization of healthcare in Africa and to ensure the preparedness and capability of the continent to tackle any future emergency healthcare challenges. The scheme aimed at enhancing African manufacturing capacity for the production of healthcare products and reducing dependence on global supply chains provides the opportunity for the production of customized solutions for African healthcare needs. However, despite these daunting challenges, I believe that dedicated African healthcare entrepreneurs will capitalize on this to chart a transformative pathway in the African healthcare ecosystem. These are exciting times, and I am hopeful for the future of the African healthcare system. • Sammy Ogunjimi, Codix Pharma Ltd, Lagos.

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1502152.html,,"Focus on drug price controls , preventive care can curb healthcare inflation",20240131T170000Z,https://www.prokerala.com/news/photos/imgs/450/major-breakthrough-in-bp-diagnosis-could-save-billions-in-healthcare-1676996.jpg,prokerala.com,English,India,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"New Delhi, Jan 31 : While there are several options for taming inflation in healthcare, prioritising prescription drug price control and placing a strong emphasis on preventive care emerge as key solutions, according to a report on Wednesday. Inflation in healthcare refers to the persistent increase in the cost of medical goods and services over time. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of factors, including advancements in medical technology, rising labour costs, pharmaceutical innovations, and the complex interplay of supply and demand within the healthcare market. The report by GlobalData, a data and analytics company, reveals that healthcare professionals (HCPs) believe that enforcing prescription drug price controls and giving greater priority to preventive care stand out as the top two solutions that could effectively mitigate healthcare inflation. Similar results were observed in previous survey waves that were launched to capture the H1 2023 and 2022 outlook. ""Inflation in healthcare often results in increased expenses for medical services, medications, and equipment. This can burden both patients and healthcare providers, potentially limiting access to essential treatments and straining the financial stability of healthcare institutions. Additionally, it may contribute to disparities in healthcare access and quality,"" said Sachin Gharat, Associate Project Manager at GlobalData, in a statement. The 2023 H2 physician survey includes 682 respondents across the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan. In H2 2023, more than half of the surveyed HCPs expressed a preference for incorporating preventive methods into patient care. This inclination toward prevention underscores a growing recognition of its dual benefit: improving health outcomes while simultaneously contributing to a more cost-effective healthcare system. ""Long discussed as a potential cost-control strategy, prioritising preventive care to reduce overall healthcare spending is often cited in conjunction with drug pricing controls. Additionally, efforts aimed at reducing avoidable complications and hospital admissions are seen as integral to alleviating financial strain on the healthcare sector, especially within the constraints of already stretched budgets,"" Gharat said. A majority of respondents, exceeding 50 per cent, believe that controlling the prices of prescription drugs stands out as a pivotal solution. ""Implementing controls over drug prices is a complex endeavour that demands careful balancing. Excessive pricing limits could potentially discourage pharmaceutical companies from investing in innovative research and development, consequently leading to higher drug prices,"" Gharat said. --IANS rvt/vd"

Garland. “As our country was battling the COVID-19 pandemic, this individual was fraudulently billing Medicare for hundreds of millions of dollars. Today, thanks to the work of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, he will now spend 10 years in federal prison for his crimes. We will continue to disrupt schemes that defraud the federal health programs the American people rely on, and we will hold accountable those who perpetrate those schemes.” According to court documents, Imran Shams, 65, of Glendale, was convicted of Medicare and Medicaid fraud in separate 1990 and 2001 cases in New York and California, respectively. After each conviction, he was excluded from participation in Medicare and all federal health care programs, and advised by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) that he had to submit a written application to be considered for reinstatement in federal health care programs. Shams never sought reinstatement, yet he continued to operate health care clinics in New York that billed federal health care programs. In November 2017, Shams pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pay and receive health care kickbacks and other charges in the Eastern District of New York related to his operation of these clinics. By 2018, Shams was an owner, operator, and manager of Matias Clinical Laboratory, doing business as Health Care Providers Laboratory (HCPL), a Baldwin Park, California-based clinical testing laboratory that billed Medicare and other federal health care programs. In order to maintain HCPL’s status as a Medicare provider and enable it to receive payments from Medicare for its testing services, Shams and a co-conspirator fraudulently concealed Shams’ role in HCPL from Medicare, including failing to submit required enrollment documentation identifying Shams’ ownership, management position, and prior convictions; causing the submission of false documentation to Medicare identifying another person as HCPL’s sole owner and managing officer; submitting false documentation concerning HCPL’s ownership and management to the California Department of Public Health; and making false statements to the U.S. Probation Office and Pretrial Services Agency while Shams was on federal court supervision following his 2017 conviction. Between August 2018 and April 2022, when the grand jury returned the indictment in this case and Shams was arrested and ordered detained without bond, HCPL fraudulently billed Medicare approximately $234 million. Medicare paid HCPL approximately $31.7 million based on these fraudulent claims. Shams pleaded guilty in the Central District of California on Jan. 24, 2023, to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and concealment of his exclusion from Medicare. In addition to the term of imprisonment, Shams was ordered to forfeit $31,761,286.21, including $4,513,106.30 in funds that the government previously seized from two bank accounts, as well as his interest in two residential properties and one business property in the Los Angeles area. Shams was also ordered to pay $31,761,286.21 in restitution. “Shams engaged in a years-long scheme in which he billed American taxpayers nearly $234 million and lined his pockets with millions of dollars of funds intended for the health and welfare of patients,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “This case demonstrates the FBI’s commitment to rooting out fraud to help ensure critical healthcare funds go where they are needed most.” “The integrity of the federal health care system rests, in part, on providers’ proper, lawful billing of Medicare and other HHS programs,” said Inspector General Christi A. Grimm of HHS-OIG. “Providers who violate federal health care law and defy measures intended to protect programs and patients from fraud will be held accountable. We remain steadfast and persistent in our efforts to investigate schemes targeting federal health care programs.” The FBI Los Angeles Field Office and HHS-OIG investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Gary A. Winters and Raymond E. Beckering III of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Maxwell Coll for the Central District of California handled the financial penalties. The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s efforts to combat health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program. Since March 2007, this program, currently comprised of nine strike forces operating in 27 federal districts, has charged more than 5,400 defendants who collectively have billed federal health care programs and private insurers more than $27 billion. In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to hold providers accountable for their involvement in health care fraud schemes.

While urban centres face issues such as minimal medical resources, a lack of healthcare workers and a lack of necessary equipment, they still provide decent healthcare services unlike rural communities who face numerous challenges that hinder their access to essential healthcare services. Rural communities in Nigeria encounter formidable barriers on regular basis when it comes to accessing healthcare services. One of the primary challenges is the shortage of healthcare facilities and trained medical professionals in remote areas. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is a significant urban-rural divide in the distribution of healthcare resources in Nigeria, with the majority concentrated in urban centres. Challenges in Rural Healthcare Access Also Read: All set for Editors Conference in Abuja Mbah bags AFRIFF award, vows to restore state as creative hub Photos: Gov. Sanwo-Olu delivers Arewa Think Tank lecture Tinubu, Shettima back NAHCON’s drive for affordable, successful 2026 Hajj, by Shafii Sani Mohammed Sanwo-Olu at Arewa House: We’ll defeat insecurity, others Geographic Barriers: One of the primary obstacles to healthcare access in rural areas is the geographic isolation of these communities. Many rural regions in Nigeria are situated far from urban centres, making it difficult for residents to reach healthcare facilities promptly. Long distances, poor road conditions, and a lack of reliable transportation options have contributed to delays or altogether neglected healthcare seeking behaviours. Shortage of Healthcare Facilities and Personnel: Rural areas frequently deal with a shortage of healthcare facilities and trained medical professionals. Nigeria has a disproportionately low number of healthcare facilities in rural areas compared to urban centres. This shortage not only limits the availability of essential services but also results in prolonged waiting times for medical attention. Financial Constraints: Economic factors also play a significant role in healthcare access, especially in rural communities where poverty rates tend to be higher. The majority of rural residents often struggle to afford healthcare services, medications, and transportation costs to reach medical facilities. Out-of-pocket expenses associated with healthcare often deter individuals from seeking timely medical attention, exacerbating health problems and perpetuating a cycle of poverty. Healthcare Infrastructure Disparities: The disparity in healthcare infrastructure between urban and rural areas is stark. Urban centers have significantly better hospitals and clinics, while many rural healthcare facilities are plagued by dilapidation and a lack of essential medical equipment. The Nigerian government’s National Health Facilities Registry highlights the uneven distribution of healthcare infrastructure, with urban areas having a higher concentration of better equipped facilities. Lack of Skilled Personnel: In addition to inadequate facilities, rural areas face a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The WHO reports that the distribution of healthcare workers in Nigeria is highly skewed as urban areas have a more significant concentration of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers. This scarcity of skilled personnel in rural regions further diminishes the quality of healthcare services available to residents. Power Challenges: Another critical aspect of healthcare infrastructure often overlooked is the lack of reliable electricity in rural regions. Many healthcare facilities in remote areas struggle with power shortages which hinders the functionality of medical equipment and limits the provision of essential healthcare services. Electrification rates in rural areas are considerably lower than in urban centers, exacerbating the healthcare infrastructure divide. Proposed Solutions Investment in Rural Healthcare Infrastructure: Increasing investments in rural healthcare facilities is imperative in order to address the healthcare infrastructure disparities. Building new, well-equipped healthcare centers and upgrading existing ones will improve the availability and quality of healthcare services in remote regions. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with international partners, can allocate funds specifically for rural healthcare infrastructure development. Training and Deployment of Healthcare Professionals: Addressing the shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas requires a comprehensive strategy. Government initiatives and incentives should be implemented to encourage medical professionals to work in underserved communities. Investing in the education and training of local community health workers can also enhance primary healthcare services in rural areas and provide a sustainable solution to the shortage of skilled personnel. Improving Transportation Infrastructure: Efforts to improve healthcare access should also focus on transportation infrastructure. Constructing and maintaining reliable roads in rural areas, as well as implementing affordable and accessible public transportation options, can significantly reduce travel barriers for rural residents seeking medical attention. Financial Support and Health Insurance: The government can establish and promote health insurance programs targeted at low-income individuals in rural areas. These programs can provide financial relief and encourage healthcare utilization by covering medical expenses. Additionally, subsidies for essential medications and preventive healthcare measures can contribute to a healthier rural population. Alternative Energy Solutions: Implementing alternative energy solutions such as solar power is crucial to provide a solution to address power challenges in rural healthcare facilities. The integration of sustainable energy sources can ensure a reliable electricity supply, enabling the consistent operation of medical equipment and improving the overall quality of healthcare services in rural areas. Last line Nigeria’s urban-rural disparities in healthcare accessibility and infrastructure can only be resolved when there is a concerted effort from the government, healthcare organizations, and the international community. By acknowledging the challenges faced by rural communities and implementing comprehensive, sustainable solutions, Nigeria can pave the way for a more equitable healthcare system. Bridging these gaps is not just a matter of social justice but a strategic investment in the nation’s health and development. When stakeholders work collaboratively, the possibility of attaining accessible, quality healthcare for all Nigerians, regardless of their geographic location, can become a reality. Aishat M.

The Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation is one partner in a new health circle that wants to provide better health care to Indigenous people living off-reserve. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC) Social Sharing A new health-care initiative in Renfrew County hopes to make services more accessible and appropriate for Indigenous people living off-reserve. The Ottawa Valley Ontario Health Team, which works to improve health-care delivery in the county northwest of Ottawa, is partnering with the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation to create an Indigenous health advisory group. The Indigenous Health Circle will be made up of Indigenous people with experience in the health-care system, including health-care providers, who will advise institutions how to adapt their practices to better meet Indigenous needs. ""Western medicine and Indigenous ways of knowing are different,"" said Kevin Lamarr, the project lead from Pikwàkanagàn. ""This can hopefully begin the process of integrating Indigenous ways and needs into health care."" It can be particularly difficult, Lamarr said, for Inuit, Métis, and First Nations people living outside of their communities to access services in line with their culture. Cornwall, Ont., hospital hires new Indigenous patient navigator Ceremonial lodge for Indigenous federal workers start of 'something greater' The current health system could adapt to be more inclusive, he said. ""It could be as simple as offering the opportunity for smudge for patients in hospitals, access to holistic forms of healing, some land-based healing or traditional ceremony such as sweats,"" said Lamarr. Kevin Lamarr is the project lead from the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation. (Submitted by Kevin Lamarr) Delivering adequate services in sprawling county can be challenging, said the co-chair of the health team's steering committee. ""When it takes you two hours just to go from one end of the county to the other, it is just hard to organize the services [so that they] exist everywhere,"" said Joanne King. That's only half the battle for Indigenous people who also face systemic barriers to accessing those services, she added. ""There's historical harms that underlie people's memory and knowledge, and those wounds that haven't all been healed,"" King said. King said she believes part of building trust with Indigenous communities will need to include encouraging more young Indigenous people to train for health-care professions. More immediately, she said health-care institutions need to offer culturally appropriate care. Joanne King is the co-chair of the team's steering committee. (Submitted) While Pikwakanagan has worked hard to develop robust health care for people living there, those services need to be available to people living elsewhere, said Peggy Dick, the community's manager of health services. ""We want to work with our partners … to improve health care overall for Indigenous people,"" said Dick, who's worked as a registered nurse for more than 25 years. ""Dealing with racism will be a component in ensuring cultural safety."" Lamarr said he has not experienced this racism himself while accessing care, but has seen it happen elsewhere. He points to Joyce Echaquan's death in a hospital near Montreal shorty after filming hospital staff making derogatory comments as a tragic example. ""That's the stuff that needs to stop,"" he said. ""People need to understand and be aware and have knowledge of that."" 1st step is consultation The first step will be to hold four community feedback sessions where local Indigenous people can share their experiences accessing health care and opinions on what the health circle should prioritize. ""Who's going to know where it's lacking the most but the person who has to experience it?"" Lamarr said. ""The goal is to identify members that can sit on that circle and become the voice of the Indigenous population."" The four sessions are: Jan. 31 at the Renfrew Legion.

https://www.kevinmd.com/2024/01/the-federal-save-act-a-beacon-of-hope-for-health-care-worker-safety.html,,The Federal SAVE Act : a beacon of hope for health care worker safety,20240127T201500Z,https://www.kevinmd.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_663154927-1.jpg,kevinmd.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Share Tweet Share It’s a narrative that has become disturbingly familiar: different health care providers, yet the same traumatic story. Ramon, an idealistic new nurse, was drawn to nursing to make a meaningful impact in the lives of the most vulnerable. But in an instant, his love for nursing changed. After just six months as a nurse, a patient’s son viciously attacked Ramon, enraged over his mother’s COVID-19-related hospitalization. In a blind fury, the son placed Ramon in a chokehold and brandished a fixed-blade knife, threatening deadly consequences unless the hospital immediately released his mother. Fortunately, a police officer who was guarding a nearby prisoner patient happened to witness the incident and intervened, saving Ramon’s life. But the psychological scars of the assault left a deep mark. Haunted by the fear of another attack and unable to reconcile with the trauma, Ramon quit nursing. This incident is just one example of the dangers health care workers face, highlighting a broader, unspoken fear that pervades the profession. Often, it’s not even the act of physical violence but the ever-present threat of physical violence, like the ICU nurse’s op-ed on how the lack of support and absence of basic safety measures drove her from the field entirely. These professionals are serving people who are vulnerable and in need of health care. But at what cost? Workplace violence against health care workers is not a new phenomenon, yet it’s an issue that is increasingly worsening. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals a striking 63 percent increase in injuries from violent attacks on medical professionals between 2011 and 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this surge, with hospital safety directors noting a significant increase in aggression towards staff, primarily attributed to factors like overwhelmed health care systems, short staffing, and longer wait times. According to an analysis by Press Ganey , the second quarter of 2022 alone witnessed an average of over two assaults on nursing personnel every hour in the US—this equates to a staggering 57 daily assaults, 1,739 monthly assaults, and 5,217 quarterly assaults. Under common law, assault constitutes a crime when it involves the intent to threaten, inflict, or attempt to inflict bodily harm on another person. Why wouldn’t the same elements of the law be applied in the health care setting? While hospitals and health care systems should be responsible for creating a safe space for their employees to perform their calling, there is also a substantive need for state and federal legislation to protect health care workers. Some states like Wisconsin and Florida have enacted laws making assault and battery against health care personnel a felony. Other states, such as Montana , believe violence against health care workers needs to be documented by the health care entity and studied before enacting protective laws criminalizing this activity. Although forty states have enacted legislation to increase penalties for workplace violence against health care workers, the absence of a federal law underscores a critical gap in providing uniform protection for health care professionals across the nation. A federal law would ensure consistent standards and protections, regardless of state borders, offering a comprehensive framework to address the varying degrees of legal recourse currently available. Particularly for the ten states lacking specific legislation, a federal mandate would provide much-needed legal protection and serve as a powerful deterrent. Furthermore, federal involvement could bring additional resources for safety improvements, enforcement, and support for victims, including legal and financial aid. Amidst these concerns, the introduction of the bipartisan Safety from Violence for Healthcare Employees (SAVE) Act represents a renewed effort by federal lawmakers to address workplace violence in the health care setting. The SAVE Act would implement more substantial legal penalties for people who knowingly and intentionally assault or intimidate hospital employees. This law is essential to protect our health care workforce, which has been decimated by the extraordinary challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are laws protecting politicians and employees in the postal service and airline industry. It’s time for stronger state and federal laws to be put in place to protect the health care industry’s most precious resource: its people.

(Image Source: ysraarogyasri.ap.gov.in ) Vijayawada: Acting firmly, the Andhra Pradesh government removed from the list of Aarogyasri 39 private hospitals, which had stopped providing healthcare services to people under the YSR Aarogyasri scheme, and served a show-cause notice to them on Friday. Several private hospitals had stopped providing healthcare to patients under the Aarogyasri and Employees’ Health Scheme from Thursday, January 25, on grounds that the state government has not released nearly Rs 1,200 crore due to them since June 2023. They appealed for the immediate release of at least Rs 560 crore of dues, which the government had promised to release last December. Authorities from Dr YSR Aarogyasri Healthcare Trust held parleys with the managements of private hospitals which stopped healthcare service all through Thursday until late into the night to persuade them to resume healthcare and avoid any trouble for patients. Some hospitals changed their mind and started providing healthcare services under the Aarogyasri scheme after getting an assurance that their dues would be settled soon. However, other hospitals did not budge from their stand, claiming that unless their dues were cleared, they would not resume Aarogyasri services. Aarogyasri trust authorities in the interim convinced the state government to release dues of Rs 318 crore on Thursday night itself. When they found that certain hospitals had failed to resume healthcare service, the trust authorities suspended permission given to them to provide healthcare under the Aarogyasri scheme. They called for an explanation from the hospitals and said they would take an appropriate decision based on their answer. Aarogyasri Healthcare Trust chief executive officer D.K. Balaji said, “Only a few hospitals have stopped providing healthcare service to patients under the Aarogyasri scheme. We have released Rs 318 crore last night itself. As some hospitals are still not providing healthcare, we have suspended the permission given to them for treating patients under the Aarogyasri scheme.” The trust authorities maintain that Rs 2,500 crore have been released to hospitals so far under Aarogyasri during the current fiscal. They said district coordinators of the scheme are taking care of patients denied treatment by referring them to other empanelled hospitals or to government medical hospitals. However, private doctors are continuing to express their inability to treat patients under the scheme without their dues getting cleared. They say they are running short of money with 92.3 per cent population of the state availing healthcare from them, with 2,800 procedures permitted under the scheme.

By Bobby Jindal and Heidi Overton Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member Affordability is on the mind of every American in 2024. From groceries to gas, Americans are spending more. Health care is no different, especially for those with costly medical conditions and high deductibles who started back at $0 of their ""deductible met"" on January 1. Health care affordability was recently listed as a top issue for voters in 2024 alongside inflation, with eight in ten and nine in ten wanting presidential candidates to talk about the issues, respectively. In 2023, family health insurance premiums rose to nearly $24,000 —a 7 percent increase from 2022—and one in five adults with insurance reported not obtaining needed health care in the past year due to cost. The country is also spending more overall. Every December, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides national health expenditure data for the prior year. Last month's data showed that in 2022, Americans spent $4.5 trillion —17.3 percent of our GDP—on health care. This was a 4.1 percent increase from 2021 and averaged about $13,500 per person. This year marks the 11-year anniversary of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—a sweeping law now proven to be affordable in name only. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden touted a record 20 million Americans enrolled in ACA marketplaces as a marker of the law's success. What he didn't address was the high cost of health care in America and the amount of government subsidization required to keep up with rising costs. Four out of five Americans enrolled in the individual market are subsidized by the government—increasing from 9.7 million people in 2021 to 14.3 million in 2023 with higher numbers anticipated in 2024. This is largely due to the Biden administration's enhanced premium tax credit subsidies from the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. These subsidies go directly to insurance companies rather than to Americans, and extend far beyond the original safety net population. For example, these laws provide premium tax credits to those with incomes greater than 400 percent of the federal poverty line (above $120,000 for a family of four) paying more than 8.5 percent of their income on premiums. Policy alternatives are desperately needed to address the affordability crisis in health care. Congress should give individuals control of their health care dollars and freedom to choose what works best for them and their families. Federal policymakers should give ACA subsidies directly to patients instead of insurance companies, and increase their portability by allowing individuals to use the subsidies on direct health care spending or any health care coverage approved by their state insurance commissioners. America's leaders should then prioritize five solutions to empower Americans with options to choose more affordable care and use these subsidies and other health care spending more efficiently.

First, policymakers should empower Americans with greater price transparency. Health care is the only good where you find out the prices after you have made the purchase. Price transparency enjoys broad bipartisan support, including across the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. Yet large, entrenched systems oppose price transparency regulations because they don't want you to know they are charging so much more than the competitor down the street for the same service. Price transparency requirements should be codified in federal statute and paired with other reforms, such as ending dishonest billing and implementing site-neutral payments in government programs to ensure patients are informed and empowered to spend their health care dollars more wisely. Second, health savings accounts (HSAs) should be expanded to give patients greater control over their health care dollars and decoupled from high-deductible plans to expand eligibility. Individuals should be allowed to use their HSA dollars to pay for monthly health plan premiums or alternative coverage arrangements. Contribution limits should be raised so these accounts can be utilized for additional savings, such as to help offset costly end-of-life care. HSAs allow patients to direct their health care dollars to best meet their needs. Third, association health plans (AHPs) should be expanded. AHPs are offered by an employer-based association and provide small employers a way to gain access to the same type of insurance as larger companies. After Obamacare took effect, the number of small businesses offering insurance to their employees dropped off from a peak of 59 percent for the smallest-sized employers (three to nine employees) in 2010 to 39 percent in 2023. AHPs empower small businesses and level the playing field with large companies, especially those that offer competitive benefit packages. Fourth, member-based nonprofit organizations, such as the Farm Bureaus, should be able to offer health benefits to members outside of the ACA marketplace mandates. These plans have been authorized in six states—Tennessee, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Indiana, and Iowa—and can be low-cost and high-quality options that give consumers more choices than the one-size-fits-all, top-down Obamacare approach. Fifth, direct patient care can enhance access to trusted doctors. In this model, patients pay a clinical practice directly and receive access to a defined set of services, usually consisting of primary and preventive care. Patients and employers who contract with this model can benefit immensely. One case study found that direct primary care (DPC) was associated with 30 percent lower out-of-pocket costs and 20 percent lower employee premiums. Another case study found a 40 percent reduction in emergency department utilization. Policymakers can allow Medicare and Medicaid to reimburse and contract with DPC providers to ensure more Americans, especially the most vulnerable, can benefit from this innovative care model. Americans need the tools to address health care affordability and gain control over their health care dollars. Ultimately, these solutions will put patients and doctors, not government and insurance bureaucrats, back in charge of health care.

To make the best out of the new technology, health care workers need training, financial incentives have to change, and regulators should step in to provide guardrails. Lacking those steps, AI could remain more hype than reality. AI is everywhere in discussions among business leaders. In fact, it may be virtually the only thing anyone talks about at events like Davos. At one dinner I moderated at Davos this month, which included executives from global tech, health care, and other firms, the group was so engaged we needed to call time to end the conversation. But as dominant as AI is as a conversation topic, its most well-known consumer applications are still rather trivial. For now, generative AI programs such as Dall-E and ChatGPT are perhaps best known for helping college students with their essays, or CEOs like Jane Fraser of Citi with tasks like choosing their next holiday destination . But you can hardly call that a productivity or prosperity revolution. Behind the scenes, though, much more drastic AI applications are brewing, and in no sector more so than health care. Health care slurps up more financial and human resources than any other part of the economy, especially in the U.S., yet its outcomes often remain sub-par, whether because of backlogs, high costs, or a lack of qualified and motivated personnel. At the same time, many processes in health care are ripe for further automation. For these reasons and more, consulting firms such as BCG see health care's AI growth written on the wall: ""AI is projected to grow faster in health care than in any other sector,"" Matthias Tauber, managing director at BCG, told me this week, reflecting on a BCG study that came out this month. He projects AI's growth rate in the sector to 85% per year in the next four years——a market worth $22 billion by the end of 2027. ""This is a pot of gold,"" Tauber said. It won't come as a surprise, then, that health care’s largest companies are ready to roll out their AI applications—not tomorrow, but today. When I spoke to Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, a year ago, he already was bullish on the promise of AI for drug discovery. This year, Roy Jakobs, CEO of health tech company Philips , told me about applications that are ready to be rolled out, most particularly in medical imaging. “AI has a huge potential in imaging,” Jakobs told me, because “more and more patients need an image, and there’s a huge backlog.” In response, Philips developed algorithms that help reschedule patient appointments, improve scan speed and quality, and help diagnose what is visible on the scans. “With less staff, you can treat more patients,” Jakobs told me of the cumulative effect of his company’s AI applications. But the challenge, he said, is mass adoption of those solutions. “You need clinicians to be willing to work in a different way. They need to be retrained,” he said. “There needs to be a financial reward, too, and it needs to be regulated.” All those elements are lacking today, Jakobs lamented. For all the business attention to AI, governments have moved on from health care as the priority in peak COVID times to geopolitics and war. ""We see a retrench,"" he said. ""Governments are spending more on warfare. Priorities have changed.” As a result, AI innovation competes with other priorities, both inside and outside the health care sector. It is another example, I would argue, of how tech can have either a positive or negative impact, or none at all. What really matters is the priorities and policies of the people in charge.

Article Insights Crowell & Moring LLP are most popular: within Insurance, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Accounting and Audit topic(s) On November 1, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the "" 21st Century Cures Act: Establishment of Disincentives for Health Care Providers That Have Committed Information Blocking "" proposed rule (Proposed Rule). Comments are due by January 2, 2024. Overview The Proposed Rule would implement the provision of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) specifying that a health care provider that the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) determines has committed information blocking would be referred to the appropriate agency for appropriate disincentives. In the Proposed Rule, HHS outlines the process for OIG's investigation of a claim of information blocking, which may result in the OIG determining that a health care provider committed information blocking; discusses how OIG would refer the health care provider to an appropriate agency; and sets forth the proposed disincentives that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would apply to health care providers that participate in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program (PI), the Medicare Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) Promoting Interoperability performance category, and the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). This means that the proposed disincentives apply to health care providers that are eligible for those programs but not, for example, pharmacists, pharmacies or laboratories that are actors under the ONC Information Blocking Rule but do not participate in the PI, MIPS or MSSP. Any appeals of the disincentives are only available under existing authorities of the appropriate agencies and are not specifically provided under the Cures Act for the OIG's findings of information blocking. HHS also proposes to publicly post names of actors under the ONC Information Blocking Rule that OIG determines have committed information blocking, including health care providers. Cures Act – Brief Background The Cures Act defines information blocking as a practice that, except as required by law or as is permitted in accordance with the enumerated exceptions in the ONC Information Blocking Rule, is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information. The Cures Act provides that the OIG may investigate claims that ""a health care provider engaged in information blocking"" and any health care provider the OIG determines has committed information blocking shall be referred to the ""appropriate agency"" to be subject to appropriate disincentives using authorities under applicable Federal law. Proposed Rule - Highlights Appropriate Agency HHS proposes to define ""appropriate agency"" to mean a government agency that has established disincentives for health care providers that OIG determines have committed information blocking. HHS proposes to interpret the phrase ""authorities under applicable Federal law"" in the disincentives provision to mean that an appropriate agency may only subject a health care provider to a disincentive established using authorities that could apply to information blocking by a health care provider subject to the authority, such as health care providers participating in a program supported by the authority. HHS also proposes to define the term ""disincentive"" to mean a condition that may be imposed by an appropriate agency on a health care provider that OIG determines has committed information blocking. HHS also outlines the ways ONC, CMS, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the OIG will consult, refer, and coordinate on information blocking claims. Impacted Health Care Providers The Proposed Rule's disincentives would apply to a subset of the individuals and entities meeting the information blocking regulations' definition of health care provider. Specifically, the Proposed Rule would provide disincentives for health care providers that are eligible to participate in the PI Program; the MIPS Promoting Interoperability performance category (previously the EHR Incentive Programs); and the MSSP. HHS acknowledges that the provisions in the proposed rule would not establish disincentives for all health care providers included in the 45 CFR 171.102 definition, including pharmacies, pharmacists and laboratories, and that the information blocking regulations are also applicable to health care providers that are not eligible to participate in these programs. OIG's Investigations and Referrals to Appropriate Agencies The OIG has discretion to choose which information blocking complaints to investigate and thus generally focuses on selecting cases for investigation that are consistent with its enforcement priorities. Similar to the OIG's information blocking enforcement priorities outlined in the OIG Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) Final Rule applicable to certified health IT developers and health information networks/health information exchanges, OIG's priorities for investigations of health care providers would be for information blocking claims that: (i) resulted in, are causing, or have the potential to cause patient harm; (ii) significantly impacted a provider's ability to care for patients; (iii) were of long duration; and (iv) caused financial loss to Federal health care programs, or other government or private entities. During OIG's investigation of information blocking by a health care provider, but prior to making a referral, OIG will coordinate with the appropriate agency to which OIG plans to refer its determination of information blocking. OIG explains that this coordination will ensure that the appropriate agency is aware of a potential referral and that OIG provides the information the agency needs to take appropriate action. OIG's referral to the appropriate agency will explain its determination that a health care provider committed information blocking. As part of the referral, OIG will provide information to explain its determination. Appropriate Agency Action The appropriate agency that imposes a disincentive or disincentives would send a notice (using usual methods of communication for the program or payment system) to the health care provider subject to the disincentive or disincentives. This notice would include: A description of the practice or practices that formed the basis for the determination of information blocking referred by OIG; The basis for the application of the disincentive or disincentives being imposed; The effect of each disincentive; and Any other information necessary for a health care provider to understand how each disincentive will be implemented. HHS clarifies in the Proposed Rule that a health care provider may have the right to administratively appeal a disincentive if the authority used to establish the disincentive provides for such an appeal. However, the Cures Act did not provide similar instruction regarding appeals of disincentives for health care providers established under the Cures Act. Any such right to administratively appeal a disincentive would have to be provided under the authorities used by the Secretary to establish the disincentive through notice and comment rulemaking. For example, in the context of the ACO disincentive, HHS explained that an ACO may be able to appeal the removal or denial of a health care provider from an ACO through the MSSP appeals process. But the underlying information blocking determination made by the OIG would have to be appealed separately. Disincentives The Proposed Rule establishes the following three disincentives for applicable health care providers: Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs ): HHS proposes that a determination of information blocking by an eligible hospital or CAH that OIG refers to CMS would result in the eligible hospital or CAH not being a meaningful electronic health record (EHR) user in an applicable EHR reporting period. An eligible hospital would lose 75 percent of the annual market basket increase, while a CAH subject to the disincentive would have payments reduced to 100 percent of reasonable costs instead of the 101 percent of reasonable costs associated with successful participation. Promoting Interoperability Performance Category of Medicare MIPS : HHS proposes that a determination of information blocking by an eligible clinician would result in the eligible clinician not being a meaningful user of certified EHR technology in a performance period and therefore receiving a zero score in the Promoting Interoperability performance category of the Medicare MIPS, typically a quarter of the total MIPS score. Medicare Shared Savings Program : HHS proposes that a determination of information blocking would result in a health care provider that is an accountable care organization (ACO), ACO participant, or ACO provider/supplier being deemed ineligible to participate as, or in, an ACO for at least one year. Public Posting of Providers That Committed Information Blocking The Proposed Rule also contains a provision proposing that ONC post on its public website information about actors that have committed information blocking. Public posting of providers on ONC's website would include identifying the information blocking practices, actors who committed information blocking, and any settlements of liability, civil money penalties levied, and disincentives administered. OIG states that it also recognizes that an appropriate agency may have other obligations related to the release of information about a participant that is a health care provider in programs under that authority. Thus, HHS proposes that posting of the information about health care providers that have been determined to have committed information blocking and have been subject to a disincentive would be conducted in accordance with existing rights to review information that may be associated with a disincentive. Requests for Comments/Information HHS requests for public comment, including comments on its proposed definition of ""appropriate agency."" HHS also requests information on how agencies can build on the proposals in this rule to establish disincentives for other health care providers, particularly those health care providers not participating in the CMS programs identified in the Proposed Rule. On November 15, ONC held an information session and published presentation slides outlining the statutory background and various provisions of the Information Blocking Disincentives Proposed Rule.

https://mondoweiss.net/2024/01/the-hypocrisy-oath-the-double-standards-of-american-health-institutions-on-gaza/,,The Hypocrisy Oath : The double standards of American health institutions on Gaza,20240124T190000Z,https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/181123_Dair-El-Balah_OD_005-scaled.jpg,mondoweiss.net,English,Israel,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"Editor’s note: The following is an open letter by American healthcare professionals and students protesting the double standards of American health institutions in refusing to condemn the targeting of Palestinian medical facilities and personnel in Gaza. The silence is deafening. As the humanitarian crisis in Palestine rages, the healthcare system crumbles, healthcare professionals continue to be targeted, and medical and health research institutions in America remain devastatingly silent. The refusal of these institutions to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis, the public violation of international humanitarian law, and the deliberate targeting of frontline healthcare workers has been disheartening, to say the least. Those in power continuously disregard the war crimes committed against physicians, many of whom were trained by American medical institutions that choose to remain silent — the ultimate betrayal. In 109 days since October 7, universities across the nation have successfully alienated their Arab, Palestinian, Muslim, and allied communities with their silence and refusal to acknowledge the escalating atrocities inflicted on the Palestinian people. Student voices have been actively stifled as numerous medical and health research institutions continue to refuse to recognize the humanitarian crisis, often citing fears of supposed retaliation. Ethical and moral values preached during medical education were discarded when the genocide committed against Palestinians was brought into context. Within a week following October 7, President Kenneth W. Freeman of Boston University School of Medicine sent an email stating, “We are appalled by and condemn the attack…on the State of Israel.” The Dean of Tufts University felt obliged to state that “the events that have come to light are pure barbarism” shortly after October 7. The UCLA Office of the Chancellor released an email to their students, residents, and faculty explicitly saying that October 7 was “a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly,” and that it “joined UC leadership in condemning this attack.” Yet all of these institutions and others continue to be silent now. Why are our institutions not joining together and condemning the humanitarian catastrophe inflicted on the Palestinian people for the past 109 days? By December 10, WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus confirmed more than 449 attacks on healthcare facilities. According to the United Nations OCHA , as of December 16, 2023, only eight of all 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip remain partially functional due to the Israeli bombardment. The Secretary-General of the United Nations revealed that as of January 15, 2024,152 UN staff members have been killed. On January 15, the vicinity of Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis was destroyed by an air strike while Israeli tanks moved into the surrounding area, endangering the lives of patients and healthcare workers. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that the IOF had surrounded their ambulance headquarters in Khan Younis on January 22, preventing them from reaching injured civilians. Al-Khair Hospital was raided and medical staff were arrested by the IOF, forcing men, women, and children sheltering at both Nasser Medical and Al-Khair Hospitals to evacuate and flee into heavy gunfire. Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor reports that at least 657 healthcare personnel have been targeted, including 301 deaths, while 208 medical facilities have been destroyed, including ambulances, and 115 journalists have been killed. Every day, these numbers grow as the bombs continue to drop. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) has released statements pleading to the world to call for a ceasefire to save innocent civilians and healthcare personnel risking their lives on the front line. Avril Benoit, Executive Director of MSF-USA, stated, “We are also an international movement made up of people from more than 169 nationalities working in more than 70 countries. Many of our staff…have friends, family, and loved ones in Israel, Gaza, or both.” The bombardment of medical facilities has caused a ripple throughout the globe. On November 16, Al-Jazeera reported and confirmed that “Israeli forces [had] launched a full-scale military raid” on Al-Shifa Hospital located in Gaza, destroying precious medical supplies. Within 24 hours, Al-Jazeera posted an update from MSF detailing the military siege on hospitals, including the Khalil Suleiman Hospital in Jenin, and the continuous efforts to block ambulances from reaching respective hospitals by Israeli soldiers. Ironically, following the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, medical institutions have gone quiet, and some have gone further and silenced their members. On November 10, Columbia University suspended the chapters of both Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, a violation of freedom of speech and a shameless response to students amplifying the S.O.S calls of fellow humanitarian workers. President Naydeen González-De Jesús of San Antonio College attempted to force her administration to cancel a Teach-In series for Palestine that students had planned for October 24. The Vice President turned away almost 200 people on the day of the event as they claimed the title, “Teach-In for Palestine,” caused discomfort among some students. They disregarded the rights of their Arab, Muslim, and Jewish communities by violating their expressive activities policy. On November 10, Dean Raymond Curry and Dean Kathleen Kashima of The University of Illinois College of Medicine permanently shut down several Slack channels that had served as messaging platforms that students used to raise awareness about the ongoing genocide in Palestine — a blatant violation of student rights. On December 1, NYU’s Faculty for Justice in Palestine were forced to relocate their teach-in event off-campus after the Students Supporting Israel organization started a smear campaign against the event and were threatened with disciplinary action by NYU Campus of Safety and University Life. It’s clear that censorship remains deeply ingrained in American institutions. The profound hypocrisy is not only embedded in healthcare institutions but also within the very foundation of American medicine itself. In April of 2022, former President Dr. Gerald Harmon of the American Medical Association (AMA) responded to the Ukraine-Russia war, stating that the AMA is calling for “an immediate ceasefire and an end to all attacks on health care workers and facilities” and that “targeting civilians and health care is unconscionable.” Yet, when it came to Palestinian civilians, the unconscionable became justifiable. In March of 2022 the AMA Foundation granted $100,000 to the International Medical Corps and Heart to Heart International to “support their efforts in addressing the humanitarian crisis for citizens in Ukraine.” The AMA joined its physicians in providing support and aid for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and publicly acknowledged the inhumanity of targeting healthcare facilities. Where is that recognition, unity, and support now? In terms of the genocide in Gaza, it is disappointing to see that this medical support is conditional. Recently, on November 7, the AMA shut down its own members’ call for a ceasefire, which would halt attacks against hospitals and healthcare personnel. With hospitals running out of fuel, medicine, and electricity, physicians in besieged facilities in Gaza have had to resort to performing surgeries and amputations, most often on children, by phone lights, and without anesthesia. Regardless, AMA’s House of Delegates speaker denied delegates their full 90 seconds to speak about the resolution. This is a blatant attempt to silence those who carry the values upon which the so-called AMA is founded. This is a mockery of democracy and a refusal of some of the most influential physicians in the world to uphold the fundamental duty of protecting and valuing human life. Health personnel in Palestinian-occupied regions hail from all across the globe. Why is their location a death sentence? In the end, students and healthcare workers alike are left to wonder what makes their lives worth so much less when their health institutions refuse to acknowledge a humanitarian crisis while the rest of the world is shouting and pleading. What makes their opinions less powerful? What makes them less human? What happened to primum non nocere — first do no harm? When did calling for a ceasefire become controversial? Are we so passive that we’d rather take the path of least resistance? The leaders of our medical and health research institutions do not represent their communities. Through their actions, these leaders fail to uphold the Hippocratic Oath’s sworn values. Healthcare is an unconditional human right . It’s time our leaders are held accountable for their roles in sustaining the preventable massacres inflicted upon innocent lives. It’s time for the leaders to follow the masses, who overwhelmingly support unconditional human rights and an immediate and permanent ceasefire. On behalf of healthcare students across the nation, on behalf of healers on the frontline, on behalf of the innocent people seeking refuge in healing hands — we are calling for a permanent ceasefire now.

The whiteness of these spaces, attempting to reinforce the necessary notions of sterility and cleanliness, may also evoke a sense of discomfort and anxiety for patients and their families. The importance of humanizing hospital, clinic, and office projects is an increasingly discussed and relevant topic in healthcare, extending far beyond the aesthetics of these buildings.

The provider enrollment team is responsible for this achievement which comes five years after the company's inception. Healthcare is notoriously complicated. Due to prior authorizations and a lack of price transparency, patients can face long wait times and surprise bills. Healthcare providers often struggle with the large administrative burden placed on their organizations, and do not have the staff, or time, to keep up. Enrolling providers allows careviso to compliantly absolve healthcare practices and institutions of their administrative burden. By processing prior authorizations and providing price transparency, careviso gives time back to practice staff, allowing them to focus on treating their patients. Breaking Down the Numbers Looking further into the 200,000 plus providers in careviso's network, over 25,000 are OB/GYNs, making up 78% of all OB/GYNs in the country. Additionally, careviso has enrolled 29% of all oncologists in the US. In the past year alone, the team enrolled over 71,000 providers, making 2023 the company's most successful enrollment year to date. One of careviso's cornerstones is their ability to enroll and work with and on behalf of the nation's leading medical healthcare institutions. On top of the provider enrollment team's commitment and enthusiasm, is their dedication to the compliance and security required to become a 3 rd party solution provider, as outlined by the Office of Inspector General (OIG). This was a key factor in enrolling over 200 leading healthcare institutions in the careviso network. Changing the Industry by Supporting Providers ""careviso takes over the [prior authorization] process for us, and it saves us lot of clinic-based time and resources so that our counselors can spend more time doing what we should be doing: our clinical work and seeing patients and less time doing the paperwork,"" expressed a member of an institution that has been enrolled with careviso since 2018. Looking to ease the burden on healthcare providers and healthcare service providers, careviso offers a unique technology solution for healthcare service providers that streamline healthcare's outdated and inefficient workflows. The single platform, seeQer, produces prior authorization requirements, patient pricing, benefit eligibility and verification, and also processes the prior authorization, if needed, for each case. With industry-leading technology, experience, and insights, careviso aims to change the healthcare industry for the better, while keeping the patient front and center.

Story Continues Diversified Healthcare Trust's Dividend Analysis The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, Diversified Healthcare Trust's dividend payout ratio is 0.00. Diversified Healthcare Trust's profitability rank , offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Diversified Healthcare Trust's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-09-30, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 7 years out of past 10 years. Growth Metrics: The Future Outlook To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Diversified Healthcare Trust's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Diversified Healthcare Trust's revenue per share , combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate , indicates a strong revenue model.

The majority of private healthcare employers (85%) are struggling to attract and retain staff, leading to a growing reliance on agency and overseas workers. Excel Recruitment's Healthcare Salary Guide 2024 tracks salaries and trends across the healthcare sector. It reveals that many healthcare providers are offering sign-on bonuses of up to €5,000 in a bid to secure staff, particularly from overseas. The private healthcare sector is ""extremely reliant"" on immigrants. ""We wouldn't be able to function without them,"" Shane McLave, MD of Excel Recruitment, told Morning Ireland. He said Ireland's reputation as a good place to work in health care has been hurt by protests opposing the accommodation of people seeking international protection here. ""I think our reputation in Ireland has been tarnished by protests and the rhetoric that's out there."" Mr McLave also told the programme that the Government needs to look at ways to support the private healthcare system, which he said props up the public system. He said private healthcare regularly loses workers to the public system.

Manage Preferences ""There needs to be an urgent rethink around the costs facing healthcare employers – and how the Government can support them to provide the remuneration and incentives that will attract and retain the staff that are necessary to provide a quality and safe healthcare system in Ireland,"" Mr McLave said. ""By 2035, Ireland's population is projected to reach 5.4 million, with a 50% increase in the elderly demographic. If the Government healthcare system already can't cope with the demands of the population today, how will it do so when confronted by the challenges posed by the aging population of 2035?"" While the pay rates of junior and entry-level workers have risen by as much as 17%, the salaries of many experienced and senior healthcare staff have often remained static or only slightly increased. The recent increases in the national minimum wage have had a knock-on effect on pay rates across the sector with many junior healthcare staff being paid more than this time last year, while the pay rates of more experienced or senior staff have not moved. In response to staffing challenges, organisations are exploring various strategies, including offering competitive benefits such as pension options, sick leave, extra holidays, and sign-on bonuses of up to €5,000. The Irish housing crisis has become a significant concern for employers and many healthcare providers, particularly outside of Dublin, are offering accommodation to attract professionals from different regions, both within and outside Ireland. This in turn has added to the already significant costs they are facing."" The average hourly rate for a kitchen porter working in a healthcare catering setting is up 17% on last year, from €11.80 to €13.80. The average hourly rate of a cleaner working in healthcare is up 12.5% on last year - from €12 in 2023 to €13.50 today. Most healthcare assistants have seen increases in pay rates of 10% or more. By comparison, pay rates for a wide range of professional, managerial and senior staff have remained static over the last year including for roles such as head chef, care manager, social care worker, speech and language therapist and occupational health therapist. ""Healthcare candidates are now emphasising the importance of flexibility, recognising that a one-size-fits-all approach is impractical and more needs to be done for a better work-life balance,"" Mr McLave said. ""To enhance long-term retention, organisations must embrace flexibility without compromising safety or patient care. Innovative tools like shift-swapping systems can facilitate this flexibility while addressing staffing gaps. ""The rise of contract work, with fixed-term contracts ranging from three to 12 months, has provided healthcare professionals with the desired flexibility. These contracts often include accommodation, and there has been an increase in retention and sign-on bonuses, along with improved benefits mirroring public packages in private facilities."" He said the healthcare workforce has shown a growing interest in agency work due to greater flexibility in work-life balance and the ability to work across a broad spectrum of healthcare facilities. Over the past few years, the healthcare sector has faced significant challenges, including the impact of Covid-19, Brexit, and increased inward immigration. These factors have created hurdles for private healthcare operators in delivering services effectively. The low unemployment rate in Ireland, and an increasing cost of living, has led to intense pressure on the labour market. Looking ahead, staffing and recruitment pose significant challenges in the healthcare sector, with factors like mandatory sick pay, pension scheme changes, an additional bank holiday, and a minimum wage increase contributing to rising costs.

It could be coming to the state of Maine, courtesy of legislation currently under consideration. Advertisement Under the so-called "" Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Health Care ,” HP 1114, the rights of parents who oppose butchering their children are completely stripped away. According to the bill summary, if passed into law, Maine would refuse to enforce an out-of-state order removing a child from a parent or guardian — but only if that parent or guardian is allowing that child to be chemically castrated or have their genitals mutilated. It would also deny the ability of the courts to allow another state jurisdiction over such a case when doing so ""limits the ability of a parent to obtain gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care for a child and the provision of that care is at issue in the case before the court."" It gets worse. The bill authorizes a court to take temporary jurisdiction because a child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care. The bill prohibits a court from considering the taking or retention of a child from a person who has legal custody of the child if the taking or retention was for obtaining gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care for the child. So this bill means that the state can take custody of a child if that child’s parents oppose him or her getting so-called “gender-affirming care"" or would favor the parent who supports it while the parent who opposes their child getting butchered would have no rights at all. Advertisement Related: Expert Warns the Transgender Medical Industry Harms Children The bill would prohibit health care practitioners, health care facilities, and state-designated health information exchanges from disclosing medical information related to individuals or entities allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care or mental health care in response to criminal or civil actions, including foreign subpoenas based on another state's law authorizing actions against those allowing a child to receive “gender-affirming care.” And law enforcement agencies would be prohibited from arresting or extraditing an individual based on an out-of-state arrest warrant if that person is allowing a child to receive ""gender-affirming care."" This bill is a horrifying violation of parental rights and a shocking violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as parents who oppose all this transgender nonsense are completely stripped of their rights in favor of the state or a parent who supports butchering their child. Will it pass? Most likely. Democrats control the Maine House, Senate, and governorship. Last year, a bill allowing minors as young as 16 years old to receive hormones and transition procedures without parental consent was passed and signed into law .

WASHINGTON , Jan. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ID.me, the market-leading secure digital identity network, has joined forces with OtisHealth, a leading player in the healthcare technology space, and two TEFCA Qualified Healthcare Information Networks to revolutionize how individuals access and manage their healthcare information. The partnership showcases the first-ever successful patient healthcare records request that places consumers at the center of their healthcare journey. Continue Reading ID.me and OtisHealth Introduce Patient Application Revolutionizing Access to Personal Health Information The application allows users to securely log in to the OtisHealth app, verifying their identity with ID.me and granting consent to access their clinical records. Through a single request, known as Individual Access Services (IAS), individuals can seamlessly retrieve, review, and share their healthcare records across all providers. Granting patients direct access to their own health data through secure digital authentication and data exchange is a significant milestone in healthcare. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) is a framework for patient directed access to healthcare data established by the 21st Century Cures Act. ID.me, in a longstanding partnership with OtisHealth, holds the distinction of being the first credential service provider to operationalize the TEFCA framework, granting patients democratic access to their healthcare data. Once a patient logs into the application, ID.me transmits a TEFCA-approved token to a QHIN (qualified health information network, an interoperability platform with authorized access to patient data). The QHIN recognizes the patient's identity and consent to request and transfer healthcare records back to OtisHealth, ensuring a smooth and trustworthy experience for users. ""History has been made with OtisHealth's success in processing the first patient direct request for their [personal health] records on the newly established TEFCA national network,"" said Marc Mar-Yohana , CEO of OtisHealth. ""This milestone is a big step in making healthcare more accessible and secure for all."" ID.me has been a member of the CARIN Alliance since 2018. The CARIN Alliance is a multi-sector, public-private partnership that is focused on getting consumers more digital access to their health care data. ""The foundation of this consumer-directed exchange was a digital credential that the CARIN Alliance has been promoting since 2017,"" said Ryan Howells , head of CARIN Alliance. ""The reality is now patients can use a single ID-proofed digital credential across a national network to access their health information. Our collective dream has become a reality!"" This historic accomplishment underscores the commitment of OtisHealth, ID.me, the CARIN Alliance, and their digital health collaborators to pioneering advancements in healthcare interoperability, ushering in a new era of patient-driven data access and control. ""Healthcare interoperability is not possible without a verified digital identity and authorized consent, two bedrock principles of ID.me. With over 50M American adults who have verified their identities with ID.me at federal and state agencies, we're truly honored to simplify and secure access to healthcare data for all,"" said Blake Hall , Founder and CEO of ID.me. To learn more, check out the ViVE Conference on February 25-28, 2024 . ID.me and OtisHealth executives will be in the InterOp pavilion presenting how this historic first was accomplished. About ID.me ID.me is the next-generation digital identity network that simplifies how individuals securely prove their identity online.

HCQAA, which created the Office of Health Care Affordability (“OHCA”), requires “health care entities” to provide written notice of certain “material change transactions” to OHCA. (Cal. Health & Safety Code § 127500 et seq.) OHCA may then conduct a cost and market impact review (“CMIR”), with the overarching goal of combatting rising health care costs and promoting market competition among health care entities. HCQAA specifically directs OHCA to adopt emergency regulations necessary to conduct CMIRs. After several rounds of soliciting public feedback and publishing draft regulations, OHCA adopted the Final Regulations on November 28, 2023. California’s Office of Administrative Law (“OAL”) approved the Final Regulations on December 18, 2023, with an immediate effective date. The Final Regulations will remain in effect for five years, while OHCA works to establish permanent regulations to take effect thereafter. A summary of the Final Regulations is provided below. Health care entities who are parties to transactions closing on or after April 1, 2024, should review the Final Regulations in detail to ensure an understanding of their obligations. Notice Requirements HCQAA requires that a “ health care entity” provide OHCA with written notice of “agreements or transactions that will occur on or after April 1, 2024” and that either (1) “Sell, transfer, lease, exchange, option, encumber, convey, or otherwise dispose of a material amount of its assets to one or more entities”; or (2) “Transfer control, responsibility, or governance of a material amount of the assets or operations of the health care entity to one or more entities.” (Cal. Health & Safety §127507, subd. (g).) The obligation to report a transaction is based on two factors: (1) whether a party is a qualifying “health care entity” meeting certain threshold criteria; and (2) whether the transaction itself constitutes a “material change transaction.” The Final Regulations clarify both the type of health care entities as well as the types of transactions that are subject to notice obligations. “Health Care Entity” The Final Regulations expand HCQAA’s definition of a “health care entity” to include pharmacy benefit managers. Also included are “parents, affiliates, or subsidiaries” that act in California on behalf of a payer and either (1) control, govern or are financially responsible for the health care entity or are subject to the control, governance, or financial control of the health care entity; or (2) in the case of a subsidiary, are a subsidiary acting on behalf of another subsidiary. (22 CCR § 97431, subd. (b).) These entities are included as qualifying health care entities because when they engage in covered transactions, they are “just as likely in OHCA’s view to affect affordability, access, and equity.” ( Finding of Emergency and Notice of Proposed Emergency Regulations , OHCA, 11/2023.) The definition reaching related entities also helps ensure OHCA can review material change transactions in which a health care entity uses affiliated entities, which may not appear to be health care entities in themselves, in order to complete a transaction and otherwise avoid compliance with the notice filing requirements. ( Ibid .) Specifically excluded from the definition of a “health care entity” are physician organizations with less than 25 physicians, unless the organization is determined to be a high-cost outlier under HCQAA. Notably, a qualifying health care entity, entering into a “material change transaction” with a non-qualifying physician organization, is still required to report the transaction to OHCA. Each qualifying health care entity must file its own written notice for a covered transaction; if multiple health care entities to a transaction meet the qualifying requirements, multiple notices should be filed with OHCA. Threshold Requirements A “health care entity” must also meet certain threshold requirements in order to be subject to written notice obligations: Annual revenue of at least $25 million or control of at least $25 million in California assets; Annual revenue of at least $10 million or control of at least $10 million in California assets and party to a transaction with any health care entity with at least $25 million in revenue or California assets; or Located in a designated mental health or primary care health professional shortage area in California. (22 CCR § 97435, subd. (b).) The Final Regulations define “revenue” as the “total average annual California-derived revenue received for all health care services by the submitter and all affiliates over the three most recent fiscal years.” (22 CCR 97435, subd. (d).) OHCA limited the term specifically to California-derived revenue, because it is focused on impacts within the state, rather than nationally, and it chose to encompass the “three most recent fiscal years” to account for external factors impacting the entity, such as a global pandemic or recession. ( Finding of Emergency and Notice of Proposed Emergency Regulations , OHCA, 11/2023.) ""Material Change Transaction” Once a health care entity has determined it meets any of the thresholds outlined above, it must evaluate whether the transaction, to which it is a party, is considered a “material change transaction” subject to notice obligations. Specifically, a “material change transaction” must meet one or more of eight circumstances: The proposed fair market value of the transaction is $25 million or more and concerns the provision of health care services; The transaction will “more likely than not” increase annual California-derived revenue of a health care entity to the transaction by either $10 million or more or 20% of annual California-derived revenue; The transaction involves the sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition of 25% or more of the total California assets of the submitter(s); The transaction involves the transfer of control or governance, in whole or in part, of the submitter; The transaction will result in an entity contracting with payers on behalf of consolidated or combined providers and is “more likely than not” to increase the annual California-derived revenue of any providers in the transaction by at least $10 million or more or by 20% or more of annual California-derived revenue; The transaction involves the formation of a new health care entity, affiliation, partnership, joint venture, or parent corporation for the provision of health care services in California that is projected to have at least $25 million in California-derived annual revenue, or the transfer of control of California assets related to the provision of health care services valued at $25 million or more; The transaction is part of a series of related transactions for the same or related health care services occurring over the past 10 years involving the same or affiliated health care entities; or The transaction involves the acquisition of a health care entity by another entity and the acquiring entity has consummated a similar transaction in the last 10 years with an entity that provides the same or related health care services. If a health care entity meets the required thresholds and the transaction meets a materiality circumstance, then the entity must provide written notice to OHCA 90 days prior to the transaction’s closing. Note that the Final Regulations apply only to transactions expected to close on or after April 1, 2024. (22 CCR § 97435.) Filing of Written Notice A qualifying health care entity must file written notice of a material change transaction under penalty of perjury and submit the notice through OHCA’s online portal. The filing entity (the “submitter”) must indicate which threshold and materiality circumstances have been met and provide a range of general information and documentation about the entity’s business and the transaction. (22 CCR § 97438, subds. (b), (c).) All submitted information will be publicly posted on OHCA’s website and treated as public record. Submitters have the option to request confidential treatment of information and documents, subject to the OHCA’s approval. ( Id ., subd. (d).) Notice is deemed complete once all information is submitted by each party to the transaction who is deemed a qualifying “health care entity.” Then, OHCA will determine whether or not to conduct a Cost and Market Impact Review (“CMIR”) of the transaction. OHCA will make the determination based upon “any” one of nine factors, all of which contemplate whether the transaction may have a negative impact on the availability or accessibility of health care services, costs, or lessen competition or create a monopoly. ( Id ., § 97441, subd. (a).) The submitters of the notice may also collectively request a CMIR. ( Id ., subd. (b).) Timeline for OHCA Review Process OHCA may elect not to conduct a CMIR, in which case it will provide a written waiver within 45 days. If all parties to a transaction receive a waiver, the transaction may close without a CMIR. If, however, OHCA chooses to conduct a CMIR, it will provide notice of that decision within 60 days. ( Id ., § 97440, subd. (a).) The CMIR should be completed within 90 days of OHCA’s determination to conduct a review. However, the Final Regulations include several provisions allowing for an extension of this time, including a discretionary 30-day extension if needed by OHCA “to complete its review,” and tolling of the 90-day time frame while awaiting additional documentation or information. ( Id ., § 97442.) The CMIR will examine specific factors relating to the health care entity’s business and its market position, including the transaction’s effect on the availability, quality, and cost of health care services and the effect on competition, as well as “[a]ny other factors” that OHCA determines to be in the “public interest”. ( Id ., § 97442, subd. (b).) After completing the CMIR, OHCA will then issue a preliminary report with its findings. The parties to the transaction, and the public, will have 10 business days to submit written comments in response. ( Id ., subd. (c).) Within 15 days after close of the comment period, or longer if OHCA determines there is “good cause” for an extension of this time, OHCA will issue a final report. ( Id ., subd. (d).) After issuance of a final report, the transaction may not close for an additional 60 days. (Cal. Health & Safety Code § 127507.2(a)(3)(A).) Conclusion Health care entities that are unsure whether they must file a notice under the Final Regulations may contact OHCA at CMIR@hcai.ca.gov . Covered “material change transactions” involving qualifying health care entities may not proceed to closing without either a waiver of the CMIR requirement or completion of the review process. OHCA began accepting notices on January 1, 2024, for transactions expected to close on or after April 1, 2024. Health care entities should review the Final Regulations, available on the California Department of Health Care Access and Information’s website Laws & Regulations - HCAI , and consult legal counsel if necessary to ensure understanding and compliance.

While the world was brought to a standstill, hospitals and health care systems entered unchartered territory and quickly adapted to the evolving health crisis to care for their community and keep potentially sick patients and health care workers from spreading the virus. The magnitude of response involved the reinforced universal masking of health care workers and patients at the hospital and regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of all health care workers and patients upon admission, regardless of symptoms, and strict isolation protocols for those infected with the virus. Approximately four years after the pandemic was declared, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine used high end technology and an innovative approach to evaluate the effectiveness of those prevention measures implemented in the health care setting during the last three waves of the pandemic. The study, published in the January 16, 2024, online edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases , was a first of its kind to use information from electronic health and contact tracing records to closely analyze the genetic makeup of the virus combined with the comparison of how the diverse strains were physically being spread among patients and health care workers in the hospital. Researchers found that the implemented infection prevention parameters in the health care setting, including ventilation standards of at least five clean air changes per hour, combined with universal masking, prevented most SARS-CoV-2 transmissions. In patients who tested positive for the virus, personal protective equipment (PPE) shielded and virtually eliminated health care associated transmission. “When the pandemic started, it was scary because initially we did not have rapid diagnostic nor treatments available, and we did not fully understand how the virus was transmitted or if our infection prevention protocols were adequate,” said Francesca Torriani, MD, senior author of the study, and program director of Infection Prevention and infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health. “Therefore, the potential implications of the virus and the welfare of our workforce and patients was an utmost concern. I witnessed health care workers fearful of contracting the virus at work and potentially infecting their loved ones at home.” Torriani adds that limiting the spread of infection and blocking the virus at the source became the highest priority. “In response to the progressing pandemic and with the trust and support from executive leadership at UC San Diego Health, we learned many life-saving lessons and strengthened infection prevention control measures to reduce the risk of transmission between patients and health care workers. The swift adoption and modification of infection prevention protocols in health care were felt to be an opportunity for deeper exploration of the effectiveness of our procedures.” The researchers took an innovative approach never used before to evaluate the different variants of the samples to identify if they were temporarily or physically near one another, suggesting health care transmission. Electronic health record data of patients, whose identities were protected throughout the study, and metadata about staff access and movement to these records, accompanied by a robust contact tracing program, were used to classify, isolate and assess individuals exposed to specific strains of the virus. “While the virus strains were very distinguishable in the second and third wave of the pandemic, during the explosive and homogenous Omicron wave, we found that we could not rely on genetic data alone,” said Christopher Longhurst, MD, co-author of the study, executive director of Jacobs Center for Health Innovation, and chief medical officer and chief digital officer at UC San Diego Health. “We had to dive deeper into the electronic documentation and social network analysis, such as individuals with similar virus strains, and considering their physical interaction in the hospital, to determine what really happened and how the virus was being spread.” Researchers examined the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 during three consecutive waves and compared how closely a person’s genetic variant was related to another’s. The study involved the collection of 12,933 virus samples from 35,666 patients and health care professionals from November 1, 2020 to February 27, 2022. “Even when hundreds of health care workers were becoming infected every week during the peak of the Omicron wave, we found that they were no more likely to acquire the virus in the hospital system,” said Joel Wertheim, PhD, co-senior author of the study and associate professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The outcomes reveal the hidden patterns of viral transmission.” The results from both the genetic and social networking analysis showed that while universal masking was key to prevent transmissions, airborne negative pressure rooms, universal N95 respirator masks or even closing the door of a patient’s room were not essential elements to protect against transmission in the health care setting. In fact, most transmissions occurred outside of the health care setting, physical contact in the community, between households or when universal masking was not followed in the setting of unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral transmission was more likely to occur in shared spaces, such as breakrooms or lobbies. “Our analysis really highlights that our health care system, with its safety measures including ventilation standards, robust viral testing, and early implementation of universal masking, was able to protect health care workers and patients during the pandemic,” said Shira Abeles, MD, co-author of the study, associate professor in the Department of Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego Health. Longhurst adds the type of technological approach used can be a model for future studies and a tool deployed for epidemics of highly contagious infectious diseases. “The pandemic has shown us what’s at stake. This novel methodology, combining a digital social network derived from electronic health record data with genomic analysis of viral strains, can be used again in the future to model spread of health care associated infections,” said Longhurst. Co-authors of the study include: Jocelyn Keehner, UCSF; Lucy Horton, Frank E. Myers, Lindsay Riggs-Rodriguez, Mohammed Ahmad, Sally Baxter, Aaron Bussina, Kalen Cantrell, Priscilla Cardenas, Peter De Hoff, Robert El-Kareh, Jennifer Holland, Daryn Ikeda, Kirk Kurashige, Louise Laurent, Andrew Lucas, David Pride, Shashank Sathe, Allen Tran, Tetyana Vasylyeva, Gene Yeo, Rob Knight, all at UC San Diego.

These include a prominent senior housing development and a state-of-the-art transitional and long-term care (TLTC) facility, affirming our commitment to creating an integrated and diversified portfolio through the 5V+ Seniors Healthcare Fund. With scarce new supply emerging since the onset of the pandemic, and only a handful anticipated in the near future, Birchwood is excited to have invested in one of the few new senior housing developments in the marketplace, especially as the 85+ age cohort is set for a substantial rise beginning in 2030. Despite a challenging market landscape, Birchwood also completed the acquisition of one of the most highly esteemed TLTC communities in the Midwest, recognized with awards for both clinical excellence and leadership. The execution of these investments marks significant achievements for the 5V+ Seniors Healthcare Fund, which was formed to pursue best in class investment opportunities in seniors healthcare. The core thesis behind the 5V+ Fund, which is focused on diversification and integration, was primarily influenced by a previously acquired portfolio by Birchwood. Most recently, this portfolio was partially sold and is expected to yield a 37% net IRR for our investors. The remaining portion of this portfolio is scheduled to be sold in Q2 of 2024. Major upheavals from the pandemic, which were exacerbated by the capital markets volatility from the last fifteen months, has created a unique investment window right before the aging of America ramps up starting in 2030. With proven expertise, a robust pipeline, and strategic positioning, Birchwood is confident in navigating this unprecedented period. We are currently raising capital for the second closing of the 5V+ Seniors Healthcare Fund, scheduled for March 15, 2024 .

However, these medical advancements largely benefit only those living in the bigger cities, even as millions in rural areas struggle to access even basic healthcare. To address this critical gap, healthtech start-up CureBay seeks to harness technology to upgrade primary healthcare in remote areas. It uses a hybrid model combining physical infrastructure with digital capability to deliver quality and affordable healthcare in underserved regions. At its core, the model involves using a technology platform to aggregate a spectrum of healthcare services. This includes doctors, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, and medtech devices, among others. Complementing this virtual network is a physical network of e-clinics — medical centres set up in remote areas lacking healthcare facilities. The e-clinics act as hubs for assisted healthcare at affordable cost. Affordability no bar Challenging the view that healthcare services in rural areas cannot be sustained financially owing to insufficient revenues, Priyadarshi Mohapatra, founder and CEO of CureBay, stresses that rural patients are more than willing to pay for quality services. CureBay combines physical infrastructure with digital capability to deliver healthcare in underserved regions Elaborating on the company’s affordable pricing strategy, he says, “Now, how are we able to make it affordable? For instance, we charge ₹100 for the first consultation, cutting the travel cost [needed to seek treatment in a city hospital], and we sell branded ethical medicines at discounted rates.” Additionally an annual membership programme, priced ₹399, gives patients access to free consultations with doctors, diagnostic tests, and discounts on medicines, besides ambulance and other services. The platform currently has on board 50 hospitals and about 100 doctors. Within six months, the programme has garnered more than 15,000 members, underscoring the demand for accessible and affordable healthcare in remote areas. Healthy spread As to the choice of location for the e-clinics, Mohapatra says the first criteria is the catchment area, namely any site that has at least 50-100 underserved villages within a 10-km radius. The start-up recently raised ₹62 crore in a Series A1 funding round, taking its overall funding to over ₹120 crore across three rounds. Currently operational in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the start-up has so far established 92 e-clinics and plans to add more. “We continue to expand within the same markets and plan to have 150 clinics in each of the two states, after which we will enter a new market, Jharkhand,” Mohapatra says.

While significant progress has been made in expanding healthcare access, disparities in healthcare utilization and outcomes persist, particularly for underserved populations. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), a flagship initiative of the Government of India, has emerged as a transformative initiative, poised to revolutionize healthcare delivery through digital transformation and pave the way for achieving UHC in the country. The Pillars of Transformation: Components of ABDM Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA): A 14-digit unique identifier, that assures a strong and universally accepted identity within India’s healthcare landscape, facilitating seamless access of health records across healthcare providers. It unifies healthcare benefits and aids in eradicating registration hassles, streamlining access to individuals over their health records [1] Health Professional Registry (HPR) and Health Facility Registry (HFR) : Comprehensive registries like the Healthcare Professionals Registry (HPR) and Health Facility Registry (HFR), ensure better coverage by connecting patients with verified practitioners and diverse health facilities across India. HPR serves as a certified repository, guaranteeing registered healthcare practitioners for modern and traditional medicine systems [3], while the Health Facility Registry includes a repository of diverse health facilities (both private and public), fostering accessibility to hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies across the healthcare systems [4]. Drug Registry: A centralized repository standardizing drug information across medical systems, ensuring authenticated drug supply and enhancing patient healthcare experiences. [5] Unified Health Interface (UHI ): Enabling seamless communication among stakeholders and facilitating diverse health services’ accessibility through various applications, akin to UPI in payments. [6] ABHA Application: Empowering individuals with control over their Personal Health Records (PHR), consent-based sharing of records, fostering informed decision-making, and longitudinal health record creation. [2] National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX): A platform enabling seamless information exchange among payers, providers, beneficiaries, and relevant entities by ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness through interoperability, machine-readability, and open standards, fostering reliable health claim transactions. [7] ABDM Adoption Initiatives: Scan and Share: It ensures the paperless registrations of the patients resulting in instant token generation that helps the patients skip the long queue during their treatment. [8] Digital Health Incentive Scheme (DHIS) and Microsites: Initiatives like DHIS [9] and Microsites [10] were launched to increase digital health adoption and participation by the private sector (especially the small and medium-scale healthcare providers) for providing a strong push to the digitization efforts across the country. ABDM: A Multi-Pronged Approach to UHC ABDM is not merely a technological advancement; it is a comprehensive strategy that addresses the multifaceted challenges of achieving UHC in India. It rests on its key components and initiatives that collectively contribute to improving healthcare access, quality, and affordability- Seamless Access to Healthcare Services: ABDM is creating an integrated healthcare ecosystem where citizens can easily access healthcare services from any provider [11], regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. The unified health interface (UHI) will serve as a single point of entry for online appointment scheduling, teleconsultations, and access to health records by eliminating geographical barriers and empowering citizens to seek care from the most appropriate provider [6]. Example: A patient in a rural area can easily find and book an appointment with a specialist in a nearby city through the UHI, eliminating the need for long-distance travel and ensuring timely access to specialized care. Empowered Citizens and Improved Patient Engagement: ABDM empowers citizens to take control of their health information through ABHA. ABHA provides secure access to personal health records, enabling informed decision-making, self-management of health conditions, and better engagement with healthcare providers [1]. This patient-centric approach would foster trust and encourage preventive care, leading to improved health outcomes. Example: A patient can access their test results and medical history through ABHA, allowing them to discuss their health concerns with their doctor in an informed manner and make informed decisions about their treatment plan. Enhanced Care Coordination and Continuity: ABDM promotes seamless sharing of health records between healthcare providers, ensuring continuity of care and informed treatment decisions. This interoperable infrastructure will break down silos between different healthcare institutions, eliminating duplication of tests and improving patient outcomes. Healthcare providers will have a comprehensive view of a patient’s medical history, enabling them to provide more effective and personalized care. Example: A patient’s medical history and recent test results from a hospital visit can be easily accessed by their regular physician, allowing for seamless continuity of care and avoiding unnecessary tests or duplicate treatments. Challenges and Future Outlook While ABDM holds immense promise, challenges like digital literacy, infrastructure disparities, data security, and behaviour change remain. Overcoming these hurdles demands concerted efforts from stakeholders, policymakers, and healthcare providers. Looking ahead, ABDM’s success hinges on continued innovation, collaboration, and adaptability. Sustained investments in digital infrastructure, capacity building, and regulatory frameworks will be vital in scaling up its impact. Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Healthcare Delivery Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) represents a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery in India, transforming it from a fragmented, provider-centric system to a patient-centric, data-driven, and accessible one [11]. It empowers citizens, enhances care coordination, promotes evidence-based decision-making, and addresses the challenges of reaching underserved populations and bridging the digital divide. As ABDM unfolds, its impact will be closely monitored, and emerging challenges will be addressed to ensure its continuous adaptation to the evolving healthcare needs of the Indian population. With its comprehensive approach and unwavering commitment to universal health coverage (UHC), ABDM holds immense promise to revolutionize the healthcare landscape and pave the way for a healthier, more equitable India."

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Military.com | By Patricia Kime Published January 11, 2024 at 4:35pm ET A 22-year-old arrangement between the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has drawn ire from conservatives in Congress, who claim it puts health care for detained migrants over that of veterans. But VA officials say it has no impact whatsoever on veterans' services or health care -- and costs the agency nothing. Since 2002, the VA's Financial Services Center, or FSC, has processed medical claims for an ICE program office that is responsible for providing health care for migrants detained by the border security agency. The VA center facilitates the same work under separate contracts for a variety of other federal offices. Read Next: Federal Watchdog to Probe Osprey Mishaps Following Deadly Crash in Japan that Killed 8 Airmen The long-standing agreement with ICE has recently become a political football amid attacks from lawmakers and conservative advocates who have hammered President Joe Biden over a flood of migrants coming across the southern border. In December, Illinois Republican Rep. Mike Bost, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, and Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., introduced a bill called the ""No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would prohibit the VA from using resources to provide health care or process claims for migrants. In rolling out the proposed legislation, Bost described being ""stonewalled"" by the Biden administration in obtaining answers on the arrangement, which has been in place since the George W. Bush administration. ""Until I get the response our veterans deserve, I'll use every available tool of my chairmanship to end this practice and put our veterans first,"" Bost said in a statement. VA officials said Thursday that, while taxpayer funding is used to process the health care claims, ICE, not the VA, pays for the work. And, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes added, the VA has never provided health care to migrant detainees. ""VA does not provide or fund any health care to ICE detainees. There is a 2002 payment processing agreement, in which ICE pays for the FSC to process payments for ICE-funded health care. This involves no more than 10 employees, is fully paid for by ICE, and has been in place for every administration since 2002,"" Hayes said in a statement to Military.com. In a recent statement to The New York Post, Tuberville's office said the Biden administration was ""playing word games"" and accused the VA of allowing detainees to access its community care network, which provides private health care services to veterans outside VA clinics and medical centers. ""By definition, that means worse options for our veterans,"" a spokesperson for the senator told The Post. Under the agreement, however, the ICE Health Service Corps, or IHSC, program office is responsible for authorizing health care services for detainees and obtaining providers to deliver their health care. ""No resources meant for veterans are used as part of this agreement. FSC provides an administrative function for ICE, using ICE funds, that has zero impact on veteran health care or benefits,"" Hayes said in a statement. ""Again, they provide this claims processing function in return for IHSC paying a fee to FSC. None of the employees have been diverted from other roles, and no resources meant for veterans are used as part of this agreement,"" Hayes added. The arrangement was first reported by Fox News . The ICE Health Service Corps provides health care to immigrants in ICE custody, including direct care and coordination of off-site care. In fiscal 2021, IHSC paid VA $74.7 million to provide medical claims processing and support referral for outside care, according to a 2022 report to the Senate and House Homeland Security Committees. According to the report, in fiscal 2021, IHSC provided health care directly to 88,000 immigrants and oversaw health care for more than 169,000 in other medical settings. It spent $338.2 million on care for these detainees, including $21.4 million from Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funds.

The healthcare sector has not been exempt from this transformation, and the use of blockchain technology has the promise of revolutionizing the sector. In this post, we'll talk about how cryptocurrency can transform the healthcare sector as a whole as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Are you looking for a reliable and well-known Bitcoin investment platform? Use quantum ai for a straightforward and secure platform. Introduction to Cryptocurrency Before we delve into the potential uses of cryptocurrency in healthcare, it is important to have a basic understanding of what cryptocurrency is. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It is decentralized and operates independently of a central bank. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, but there are now thousands of different types of cryptocurrencies in circulation. How Can Cryptocurrency be Used in Healthcare? Electronic Health Records Electronic health records (EHRs) are one of the most significant ways cryptocurrencies can be used in healthcare. EHRs are computerized patient health records that healthcare professionals use to deliver precise and timely medical treatment. Patient data may be more securely and privately stored if cryptocurrency is used in EH Patient data can be safely encrypted and kept in a decentralized database utilizing blockchain technology, with only authorized parties being able to access it. Medical Research Cryptocurrency can also be used to revolutionize medical research by allowing for the creation of decentralized clinical trials. Clinical trials are essential to the development of new medications and treatments, but the traditional process can be slow and costly. With the use of cryptocurrency, clinical trials can be conducted more efficiently and inexpensively, allowing for the faster development of new treatments and medications. Telemedicine Telemedicine, or the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using telecommunications technology, is becoming increasingly popular in the healthcare industry. Cryptocurrency can facilitate the use of telemedicine by allowing for secure and efficient payment transactions between patients and healthcare providers. This can help to reduce the administrative burden and increase access to healthcare services for patients in remote or underserved areas. Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency in Healthcare Increased Security and Privacy As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrency can provide increased security and privacy to patient information. By using blockchain technology, patient information can be encrypted and stored securely in a decentralized database. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to patient information and protect patient privacy. Faster and More Efficient Transactions Traditional payment transactions in the healthcare industry can be slow and expensive. By using cryptocurrency, transactions can be conducted more quickly and efficiently, reducing the administrative burden and freeing up resources for other uses. Increased Access to Healthcare Services Cryptocurrency can also help to increase access to healthcare services for patients in remote or underserved areas. By facilitating the use of telemedicine, patients can receive the care they need without having to travel long distances or incur significant costs. Challenges of Using Cryptocurrency in Healthcare Lack of Regulation One of the biggest challenges to the integration of cryptocurrency in healthcare is the lack of regulation. While some countries have begun to regulate cryptocurrency, there is still a lack of standardization in the industry. This can make it difficult for healthcare providers to adopt cryptocurrency and could potentially put patient information at risk. Volatility Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can experience significant fluctuations in value. This can make it difficult for healthcare providers to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, as they may not be able to accurately predict its value. Limited Adoption Finally, cryptocurrency is still a relatively new technology, and its adoption in the healthcare industry is still limited. Healthcare providers may be hesitant to adopt cryptocurrency until it becomes more widely accepted and regulated. Conclusion In summary, bitcoin has the ability to completely transform the healthcare sector by enhancing patient data security and privacy, enabling quicker and more effective transactions, and expanding access to healthcare services. Before cryptocurrencies can be used as a common method of payment in the healthcare industry, however, the issues of regulation, volatility, and limited adoption must be resolved. It will be interesting to observe how cryptocurrency is integrated and how it alters the healthcare environment as the sector develops further and new technologies emerge.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 11, 2024, 09:00am EST Share Save Cofounder & CEO of PointClickCare , a leading healthcare technology platform enabling meaningful collaboration across the care continuum. getty With AI becoming increasingly prevalent, I believe the future of AI applications in healthcare looks promising . This is a critical moment for healthcare leaders to dive deeper into the potential of generative AI as well as prepare for the challenges that come with AI integration. Augmenting Human Capabilities With Generative AI One of the primary advantages of AI in healthcare is its ability to augment human capabilities, allowing clinicians and healthcare staff to operate at the top of their license. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI frees up scarce clinical resources , enabling healthcare professionals to concentrate on more critical aspects of patient care. Virtual assistants and chatbots are just a couple of examples of AI technologies that you can look into to enhance patient engagement and reduce unnecessary visits to healthcare facilities. As a result, overworked and understaffed healthcare teams can lighten their workload and improve their efficiency. This is great news, seeing as the U.S. is currently facing a projected shortage of physicians and increasing rates of burnout. Through predictive analytics and data-driven insights, AI can help clinicians make more informed decisions and personalize treatment plans to optimize therapies for better patient outcomes. This precision medicine approach not only benefits individual patients but also positively contributes to research and development, advancing value-based care. Simply put, the more AI-generated insights are provided to clinicians at the point of care, the more efficiently they can make informed care decisions. Advancing Value-Based Care Through AI By leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze data, AI can help your organization identify patterns, risk factors and treatment responses, leading to more precise and personalized care plans. As a result, value-based care models—those focused on improving patient outcomes while controlling costs—can be significantly enhanced. In value-based care, healthcare providers are incentivized to deliver high-quality care and maintain patient health over the long term. I believe that AI's ability to optimize therapies and treatment plans can more quickly allow providers to achieve these goals. Insights from AI-driven analytics can enable targeted interventions and identify trends and disparities within patient populations, therefore improving public health initiatives overall. A Three-Phased Approach To AI Adoption It’s important to note that AI adoption won't happen overnight. To effectively harness the potential of AI in healthcare, I believe a three-phased approach is necessary. 1. Phase one involves laying the foundation and establishing the infrastructure for AI integration. This includes building robust data repositories, ensuring interoperability between systems and training healthcare staff in AI technology usage. It’s important to gain buy-in from those on the C-suite to the staff in the operating rooms. 2. Phase two focuses on enabling more effective care transitions and proactively mitigating risks before they manifest. By leveraging predictive analytics, AI can identify patients at higher risk for adverse events or readmissions, enabling timely interventions and reducing healthcare costs. 3. Phase three is centered around creating actionable intelligence from vast amounts of digitized information. By transforming data into specific insights, AI promotes cross-collaboration across care settings, enhancing continuity of care and patient experience. Overcoming Challenges In AI Adoption While AI offers tremendous potential, it also poses challenges related to privacy, security, regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations. Protecting patient data against data breaches is paramount, and AI developers and healthcare organizations must adhere to strict privacy protocols and comply with regulatory standards. Further, AI algorithms are trained on large datasets, which may contain biases and reflect existing healthcare disparities. It is crucial to address these biases to ensure that AI-driven decision-making does not perpetuate unfair outcomes. Responsible AI development must involve continuous monitoring and adjustments to algorithms to achieve equitable and just healthcare outcomes for all patients. It's also important to note that the potential for job displacement due to AI automation is a genuine concern among healthcare professionals. To maintain a skilled and compassionate workforce, support healthcare professionals as they adapt to this changing landscape. Education and upskilling programs can help professionals embrace AI as a valuable tool to enhance their abilities rather than replace them. A Promising, Still Unfolding Future The future of AI in healthcare holds tremendous promise for enhancing patient care and advancing value-based medicine. By leveraging generative AI, healthcare professionals can concentrate on critical patient interactions while AI automates repetitive tasks and optimizes treatment plans. AI-driven analytics also have the potential to improve patient outcomes, promote population health management and enhance value-based care models. Nonetheless, the journey towards the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare is not without challenges. As technology continues to evolve, embracing AI as a collaborative partner in patient care is important in helping pave the way to maximize healthcare efficiency, empower patients to take charge of their health and ultimately lead to better outcomes for individuals and communities alike.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 10, 2024, 09:30am EST Share Save CEO of Orriant . Helping CEOs lower costs and increase productivity by aligning healthcare to work for them instead of against them. getty Having managed 10 different hospitals in my career, I am very much aware of misalignments in healthcare. But I was still stunned at a recent healthcare leadership conference to see a slide presented by a large healthcare system. The slide showed that healthcare systems own physician practices to be a funnel source into hospitals. A 2019 article by KFF Health News described a lawsuit against a hospital that lost money from the practices it owned but made loads of money from the patients funneling into its facilities. This trend in hospital-owned physician practices has increased in recent years , and the shift of services being delivered at the hospital versus in the physician office setting certainly impacts healthcare spending. The presenter’s next slide was the focus of his presentation. He showed news clippings announcing that large non-healthcare entities, like Amazon , are buying primary care practices. His point was that hospital administrators are losing their funnel sources. I raised my hand and shared that some of the largest employers in the U.S. appear to have figured out this misalignment and are offering their employees a value-based primary care and payment option that is not owned by hospitals. His response shocked me but also genuinely impressed me. He responded by saying that nothing could be better for the people of America, and it's now up to the leaders of healthcare systems to transform the way they think about delivering healthcare to respond to the needs of the customer. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Are the healthcare leaders of America going to start building healthcare around the needs of the customer? I believe that is amazing. I left being a hospital administrator 27 years ago because I felt the healthcare industry was acting more like a financial machine to make money than an industry creating health. I am the CEO of a wellness company, and I have also spent the past 12 years as a speaker to other CEOs across the country for a coaching organization, which has allowed me to educate leaders on how to align their brokers to work for them and teach them about direct primary care. Here are the considerations I encourage both business and healthcare leaders to keep in mind to help balance the scales and align healthcare to work for the customer. Options For CEOs Employers can consider establishing fee-based contracts with their benefits consultants where the consultant gets paid directly from the employer instead of from the insurance carrier commission. Contract bonuses and incentives can be built into the contract so the consultant earns more money by helping the employer reach their business objectives. The reality is that the benefits broker community is not going to drive this; this has to be driven from the CEO’s office. CEOs can also consider what jumbo employers are doing right now and offer to pay for direct primary care, or, in other words, primary care paid based on a monthly subscription rather than billing insurance for every visit. Now that some of the largest employers in the country have decided to offer this form of primary care to their employees, this subscription model is growing . CEOs should be aware that though this form of primary care can have benefits, influencing employees to engage in such a benefit will be challenging. Change is never easy. In my experience, people often look at a change in benefits as something that is good for the employer but not for the employee. CEOs will need to develop education strategies to help employees understand the merits of this new front door to healthcare that is far more relationship-based and customer-centric. With all these benefits, there will always be a group of employees that prefer to stay with the provider they are used to seeing. Considerations For Healthcare Leaders I often hear healthcare leaders discuss the benefits of subscription-based primary care. Providers have fewer patients in their practices, which means they can take more time with each patient and build closer relationships. Some providers have concerns about direct primary care as well, including its affordability and the shortage of primary care providers across the country. How will we ever be able to supply enough providers to meet demand? I believe an important part of answering that question is creating a work environment that primary care providers love. Many American physicians are unhappy with their jobs. “I feel like a pawn in a moneymaking game for hospital administrators,” one doctor was quoted in the Journal of Medicine . Create a work environment where they can have a relationship with their patients and don't feel so rushed to help move the needle on a shortage. Healthcare systems have it within their power to improve the work environment for the primary care providers that they own. They can reduce their expectations of how many patients each provider sees each day. However, I believe misaligned financial incentives can inhibit healthcare systems from making those changes. Another option worth exploring is the role played by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who could help meet the demand for primary care services. Nurse practitioners are already being chosen as primary care providers by many Americans, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners said . Healthcare transformation is no longer in the future. It is happening right now, and the more CEOs get on board, I believe the better it will be for employees, providers and employers.

She said the reassignments could even reduce the workload significantly, especially in hospital wards affected by the uneven distribution of healthcare workers previously highlighted by MMA. ""We commend the Health Minister and the Health director-general for their progressive efforts and encourage continued commitment to reshaping the healthcare workforce distribution in addressing the healthcare needs of the population. ""We hope the positions vacated as a result of the reassignments will be promptly filled to prevent any disruptions to services. The importance of training must also be emphasised,"" she said in a statement on Tuesday (Jan 9). Dr Azizan pointed out that such shortages in healthcare personnel have underscored the importance of digitalising the public healthcare system. ""We believe data-driven decisions and real-time monitoring will be the way forward for effective planning of workforce placement,"" she said. On another matter, the Health Ministry said staff would be trained accordingly before being assigned with specific clinical tasks and procedures. ""To ensure the best quality of nursing care provided to patients, it is important to strategically station nurses at sites that require specific nursing skills, particularly in wards. ""The ministry continues to prioritise the well-being of nurses who have always been committed to providing the best health care services to Malaysians,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. The ministry said this in response to a report by health portal CodeBlue that there were plans to relocate ""100%"" of nurses from specialist clinics – excluding those in clinical areas like obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) and paediatrics – to wards, due to a severe shortage of nurses in public hospitals and insufficient nursing graduates. The ministry said it would re-strategise the placement of human resources across the ministry as quality patient care hinges on a positive work environment. ""A strategic mobilisation and placement of healthcare workforce, including nurses and medical assistants, are meticulously planned and executed by the ministry without compromising clinical services and the safety of patients. ""This is pertinent in ensuring adequate and skill-matched staffing aligns with the commitment to enhance patient care and safety, contributing to the overall effectiveness of healthcare services. ""Besides that, in a bid to optimise the healthcare services, nurses and medical assistants will be placed according to their core competency, complementing each other,"" it said. ""The ministry would like to reiterate that it is highly committed to improving healthcare services across the country while aimed at charting the way forward for comprehensive improvements in the healthcare sector with the passing of the Health White Paper,"" read the statement.

EQT Healthcare Growth will support Mabtech as it expands its product portfolio and reach, especially in the US STOCKHOLM, Jan. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EQT is excited to introduce the EQT Healthcare Growth Strategy(or the ""strategy"") and announce its first investment, Mabtech, which is being acquired from the IK Small Cap II Fund. Introducing the EQT Healthcare Growth Strategy Long-term trends - such as growing, aging, and less healthy populations, significant unmet medical needs, and rising healthcare costs - are leading to a greater need for better, more efficient, and accessible healthcare. At the same time, scientific breakthroughs and advancements in technology and data are accelerating healthcare innovation. This is increasing the opportunity to invest in innovative and differentiated products and services that seek to deliver positive outcomes across the value chain. The opportunity is particularly compelling in Europe, where there are a growing number of companies in need of capital, expertise, and global reach to help them scale and unlock their full growth potential. Against this backdrop, EQT is introducing the EQT Healthcare Growth Strategy. The buyout strategy will apply EQT's active ownership approach and invest in the same healthcare subsectors that the firm has invested in for 30 years. The dedicated Advisory Team is led by Maarten de Jong, who joined EQT earlier this year from Moelis & Company, where he led the expansion of its healthcare franchise. The EQT Healthcare Growth Advisory Team includes three further partners: Geraldine O'Keeffe, joining from EQT Life Sciences, Isabel de Paoli, joining from EQT Private Equity and previously Chief Strategy Officer at Merck KG, and Mark Braganza, who recently joined from Sun European Partners and was previously at GHO and TPG, where he focused on healthcare investing. Maarten de Jong said: "" I'm delighted to have joined EQT to establish and lead the EQT Healthcare Growth Strategy, alongside a fantastic team. The new strategy will invest in innovative, fast-growing, proven healthcare companies, predominantly based in Europe. Applying EQT's proven approach and leveraging its global network, we will help these companies build their commercial muscle and expand their global reach. In doing so, we seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for clients while scaling positive outcomes across the healthcare value chain.""

Log In Create Free Account The U.S. health care sector is showing signs of life after lagging in 2023 as investors bet cheap valuations will offset a tendency to underperform during presidential election years. The S&P 500 health care sector has climbed about 6 per cent since the start of December, doubling the gain of the broader index during that period. Its performance during 2023 overall was far less impressive, as it rose just 0.3 per cent compared with the S&P 500′s 24-per-cent jump. Health care, which has a roughly 13-per-cent weight in the S&P 500, was one of the areas left behind last year as investors flocked to the narrow group of massive tech and growth stocks that propelled indexes higher. The rise of new obesity treatments sparked worries that there would be less need for medical treatments aimed at weight-related health conditions at the same time demand for COVID-19 products waned. The sector’s lacklustre showing has made it an attractive target for investors looking for undervalued areas of the market. The health care sector trades at 17.9 times forward earnings estimates versus a P/E ratio of 19.7 for the S&P 500, a discount of 9 per cent. Historically, health care has traded at a 4-per-cent premium to the broader index, data from LSEG Datastream showed. “Investors are starting to look out for those sectors that didn’t work in 2023, and health care fits that bill,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, who is recommending investors “overweight” the health care sector. Some investors are also betting that the rally that boosted tech and growth stocks will spread to other areas – a phenomenon that appears to have started late last year as banks, small caps and other unloved areas of the market drew heavy buying. Earnings are another potential bright spot, with companies in health care expected to increase profits by 17.5 per cent in 2024, versus an 11.1-per-cent rise for the S&P 500 overall, according to LSEG data. Last year “was a very narrow market and I think that broadens out in 2024 and creates opportunities for lots of different stocks to perform better, including health care stocks,” said Michael Smith, senior portfolio manager for Allspring Global’s Discovery Large Cap Growth Fund, which owns shares of UnitedHealth Group, Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems. The discount is more acute in certain areas of health care. Excluding Eli Lilly, whose shares soared last year on enthusiasm over the potential of its weight-loss treatment, a group of large-cap drug makers and biotech companies tracked by JPMorgan were trading at a 30-per-cent discount to the S&P 500, a “historically low” level, the bank’s analysts said in a note late last month. Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said the firm’s value-stock funds are significantly overweight the sector, including holdings in CVS Health, Bristol Myers Squibb and Viatris. “Classically, value investors are looking for a group that is out of favour with low valuations,” Mr. Kaser said. “Health care checks both those boxes really well right now.” REASONS FOR CAUTION An early test for the sector comes at this week’s JP Morgan health care conference in San Francisco, where investors are gathering to hear dozens of companies forecast the year ahead and talk about their prospects. There are reasons for caution regarding health care’s performance in 2024. The widely expected scenario of a stable but slowing economy, ebbing inflation and falling interest rates could give investors little reason to abandon the big tech and growth stocks that worked for them last year. Those same factors could also be more favourable to sectors that are more tightly linked to the economy, such as financials and industrials. Health care stocks also tend to struggle in presidential election years, as the cost of medical care frequently emerges as a political issue that puts the industry in the crosshairs. The sector has only beaten the S&P 500 in three of the past 12 presidential election years, according to Strategas. However, some investors believe this year’s presidential contest poses less risk to health care stocks than recent past elections. Neither political party is expected to gain significant majorities in Congress, diminishing the chances of major legislation that overhauls the industry, while President Joe Biden already enacted legislation during his first term that addresses drug prices. Generally, health care is “an easy target for politicians,” Mr. Kaser said. This year, “I don’t think there is a likely outcome of anything big and new hitting the sector. ... [There is] less uncertainty than many election years.” Be smart with your money.

https://kvia.com/news/business-technology/stacker-science/2024/01/06/how-health-care-spending-varies-by-occupation/,,How health care spending varies by occupation,20240106T171500Z,https://kvia.b-cdn.net/2024/01/HealthcarecostEXCR_0-860x613.png,kvia.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Stacker-Science By Stacker Published January 6, 2024 2:20 AM Canva How health care spending varies by occupation A stethoscope sitting on top of a pile of $20 bills. The American health care story is essentially a tale of the “haves” and “have-mores.” Managers and professionals, as well as all wage and salary workers, pay 6.8% of their income toward health expenses, including prescription drugs, health insurance, medical services, and medical supplies. Construction workers and mechanics, however, despite their physically rigorous professions, spend less of their household budgets on their health at 5.7%. To get these numbers, Incredible Health used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine health care spending across different work sectors. It may seem that spending more on health expenses may be a bad thing. But health care only works when you can use it. Workers in careers with the best, employer-sponsored health insurance and with the best benefits packages of sick days, personal leave, and salary appear to spend more because they utilize health care more—and can afford to do so. Meanwhile, the oldest Americans, retirees, spend double (nearly 14%) what the average worker does on expenses related to health care. Regardless of your station in life, premiums for employer-sponsored insurance family plans are going up, and in some cases, workers are shouldering more of that cost . Incredible Health Health care makes up less than 8% of overall spending for most people Bar chart showing retirees spend about 14% of overall spending on health expenses, compared to under 8% for most other worker categories. It shouldn’t be a surprise that retirees are spending the most on health care. In 2023, a 65-year-old single person may need $157,500 in after-tax savings to pay for retirement health care costs, according to a Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate. The average 65-year-old retired couple may need $315,000. Outside of Medicare and insurance, people can plan for retirement health expenses by opening a health savings account. Commonly referred to as an HSA, these accounts allow workers to put aside pre-tax money to spend on qualified medical expenses. The untaxed dollars may lower out-of-pocket health care costs such as copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. Another way to plan for health care expenses is by purchasing long-term care insurance. While it has some shortfalls —and it is not a substitute for health care—it can cover expenses that health insurance will not. Services such as hiring help for bathing, dressing, or care for Alzheimer’s disease may be covered by long-term care insurance. Incredible Health Insurance is the most expensive health expense Table showing blue collar workers spend less dollars on health expenses. Other than retirees, health expenses as a share of overall spending is consistent across most workers. Blue-collar workers spend fewer dollars per year on health expenses. However, it’s important for blue-collar workers to have adequate health care, pay, and sick days because they tend to work longer and have worse health conditions than white-collar workers, according to a 2011 Columbia University study. Adults who don’t have adequate—or any—health insurance are three times more likely to say they haven’t visited a health clinic or medical doctor in a year, according to a KFF report , The Uninsured and the ACA: A Primer – Key Facts about Health Insurance and the Uninsured amidst Changes to the Affordable Care Act. Those stats may explain the plight of construction workers. Fewer than 43% of construction workers in the South are offered health insurance by their employer, according to the Build a Better South: Construction Working Conditions in the Southern U.S. study by the Workers Defense Project, an organization that helps low-wage, immigrant construction workers in the construction industry. What’s more, 78% lacked paid sick time, the study found, making it harder to even leave work to see a doctor without risking a cut in pay. Affordability may also be a factor; even though more than 80% of the workers in the Build a Better South study reported working overtime, 36% struggled to pay for essentials such as food or rent. According to the KFF report, “19% of uninsured adults said they delayed or did not get a needed prescription drug due to cost, compared to 14% with public coverage and 6% with private coverage. “ Story editing by Ashleigh Graf.

Putting your hard-earned cash in solid corporations with bright futures will help grow your initial capital. And while the healthcare industry may not be the most exciting, top companies that provide healthcare services often stand the test of time. After all, medical care is always in high demand. With that said, let's look at two excellent healthcare stocks worth buying today: Eli Lilly ( LLY +2.14% ) and HCA Healthcare ( HCA +0.66% ) . Expand NYSE : LLY Eli Lilly Today's Change ( 2.14 %) $ 20.72 Current Price $ 987.36 Key Data Points Market Cap $914B Day's Range $ 966.00 - $ 999.94 52wk Range $ 623.78 - $ 999.94 Volume 197K Avg Vol 4.2M Gross Margin 83.03 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % 1. Eli Lilly Popular stocks aren't always great investments, but in the case of Eli Lilly, it certainly is. Last year, the biotech made quite a bit of noise thanks to its newly approved anti-obesity drug Zepbound, which looks destined for stardom. Zepbound first hit the market in 2022 in treating type 2 diabetes (it is marketed as Mounjaro in this indication). In addition to these two approvals, it is seeking many other label expansions, from obstructive sleep apnea to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, among others. Zepbound should help drive solid top-line growth for Eli Lilly for years, especially since it isn't the only new medicine the company will rely on. The drugmaker's portfolio has been getting quite the makeover lately, with brand new products such as cancer medicine Jaypirca, ulcerative colitis therapy Omvoh, and two more that should earn the green light relatively soon. The first is lebrikizumab, a potential eczema treatment whose application for approval was declined last year. But since that was entirely due to manufacturing issues, Eli Lilly should be just fine here. The second is the drugmaker's investigational Alzheimer's disease therapy, donanemab, which reported excellent results in a late-stage clinical trial. Eli Lilly's financial results should remain strong, just as they were last year, thanks to its incredible portfolio. In the first nine months of 2023, the company's top line jumped by 17% year over year to $24.8 billion, despite sales of its COVID-19 antibodies completely vanishing compared to the parallel period in 2022. Analysts see Eli Lilly's revenue increasing at a rate of 28.7% per year for the next five years -- an incredible number for a biotech giant. Lastly, Eli Lilly is also a solid dividend stock . All things considered, the company's shares look attractive even after destroying the market in 2023. Expand NYSE : HCA HCA Healthcare Today's Change ( 0.66 %) $ 3.01 Current Price $ 462.31 Key Data Points Market Cap $105B Day's Range $ 458.19 - $ 469.57 52wk Range $ 289.98 - $ 478.88 Volume 1.3M Avg Vol 1.3M Gross Margin 15.64 % Dividend Yield 0.01 % 2. HCA Healthcare HCA Healthcare owns and runs a network of medical facilities, mostly hospitals. The company is one of the leaders in this field, with facilities that span most of the country, although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. HCA Healthcare's business was deeply affected by the pandemic in several ways. First, occupancy rates in its facilities -- one of the critical determinants of the company's revenue -- fluctuated a lot and became somewhat unpredictable. Second, the healthcare giant had to rely on more expensive contract labor in the earlier days of the outbreak. HCA Healthcare is slowly but surely leaving these problems behind, and the company performed pretty well last year, at least as far as its financial results are concerned. Through Sept. 30, 2023, HCA Healthcare's revenue of $47.7 billion increased by a decent 6.5% year over year. Its earnings per share of $13.07 was roughly 9% higher than the year-ago period. HCA Healthcare should continue to rebound progressively. The company's business has excellent prospects. Building a network of well-equipped medical facilities is highly capital-intensive, but it's the first step to success in this business. HCA Healthcare already has the advantage of having formed deep relationships with different players in the healthcare industry , something that will be extremely hard for newcomers to replicate. Unless something drastic happens, the company should remain a leading hospital chain for a long time. Further, even in comparison to its existing competitors, HCA Healthcare has generally been a standout -- for instance, it has continuously increased its market share, going from 23% in 2011 to 27% as of the end of 2020. HCA Healthcare's blueprint for success should continue to work, especially as the world's population ages and there is a higher demand for the services it offers. That's why the company's shares are worth buying today."

The artists aim to raise awareness and advocate for a more affordable and equitable healthcare system through enhanced price transparency. The event, attended by Congressional leaders and government officials, will spotlight the injustices resulting from hidden prices by hospitals and insurers, hindering competition and allowing the industry to avoid accountability for overcharges and price gouging. Fat Joe will serve as the emcee, while Jelly Roll and Wyclef Jean will deliver performances, adding a powerful artistic dimension to the advocacy. “The U.S. healthcare system is America’s sickness,” said Fat Joe. “Healthcare price transparency isn’t a partisan or complicated issue. It’s common sense. The only people opposed to it are healthcare industry interests profiting by keeping patients in the dark. Price transparency can protect patients, families, employers, workers, even our own government from healthcare overcharging and pricing fraud as it does everywhere else in the economy. Clear prices allow consumers to choose affordable treatments without worrying that routine care will result in overcharges and even bankruptcy. Price transparency holds hospitals and insurance companies accountable, forcing them to compete and lowering costs, improving healthcare access, quality, and outcomes.” Fat Joe, along with Power to the Patients, affiliated organization Patient Rights Advocate, and employers nationwide, will engage in meetings with Congressional leaders, urging the passage of healthcare price transparency legislation. Power to the Patients has been instrumental in Capitol Hill awareness efforts, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive healthcare price transparency legislation. Previously, Fat Joe met with Congressional leaders and the White House in April 2023 and collaborated with fellow musicians in September 2023 for a compelling public service announcement (PSA) demanding elected officials commit to price transparency. The artists underscore the deception caused by hospitals and insurance companies hiding prices, leading to stifled competition, overcharges, fear, debt, and devastation across the country. The advocacy extends beyond the event, with ongoing PSAs and billboards across Washington, D.C., amplifying the message for honest, affordable, and equitable healthcare. Amidst a healthcare crisis where over 100 million Americans are in medical debt, the event aligns with recent bipartisan legislative efforts to strengthen healthcare price transparency requirements, signaling a growing momentum for essential changes in the healthcare system."

While cyclical companies did very well in December due to lower market interest rates, GE Healthcare's outperformance comes down to stock-specific news relating to its key earnings driver. In other words, management aims to improve its profit margins while growing revenue at a mid-single-digit rate. How GE Healthcare plans to expand profit margins Following the spin-off from General Electric in early 2023, management has taken many routes to expand profitability. They include taking a more focused approach to pricing and ""product platforming"" (developing products that work off a common platform), investing in products powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and enhancing its software mix. In addition, GE Healthcare has a significant opportunity in the growing field of theranostics (using agents to deliver drugs to precise areas), not least because it manufactures the agents used to diagnose, monitor, and guide drug delivery and the high-ticket imaging equipment. Image source: Getty Images. New product introductions However, I digress. The key to the move in December is probably the biggest driver of GE Healthcare's long-term margin expansion and growth plans, namely new product introductions (NPI). NPIs not only drive demand growth but also tend to come with higher margins. GE Healthcare released 40 NPI at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting in 2022, and it was a similar story recently, with more than 40 products released at RNSA in late November 2023. These included theranostics tools, AI, and deep learning solutions, including AI-enabled ultrasound solutions, imaging technology, and scanners. By keeping up the constant pace of NPI launches, GE Healthcare can take full advantage of its new-found independence from GE and improve profitability and cash-flow generation from earnings. Image source: Getty Images. A stock to buy for 2024? NPI growth is essential because GE Healthcare suffered margin erosion in making investments to generate them in 2023. Still, the company is on track to expand its comparable earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin from 14.5% in 2022 to 15%-15.5% in 2023. Management believes it can hit a high-teens to 20% EBIT margin over the medium term. Should you invest $1,000 in GE HealthCare Technologies right now?

The musicians called out hospitals and insurance companies that continue to hide prices by posting “estimates” or “average prices” instead of dollars and cents and noted the deception leads to the “stifling of competition, overcharges, fear, debt, and devastation all over the country.” As a result of the continued awareness campaign, momentum for healthcare price transparency legislation has accelerated with both chambers of Congress taking action to advance legislation. Joe will join Power to the Patients, affiliated organization Patient Rights Advocate, and employers from across the country in meetings with Congressional leaders urging them to seize the momentum and get healthcare price transparency legislation passed and sent to President Biden’s desk.

Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel participated in the event. The theme of the event was 'Holistic Healthcare: Good Health and Wellbeing'. Gujarat's commitment to this holistic healthcare approach involves not only treating illnesses but also promoting wellness and preventive measures, fostering a healthier population and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Friday's event particularly focused on promoting the pharmaceuticals and medical devices sector, technology-transforming healthcare, and promoting holistic healthcare . ""Up to now, Vibrant Gujarat has been focusing on the pharmaceutical sector. This is the first time I think the entire gamut of the wellness industry is incorporated into the seminar. It includes healthcare, pharmaceuticals, non-traditional allopathic medicines, Ayush medicines, wellness centres, yoga and other things,"" said Dr Sunil Parekh, Corporate Affairs and Strategic Advisor, Zydus Life Science Group. ""Traditionally, those who are in Ayurveda and homoeopathy were not counted earlier, but this seminar today saw their participation. The biggest advantage of this Vibrant Gujarat summit is that it brings the whole sector together,"" Parekh added. In this edition of Vibrant Gujarat , he said the Pharma sector as a whole has so far committed Rs 18,300 crores of new investment. Of that investment commitment, he said his company Zydus signed an investment MoU worth Rs 5,000 crores. Phillis Kim, Senior Health Specialist at the World Bank, said, ""We will be talking about the transition in disease burden, globally as well as here in India, and we are very excited to be here, talking about holistic healthcare . The World Bank has already invested USD 350 million here in Gujarat to be working with the government."" Rahul Pandey, Senior Operations Officer, World Bank, said the partnership between the World Bank and Gujarat government is to focus on primary healthcare, healthcare and education for adolescent girls, improve disease surveillance capacity, and improve the overall quality of healthcare. ""This partnership will continue for the next five years, and we hope that our objectives will be met in collaboration with the Gujarat government,"" Pandey added. Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, an event conceptualised in 2003 under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the event has today evolved into one of the most reputed global forums for business networking, knowledge sharing and strategic partnerships for inclusive socio-economic development. The 10th Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit is scheduled for January 10-12, 2024 in Gandhinagar. It will be inaugurated by Narendra Modi and the central theme of the summit is 'Gateway to the Future'.

The CS was speaking while at St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Kakamega County. ""Assaulting a healthcare worker not only endangers their lives but also disrupts the vital services they provide to other patients and the community,” she noted.

Transforming hospital operations: impacts on clinicians In the rapidly evolving world of health care, the integration of advanced technology is not just an option, but a necessity. This transformation is not merely about adopting new tools; it’s about fundamentally redefining how hospitals operate and how clinicians provide care. The key lies in leveraging technology to streamline non-clinical operations, thus freeing up more time for patient-focused tasks. The genesis of a technological revolution in health care The journey into a more tech-integrated health care system begins with understanding the diverse backgrounds of those leading the charge. Leaders with a rich history in software and technology are now turning their attention to health care, seeing an opportunity to apply their expertise in a field ripe for innovation. The convergence of technological acumen with medical expertise is creating a powerful synergy that is redefining patient care. A new approach to health care operations A pioneering vision in the realm of health care technology focuses on simplifying non-clinical health care operations, encompassing areas such as provider data management, workforce management, contract and supply chain management, and compliance, quality, and safety. This approach is not about marginal improvements but a complete overhaul of how health care systems operate, aiming to give health care workers more time to focus on what they do best: caring for patients. The clinical perspective: the impact of technology on patient care From a clinical standpoint, the impact of technology on patient care cannot be overstated. Technologies that enhance communication within health care settings, for example, can significantly reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes. Efficient communication systems ensure that the right health care provider is available at the right time, making a critical difference in emergency situations. COVID-19: a catalyst for technological adoption The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a major catalyst in accelerating the adoption of technology in health care. The crisis highlighted the urgent need for health care systems to evolve rapidly. As a result, there is a newfound eagerness within the sector to adopt technological solutions that can lead to tangible improvements in patient care. Real-life impact: Enhancing health care delivery One of the most compelling aspects of technological integration in health care is the tangible impact it has on the ground. For instance, in intensive care settings, efficient communication tools can be lifesaving, especially when managing multiple critical patients simultaneously. Such technologies not only aid in immediate patient care but also play a significant role in reducing the likelihood of medical errors. Research insights: the potential for reclaimed time Recent research by symplr indicates that by optimizing technological processes, health care professionals could reclaim a significant portion of their time – as much as 20 percent – which could be redirected towards direct patient care. This revelation underscores the potential of technology to revolutionize health care delivery. Focusing on health care workers A unique approach in this technological revolution is the focus on health care workers. By empowering clinicians and administrators with better tools and systems, the entire health care ecosystem, including patients, stands to benefit. This worker-centric approach is a strategic shift from the traditional patient-centric models, yet it indirectly enhances patient care by supporting those who provide it. Bridging the gap: Aligning technology with clinical needs A critical challenge in embracing new technology is aligning the perspectives and priorities of IT professionals and clinicians. Collaborative efforts are essential in identifying and implementing the right technological solutions. Addressing real problems like clinician burnout and operational inefficiencies requires a unified approach from both the technological and clinical sides. Looking ahead: standardization and efficiency in 2024 and beyond The future of health care technology is likely to be marked by a trend toward system-level standardization. This shift aims to create more efficient and interoperable systems that enable health care professionals to work effectively across various settings. Standardization also addresses the current challenges of resource scarcity, particularly in the face of a global shortage of health care workers. Embracing the technological leap: advice for the health care sector For health care institutions still on the fence about embracing new technology, the path forward involves identifying specific challenges and finding the right technological solutions to address them. Committing to these solutions and partnering with the right technology providers is crucial in navigating the complexities of modern health care. Conclusion: a call to embrace change As the health care sector stands at a crossroads, the decision to embrace technology is more than a choice—it’s a strategic imperative. Leveraging technology to solve new and existing challenges will not only enhance patient care but also empower health care workers to practice at the top of their license. The future of health care is inextricably linked to technology, and embracing this relationship is key to unlocking a new era of operational efficiency and improved patient outcomes.

The country was set to host 22 healthcare deals last year, with deal value reaching $4.6 billion, just below the $4.7 billion in 2022. In the Asia-Pacific region, announced deal value reached around $14 billion. “Investors seeking to manage geopolitical risk began to broaden their horizons, with India representing the largest share of announced deal value and continuing to see a long-term rise in biopharma-related activity,” according to Bain & Company’s annual Global Healthcare Private Equity and M&A report. India’s economic growth, business-friendly government, pharmaceuticals manufacturing landscape, and thriving middle class continue to propel investment. “The burgeoning middle class in India is catalysing a significant surge in healthcare expenditure, propelled by the upswing in disposable incomes and the proliferation of insurtech platforms, alongside the presence of private payers. Projections signal a sustained trajectory of growth in healthcare spending,” the report noted. India’s pharmaceutical sector, buoyed by government policies and skilled talent, holds a top-three global position in small molecule and generic manufacturing, satisfying 50 per cent of global vaccine needs. The emergence of biologics as impending generics points to a potential shift, although China’s dominance in generics, leveraging expertise in microbiology, remains a competitive edge, the report said. Globally, the healthcare sector continued to be a hub of private equity (PE) deal activity in 2023, reaching $60 billion in announced deal value, despite higher global interest rates, inflationary pressures, and broader geopolitical uncertainty. Biopharma captured the bulk of dealmaking momentum, attributing 48 per cent of global deal value, including six deals in excess of $2 billion. “Compared to private equity dealmaking globally, we saw relative resilience in healthcare dealmaking last year,” said Kara Murphy, co-lead of Healthcare Private Equity at Bain & Company. In 2024, investors will continue to bet on the transformative nature of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI); new modalities and innovative therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s); and India as a place to deploy healthcare capital at scale. India has historically served as the back end for many US and Europe-focused healthcare data and analytics companies; however, recent years witnessed a surge in direct-to-consumer digital health companies especially in fitness, wellness, telemedicine, and insurtech. “Despite reduced deal activity, Indian firms at the healthcare-tech nexus benefit from robust fundamentals, driven by a digitally-enthusiastic youthful population,” said the report. “In 2024, sponsors will need to establish higher confidence in value creation opportunities earlier and think beyond pure commercial diligence. Successful investors will evaluate a wider set of factors early in their process to create value quickly,” said Nirad Jain, co-lead of Healthcare Private Equity at Bain & Company. –IANS na/rad Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Email Telegram Flip Copy URL Previous article Vishesh Bansal, Ashlesha Thakur begin shoot for 'Gutar Gu' S2 Next article Zeenat Aman reveals how she joined Feroz Khan's 'Qurbani' cast RELATED ARTICLES Extraordinary travel experience from world’s greatest icons May 2, 2024 33-year-old UP woman gives birth to twins after 10 failed IVF cycles April 30, 2024 AstraZeneca admits Covishield jab raises TTS risk.

No simple words can explain what we feel. I love you all. The COVID aftermath has been greater than we expected. I must apologize in that performance was poor in 2023 in many aspects. The economic situation appears to be like a second pandemic, largely due to the healthcare spending, challenged industries and healthcare resources like hospitals and professional schools. Two outdated social and institutional systems need to be creatively destructed or they may eventually crash down. We need a new system upgrade in 1. Welfare, and 2. Healthcare ecosystems. We face new issues that are difficult to control with the current system and we need to move fast. It may be related to phenomena such as food toxicity, drug abuse and low birth rate. The pandemic was about resources. Now we need a ‘pandemic-like’ resource plan change. We need to gather elite healthcare system developers who can bring us the upgraded version.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jan 03, 2024, 07:00am EST Share Save Managing director at TERRITORY Influence , a leading social media and influencer marketing agency activating 4 Mio creators for CPG brands. getty During the Covid-19 lockdowns, many people turned to Google and social media for answers about health issues. The #health hashtag has more than 165 million publications on Instagram today, encompassing illnesses, nutrition and mindfulness. Consequently, digital marketing has become more important, and marketers are turning to key opinion leaders, experts and influencers for digital content and recommendations (while there are significant differences between these three groups , I will simply refer to them as influencers from now on). However, they should approach influence marketing with caution, given some important specifics related to healthcare: Highly regulated products and services. Sensitive consumer needs. Trust and credibility with medical professionals. Educational focus of content. Compliance challenges. Still, the use of influencers in healthcare has reshaped the landscape of how we perceive, access and engage with medical information and services, so let's deep dive into some of the opportunities, but also some of the potential pitfalls. Opportunities Of Influencer Marketing In Healthcare At its core, influencer marketing in healthcare could help with the dissemination of health information, promote awareness about various conditions and treatments, and encourage health prevention among consumers. Here's how influencer marketing can support the healthcare industry: Education And Accessibility Healthcare can be a complex and intimidating topic for many patients. Influencers, on the other hand, possess the ability to simplify medical jargon, making health information more accessible and understandable to the general public. They can break down jargon, explain procedures, and share personal experiences, making health-related topics more approachable and accessible. Whether it's advocating for preventive vaccinations, shedding light on medical misinformation or raising awareness about specific diseases, influencers can serve as conduits for educating audiences online. Destigmatizing Health Issues By sharing personal stories and experiences, influencers can help break taboos around sensitive health topics. Their openness can encourage others to seek help, reducing the barriers to discussing mental health, chronic illnesses or other issues that are often sidelined in public discourse. Being The Catalyst For Change Influencers have dedicated and engaged followers who trust their recommendations; therefore, creators can use their platforms to advocate for important causes. They can raise awareness about issues like mental health, vaccinations or specific medical conditions. By aligning with influencers who are passionate about a particular cause, NGOs, governments, and other healthcare market participants can amplify their impact and drive positive change. Promoting Healthcare Products And Services Collaborations between healthcare brands and influencers can spotlight innovative products, services or technologies. This not only raises awareness but also helps consumers make informed choices about their health and well-being. When an influencer endorses a healthcare brand or service, it carries a level of credibility and authenticity that traditional advertising struggles to match. Humanizing (Digital) Healthcare Healthcare institutions and professionals are sometimes perceived as impersonal or intimidating, with medical communication often perceived as distant and too formal. Moving away from personal interactions in real life toward more digital services and online information creates even more distance. Collaborating with influencers enables healthcare institutions and companies to humanize their approach again. Through influencer partnerships, they can showcase the compassionate and relatable faces behind the healthcare services, building trust and familiarity. Watch-Outs Of Influencer Marketing In Healthcare It is important to keep in mind that leveraging influencer marketing in healthcare demands a heightened sense of responsibility and awareness of potential pitfalls. Here are some areas that healthcare marketers need to pay attention to, as well as pro tips from our own experience of running successful marketing campaigns for the healthcare industry at Territory Influence. Misinformation With great influence comes an even greater responsibility, as the dissemination of misinformation or the endorsement of unverified medical products or practices can have severe health consequences. A few years ago, pharmaceutical company Duchesnay USA learned this the hard way when Kim Kardashian promoted its morning sickness medication Diclegis on Instagram. As Kardashian is not a medical expert, the FDA had to step in . Pro tip: According to Mavrck : ""Influencers in this industry need to be chosen carefully and possess the right credentials to support claims. It takes much more than a big-name celebrity to deliver a powerful message in relation to wellness."" Regulatory Compliance The healthcare industry operates within a framework of stringent regulations to safeguard consumers' interests. Navigating these regulations, especially concerning health claims and endorsement, requires meticulous attention and compliance. A rise in social media content and consumer engagement might result in inconsistent community moderation, missing adverse event detection, and other quality control issues. Pro tip: Marketers in healthcare need to pay attention not only to the influencer content but also to consumer interactions and discussions. AI-powered social listening tools can help healthcare companies to embrace social media and influence marketing. Ethical Dilemmas And Conflicts of Interest Influencers straddle a fine line between authentic storytelling and promotional content. Balancing genuine advocacy with commercial interests can pose ethical dilemmas, leading to potential conflicts of interest that may compromise integrity. Pro tip: Identify influencers who actually have the medical condition you want to treat or prevent so that they can share their own experience. Or partner with real medical experts and help them amplify their content online to reach a broader audience. Summary And Conclusions If done right, partnering with health experts, influencers and key opinion leaders can be very successful and help educate consumers about vaccinations, illness prevention and a healthier lifestyle. Influencer authenticity resonates with audiences seeking relatable voices in a sea of medical information online. By aligning with healthcare brands, they lend their platforms to amplify essential messages, advocating for healthier lives and driving positive outcomes. For healthcare brands, collaborations with influencers offer a transformative avenue to bridge the gap between medical expertise and public awareness. Through influencers, they can show a human face to their services and products to boost brand empathy, consumer engagement and medical adoption.
