Epic v. Google: everything we learned in Fortnite court See all Stories Posted Sep 30, 2024 at 12:01 PM UTC S Quote Sean Hollister Tim Sweeney says his Epic lawsuits are all about freeing the youth: We want our kids to grow up in a world that’s better than this one. I grew up in an awesome world for developers and opportunity, the early days of Apple II computers and PCs, and anybody growing up, coming of age in this industry right now, is best case going to be an Apple and Google serf. That has to change. That must change. Not surprising to hear the man behind “Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite” say this, but it really does encapsulate his war with the tech industry.

Beijing has been rather quiet as TikTok, the first globally successful app born from its domestic tech sector, fights for its life in the U.S. The debate over whether Washington will ban TikTok due to perceived national security concerns related to the Beijing base of its parent company, ByteDance, has simmered for years. In the past, Chinese officials haven’t shied from harsh rhetoric voicing opposition. But now, as a ban seems more likely than ever to take hold, Beijing is holding its cards close to the chest. In the months since legislation that would force TikTok to divest from ByteDance has made its way through Congress and now the courts, spokespeople for China’s Foreign Ministry have demurred requests for comment, referring to previous remarks. (Namely, a March statement from commerce officials that China will resolutely "safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”)

TOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Sep 30, 2024, 06:55 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large At Carnegie Mellon University, Google CEO Sundar Pichai discussed AI's transformative potential and the role of failure in tech development. He emphasized that ambitious projects attract top talent and can result in valuable innovations, even if they fail. Pichai humorously addressed questions generated by AI chatbots, noting a mix-up by Microsoft Copilot. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sees immense potential in AI, viewing it as a transformative technology with the power to revolutionise various aspects of life, however, he also acknowledged that failure is an inevitable part of the process when it comes to developing ambitious technology like AI. He has spoken about this publicly, most recently in a talk at an event at Carnegie Mellon University . Farnam Jahanian, the president of Carnegie Mellon University, used AI chatbots like Google Gemini, Perplexity AI and Microsoft Copilot to generate questions for a hypothetical elevator encounter with Pichai. Jahanian particularly emphasised on questions by Microsoft Copilot: You could inquire, "Could each of you please explain why consumers wouldn't benefit if we were to vote to break up Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon?" To address Google's practices, ask Sundar Pichai, "How is it fair for Google to aggressively promote its own products alongside third-party products? Is this a level playing field for sellers?" CMU President's Lecture Series with Sundar Pichai What was Google CEO’s response Jahanian highlighted that in the first question, saying, “Microsoft is notably missing here, by the way, but this is all for good humour”. When he was clarifying that the second question was “really what we got,” Pichai quipped saying the Microsoft Copilot AI may have confused Google with some other company. “And the second one it's confused about us and some other company, but I leave it up there,” Pichai said. “Great rebuttal,” Jahanian replied. Google CEO on failures in tech Pichai also said that failures are a part of the tech industry and that unsuccessful ventures can yield valuable innovations and attract top talent. “In tech, I think failures are an important part of your journey. When you want to work on really ambitious things, first of all, no one else is working on it, so you tend to have less competition,” Pichai responded to a question on “failure in the tech industry and how does he encourage his team to take risks.” “It attracts the best people in the world... even if you fail in accomplishing what you set out to do, whatever you created in the process will still be incredibly valuable,” he added.

Google employees are known as 'Googlers,' Meta's workforce is called 'Metamates,' and Amazon staff are termed 'Amazonians.' Microsoft employees go by 'Softies' and Nvidia's team is referred to as 'Nvidians.' These names contribute to company culture and values. The use of nicknames, for example at schools, creates a sense of shared identity. In India, students at St. Stephen's College are known as "Stephanians," while those at St. Xavier's School are called "Xaverians." This culture extends beyond educational institutions and into the corporate world where tech companies have given their employees distinctive nicknames that foster a sense of belonging. From " Googlers " at Google to " Metamates " at Meta, these monikers have become part of the company culture. According to a report by Business Insider, comedian John Mulaney recently poked fun at the tech industry's love for corporate jargon in his set he performed for Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference earlier this month. Let's take a closer look at some of the popular nicknames used in the tech industry. Workers at Google are called “Googlers” Probably the most common nickname that even kids may know is ‘Googler’. At Google, employees are known as “Googlers,” with newcomers called “Nooglers” and alumni becoming “Xooglers.” Amazon workforce are “Amazonians” This isn’t very hard to guess. While some probably know it from the movie Wonder Woman, before the word became ‘popular’, Amazon was already calling its workforce as “Amazonians.” Amazon takes a cue from its namesake river. “Metamates” at Meta Following Facebook's transformation into Meta in 2021, employees who were previously called “Facebookers” transitioned to “Metamates”. According to the company's culture page, Metamates “have a sense of responsibility for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It's about taking care of our company and each other.” Microsoft’s “Softies” Microsoft employees have been known to call themselves “Microsofties” or simply “Softies,” – if the word is a bit too hard for you. The name became common when the company in 2020 published a blog post about the “life of a Microsoftie”, as per the publication. Nvidia has a workforce known as “Nvidians” At Nvidia, the chipmaker led by Jensen Huang, employees are called “Nvidians,” a nod to the company's name, which is derived from the Latin word for “envy.” Apple has “Geniuses” Apple, despite its strong brand identity, doesn't seem to have a widely recognised nickname for its corporate employees. While there is no particular nickname, its retail staff are famously known as “Geniuses.” Twitter and Anthropic Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, workers have embraced the nickname “Ants”. Before Elon Musk's takeover and rebranding of Twitter to X, employees were commonly called “Tweeps.” About the Author TOI Tech Desk The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

This funding round is expected to raise as much as $6.5 billion. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion into OpenAI, is expected to add another $1 billion in this round. Ayushi Jain 28-Sep-2024 Apple has reportedly pulled out of discussions to join OpenAI’s upcoming funding round, which aims to raise as much as $6.5 billion. This unexpected move comes just before the round is set to close next week. Apple’s participation would have marked a notable investment from the iPhone maker in another major company, sparking interest among industry watchers. Survey ✅ Thank you for completing the survey! According to a source familiar with the situation, Apple recently dropped out of the talks, despite initial plans to be involved, reports The Wall Street Journal. The funding round, led by venture capital firm Thrive Capital, has attracted other big names in the tech industry. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion into OpenAI, is expected to add another $1 billion in this round. Nvidia, known for its AI and graphics processing technology, has also been in talks to join. Add As A Trusted Source For Google. Add as a preferred source on Google Also read: Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft in talks to invest in OpenAI Besides Microsoft, investment firms like Tiger Global Management and MGX, a company backed by the United Arab Emirates, are also considering participating in the round. Thrive Capital is expected to contribute around $1 billion. However, it’s important to note that it’s possible that participants and their investment amounts could change before the round closes. Some investors may adjust their contributions or pull out entirely, much like Apple has done. Also read: “When actual regulation is on the table, he opposes it”: Ex-OpenAI researcher claims Sam Altman doesn’t support AI regulation OpenAI, the company behind the popular AI tool ChatGPT, is also undergoing a significant corporate transformation. Originally structured as a nonprofit, OpenAI is transitioning to a for-profit company. This change, which was encouraged by many of the investors in the funding round, adds complexity to the process. If OpenAI fails to complete the transformation within two years, investors from this round can request their money back. While Apple’s exit from these talks may raise questions, other tech giants seem to remain committed to supporting OpenAI’s future growth, as AI continues to play a crucial role in shaping the tech industry.

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Google Trial Ends, Execs Emboldened To Speak Outside Courtroom by Laurie Sullivan , September 27, 2024 The Google and Department of Justice (DOJ) trial wrapped up this week, as both attempted to prove several things ahead of closing arguments scheduled for November, just before Thanksgiving. There were expected and unexpected consquences from the trial. The expected began with the DOJ alleging Google engages in anticompetitive behavior and monopolistic practices in three markets of the ad-technology sector connected to “open web display advertising” -- publisher ad servers, advertiser ad networks, and ad exchanges. It rested the case after weeks of sharing hours of expert testimony and introducing into evidence endless quotable emails from Google executives describing their views on the company’s position in the advertising ecosystem. "We'll be able to crush the other networks and that's our goal," said David Rosenblatt, Google's former president of display advertising, describing the company's strategy. The notes were cited in court. advertisement advertisement Google argued that it faces plenty of competition and its business decisions, which the DOJ has characterized as anticompetitive, are intended to create a safer ecosystem for its users -- competition from other companies Microsoft Advertising and increasingly from TikTok and other tech companies building an ad business like The Trade Desk. Then, as the trial ended, the unexpected happen. Executives began willingly speaking out and sharing their views on a variety of companies they beleive to have followed in Google's steps. Lotame Founder Andy Monfried shared an interesting point on X, identifying a "weird evolution" in the ad-tech industry. He said that during the past decade Trade Desk executives have positioned the company as the alternative or "the good guys" when it comes to building a business and delivering value for brands and agencies, in programmatic ad technology -- specifically as an alternative to Google. "I applaud them," he wrote. "They built a tremendous company, and have been incredible entrepreneurs, operators, and marketers. Perhaps the best in our ecosystem of Advertising Technology. It is no small feat." A core thesis, while building an empire, has been for The Trade Desk to tout they are the "anti-Google" -- meaning the "good guys" that will do things differently, and always defer to the ethical and transparent way of doing business on behalf of clients, Monfried wrote. Unfortunately, Monfried wrote, "they became what they preached" and eventually became the "new industry bully." Monfried called The Trade Desk the "new Google" that has begun to throw its "muscle and weight around in a manner that hurts competition, negatively impacts the market" in an to own the chain of events around addressability, enrichment and connectivity. "I just hope they realize that their ascent to the most dominant player in our industry comes with a realization that Google never had," he wrote. " A rising tide lifts many boats (when you become the biggest) -- and not simply, 'lets crush and own the entire data and media' chain of programmatic advertising." An executive at The Trade Desk said the company strictly serves advertisers, not all sides of the ad supply chain. "Such characterizations don’t reflect The Trade Desk’s mission or business," Melinda Zurich, GM of communications at the company, told MediaPost. "The Trade Desk has long stood for supply path integrity and a level playing field for our advertiser clients. Those principles, plus our commitment to never own media, will always underpin our business." ad exchange , ad network , ad serving , ad technology , advertising , digital , display , google , legal , media buying , programmatic Comment Next story loading advertisement More from MediaDailyNews Cox Presses SCOTUS To Throw Out Piracy Verdict Roblox Expands Creator Access To IP-Licensed Game Creation Meta's AI Goal: Commits To Spending $600B On U.S. Projects By 2028 Amazon Fights Prime Video User Bid To Revive Privacy Suit Amazon Reboots Ads System, Agents For Advertising SPONSOR CONTENT Join QSR Marketers in Santa Barbara!

Rep Troy Nehls, R-Texas, arrives for an event to call for the banning of TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing app, at the Capitol in Washington, on Mar 23, 2023.

Get bite-sized news via a new cards interface. Give it a try. Click here to return to FAST Tap here to return to FAST FAST TOKYO: Beijing has been rather quiet as TikTok, the first globally successful app born from its domestic tech sector, fights for its life in the US . The debate over whether Washington will ban TikTok due to perceived national security concerns related to the Beijing base of its parent company, ByteDance, has simmered for years. In the past, Chinese officials haven’t shied from harsh rhetoric voicing opposition. But now, as a ban seems more likely than ever to take hold, Beijing is holding its cards close to the chest. In the months since legislation that would force TikTok to divest from ByteDance has made its way through Congress and now the courts, spokespeople for China’s foreign ministry have demurred requests for comment, referring to previous remarks. Namely, a March statement from commerce officials that China will resolutely “safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” But it would be premature to interpret the recent silence as any sort of indication that Beijing will take this lying down. United States firms with exposure to the world’s second-largest economy, from Apple to Tesla, should brace for collateral blows if a tit-for-tat escalates. And policymakers would be unwise to underestimate the might Beijing may deploy in response to what it has previously decried as unfair “bullying”. A high-stakes DC Circuit Court hearing last week did not go well for TikTok. The odds of it halting a ban plunged from 70 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. And if it fails to win this court battle, the likelihood of undoing that loss is 10 per cent. CHINA WOULD NEVER ALLOW FORCED SALE OF TIKTOK While government spokespeople have shown restraint, Chinese state-backed news outlets offered a window into official thought. Shortly after the Senate passed the ban legislation, the China Daily ran an editorial warning: “The century of humiliation won’t be repeated over TikTok.” It indicated that Beijing views the US attacks on the popular app as in line with an historical pattern of Western exploitation, dating back to when British armies forced Chinese people to buy opium. It warned that attempts to impose coercion and subordination will fail. Separate editorials in other outlets similarly accuse the US of trying to “plunder” ByteDance. Even policymakers on the US-China Commission can’t seem to grasp that Beijing, and ByteDance, would never allow a forced sale of its crown jewel algorithm to a foreign buyer. China tweaked its export laws in 2020 to safeguard “national security and interests,” a move widely interpreted as a response to the first talks of a ban emerging. TikTok’s recommendation engine, which drives individualised content to users’ feeds to keep them scrolling and engaged, has long been cited as the secret sauce of the app’s success over rivals. Related: Commentary: Time is running out for TikTok in the US Commentary: The true victims of China’s foreign adoption ban? The children Some commentators argue that it won’t make sense - especially given the current macroeconomic woes - for Beijing to retaliate with sanctions or further policy signals that would discourage foreign investment amid a decades-low plunge. They claim blocking a sale would hurt ByteDance’s global investors. Yet this fails to acknowledge that Beijing has knee-capped its own tech sector in favour of broader policy goals with a brutal crackdown that has only recently eased. If the past few years have revealed anything about government priorities, it’s that investor returns and fast growth in the tech sector are no longer on top. President Xi Jinping’s mantra of “common prosperity” and high-quality innovation that strengthens its tech independence has taken its place. The US knows the game it’s playing with TikTok is unevenly weighted due to its own place in the global tech hierarchy, but this can also be a double-edged sword. As much as China risks turning away foreign investment by blocking a sale, it would be a win to broadcast to the world that any venture to make it in the lucrative US market isn’t safe. BEIJING MAY BE WISE NOT TO SAY MUCH Chinese officials may also be quietly considering options as they await the outcome of the presidential election. While Donald Trump kicked off this whole saga during his time in office, as a candidate he has since signalled that he would be against an outright TikTok ban because it would boost competitor Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Lawmakers have been quick to fill the space left by Beijing’s silence. They are furiously defending the constitutional right of free speech, while trying to silence a platform that more than 170 million Americans use to express themselves. TikTok is painted as a national security threat, but not only has commander-in-chief Joe Biden’s team joined, it has become a major campaign tool for both presidential frontrunners. The coconut tree memes and “brat” vibes propelling Kamala Harris’ popularity in the polls originated on the app. Related: Commentary: Kamala Harris is being called ‘brat’. What the sigma? Commentary: US law that could ban TikTok has a logic problem It’s ironic that the US is employing an undemocratic process to ban the app in the name of preserving its democracy. Around half of Americans use TikTok. Less than a third support a ban. Seven million US businesses are on TikTok. The supposed smoking-gun evidence that it is a real threat remains classified, kept from the eyes of not just the American public but TikTok’s own lawyers. The ban legislation was fast-tracked through Congress, attached to a foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. Lawmakers worried about social media security risks should instead pass comprehensive laws to protect Americans’ data and safeguard users from threats across all apps. Banning TikTok under these circumstances only gives China’s well-oiled propaganda machine the ultimate ammunition. Maybe Beijing is wise not to say much. America’s actions speak for itself.

Title: Balancing technical skills with a well - rounded education

Article Content:
In recent years, universities worldwide have experienced a surge in the number of students choosing their computing programs. This situation is unsurprising, considering the growing demand for tech-savvy professionals in an increasingly digital world. However, it has brought to light significant challenges for higher education institutions. They must now grapple with the delicate balance of meeting the demands of the job market while maintaining the integrity of a well-rounded education. The rapid increase in computing majors, particularly at prestigious institutions like Stanford and MIT, signals a societal shift towards valuing technical skills over a broader educational mission. This phenomenon, often called the “STEM-ification” of society, underscores a prioritisation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at the expense of the humanities and social sciences. The implications of this trend are multifaceted. On the one hand, the surge in computing graduates is a response to the high demand for tech professionals, driven by the rapid pace of technological advancement and the lucrative job opportunities in the tech industry. For instance, 18% of Stanford University seniors graduated with a computing degree. This proportion has more than doubled in the past decade. Over the same period, at MIT, the rate of computing graduates increased from 23% to 42%. Students are drawn by the promise of high salaries and job security in a field that shows no signs of slowing down. However, this emphasis on computing and other STEM fields raises concerns about the potential marginalisation of the humanities and social sciences. A well-rounded education is crucial for developing critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and cultural awareness—indispensable professional skills, especially in the tech industry where ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity are increasingly important. Integrating technical skills with broader intellectual development can produce well-rounded professionals proficient in their fields, capable of thinking critically and ethically about the implications of their work. Interdisciplinary programs that combine computing with the humanities and social sciences offer a promising solution. For instance, some universities have introduced programs allowing students to major in computing while taking courses in philosophy, sociology, or history. These programs, such as Stanford’s ‘Computing and Society’ or MIT’s ‘Computing, Culture, and Society ‘, aim to produce graduates who understand the broader societal implications of their work, equipping them with the tools to navigate the ethical and cultural challenges they may encounter in their careers. In response to the changing demands of the job market, many companies are now focusing on candidates’ competencies rather than their formal education. Initiatives like Google Career Certificates exemplify this shift. These certificates offer an alternative pathway to tech careers by providing job-ready skills through short, intensive programs. Unlike traditional university degrees, which can take several years to complete, these certificates can be earned in months. They focus on practical skills directly applicable to the job market, such as IT support, data analysis, project management, and user experience design. These certificates provide a quick and accessible route to employment for individuals who may not have the time or resources to pursue a traditional degree. They address the immediate needs of the job market by equipping individuals with the skills employers are looking for. However, this trend also raises questions about the long-term value of such programs compared to a comprehensive university education. As companies increasingly focus on candidates’ competencies rather than their formal education, the value of traditional degrees may be challenged. While these certificates provide a quicker path to employment, they offer a different level of knowledge and critical thinking skills than a traditional degree. Universities must adapt to this new landscape by ensuring that their programs remain relevant and by offering more flexible and diverse pathways to education. This could involve revising curricula to integrate technical skills with broader intellectual development and promoting interdisciplinary programs that combine computing degrees with the humanities or social sciences. Moreover, collaboration between academia and industry is crucial. By working together, universities and tech companies can ensure that curricula stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and that graduates are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the job market. This partnership can also provide students with valuable internships and real-world experience opportunities, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The challenge for universities is to find a balance between meeting the demands of the job market and providing a comprehensive education. The rise of computing programs and initiatives like Career Certificates reflects the changing landscape of higher education and the job market. However, ensuring that students receive a balanced education that integrates technical skills with broader intellectual development is crucial. By collaborating with industry and promoting interdisciplinary programs, universities can prepare students to navigate the complexities of the modern world and ensure they are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in their careers. The future of higher education depends on its ability to adapt to these challenges and innovate in ways that meet the needs of both students and the job market.

Article Content:
Representative image A tech-savvy Indian couple in Canada recently shared insights on their impressive earnings and offered advice on how others in the tech industry can achieve similar income levels. The couple was interviewed by Piyush Monga, the founder of the Instagram channel Salary Scale, during a vox pop in Toronto. High Income in Tech Roles The couple, both tech professionals, revealed their annual earnings—CAD$100,000 each, amounting to a combined family income of CAD$200,000 (roughly ₹1.2 crore). The husband works as a programmer, while the wife is employed in a support role. Upskilling Recommendations When asked how others could earn similar amounts, the husband suggested pursuing technical certifications. “You can go for a technical certification, like Hadoop certification or Cloud Certification,” he said. For those interested in management roles, he recommended the Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Project Management Professional (PMP) certifications, adding that PMP can significantly boost career prospects. The wife echoed his sentiment, agreeing that PMP certification is valuable. However, Monga questioned whether PMP retains its value in today’s job market, considering its widespread availability, and asked if certifications like Cloud might be more lucrative. Relevance of Certifications in Different Domains The husband emphasized that the relevance of certifications depends on the domain. “For example, there are domains where if you have a cloud certification, you will get the job easily,” he explained. He added that cybersecurity certifications also hold significant value, highlighting the importance of domain-specific skills in the IT sector. Live Events He disagreed with Monga’s suggestion that PMP is losing value, stating, “There has to be someone to manage the team, right,” underscoring the continuing need for project management skills in the tech industry. The couple’s insights highlight the importance of continuous upskilling and adapting to domain-specific demands in the tech industry to achieve high earning potential.

Wednesday, November 12, 2025 Advertise with us News SEARCH NEWS NEWS HOME » BUSINESS Bengaluru hosts 36% of GCC workforce in first two quarters of FY25: TeamLease Share Tweet COMMENT New Delhi | September 24, 2024 10:11:45 AM IST Bengaluru has kept its position strong as a prominent hub for GCCs, hosting 36 per cent of the GCC workforce in the first two quarters of the financial year (FY) 2025, a TeamLease Digital report observed. The Karnataka capital's dominance in the high-tech industry is the major reason behind the growth of the GCCs, as per the report, which added that Bangalore has about 37 per cent of GCC talent. Professional Services, which includes BFSI and consulting companies, follow with 21 per cent of the headcount. The manufacturing sector in Bengaluru is also emerging as a significant player, contributing 10 per cent to the total headcount, with automotive and electronics manufacturing leading this growth. The findings also showed Hyderabad accounting for 14 per cent of TeamLease Digital's client base. The city excels in the high-tech industry, which contributes 45 per cent to the GCC headcount. Hyderabad's GCCs are at the cutting edge of digital transformation, leveraging advancements in cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, and data analytics to enhance global operations. The focus on automation and emerging technologies like robotics and blockchain underlines Hyderabad's role as a leader in tech innovation. The Mumbai/Pune region follows closely, with 31 per cent of TeamLease Digital's GCC partnerships. The high-tech and automotive sectors are the most significant in this region, with the high-tech industry making up 33 per cent and the automotive sector contributing 22 per cent of the headcount. Pune, in particular, is emerging as a driver in the automotive sector. This region is also notable for its involvement in the capital markets, a sector that is only served by Mumbai/Pune and Delhi NCR, highlighting critical skills in data mining, predictive analytics, and big data frameworks. Delhi-NCR contributes 22 per cent to the overall GCC headcount, with Software Platform and High Tech each representing 20 per cent of the headcount. This region is unique in its substantial contribution to the oil and gas industry, comprising 6.5 per cent of the GCC headcount. Elaborating on the findings, Neeti Sharma, Chief Executive Officer, of TeamLease Digital said, "Sectors like healthcare, BFSI, and retail have shown remarkable growth. Between 2021 and 2023, these sectors recorded cumulative compound annual growth rates (CAGR) exceeding 30 per cent. This growth is particularly notable, given that during the same period, the broader IT industry was experiencing a downturn. In contrast, the GCC Software and Internet sector maintained steady progress and is projected to reach a CAGR of 6.2 per cent by 2027. Even more promising is the retail and e-commerce GCC sector, which is expected to see the strongest growth at 8.4 per cent CAGR, followed closely by Healthcare at 7.5 per cent."

Here's why travel influencer parted ways with Apoorva Mukhija Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently shared his vision for the future of technology during a live recording of the "Acquired" podcast in San Francisco. He emphasized the importance of open-source models in the ongoing competition within the tech industry. According to Zuckerberg, the debate between open and closed models is more than just a business strategy; it’s an ideological battle that could shape the future of how technology is developed and used. Zuckerberg pointed out that companies like Apple have traditionally followed a closed model, integrating their software and hardware in a way that keeps their source code private. While this approach can enhance security, it limits how quickly innovation can occur. In contrast, he highlighted the success of open ecosystems, like those seen during the PC era with Windows, where a more open model allowed for greater collaboration and faster advancement. His long-term goal is ambitious: over the next 10 to 15 years, Zuckerberg aims to champion the development of open platforms and hopes they will ultimately dominate the tech landscape. He believes that fostering open-source technologies will not only promote innovation but also create a more vibrant and democratic tech industry where anyone can contribute. Meta has already made significant moves in this direction. In 2023, the company launched Llama 2, an open-source AI model that quickly gained traction in the tech community. This was seen as a positive step, allowing developers and researchers to modify and build upon the model. However, open-source technology is not without its challenges. Zuckerberg acknowledged the potential risks, such as misuse by bad actors. For example, Llama 2 has faced criticism for providing access to sensitive information, though Zuckerberg defended the model by saying similar information is available elsewhere. In July, Meta built on this momentum by releasing Llama 3.1, another open-source model that was praised across the tech industry. Many executives described it as an “incredible gift,” highlighting the potential benefits of open-source innovation. Overall, Zuckerberg's commitment to open-source technology reflects a broader shift in the industry, aiming to create more collaborative and accessible tools for everyone.

S’pore universities’ computing enrolment surges, amid industry changes and stiff competition for jobs Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox The demand for computer science graduates has been fuelled by the growth of Singapore’s tech industry. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG Ng Wei Kai Follow topic: Universities - Singapore Published Sep 21, 2024, 05:00 PM Updated Sep 23, 2024, 03:58 PM SINGAPORE – With a near-perfect score for his A-level exams, 22-year-old Kee Song Yang had his pick of university courses before settling on computer science, in part for the promise of a high starting wage. But he came up empty-handed despite sending out dozens of internship applications in the last summer break – signalling the rising competition within the industry. The third-year National University of Singapore (NUS) student , who is worried about his job prospects, is among the swelling numbers of local undergraduates studying computer science and related disciplines who are soon entering a rapidly changing and highly competitive tech industry. Across NUS, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU), the number of young people enrolled in computing and related courses shot up 63 per cent over the last five years, based on enrolment data. Since 2019, the number of students enrolled in NUS’ School of Computing and its computer engineering course, which is jointly organised by the College of Design and Engineering and the School of Computing, has risen 68 per cent, from 3,498 to 5,878. At NTU, the number of undergraduates specialising in computing-related courses has nearly doubled from 1,987 in the 2019/2020 academic year to 3,156 in 2023/2024. Similarly, enrolment in SMU’s computing-related courses jumped from 1,490 to 2,310, up by 55 per cent. In response to queries, NUS said it is seeing greater interest for programmes such as artificial intelligence, computing, computer engineering, as well as data science and analytics. Highly competitive sector Starting salaries for these graduates, who usually enter the tech industry, often top the graduate employment surveys published by universities. In 2023, NUS’ computer science graduates earned a $6,181 median basic monthly salary compared to the $4,313 average for all fresh graduates. Demand has been fuelled by the growth of Singapore’s tech industry, which in 2022 was worth $106 billion – or 17.3 per cent of Singapore’s nominal gross domestic product. Big tech firms, including US companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, as well as short-video sharing app TikTok’s parent company ByteDance and conglomerate Tencent have in recent years made Singapore home. Also in the mix are hedge funds and other financial institutions, which seek such graduates as “quants”, or quantitative traders who execute complex trades using algorithms and other programs , as well as various regional players and startups . The route into permanent positions in these firms is often through internships , which can result in “conversions”, or offers of employment , said fourth-year NUS computer science student Vibilan Jayanth, 21. Roles at established tech firms or financial firms such as Jane Street Capital – which has an office in Singapore – are seen as very prestigious and often well-paid, he added. That is why competition for such internships is fierce, said Mr Vibilan, who sent out 30 applications for internships last year. His peers too had sent out between 50 and 100 applications. While the industry has always been competitive, the growing pool of graduates means the situation is even more dog-eat-dog than before, he said. “It feels like even more people fighting for fewer spots.” Advent of generative AI; changing skills needed More broadly, large-scale industry restructuring due to changing macro-economic conditions like higher interest rates and the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have kept students on their toes . These changes have resulted in widespread layoffs globally over the last few years, which some publications have dubbed The Great Tech Reset. In August, tech giant Intel announced a 15 per cent cut in its global workforce. According to independent tech layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi, 436 tech companies have laid off 137,050 workers in 2024 alone. Closer to home, in January, e-commerce giant Lazada retrenched an undisclosed number of its Singapore staff. Figures from the annual graduate employment survey showed that 88.7 per cent of information and digital technologies graduates found full-time permanent work after six months in 2023, down from 93.2 per cent in 2022 and 93.7 per cent in 2021. Despite this, demand for tech workers in Singapore has rebounded, data from professional networking site LinkedIn showed. The company saw a 29 per cent year-over-year increase for tech industry job postings in June 2024 compared to June 2023. More on this topic Higher starting salaries for SIT’s class of 2023, with tech graduates earning the most askST: Do tech graduates still enjoy good job prospects? This was much better than the 49 per cent year-on-year decrease in June 2023 compared with June 2022 , it told The Straits Times. LinkedIn Apac’s head economist Chua Pei Ying said: “The data also shows that the hiring rate for the tech industry has started to improve in recent months – the hiring rate for June 2024 grew by 2.7 per cent year on year, which is the highest growth in over two years.” While demand for fresh tech graduates is strong, the skills employers are asking of them have changed. Ms Chua said: “We are seeing a significant skill shift accelerated by AI transformation, which will fuel the emergence of new roles in burgeoning sectors.” President of the Singapore Computer Society Sam Liew said the demand for tech roles in Singapore has changed significantly over the past few years, driven by factors such as technological advancements, government initiatives, and shifts in business operations. The job market has faced challenges due to economic uncertainties and changes in the hiring patterns of big tech companies, he said. Despite this, demand for tech roles remains robust, particularly in areas such as cyber security, artificial intelligence and data science, he added. Students’ concerns about the job market are understandable, given the current climate. “However, it is important to note that despite retrenchments, the tech sector remains resilient overall. The demand for tech skills continues to grow across various industries.” One major change in the industry is the arrival of generative AI, particularly the launch of AI-chatbot ChatGPT at the end of 2022. More on this topic New handbook to help S’pore employers hire tech workers based on skills, not academics Singapore’s tech grads in limbo amid shrinking job market The chatbot , which is free to use up to a point, is able to process and respond to questions in conversational form. Its introduction is widely seen as a watershed moment in the use of such technology. It also has applications in programming. NUS’ Mr Kee said: “ChatGPT is actually very good at programming. It’s useful for a lot of the simpler parts of the work.” Universities are working to help students keep pace with the speed of change. Associate Professor Ng Teck Khim, vice-dean for industry relations at NUS’ School of Computing, said it has introduced new courses in AI-related areas, and is also looking into updating the syllabus of existing courses. The school also plans to revamp or introduce new degrees to reflect the latest AI advancements, he added. NTU’s Professor Luke Ong, vice-president (AI & Digital Economy) and dean at the College of Computing and Data Science, said new AI-related offerings for students include an AI and Society computing degree launched in 2024 . Students who show strong aptitude and talent in AI are further stretched with the Turing AI Scholars Programme, meant to develop those interested in AI research, he added. The college also launched a new minor in AI programme in 2024 for all non-computing undergraduates, he said. Getting past gruelling interviews to land a job remains among students’ chief concerns. Said Mr Vibilan: “I feel prepared to function in a role in a company, but it’s getting past the hurdle of the time-trial interviews that seems like a big barrier.” More on this topic Fixing the ‘leaky’ Stem pipeline begins with helping women beat imposter syndrome SMEs to get help in using generative AI, tech workers to be upskilled The interview process for technical roles often involves timed coding exercises , which many students prepare for using LeetCode – a website with practice questions, as well as mock interview preparation . Worried about the future and aiming for a job in big tech, Mr Kee spends many of his free hours on the website to prepare for interviews , or ‘Leetcoding’, as users call it . “I guess I just have to keep on grinding,” he said. Correction note: An earlier version of the story did not include some computing-related courses offered by SMU. The story has been updated to accurately reflect the enrolment in such courses across the universities. See more on Universities - Singapore Big Tech Working life

Money Report In partnership with news Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island nuclear plant, sell the power to Microsoft for AI By Spencer Kimball,CNBC • Published September 20, 2024 • Updated on September 20, 2024 at 4:54 pm BOOKMARKER Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty Images Constellation Energy plans to restart the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island. It will sell the power to Microsoft to support the power needs of data centers. Unit 1 is separate from the reactor that partially melted down in 1979 in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Constellation will rename the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. Watch NBC6 free wherever you are WATCH HERE Constellation Energy plans to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and will sell the power to Microsoft, demonstrating the immense energy needs of the tech sector as they build out data centers to support artificial intelligence. Constellation expects the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island near Middletown, Pennsylvania, to come back online in 2028, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the company announced Friday. Constellation also plans to apply to extend the plant's operations to at least 2054. Constellation stock jumped about 22% on Friday to close at $254.98 per share. Its shares have more than doubled year to date. Microsoft will purchase electricity from the plant in a 20-year agreement to match the energy its data centers consume with carbon-free power. Constellation described the agreement with Microsoft as the largest power purchase agreement that the nuclear plant operator has ever signed. "The decision here is the most powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource," Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez told investors on a call Friday morning. Unit 1 ceased operations in 2019 as nuclear power struggled to compete economically with cheap natural gas and renewables. It is separate from the reactor that partially melted down in 1979 in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. Constellation will rename the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. The facility is named after Chris Crane, who was CEO of Constellation's former parent company and died in April. Constellation will invest $1.6 billion in restarting the plant through 2028, including on nuclear fuel, Chief Financial Officer Dan Eggers told investors during the call. Tech hunts for nuclear Electricity demand from data centers is expected to surge in the coming decades as the tech sector ramps up AI, threatening to strain the electric grid. While estimates vary, Goldman Sachs has forecast data centers will consume 8% of total U.S. electricity demand by 2030, compared with 3% currently. Power demand is also surging from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the adoption of electric vehicles. Rystad Energy has forecast that data center and electric vehicles alone will add 290 terawatt hours of electricity demand by the end of the decade, equivalent to the entire consumption of the nation of Turkey. Tech companies are hunting for nuclear power to meet that growing electricity demand while adhering to their climate goals. In March, Amazon Web Services bought a data center campus from Talen Energy that will be powered by the Susquehanna nuclear plant, also in Pennsylvania, in a first-of-its-kind deal. Oracle recently said it is designing a data center that will be powered by three small nuclear reactors . There is growing bipartisan support from federal and state governments to revive the nuclear industry after a decade-long wave of reactor shutdowns. Three Mile Island would be the second nuclear plant to restart operations in U.S. history. The Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan would be the first, with that plant expected to return to service at the end of 2025. Restart process Constellation anticipates that the NRC will complete the review of Three Mile Island in 2027, Eggers said. The review includes a safety and environmental impact study. "Based on our expertise on plant licensing and regulatory processes and through observation of the Palisades restart, we are highly confident we'll be able to restore the plant's operational licensing authority to the same state that existed prior to the shutdown in 2019," Eggers said. The nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, will also have to review Three Mile Island's impact on the grid before the nuclear plant can restart, Eggers said. Constellation plans to submit a grid interconnection request to PJM next year, the executive said. Eggers said the plant could potentially restart earlier than expected if PJM embraces changes that speed up interconnection requests to address tightening power supplies in the 13-state, primarily mid-Atlantic region that the grid operator serves. "In this rebirth, we see the most powerful sign that America will turn to the enduring promise of nuclear energy, an old and loyal ally that is renewed and ready to light the way forward," Dominguez said.

Careers Ankit Kariya. Image: © Andres Poveda Kinia, Cognizant and Lenovo among the 2024 Diversity in Tech winners by Suhasini Srinivasaragavan 20 Sep 2024 Save article From individuals to organisations, a total of 17 awards were given, celebrating diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. The seventh annual Diversity in Tech Awards took place last night (19 September) at Dublin’s RDS, with wins for Kinia, Fiserv and Workday, among others. Judged by a panel of industry leaders, the awards celebrate diversity, women’s achievements and exceptional leadership in the tech industry. US recruitment company Greenhouse Software , which opened its first EMEA office in Dublin in 2020, won the Diverse Company of the Year Award. Dr Alessandra Sala won the Grace Hopper Award , named after the pioneering computer scientist, and pays tribute to STEM professionals who make a lasting impact on technology and society. With more than 15 years’ experience in research and innovation, Sala is the global president of Women in AI , the co-chair of UNESCO’s Women4Ethical AI and senior director of AI and data science at Shutterstock. In 2021, she received the XV International Prize ‘Le Tecnovisionarie’ in the AI-Industrial Research category. She was previously head of analytics research at Nokia Bell Labs. At the award ceremony yesterday, Sala delivered a keynote about AI excellence and cultivating a diverse ecosystem. “This award celebrates our collective investment and underscores the importance of building a future where women and underrepresented groups can lead, innovate and inspire in a more equitable tech industry,” she said. Speaking to SiliconRepublic.com in 2020 , Sala said a different approach is needed to tackle the gender problem in AI. “The model is not to just state that we have a problem. Stating that we have a problem is obvious to everyone,” she said. “Sharing the same experience and stopping there, it doesn’t move the needle.” Managing director of the awards, Tracey Carney said that “diversity is no longer an optional add-on” for companies. “These awards celebrate not only the companies that have embraced inclusion, but also the individuals who are the driving force behind this transformation. “The people we honour today are not just professionals; they are passionate advocates, many of whom bring lived experience to their work, making their commitment to diversity all the more powerful and authentic.” Winners DE&I Excellence in Leadership Award – Sebastian Gollwitzer (Fiserv) Neurodiverse Inclusion Award – Auticon Technical Guru Award – Nicola McDonnell (Workday) Cultural Inclusion Award – Carelon Global Solutions Hiring Now Think for impact with Liberty IT.

Business Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital warns of bigger annual revenue drop Unnamed high-rolling tech sector client behind the trend at cutting-edge digital ad agency Mind the gap: City trailblazer Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital has been hit by slower spending from the tech sector PA Archive Michael Hunter , Markets reporter 19 September 2024 COMMENTS Sign up for our email featuring expert insight and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and SMEs Sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Martin Sorrell ’s digital advertising agency S4 Capital pointed today to a bigger drop in annual revenue as it reported a half-year operating loss. Lower spending from major tech firms led the decline, with one unnamed major customer in particular cutting back. S4 said: “All Practices have seen some impact from the net revenue reductions, most evident in Technology Services reflecting anticipated lower transformation revenue from one client” Net revenue in the first half fell 13.5% on a like-for-like basis to £376.1 million. Its operating loss was £3.7 million. The firm said: “We target like-for-like net revenue to be down on the prior year, but to a greater extent than that assumed in May 2024 in our last trading update.” It stood by full-year profit guidance. S4 is a digital-only marketing firm, at the cutting-edge of the industry. On the latest trends in the trade, it said there was “a focus on AI driven hyper-personalisation at scale”. Its founder Sorrell, who is one of the best-known names throughout the City, explained: “Trading in the first half reflects the continuing impact of both challenging global macroeconomic conditions and high interest rates. “This particularly impacted marketing spend by some technology clients and our Technology Services practice was affected by a reduction in one of our larger relationships”. The wider ad industry has flocked to the tech sector, seen as a promising source of business amid more challenging conditions in the wider economy, S4’s update is likely to sound alarm bells over the potential limits of budgets even in this fast-growing area. Nonetheless, Sorrell stayed upbeat as he looked ahead, not least as use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues as a major industry theme. The veteran entrepreneur and grandee added: Read More How to opt out of Instagram and Facebook training AI on your photos London scientists developing tools to identify women at high breast cancer risk UK signs first international treaty on artificial intelligence Sponsored Get luxury looks for less at McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Ashford “We continue to capitalise on our prominent AI positioning and we continue to see multiple initial AI related assignments”. S4 has a market value of around £260 million. Its shares fell 3p to 42p, a drop of 7%. MORE ABOUT S4 Martin Sorrell Artificial Intelligence

Title: Six Ideas For Latina Inclusion In The IT Channel
Date: 20240918T210000Z
URL: https://www.crn.com/columns/running-your-business/six-ideas-for-latina-inclusion-in-the-it-channel

Article Content:
Six Ideas For Latina Inclusion In The IT Channel Latinas make up less than 2 percent of the U.S. tech workforce, and roughly 1 percent of engineers in the U.S., however inclusion initiatives often fail to address their specific challenges and barriers. Natalia Herrera, global head of marketing and alliances for channels at Logitech, tells CRN the best ways to fix that problem. The tech industry, while known for its innovation, still faces challenges regarding diversity and inclusion, particularly for Latinas. Despite organizations claiming to value diversity, Latinas continue to be underrepresented in tech and leadership roles. In an interview with CRN, Natalia Herrera, global head of marketing and alliances for channels at Logitech, shares her insights on how inclusive leaders and organizations can help Latinas thrive in the IT channel. Below are six actionable ideas for Latinas striving to make their mark in the tech industry. 1. Break Through Biases And Stereotypes Latinas often face both racial and gender biases, which can limit their career advancement. According to Herrera, biases and stereotypes about Latinasâ€™ abilities and perceived lack of cultural fit remain a significant barrier: "Latinas specifically have not only a racial bias sometimes, but also a gender bias. That can affect hiring, promotion opportunities, and investment." Recognizing and challenging these biases is the first step toward change. Latinas in IT can work to educate themselves and others about these biases while pushing for organizations to adopt more equitable hiring practices. 2. Seek And Build Role Models And Mentorship One of the critical gaps for Latinas is the lack of visible role models in tech leadership. Herrera emphasizes the importance of seeing people like yourself in positions of power: "In the recruiting process, there needs to be specific role models, diverse role models that can lend a pin onto a diverse group of people." Latinas can actively seek mentors and sponsors within their organizations and beyond. By doing so, they can create pathways not just for themselves, but for the next generation of Latina leaders in the channel. 3. Expand Your Network Latinas often face a limited network in the tech industry. Herrera noted that although progress has been made for women in general, there is still work to be done specifically for Latinas: "We see a lot more progress on the women's side, but Latinas specifically, there's still smaller groups that support that scenario." Building a professional network is key to career growth. Latinas can leverage Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and industry-specific organizations to connect with others who share their background and career aspirations. Networking can open doors to new opportunities, mentorship, and support systems that are critical for advancement. 4. Advocate For Tailored Inclusion Programs One-size-fits-all diversity initiatives may not address the unique challenges Latinas face in the workplace. Herrera believes that inclusion programs must be tailored to meet the needs of different groups: "While we're trying to be inclusive of all the groups, each group has different disadvantages... there needs to be a very specific approach to addressing the barriers for their advancement." Latinas should advocate for programs that address the specific obstacles they face in the tech industry, such as targeted mentorship, sponsorship, and recruitment efforts designed to provide them with the support they need to excel. 5. Push For Early Recruitment Initiatives Early exposure to STEM fields is critical for Latinas. Herrera highlights the need for educational institutions and companies to create targeted outreach programs: "We need to see a lot earlier exposure and engagement to STEM programs for Latinas specifically." Latinas can encourage companies to build recruitment pipelines that start early, reaching out to schools and universities that serve underrepresented communities. Being proactive in these efforts ensures that young Latinas see tech as a viable career path. 6. Leverage Cultural Diversity In Business Strategy Latinas can use their unique cultural insights to drive business strategy. Herrera emphasizes the importance of understanding diverse markets, especially when working in global roles: "You don't get that from sitting behind your desk. You actually have to go to the markets and kind of understand that from working with distributors or specific channels of that country or region." Latinas working in the IT channel can advocate for immersive experiences that allow companies to leverage cultural diversity in their go-to-market strategies. This creates meaningful and targeted campaigns that resonate with diverse customers, providing companies with a competitive edge. The Bottom Line Latinas have much to offer the tech industry, but success requires both inclusive leadership efforts and organizational support. By challenging biases, building networks, advocating for targeted inclusion, and leveraging their unique perspectives, Latinas can pave the way for future generations. As Natalia Herrera points out, the power lies in pushing for change while also embracing the diversity that defines the IT channel.

Title: Why Not Buy the Dip on Nvidia , Adobe , and Salesforce and the Run - Up in Oracle With This Vanguard ETF ?

Article Content:
It's been a volatile period for growth stocks, especially tech shares that have seen their valuations put to the test this earnings season. Oracle just hit an all-time high. Nvidia mostly recovered from its sell-off and is now down just 12% from its all-time high. Adobe sold off on earnings but is still up over the last few months. And Salesforce is down around 20% from its all-time high but has also recovered from its lows. Here's why exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT 0.91% ) can be an excellent way to ride the rally in Oracle and buy the dip on Nvidia, Adobe, and Salesforce. Image source: Getty Images. A results-focused market Some folks might look at the market rally in 2024, especially since the beginning of 2023, and say that valuations are overextended. But overall, the growth has been impressive, and earnings have been strong enough to support the broader market rally. Nvidia reported blowout results but fell due to valuation concerns. It has since made up the bulk of that sell-off. Adobe's growth has slowed, and the stock is down year to date despite gains in the major indexes and tech sector. The company has developed impressive new apps and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, but it has yet to monetize these solutions enough to justify higher costs. Salesforce is also down slightly year to date for reasons similar to Adobe. Its results have failed to impress Wall Street as enterprise software remains a challenging pocket of the tech sector. Unlike Nvidia, which benefits from higher demand for computing power to support AI models, enterprise software companies must justify their AI investments with higher sales and profitability , which hasn't exactly gone smoothly for industry leaders like Adobe and Salesforce. Meanwhile, Oracle is at the top of its game and continues to see surging cloud revenue . The stock has rocketed over 53% higher in 2024 thanks to strong results, but it's beginning to look expensive . Enthusiasm could lead to stretched valuations. But good-to-excellent results from most top tech companies mean that the rally isn't purely based on euphoria. Investing in proven winners Every investor wants a great deal, but timing the market is ultimately a losing battle. Instead of trying to buy the lowest low in a phenomenal company, it's far more impactful to pick the companies that have what it takes to grow well into the future. Apple and Microsoft , the two largest companies by market capitalization, are perfect examples of why timing the market is overrated. Both companies have been known winners for decades. Yet five years ago, Apple and Microsoft had around $1 trillion market caps. Today, they are each worth over $3.2 trillion. So buying either stock at an all-time high five years ago would have still more than tripled your money. And there's reason to believe both are still good buys now because they allocate capital well and have a clear runway for returning value to shareholders by growing the core business, buying back stock, and raising their dividends. Building a diversified basket of tech stocks Buying a fund like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple yet effective way to invest in the broader tech sector. Instead of overly focusing on which stocks have sold off or which ones are in favor, the ETF offers a way to take a step back and look at the big picture. The tech sector includes a variety of industries, including hardware and software companies, designers and makers of semiconductors, electronic component companies, and more. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a bet that the sector will continue leading the broader market higher and that tech companies will be able to back up their premium valuations with future earnings growth. The ETF features a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 42.2 and a dividend yield of just 0.6%, so it's not a good fit if you're looking for value or passive income. The fund contains 318 stocks, with exposure to top names like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Broadcom , Salesforce, Adobe, Advanced Micro Devices , Oracle, Qualcomm, and more. It has a minimum investment of just $1 and an expense ratio of 0.1% -- or $1 for every $1,000 invested. Approaching the tech sector with the right mindset The tech sector makes up 31% of the S&P 500 and has been the driving force behind the bull market for over a decade. Buying tech stocks requires the acceptance that you aren't getting a good deal based on traditional valuation metrics like the P/E ratio. It also demands patience, a high risk tolerance, and an ability to hold through periods of volatility, since the sector can suffer severe drawdowns in a matter of months. If those factors sound acceptable, then the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be a great way to buy and hold many top tech stocks and let exciting growth themes play out over the long term.

Eight out of 10 Asian tech professionals recognise UAE's growing reputation as a tech hub; 45% of tech workers would relocate to the UAE, outperforming Germany and Hong Kong as a popular relocation destination for tech talent; 93% of respondents think it is important to have a government that is supportive of the tech industry DUBAI , UAE, Sept. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent survey conducted by Capital.com , a global trading platform and the Middle East's fastest-growing technology company*, has revealed that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is rapidly gaining recognition as a competitive tech hub. The survey polled 1,000 respondents across Singapore , Hong Kong , Vietnam and India , and found that 81% of Asian tech professionals view the UAE as a growing tech hub. A further 76% of respondents say the UAE provides a conducive environment for the tech industry. Tarik Chebib, CEO, Middle East, Capital.com The UAE's growing reputation as a burgeoning tech hub is fuelling interest among tech workers across the region, with nearly half (45%) of respondents expressing a willingness to relocate to the UAE for work, out-ranking countries like Germany (38%) and Hong Kong (20%) as popular relocation destinations. This places the UAE in close competition with other prominent destinations such as Singapore (46%), the UK (57%), and the US (52%) as preferred locations for relocation among tech professionals. Commenting on the findings, Tarik Chebib , CEO, Capital.com, Middle East , said: Get the latest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . "With 8 in 10 respondents from our recent survey recognising the UAE as a competitive tech hub, it's clear that the region is gaining momentum as a favourable destination for tech talent. Asia's tech professionals have traditionally gravitated to cities in the UK, the US and Singapore to further their careers, so it's encouraging to see the UAE stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this cohort and get the recognition it deserves as an attractive location to live and work." Government support is the key factor contributing to UAE's growing reputation as a tech hub and relocation destination of choice. Of those surveyed, 93% think it is important to have a government that is supportive of the tech industry, highlighting the UAE's concentrated push to develop the country as a hotspot for international tech talent. Advertisement The majority of those surveyed (74%) cite the UAE's banking, visa, special healthcare/health insurance packages, and real estate services for qualified tech professionals, as factors. More broadly, respondents also say that a high quality of life (60%), attractive remuneration (54%) and the UAE's strategic location (52%) also feed into their decision to relocate. "As a leading partner of the UAE's NextGenFDI initiative, we have seen first-hand the government's commitment to support and grow the tech sector. The UAE's business-friendly environment, forward-thinking policies, investment in innovation, and position as a gateway to the Middle East , Africa and Asia , makes it an ideal location for companies and talent alike. Capital.com is proud to contribute to the sector's growth and innovation in the UAE." said Chebib . While all respondents indicated a ' willingness ' to relocate for work, 47% indicated that they are ' actively' looking to relocate, highlighting the huge potential for the UAE to attract and retain tech talent. "As a company operating in the UAE that is licensed by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), we need to draw on an exceptional pool of talent to meet our exacting business and regulatory needs. This means searching for the best talent, from anywhere in the world. Given the UAE's pro-talent stance and growing appeal as a tech destination for professionals, we have had no problem recruiting talent from as far afield as the UK, Europe and Australia . Employees are eager to relocate to a country that not only supports their personal needs but also provides fertile ground for further development within the tech sector," added Chebib .

Taiwan's tech industry is a key link in the global supply chain [Carl Court/Getty Images] By Erin Hale and Alastair McCready Published On 18 Sep 2024 18 Sep 2024 Click here to share on social media share2 Share facebook twitter whatsapp copylink Save Taipei, Taiwan – Taiwan’s crucial tech industry has been unwittingly drawn into Middle East politics after revelations that thousands of exploding pagers used to kill members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group were manufactured using the branding of a Taiwanese firm. Taiwanese tech company Gold Apollo on Wednesday denied that it had manufactured the AR-924 model pagers that exploded en masse in Lebanon, saying they had been made by a European company named BAC through a licensing deal.

The logo of Taiwanese company Gold Apollo is seen outside its office in New Taipei City on September 18, 2024 [Yan Zhao/AFP] Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had no record of direct exports of the devices to Lebanon and that the pagers may have been modified after manufacturing. Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Times and Reuters news agency, citing unnamed officials, reported that Israeli authorities had placed small amounts of explosive material in the pagers before the detonations. Israel has not commented. Analysts in Taiwan expressed doubt that the Taiwanese government or Gold Apollo would have willingly participated in the apparent attack, which Lebanese authorities say killed nine people and wounded more than 2,700 others. Advertisement Still, the incident draws unwelcome attention to Taiwan and its globally renowned tech industry, which produces the lion’s share of semiconductors used to power practically all electronics worldwide. Jhy-Chern Liu, a professor at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, said he was “shocked” at the news and that people on the island were concerned. “Even though Taiwan has been very close to the US in all aspects, I do not believe that any companies in Taiwan would be involved in a deadly plot like this, considering that Taiwan is an open society and a full democracy. Any hint of ideas like this is simply impossible and unthinkable,” Liu told Al Jazeera. “I do not think the Gold Apollo company would be so unprofessional or stupid to be involved …,” Liu added. While Taiwan is unlikely to have been directly involved, the incident nonetheless raises uncomfortable questions for Taiwan’s tech industry going forward, given its importance for global supply chains, said Yachi Chiang, a professor in tech law at National Taiwan Ocean University. “This incident will be a huge, critical lesson for the industry,” Chiang told Al Jazeera. “The Taiwan tech industry used to think they are only manufacturers of hardware, so they have nothing to do with politics, they are doing their own business. But not any more.” The revelations have also brought the fallout of the war in Gaza to Taiwan’s front door. Taiwan typically keeps its distance from global conflicts and geopolitical controversies except in cases involving China, whose government in Beijing claims the self-governing island as a province. Since the war in Gaza began in October, Taipei has stayed largely silent on the number of Palestinian deaths, although it did condemn Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel. Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, which, like most countries, does not officially recognise Taipei, but they both have close ties with the US. While Taipei is one of the most diplomatically isolated governments in the world with just 12 formal allies, it punches above its weight in global influence thanks, in part, to its powerful tech industry. A security staff member walks past a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company logo at the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu on July 5, 2023 [Sam Yeh/AFP] The island is home to TSMC, which manufactures about 90 percent of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips, which make up the backbone of Taiwan’s export-dominated economy. About two-thirds of Taiwan’s exports, which account for about 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), are classified as machinery and electronics, ranging from advanced iPhone chips to small components like the screws used in car engines. Advertisement Besides cutting-edge tech, Taiwan’s factories also produce more antiquated technology such as pagers, which run on less advanced chips than smartphones. Taiwan’s economy is also dominated by small and medium enterprises such as Gold Apollo, which was founded in 1995 and specialises in pagers and small wireless communication devices used by restaurants and hotels. Chiang said the incident in Lebanon highlighted the need for Taiwanese tech companies to pay more attention to their supply chains, even as Taipei has signed onto initiatives like the US-led Clean Network to keep Chinese tech out of Western telecom infrastructure. “You may recall the United States, they advocated for the Clean Network, clean infrastructure – this is because in each of the links of this whole supply chain, it could be the weakest link, but we don’t know which link that might be,” she said. “That’s why it’s necessary to have a whole clean network and whole clean infrastructure – you can see the necessity here.” In Taiwan, where the public is used to China’s threats to “reunify” with the island by force if deemed necessary, Tuesday’s attack also prompted questions about the island’s security. Some Taiwanese netizens wondered if pagers could be used in a similar attack by Chinese tech companies in the future. “What we should worry about is that the other side of the Taiwan Strait will follow the same pattern and attack us,” one user wrote on the popular Reddit-like message board PTT. “Taiwan just wants to sell things, okay?” another wrote. “How others mess around is the business of the Middle East.”

The Okanagan tech sector in British Columbia is delivering an outsized economic punch relative to its population size, according to a new report from tech accelerator Accelerate Okanagan. Although the Okanagan accounts for less than 10 percent of BC’s population, the report revealed that its tech sector contributed an impressive $4.98 billion to the economy in 2023. By comparison, BC as a whole, with a population of over five million, saw its tech sector generate $16 billion in gross domestic product in 2022. Accelerate Okanagan’s fourth economic impact study shows the region’s economic impact has grown nearly fivefold from $1.02 billion in 2013. That figure is determined using Statistics Canada’s input-output models . The Okanagan is home to 787 tech companies employing 32,645 people. The Okanagan region, which surrounds its namesake lake in south-central British Columbia, encompasses cities like Kelowna, Vernon, Penticton, and Salmon Arm. While its population may be small compared to major urban centres like Vancouver, it is home to 787 tech companies employing 32,645 people. Among the Okanagan’s four census regions, the Central Okanagan—home to its largest city, Kelowna—was the driving force behind much of the area’s economic growth. The region generated $3.01 billion in 2023, employing over 19,747 people, according to Accelerate Okanagan’s report. The report revealed that 61 percent of local tech companies in the Okanagan are under nine years old, and 58 percent have already reached profitability. Top sub-sectors in Okanagan tech include advanced manufacturing, with companies like RainStick Shower and 4AG Robotics, cleantech with firms like Lomi and GreenStep, and SaaS businesses such as Minga and Trellis. The report noted that quality of life, climate, and commute times were listed by respondents as some of the key benefits of building a tech company in the Okanagan. The greatest challenges for local founders, however, include access to capital and attracting new customers, according to the report. RELATED: Saskatchewan tech sector employment doubled over four-year period: report “The struggle to easily access growth capital and tech talent is a universal issue, but it’s magnified in the Okanagan by the region’s distance to major urban centers,” the report reads. Sourcing technical talent also appears to be a challenge cited by those surveyed in the report, which is being exacerbated by a higher cost of living sweeping BC and other Canadian provinces. However, the study found that the region’s reputation as a destination for young talent is taking hold, with 46 percent of employees being under the age of 35. The report noted that startups, for example, are benefitting from local graduates from institutions like Okanagan College and the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus. The report also found that the overall sentiment within the region’s tech ecosystem is largely positive, with 65 percent of tech companies preparing to grow their workforce in the coming year.

The creator of Linux detailed the latest Linux updates at the Linux Foundation's Open Source Summit Europe event. Credit: Shutterstock At the Open Source Summit (OSS) Europe event in Vienna, Austria, on Sept. 16, the always colorful Linus Torvalds took the stage in a fireside chat to detail his views on the latest open source and Linux developments. The Linux Foundation , which hosts the event as well as employs Torvalds, used the summit to make a series of announcements. Among the news: The free5GC open source 5G core software project is moving to the Linux Foundation. The CAMARA project issued its first release, providing common network APIs for telcos and hyperscalers. AWS moved its OpenSearch technology to new governance under the Linux Foundation . Linux kernel 6.11 release is out. “We’ve had a very good regular cadence of releases, and it has resulted in the fact that we’re doing the releases every roughly nine weeks,” Torvalds said. “That means that releases are not exciting, and they’re not supposed to be. They are timely, and they are hopefully very reliable. But exciting is not, I think, the goal.” What’s new in Linux The Linux kernel is the core component of any Linux distribution. Torvalds emphasized that most kernel changes are still driver updates. That said, core kernel development continues even now, 33 years after he first started Linux. “I’m still surprised by the fact that we’re doing very core development,” Torvalds said, citing recent work on fairly low-level virtual file system code and discussions about memory management and “…things that have been around forever.” This continued evolution, he suggested, is driven by the continued expansion of the hardware base but also the continued expansion of the user base. One of the most significant recent milestones in Linux development has been the completion of the real-time Linux project, which Torvalds wryly described as having a very brief development cycle of about 20 years. The real-time Linux project brings a high level of determinism to operating system functions. This project exemplifies the sometimes lengthy process of kernel development. “While kernel development is very active, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you can get a new feature, file system, or anything into the kernel very quickly,” Torvalds said. “There’s often a long development period that people seldom even see.” Torvalds remains optimistic about the state of open source Contrary to concerns about recent tech industry layoffs and reduced corporate involvement in open source, Torvalds painted an optimistic picture. “I feel like open source is doing very well,” he said. “People take open source for granted now in a way that they absolutely did not just two decades ago.” Torvalds highlighted the democratizing effect of open source, particularly for newcomers to the tech industry. He noted that any new programmer can use open source as a way to enter the industry and make connections without necessarily having gone to the right schools or having the personal connections that are often needed in many other industries. For those looking to start new open-source projects, Torvalds advised finding a niche that is both personally interesting and meaningful to others. “In the tech industry, so much is about the hype. Everybody is following everybody else like lemmings off a cliff, trying to chase the next big thing, and I don’t think that’s a successful strategy,” Torvalds said. “I think you need to find something that isn’t what everybody else does and excel at that and be the first to do something slightly different.” SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER From our editors straight to your inbox Get started by entering your email address below.

September 12, 2024 EEOC Puts High Tech Employers on High Alert Regarding Discrimination Christopher DeGroff , Christopher Kelleher , Andrew Scroggins Seyfarth Shaw LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Seyfarth Synopsi s : The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) has issued a report that should have high tech employers on high alert. According to the EEOC’s findings, analysis, and enforcement information, there are barriers to equal employment for high tech jobs, which the Agency intends to address through heightened enforcement efforts. It is important for all employers – not just high tech companies – to understand the EEOC’s report and be mindful of the agency’s strategic position it signals to avoid becoming the target of the EEOC’s enforcement efforts. On September 11, 2024, the EEOC issued a report entitled High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech Workforce and Sector 2014-2022 , which analyzes “demographic disparities for workers in 56 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations and the industries employing them.” In addition to providing an assessment of the current state of diversity in these fields, the report also discusses the most common discrimination charges filed by high tech sector workers with the EEOC. The report follows on the EEOC’s Strategic Enforcement Plan (“SEP”) for fiscal years 2024-2028, which stated, in part, that “[t]he continued underrepresentation of women and workers of color in certain industries and sectors (for example, construction and manufacturing, high tech, STEM, and finance, among others), are also areas of particular concern, especially in industries that benefit from substantial federal investment.” (We’ve written previously about the proposed and final SEP .) EEOC Findings of Underrepresentation of Certain Workers in High Tech Jobs The report lists numerous findings that show, according to the EEOC, that the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, female, and older workers in the high-tech industry is due to “discriminatory barriers,” which the EEOC intends to address by proactively investigating charges of discrimination and pursuing litigation. The EEOC also plans to provide technical assistance and engage in extensive education and outreach efforts aimed at getting employers to comply with laws enforced by the EEOC. The EEOC’s specific findings include: Female, Black, and Hispanic workers remained substantially underrepresented in the high tech workforce and sector. According to the EEOC, between 2005 and 2022 there was very little change in the representation of Black workers and virtually no change in the representation of female workers occurred in the high tech workforce. Black, Hispanic and Asian workers were purportedly underrepresented in managerial positions compared to their participation in the high tech workforce overall. While women are nearly half of the total U.S. workforce, the EEOC reports that they were just 22.6% of the high tech workforce in all industries, and only 4% of the high tech workforce in the high tech sector. The EEOC suggests that the high tech workforce is generally younger than the total U.S. workforce; 40.8% of the high tech workforce are ages 25 to 39, but only 33.1% of the overall workforce. Workers over age 40 in the high tech workforce reportedly lost ground between 2014 and 2022, declining from 55.9% to 52.1%. EEOC Charge Filings in the High Tech Sector The report provides charge filing information from 2022 (the most recent year for which the EEOC has reported data). The data show that the four most common types of charges filed in the high tech sector are: (i) retaliation; (ii) disability discrimination; (iii) race discrimination; and (iv) sex discrimination. Further, age, pay, and genetic information discrimination charges are more prevalent in the high-tech sector than in other sectors, with age discrimination charges representing the greatest difference in filings as compared to other sectors. Employers are likely to see surge in enforcement action by the EEOC in these areas, particularly with respect to Black, Hispanic, female, and older workers. Implications for Employers Employers in the high tech sector and with high tech employees must remain on high alert when it comes to the EEOC. The EEOC announced in the SEP that it intended to focus its enforcement efforts on this sector, and this report demonstrates that the EEOC is doing just that. As such, employers in the high tech industry and with high tech employees should be familiar with this report, and the EEOC’s promise to pursue large scale enforcement efforts in this space. Employers in all industries should also mark the take-away that the EEOC continues its focus on systemic hiring and recruiting enforcement in a wide variety of sectors.

September 12, 2024 EEOC Research Finds Unequal Opportunity in the High Tech Sector and Workforce U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: WASHINGTON – The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) today released a report, “ High Tech, Low Inclusion: Diversity in the High Tech Workforce and Sector from 2014 - 2022 ” which highlights demographic disparities for workers in 56 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations and the industries employing them. The report assesses the current state of diversity in the high tech workforce and those employed in the high tech sector. It also discusses the most common discrimination charges filed by high tech sector workers with the EEOC, building on previous reports from 2016 and 2017 by the EEOC and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) , respectively. The EEOC report released today acknowledges that employers have made limited progress toward including qualified workers of all backgrounds in the high tech sector and high tech workforce but concludes that significant barriers still remain to equal employment opportunity in high tech. The magnitude of the underrepresentation for some demographic groups, particularly for women and Black workers, combined with research and the EEOC’s experience enforcing anti-discrimination laws, suggest that discrimination likely contributes to the relatively low employment of women, Black workers, Hispanic workers, and older workers in high tech. “Sixty years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, there is a high degree of underrepresentation and a disturbing lack of career advancement for female, Black, and Hispanic workers in the high tech workforce, despite the recent period of growth in high tech occupations. America’s high tech sector, which leads the world in crafting technologies of the future, should not have a workforce that looks like the past,” said EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows. “These data raise serious questions that deserve serious answers.” Burrows said, “At the Commission, we will work to identify instances in which discrimination has contributed to these disparities. It is important for high tech employers to self-assess and address any discriminatory barriers limiting employment opportunities and to implement proactive policies to increase inclusion. Everyone deserves access to these high tech opportunities, which often provide competitive pay, benefits, job security, and stability.” Findings from the report include: Female, Black, and Hispanic workers remained substantially underrepresented in the high tech workforce and sector. Between 2005 and 2022 there was very little change in the representation of Black workers and virtually no change in the representation of female workers occurred in the high tech workforce. (see Section III) Black, Hispanic and Asian workers were underrepresented in managerial positions compared to their participation in the high tech workforce overall. (see Section V) While women are nearly half of the total U.S. workforce, they were just 22.6% of the high tech workforce in all industries, and only 4% of the high tech workforce in the high tech sector. (see Section V, Tables 11 and 12) The high tech workforce is generally younger than the total U.S. workforce; 40.8% of the high tech workforce are ages 25 to 39, but only 33.1% of the overall workforce. Workers over age 40 in the high tech workforce lost ground between 2014 and 2022, declining from 55.9% to 52.1%. (see Section V, Table 9) Charges of discrimination filed with the EEOC in the tech sector were more likely to involve discrimination based on age, pay, and/or genetic information than those filed in other sectors. (see Section VII) Given its findings, the report recommends that high tech companies proactively examine barriers limiting employment for women, older workers, Black workers, and Hispanic workers. The EEOC prevents and remedies unlawful employment discrimination and advances equal opportunity for all. More information is available at www.eeoc.gov .

Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC ( LSE:SMT ) View Price & Profile Scottish Mortgage jumps following Nvidia recovery Published: 10:01 12 Sep 2024 BST Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC (LSE:SMT) has added more than 3% to its share price following a bullish session in the US tech sector. Nvidia Corp, which is Scottish Mortgage’s largest holding (comprising 6.8% of its total portfolio) closed 8% higher on the Nasdaq 100 index on Wednesday, marking the end to a bearish period for the superstar chipmaker. Nvidia shares have been out of favour following its second-quarter earnings in early September. While the Silicon Valley giant and primary Wall Street play on the artificial intelligence sector beat revenue expectations, concerns were raised about the trajectory of its AI chip sales. This led to a record $270 billion being wiped from Nvidia’s valuation. But Nvidia shares staged a bumper recovery yesterday, sending shares surging over 8%. In turn, Scottish Mortgage, being one of Britain’s foremost investors in the group, shared in the positive sentiment. Scottish Mortgage is a prominent tech investor, with major holdings in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and a raft of unlisted companies including Elon Musk’s SpaceX . This makes the FTSE 100 investment trust susceptible to market shifts in the US tech sector. At the time of writing, Scottish Mortgage shares were swapping for 819.19p with a market capitalisation of £10.6 billion. Continue reading

Asia funds create alliance to help funnel billions into Vietnam Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Vietnam’s digital economy is expected to surpass US$90 billion in 2030 from US$30 billion in 2023. PHOTO: AFP Follow topic: Technology sector Published Sep 12, 2024, 12:55 PM Updated Sep 12, 2024, 05:05 PM HANOI – Several regional private equity firms have banded together to establish a Vietnamese alliance, aiming to facilitate US$35 billion (S$45.7 billion) of investment into the country over the next decade. The newly established Vietnam Private Capital Agency (VPCA), founded by five partners from funds including Golden Gate Ventures, Do Ventures and Monk’s Hill Ventures, will organise seminars, support private equity firms and both lobby and work with the government on policy. Its goal is to facilitate investment in sectors from agriculture to education to healthcare, said Mr Vinnie Lauria, a board member for the agency. It is unclear how the association arrived at its investment projection, which is several times higher than what Vietnam’s tech sector attracts annually at present. But many investors tout the country’s potential at a time US-China tensions are prompting businesses to relocate factories and target new markets for growth. Vietnam’s digital economy is set to surpass US$90 billion in 2030 from US$30 billion in 2023, according to a joint report from Google, Temasek and Bain & Company. “Vietnam is a hot market,” said Mr Lauria , a Golden Gate founding partner . “The motivation to establish the VPCA stemmed from key developments in Vietnam, including rising wages and GDP (gross domestic product), increasing FDI (foreign direct investment), export growth post-Covid-19, government innovation programmes and rapid infrastructure development.” The industry association hopes to broaden its membership to 100 individuals by the end of 2025, from more than 40 now. Existing member firms also include Vertex Ventures, Ascend Vietnam Ventures and Mekong Capital. Vietnam’s start-up scene has exploded in the past years, driven by the rise of firms such as games developer VNG. But as with much of South-east Asia, its tech sector has struggled to raise capital since a post-Covid-19 downturn. In 2021, Vietnam drew a record US$2.6 billion through 233 private deals, up from US$700 million via 140 deals a year prior, according to the Google report. But total capital invested in Vietnamese tech start-ups in 2023 plunged 17 per cent to US$529 million, placing it third among South-east Asian countries, according to a separate report from Do Ventures and the Vietnam National Innovation Centre.

Title: Best Technology ETFs | Bankrate

Article Content:
gorodenkoff/Getty Images Menu List Icon Table of contents Back to top Trend Unchanged Icon Arrow Up Icon The technology sector moves quickly, so if you’re looking to invest here, it could make sense to buy a tech exchange-traded fund (ETF). A tech ETF is an easy way to build a tech portfolio, letting you play the sector if you think it’s going to run higher – and you can do it without analyzing the individual companies. An ETF also provides diversification , reducing your risk compared to buying a few individual stocks. Here are some of the best tech ETFs to consider for your investment portfolio, with data as of April 23, 2025. What are the main kinds of tech ETFs? The tech sector is large, and for purposes of classification, it’s called “information technology” as part of the GICS classification system . That system breaks the tech sector down into three major industry groups: Software and services — This industry group includes software companies and IT services companies. Technology hardware and equipment — This group includes three main areas: communications equipment; technology hardware, storage and peripherals; and electronic equipment, instruments and components. Semiconductors and semiconductor equipment — This group includes the “chip” companies that make semiconductors and those that produce supporting equipment. If you’re looking for broad exposure to tech, you can find funds that invest across the sector, giving you a diversified cross-section of players. Best tech ETFs 1. Best software & services ETF iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) This ETF tracks an index composed of North American software companies and interactive media companies. Top holdings include Oracle, Microsoft and Salesforce. 5-year returns (annualized): 14.2 percent Expense ratio: 0.41 percent Dividend yield: n/a 2. Best internet ETF First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (FDN) This ETF aims to match the investment results of the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which tracks stocks of U.S. internet companies. Its largest holdings include Meta Platforms , Amazon and Netflix. 5-year returns (annualized): 9.2 percent Expense ratio: 0.51 percent Dividend yield: n/a 3. Best semiconductor ETF iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) This ETF tracks an index composed of U.S.-listed stocks in the semiconductor industry. Its top holdings include Broadcom, Nvidia and Texas Instruments. 5-year returns (annualized): 19.1 percent Expense ratio: 0.35 percent Dividend yield: 0.8 percent 4. Best diversified tech ETF Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) This ETF tracks a benchmark index of the information technology sector, giving investors a diversified cross-section of the sector. Top holdings include Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft. 5-year returns (annualized): 18.6 percent Expense ratio: 0.09 percent Dividend yield: 0.6 percent What to look for in an ETF When investing in ETFs, it’s useful to look at a few aspects of each ETF so that you actually buy what you think you’re buying. Here are three key things to look for: The sub-sector — Each sub-sector may respond differently to developments in the industry. For example, software companies will respond differently to growing demand than semiconductor companies, which often have to deal with the cyclicality of that sub-sector. So you need to know what kinds of companies your ETF owns. The investment track record — The track record of the ETF can give you an indication of how the fund might perform in the future, though there are no guarantees. Has the ETF outperformed or underperformed the industry? The sub-sector can heavily influence the track record, since not all tech sub-sectors perform the same. The expense ratio — Pay attention to the expense ratio , which tells you how much it costs to own the fund annually as a percent of your total investment in it. Finally, it’s worth noting that larger ETFs tend to charge lower expense ratios, because they can spread the costs of running the fund across more assets. So the cheapest funds may often be the largest funds, and a low expense ratio is a key measure of what makes a top ETF. How to invest in tech ETFs An ETF can make it easier for individual investors to invest in the tech sector , but because of the various industry dynamics at play, you’ll still need to know some of the sub-sectors you’re investing in. While some sectors do well almost perennially, others may be more cyclical and have more booms and busts, depending on their specific dynamics. The ETFs above give you a highly liquid way to invest in the tech sector, but you’ll want to carefully consider which sectors you’re investing in. If you want to invest in an upswing of the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, you may want a fund that’s focused exclusively on that industry group. If you’re right, you may enjoy even greater profits than you would earn with a more broadly diversified tech ETF. Similarly, you may want to invest in one of the most profitable areas of the market – software companies. The big appeal of software is that these firms can operate with enormous margins as they grow their sales. Because the incremental costs on software sales are low, much of every incremental dollar of sales may add to pre-tax profit. Bottom line Investors looking for exposure to the tech sector have a few different options to play it, from funds that invest in sub-sectors to those that invest across the sector. So it’s important to know which sector you’re investing in and the potential risks and returns offered by each ETF. For this reason, some investors stick to broadly diversified index funds, such as those based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 index , and don’t worry too much about a sector’s ups and downs. — Bankrate’s Brian Baker contributed to an update of this story.

Title: Workers with AI skills top of employer wishlists amid expected hiring surge in coming months

Anne-Marie Walsh Wed 11 Sep 2024 at 03:30 Workers with AI skills are top of tech employers' hiring wishlists as a major surge in recruitment is predicted in the coming months. A new survey by ManpowerGroup Ireland published today says Irish tech companies expect a resurgence in hiring plans in the next three months. This follows a prolonged period of stagnant hiring plans and downsizing. The report calculates that employers’ “net employment outlook” or optimism for the period from October to December this year stands at 39pc, up from 6pc in the previous three months. The “net employment outlook” is calculated by subtracting the number of employers who expect a fall in hiring from those who expect an increase. This optimism is driven by fresh demand for highly skilled specialists, especially candidates with AI skills. More than half of employers expect AI to create more jobs than it replaces over the next two years. The ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey reveals the highest level of optimism since the post-pandemic hiring boom. Demand for high-skilled roles like AI specialists, data engineers, cloud architects, cybersecurity specialists, and developers is expected to ignite tech sector hiring. Despite this, hiring in “high volume”, or large numbers of workers, is expected to remain subdued. “Following a period of redundancies and hiring freezes made in response to economic turbulence and post-pandemic over-hiring, the tech sector is now looking to the future with a sense of cautious optimism.” said Jonny Edgar, Managing Director at ManpowerGroup Ireland. He said employers feel confident about the potential of AI to create more jobs than it replaces, and there’s a growing appetite for specialists in generative AI and machine learning. However, he said it is going to be a mixed picture “and it remains to be seen whether businesses’ optimistic attitude is reflected in the reality of hiring trends over the coming years”. The IT sector in Dublin is the most confident about recruitment, and has adopted AI more than elsewhere. "The stability of a growing economy has given big tech the confidence to plan for growth, and most of that is increasingly concentrated in the capital," said Mr Edgar. He noted that Ireland’s GDP is projected to grow by 1.2pc this year and 3.6pc next year – the highest rate of any country in the Eurozone. "With inflation cooling and workforce participation increasing, businesses have reason to be optimistic," he said.

(DC File Photo) London: Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. "By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court," the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission's original decision in 2017 accused the Silicon Valley giant of unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. Google made changes to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. The company started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. Google is also appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties involving its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence. Google is facing particular pressure over its digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial set to begin Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges the company holds a monopoly in the “ad tech” industry. British competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in “ad tech” while the EU is carrying out its own investigation.

LONDON — Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the bloc’s top court ruled against it Tuesday on a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Union’s top court rejected Google’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who’s expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commission’s top official overseeing competition. Experts said the rulings illustrate how watchdogs have been emboldened in the years since the cases were first opened. Advertisement One of the takeaways from the Apple decision “is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their (collective) muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary,” Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The Google ruling “reflects the growing confidence with which competition regulators worldwide are tackling the perceived excesses of the Big Tech companies,” said Gareth Mills, partner at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. The court’s willingness “to back the legal rationale and the level of fine will undoubtedly embolden the competition regulators further.” The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. Advertisement “We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,” Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. “Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,” Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court’s decision, saying it shows how the bloc’s competition law “remains highly relevant” in digital markets. “It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day,” Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. “It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They don’t need to depend on Google to reach out to customers.” Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of 4.125 billion euros ($4.55 billion) involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of 1.49 billion euros ($1.64 billion) over its AdSense advertising platform. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. European Commissioner and Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said that the shopping case was one of the first attempts to regulate a digital company and inspired similar efforts worldwide. “The case was symbolic because it demonstrated even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable. No one is above the law,” Vestager told a press briefing in Brussels. Advertisement Vestager said the commission will continue to open competition cases even as it enforces the Digital Markets Act. The DMA is a sweeping rulebook that forces Google and other tech giants to give consumers more choice by following a set of dos and don’ts. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. Vestager, who said she had been braced for defeat, hailed it as a landmark victory for “tax justice.” It was a surprise win for the commission, which has previously targeted Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat with tax rulings that were later overturned on appeal. They were part of the EU’s efforts to stamp out sweetheart deals that let companies pay little to no taxes in a fight that highlighted the debate over whether multinational corporations are paying their fair share around the world. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it “total political crap.” Then-U.S. President Donald Trump slammed Vestager, who spearheaded the campaign to root out special tax deals and crack down on big U.S. tech companies, as the “tax lady” who “really hates the U.S.”

The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer. Recommended Videos "By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and thus upholds the judgment of the General Court," the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. The commission punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. “We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts,” Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. “Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services,” Google said. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. European consumer group BEUC hailed the court's decision, saying it shows how the bloc's competition law “remains highly relevant" in digital markets. "Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival comparison shopping services were virtually invisible," director general Agustín Reyna said. “Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from clothes to washing machines.” Google is still appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties, which involved its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence. Google is now facing particular pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial that began Monday , the U.S. Department of Justice is alleging the company holds a monopoly in the “ad tech” industry. British competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in ad tech while the EU is carrying out its own investigation. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A rocket launches from launchpad. (Courtesy of Adobe Stock/Ryan Chylinski) Cal State Fullerton has been awarded a nearly $5 million NASA grant to launch the new SpaceIgnite Center for Advanced Research-Education in Combustion to prepare a diverse workforce in the aerospace industry. As part of the grant project, the SPARC Center will build capacity in aerospace research to support future space exploration missions and boost the number of underrepresented students in STEM careers, said Haowei Wang , professor of mechanical engineering, who is directing the grant project. The SPARC Center will introduce students to the aerospace industry through new courses and participation in research experiences at CSUF, Clemson University and the University of Washington. Students will also have the opportunity to intern at the NASA Glenn Research Center and engage in activities with industry partners to develop professional networks. Haowei Wang, professor of mechanical engineering According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the global aerospace market is projected to grow from $321.5 billion in 2022 to $678.17 billion by 2032, Wang shared. “A tremendous number of new career openings will arise in this field, such as the application of sustainable aviation fuels,” he said. “Southern California is a hub for the aerospace industry with companies such as Boeing and SpaceX. Our students will have a unique advantage in seizing these job opportunities.” Plans also include creating a focus area in aerospace engineering for the university’s bachelor’s degree program in mechanical engineering and building a pipeline for students to enter doctoral programs at the two partner institutions and other top-tier research universities. Additionally, the center will offer research experiences to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students at Santiago Canyon College and encourage them to transfer to CSUF. “These efforts will help increase the number of underrepresented students who earn a STEM degree, propel interest in careers at NASA or the aerospace industry and diversify the workforce,” Wang said. Co-directing the five-year grant project, which starts Oct. 1, are CSUF’s Chean Chin Ngo, chair and professor of mechanical engineering; Jidong Huang, chair and professor of electrical and computer engineering; and Megan Drangstveit, director of Project RAISE . The Department of Mechanical Engineering in the College of Engineering and Computer Science currently offers several aerospace-related courses such as Aerodynamics, Propulsion Systems and Combustion, Wang said. The SPARC Center plans to build upon the curriculum by developing new courses in space technology, space flight, orbital mechanics and thermodynamics, which relate to the properties of gas mixtures and combustion processes. High-pressure combustion and supercritical oxidation research is essential in the aerospace industry to optimize the performance of aircraft and space vehicles, explained Wang, whose research interests focus on combustion and education. “Our research aims to better understand the injection and mixing process of supercritical fluids to improve aircraft engine efficiency at high pressures,” he said. CSUF students will conduct aerospace research at the NASA Glenn Research Center. (Courtesy of NASA) At the NASA Glenn Research Center, faculty and students will have access to the Cleveland, Ohio, facility to learn about supercritical water oxidation reclamation. With this new technology, reclaimed water secures the water supply for long-duration space exploration missions, Wang said. Wang hopes that these efforts will spark student interest in the aerospace field and ignite their future careers. “I am confident that through the SPARC Center, students will learn about leading technology in the aerospace industry, acquire technical skills and develop an innovative spirit to become leaders in the aerospace industry.” The NASA award was made possible through the Minority University Research and Education Project Institutional Research Opportunity (MIRO) grant, funded by the agency’s Office of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Engagement.

close Video 'CyberGuy': Spaceplane breaks barriers, reaching incredible heights, speeds Tech expert Kurt Knutsson explains how Dawn Aerospace is advancing a reusable spaceplane to make space travel more affordable. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! Dawn Aerospace, based in Christchurch, New Zealand, is making waves in the aerospace industry with its groundbreaking approach to creating a reusable spaceplane. But why should this matter to you? Imagine a future where space travel is as routine and affordable as flying across the country. This is the vision Dawn Aerospace is working towards, and its recent achievements bring us one step closer to that reality. GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE Uncrewed Mk-II rocket-powered spaceplane (Dawn Aerospace) (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Major advances in spaceplane technology Dawn Aerospace's latest test flight , conducted as part of its Campaign 2-2 development program, saw its uncrewed Mk-II rocket-powered aircraft reach transonic speeds of Mach 0.92 and an altitude of 50,000 feet. This achievement represents a substantial enhancement in performance, with improvements of three to five times compared to previous metrics. The company is now ready to begin Campaign 2-3 in September, where it hopes to achieve supersonic flight for the first time. The overarching goal is to create a spaceplane that combines the performance of a first-stage rocket with the predictability and rapid turnaround of a conventional aircraft. KURT’S PICKS: EARLY LABOR DAY DEALS Uncrewed Mk-II rocket-powered spaceplane (Dawn Aerospace) (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) NASA'S DRAGONFLY DRONE CLEARED FOR FLIGHT FOR SATURN'S MOON, TITAN The vision behind Dawn Aerospace The philosophy behind Dawn Aerospace's development strategy is reminiscent of NASA's X-15 program from the 1950s and 1960s. The company focuses on incrementally developing the spaceplane by starting with a conventional aircraft design and progressively enhancing its performance and capabilities with each campaign cycle. This method allows the aircraft to take off and land from a runway like a traditional plane while gradually incorporating advanced technology. Campaign 2-2 was a big success for Dawn Aerospace, with three flights achieving all their goals. Now, they're gearing up for Campaign 2-3, which will use the Mk-IIA aircraft. This plane is expected to break the sound barrier and confirm that the design works well at different speeds and altitudes. After that, they'll move on to the Mk-IIB, which will have more power, 10% more thrust and 30% more total impulse than before. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET Uncrewed Mk-II rocket-powered spaceplane (Dawn Aerospace) (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) THE RACE TO FLOAT TOURISTS TO THE EDGE OF SPACE IS HEATING UP Future goals and aspirations Dawn Aerospace has set ambitious targets for its Mk-II spaceplane. By the end of 2025, the company hopes to climb faster than an F-15, fly higher than a MiG-25 and exceed speeds greater than the SR-71 Blackbird. Additionally, they aspire to be the first vehicle to fly above the Karman line, defined as 62 miles altitude, twice in a single day. Many of these records have stood for over 50 years, highlighting the ambitious nature of their goals. The company has invested approximately $10 million in the program so far and plans to complete it for under $20 million in total. Dawn Aerospace's rapid progress through flight testing, compared to other rocket development programs, can be attributed to its core philosophy and design methodology.

Home latest pakistan world sports showbiz entertainment Royal Hollywood business health Sci-Tech Food Fact Check big picture Videos shows Watch Unlock the sky Globally, aerospace and defence industry commands an impressive annual market of $697 billion By Imran Jattala | August 24, 2024 A representational image of the iCube Qamar in space seen in this still taken from a video. — CGTN The aerospace industry represents the pinnacle of innovation, driving both technological advancement and economic growth. As artificial intelligence (AI) and information and communications technology (ICT) continue to evolve, Pakistan finds itself at a critical juncture of economic transformation. Aerospace tech presents a high-growth avenue. In a groundbreaking collaboration, Ignite NTF, the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunications (MoIT&T), and the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park (NASTP) have established a dedicated Aerospace and ICT Innovation Centre. Advertisement This centre, the National Incubation Centre for Aerospace Technologies (NICAT), is the region's first Aerospace & DeepTech Incubation centre, reshaping the country's aerospace and deep-tech landscape. Globally, the aerospace and defence industry commands an impressive annual market of $697 billion, with commercial aerospace valued at $298 billion. Boeing forecasts a demand for over 43,500 new airplanes worth $7.2 trillion by 2040, underscoring a substantial growth opportunity. However, Pakistan's current metrics reveal considerable untapped potential. For example, the cost of a flight per mile in Pakistan is $0.064, compared to $0.049 in neighbouring countries. Additionally, Pakistan's aircraft seats per person ratio is 0.03, compared to India's 0.16, Nepal's 0.11, and Bangladesh's 0.04. To address these challenges and harness the opportunities, Pakistan has outlined comprehensive policies. The National Aviation Policy aims to advance the aerospace sector through technology and innovation, enhancing infrastructure, regulatory reforms, and research initiatives. The National Space Policy complements this by focusing on developing indigenous satellite technology for improved communication, Earth observation, and navigation systems. It promotes public-private partnerships to drive innovation and investment while emphasising international collaboration to access advanced technologies and research. The NASTP exemplifies this commitment. As a nationwide network of science and technology parks, NASTP aims to elevate the aerospace sector through advanced research and collaboration, attracting global aerospace companies and research institutions. It seeks to become a hub for cutting-edge aerospace technologies, supporting the development of new materials, systems, and solutions. By integrating industry leaders, government bodies, and academic institutions, the NASTP drives scientific advancement, stimulates economic growth and creates high-tech jobs. Parallel to this, the NICAT is set to leverage Pakistan's aerospace potential. NICAT, focusing on aerospace, deep-tech, and ICT, provides access to specialised equipment, advanced production facilities, R and D labs, and a global marketing network. Its goal is to stimulate growth in Pakistan's aerospace and high-tech manufacturing sectors, akin to Vietnam's economic transformation, which saw high-tech exports rise from 10% to over 40% of total manufactured exports within a decade. The potential of aerospace technologies to address challenges in mobility, healthcare, agriculture, and emergency services is immense. In the mobility sector, advancements such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and enhanced satellite navigation systems can revolutionise transportation in cities like Karachi and Lahore. These technologies promise to alleviate congestion and improve travel efficiency. In healthcare, aerospace innovations in medical imaging, telemedicine, and air ambulances can significantly enhance diagnostic capabilities and emergency medical services, especially in remote areas. In agriculture, remote sensing technologies and aerial spraying can optimise crop management and increase yields, benefiting Pakistani farmers. Aerospace technology also plays a crucial role in emergency services by improving search and rescue operations and disaster response through advanced satellite monitoring and drones. Recent advances in space technology highlight this potential. The successful launch of ICUBE-Qamar, Pakistan's first lunar mission, aboard China's Chang'E-6, showcases the country's growing capabilities in space exploration. This mission, aimed at lunar surface imaging and magnetic field data collection, underscores the need for a comprehensive space policy to guide future initiatives. International examples highlight the impact of public-private partnerships in advancing aerospace technology. India's collaboration between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and private companies has led to innovations such as the Mars Orbiter Mission and Chandrayaan-3. China's space programme, through partnerships with private firms, has achieved milestones in lunar exploration and satellite technology. Similarly, Turkey's partnership with Turkish Aerospace Industries has enhanced its capabilities in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite technology. These global examples demonstrate how public-private partnerships can drive technological innovation and economic growth. Pakistan should adopt a similar strategy, leveraging NICAT and other initiatives to advance collaboration among government, academia, and industry. This approach will enhance Pakistan's strategic position and stimulate economic growth through high-tech innovation. The aerospace sector presents immense opportunities for Pakistan. Continued state investment, a supportive policy framework, and a focus on high-tech sectors, particularly aerospace and space technology, will drive sustainable economic growth. NICAT and the ICUBE-Q mission highlight the transformative potential of innovation and international collaboration. By embracing public-private partnerships and prioritising high-tech manufacturing, Pakistan can secure its place at the forefront of technological advancement and economic development, alongside its international counterparts.

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways The Defense News Top 100 list of defense companies for 2024 includes five Turkish firms, up from four in 2023, amid rising global demand for Turkish defense products and increasing maturation of the Turkish defense industrial sector in terms of breadth and sophistication. Ranked Turkish companies include: ASELSAN (42, up from 47 last year): producer of defense electronics, especially communications and sensors. ASELSAN was the first Turkish company to crack the Top 100 in 2008 and has consistently been the leading Turkish defense revenue generator. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI or TUSAS ) (50, up from 58): leader in Turkish defense aerospace joined the Top 100 in 2012 and has been the second-ranked Turkish firm since. ROKETSAN (71, up from 80): producer of unguided rockets and guided missiles has seen revenues grow in large part due to integration of its products on Turkish unmanned systems Machine and Chemical Industry ( MKE ) (84, new): producer of small arms, artillery and ammunition; shifted from a state-owned enterprise to a joint stock company in 2022. Has helped meet booming demand for artillery and related munitions. Military Factory and Shipyard Enterprise ( AFSAT ) (94, new): aircraft, naval and land systems production and overhaul. Major deals with Pakistan (MILGEM) Burkina Faso/Togo (minesweepers). Several intriguing aspects of this grouping stand out. First, Turkey occupies an elite tier among international arms producers. Only eight countries have more than two companies in the Top 100, and only three — the U.S., U.K. and China — have more Top 100 firms than Turkey. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Top 100 is here: Find out how defense companies performed in FY23 The U.S. is in a class of its own, but with 25% defense export growth and $5.5 billion revenue in 2023 , the Turks have risen to near the top of the second tier. Second, arguably the most dynamic sector in the Turkish defense industry — unmanned systems — has yet to produce a Top 100 firm, but seems poised to do so moving forward. BAYKAR , makers of the TB2 Bayraktar and Akinci Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles, has become the standard bearer for Turkish defense innovation and operational impact across various global hotspots. TAI produces high-quality drones as well, and a half-dozen other companies have established Turkey as an innovation and price-performance leader in the field. That five Turkish companies not centered on unmanned systems made the Top 100 makes clear that an understanding of Turkish defense needs to look beyond the headline-generating drones. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Third, such growth could not have happened without an expanding network of clients and partners for the Turkish defense industry; while indigenization has increased the milli ve yerli (locally/nationally produced) portion of domestic defense needs, globally significant firms require foreign markets and partnerships. Turkish defense sector firms — there are over 3,500 total — have built partnerships with Ukraine , the U.K. , Pakistan , Gulf countries and many others . The Turkish Ministers of Defense (Yasar Guler) and Defense Industry (Haluk Gorgun) addressed a bilateral Defense Industrial Base conference in Washington on the sidelines of the recent NATO summit, and touted the Turkish defense sector as young, dynamic, enjoying unique access in the Mideast, Africa, Balkans, Central and South Asia — and uniquely positioned to partner with U.S. firms. Guler assessed during the conference that Turkish exports in the first half of 2024 showed continued growth, up 20% year on year. An interesting bit of context for this year’s Top 100 is the directed efforts in Washington and Ankara to deepen and broaden defense cooperation between the two NATO allies. The Turkish American Business Council (TAIK, headed by Murat Ozyegin) and the American Turkish Business Roundtable (ATBR, led by retired Gen. James Jones) have convened two conferences in 2024 to bring U.S. and Turkish firms together to explore areas for collaboration and cooperation in the defense sector. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement With the example of the recently approved F-16 deal and joint venture for 155mm artillery ammunition between Turkish and American firms , we might expect to see many more such joint ventures emerge. The Turkish defense industry still faces growing pains and dilemmas, though. The International Institute for Strategic Studies noted in a recent study that the Turkish defense industry is at a crossroads: Having increased self-sufficiency and developed significant export capabilities through defense sector indigenization, it has developed a new dependence on sustained exports and defense industrial cooperation for advanced subsystems. Substantial autonomy does not mean full independence in the defense sector but rather continued complex interdependence. This implies that continued growth will require proactive consultation and mutual compromise between Ankara, Washington and NATO allies in Europe. Another check on growth has been the Turkish government’s struggles with inflation, which is currently subject to a significant campaign of monetary tightening. Upward pressure on interest rates from the battle against hyperinflation has made domestic bank loans less attractive for developing small firms into major defense industrial players. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One solution has been for such firms to pursue public listing rather than domestic bank or government financing. Demand remains high in the global market for the solid price-performance balance that has typified Turkish defense products. That augurs well for the continued growth of the five current Top 100-member Turkish firms and those aspiring to join the club. If 2024 sees progress in Ankara’s efforts to bring down inflation, continued macroeconomic stability and sustained Great Power Competition, this year’s strong performance from the Turkish national defense sector should be reprised or accelerated over the next twelve months.

It's a brave new world for aerospace propulsion company GE Aerospace ( GE 0.39% ) . After operating as an industrial conglomerate for more than 130 years, growing to become a bellwether, blue chip industrial firm, GE spun off its various core businesses. Since April 2, 2024, the history-steeped GE stock ticker symbol has represented GE Aerospace, a leaner company exclusively focused on civilian and military propulsion systems. Though it has only been a stand-alone company for two quarters now, GE Aerospace is off to a profitable start. Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.39 %) $ -1.22 Current Price $ 310.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.05 - $ 312.72 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 2.7M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % GE Aerospace's fantastic second quarter of 2024 The company reported strong earnings that included across-the-board growth in orders, operating margin and profit, and free cash flow. Orders up 18%, to $11.2 billion Adjusted revenue up 4%, to $8.2 billion Operating profit up 37%, to $1.9 billion Adjusted earnings per share up $0.46, to $1.20 per share Free cash flow up $200 million, to $1.1 billion These second-quarter results come on the heels of a similarly strong first quarter. Clearly, GE Aerospace is building momentum as a stand-alone entity. Besides the profitable results, the company also issued upward revised guidance for full-year 2024, forecasting free cash flow of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, operating profits of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.20. The bullish revision to its guidance makes sense, since the company also reported new agreements to supply engines for 34 aircraft for four different airlines. As part of GE Aerospace's focus on operational results, the company reported progress on its Flight Deck strategic plan. By the close of the second quarter, it had made progress growing efficiencies at the majority of its 15 largest suppliers. In total, GE Aerospace's second quarter was chock-full of encouraging news. GE Aerospace is executing an investor-friendly capital allocation plan The profitable operating results from the first two quarters of the year aren't the only encouraging signs for investors in GE Aerospace. Since operating as a stand-alone company, GE Aerospace has been implementing a capital allocation plan that favors investors. The plan involves the regular payment of dividends as well as share repurchases. During the second quarter of 2024, the company repurchased 11.7 million shares and paid a dividend of $0.28 per share; the dividend is currently yielding 0.66% on a forward basis. As part of the company's overall strategic plan that is focused on operational leanness, GE Aerospace either completed or reached agreements to sell several legacy insurance and licensing businesses. The focus for the future is very much on the core propulsion business, and management seems determined to help shareholders reap the rewards of its pinpoint focus. GE Aerospace stock is fully valued and not a buy at current levels Things are going well for GE Aerospace, and with the more concentrated focus on propulsion, growing sales and earnings, and an emphasis on rewarding shareholders, there is little for investors to quibble with -- except for the share price. Up over 80% in the last year, shares have come a long way very quickly. Analyzing GE Aerospace on traditional valuation metrics, especially in comparison to competitor RTX Corporation ( RTX +0.11% ) , reveals that shares are currently not attractive on a valuation basis. Ticker Price-to-free cash flow per share Price-to-earnings ratio Price-to-sales ratio Price-to-book value ratio Dividend coverage ratio GE 52.0 40.3 2.7 9.9 8.1 RTX 35.4 21.4 2.4 2.6 0.7 On every one of the traditional valuation metrics shown in the table, GE Aerospace is more expensive than RTX; in several cases, substantially so. One area where GE Aerospace shows more potential than RTX is in its dividend coverage; its coverage ratio is substantially higher than RTX's. This higher ratio not only means that GE Aerospace can easily afford its dividend, it also shows there is substantial room to increase its dividend, which could be attractive to income investors. The bottom line is that GE Aerospace is off to a strong start as a stand-alone company, but its shares are too expensive right now. Value-oriented investors should watch for a drop in share price, looking for an opportunity to buy this quality company "on sale."

Howmet Aerospace ( HWM 0.40% ) stock is up a whopping 75% in 2024 and rose 14.7% in the last week to Friday morning trading. The latest leg up is due to its impressive second-quarter earnings release earlier this week. Howmet's end markets The company generates around 52% of its sales from commercial aerospace and 16% from defense aerospace, with commercial transportation at about 18%. The remaining 14% is under the "industrial and other" heading. Its crucial end markets are jet engine components, aerospace fastening systems, and airframe structural components. Expand NYSE : HWM Howmet Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.40 %) $ -0.84 Current Price $ 208.90 Key Data Points Market Cap $84B Day's Range $ 204.80 - $ 209.96 52wk Range $ 105.04 - $ 211.95 Volume 1.4M Avg Vol 2.1M Gross Margin 30.03 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % Key customers include aerospace and defense giants GE Aerospace (12% of 2023 revenue) and RTX (9%). While it's no secret that end market demand for airplanes (commercial or defense) remains robust, and manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs, there are questions about delivery rates. Boeing's delivery issues are well documented , and Airbus recently lowered its guidance for airplane deliveries. Moreover, this year, GE Aerospace has significantly reduced its 2024 guidance for production of the LEAP engine, which powers the Airbus A320 neo and the Boeing 737 MAX. Howmet's earnings dispel fears That said, Howmet beat expectations for the second quarter, and management raised its full-year revenue, earnings, and cash-flow guidance. Instead of a baseline case of $2.35 in earnings per share (EPS), management now expects $2.55. Image source: Boeing. Discussing the airplane volume issue on the earnings call, CEO John Plant said that, despite slowing its production, Airbus was still increasing its requirements. Meanwhile, parts orders at Boeing "continue to be at levels above the actual 737 and 787 build rates." Indeed, Boeing expects a recovery in build rates on the 737 MAX to hit 38 a month by year-end. That would be good news for Howmet, and it can continue its strong operational performance.

GE Aerospace : Turkish Aerospace, TUSAŞ Engine Industries and GE Aerospace Sign MOU to Extend Collaboration on HÜRJET Advanced Training Jet Program Published on 07/22/2024 at 11:05 am EDT - Modified on 07/22/2024 at 11:06 am EDT Publicnow Share GE Aerospace -0.39% GE Aerospace F404 turbofan engines would be integrated into the HÜRJET program's new variants Complementary capabilities among three companies support success of first Turkish-manufactured training jet TEI would assemble, inspect, and test the F404 engines, and provide MRO services FARNBOROUGH, England - July 22, 2024 - GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) announced today that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Turkish Aerospace and TUSAŞ Engine Industries Inc. (TEI) to evaluate and collaborate on integrating GE Aerospace's F404 engine into new HÜRJET aircraft variants, an extension of the companies' current relationship on the HÜRJET program. The agreement reflects the success of the HÜRJET advanced training jet program, the first aircraft of its type to be manufactured in Türkiye. The collaboration, which extends the three companies' existing collaboration on phase 1 of the HÜRJET program, supports Türkiye's advanced-technology industrial base and strengthens its position as a technology and engineering hub for the global and defense aviation industry. The prior agreement among the three companies saw the F404 engine successfully incorporated into the Turkish Air Force's HÜRJET training jet, which is currently undergoing qualification. The HÜRJET is expected to be highly competitive in the global training jet market. "This aircraft fulfills a critical role in modern pilot training by delivering excellent performance in a single-engine, tandem-seat configuration, alongside modern avionics and high-performance features. We believe this MOU will bring success to all parties," said Dr. Mehmet Demiroğlu, President and CEO of Turkish Aerospace. Under the agreement, the three companies agreed to pursue collaboration on flight testing of the HÜRJET program's new variants and to explore applications of other engine and system products of GE Aerospace's Defense & Systems business. For these new variants and potential new customers, the parties are exploring TEI, a joint venture company between GE Aerospace and Turkish Aerospace established in 1985, to perform the assembly, inspection, and testing of the F404 engines in Türkiye. TEI would also provide assembly, maintenance, repair, and overhaul for the engine for Turkish Aerospace HÜRJET aircraft and export customers. The subject agreement will also serve the purpose of enabling TEI to potentially provide services for global F404 end-users for platforms other than HÜRJET. "For the past 40 years, TEI has been a major manufacturing supplier for military and commercial engines for international OEMs, as well as an exceptional authorized service provider for various military engines worldwide," said Prof. Mahmut F. Akşit, General Manager, TEI. "Today's agreement reflects this heritage and extends our work on one of the nation's most important aircraft programs. TEI plans to perform production of the engines and provide integrated logistics support (ILS) for end-users. We strongly believe that our solid commitment and partnership in the program will add another success story to Türkiye's defense and aviation industries." TEI is an important contributor to GE Aerospace's global supply chain - manufacturing hundreds of engine components for GE Aerospace and its partners*, including turbines and compressors for CFM LEAP, GEnx, and GE9X engines, and prototyping for the CFM RISE** (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program. "Through this MOU, GE Aerospace is proud to deepen our nearly six-decade commitment to Türkiye's economic development and participate in a program that builds on the strengths of each party to create a program with global prospects," said Amy Gowder, President & CEO, Defense & System at GE Aerospace. "As long-term partners, GE Aerospace, Turkish Aerospace, and TEI complement one another, enabling continued success for the HÜRJET program." Sixteen nations have F404-powered aircraft in operation or on order, reflecting the turbofan engine's position as one of the most versatile engines in its class and a proven engine of choice for Air Force applications around the globe. GE Aerospace has been a committed partner to Türkiye for nearly 60 years. With offices and facilities located in Istanbul, Ankara, and Gebze, GE Aerospace's 440+ employees support an installed base of more than 2,300 commercial and defense engines across the country.

Supersonic flights at unlimited speeds for MK-ii aurora Back in 2020 , Dawn Aerospace introduced its suborbital spaceplane , Mk-II Aurora. Fast forward to 2024, the New Zealand-based aerospace company has received its certification from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to fly its rocket-powered aircraft for supersonic flights at unlimited speeds. This certification also allows the plane to be flown beyond the pilot’s line of sight without needing special restricted airspace. It’s a milestone for Mk-II Aurora, which has completed 50 flight tests under both jet and rocket power since July 2021, even operating under more restrictive licenses. Dawn Aerospace poses its rocket-powered aircraft as the first air vehicle ever to fly to 100 kilometers altitude, towards the suborbital, and make it happen two times in a single day. Aside from conducting supersonic flights, the aircraft can also fly for high-speed flight research, earth observation, as well as other defense and civil uses. all images courtesy of Dawn Aerospace Dawn aerospace to set new record for rocket-powered aircraft Dawn Aerospace worked closely with local agencies like the CAA, NZ Space Agency, and other agencies for several years prior to receiving the certification. They went through rigorous checks and testing to ensure that the aerospace company’s rocket-powered aircraft could deliver its performance enough to carry out supersonic flights. Now, their Mk-II Aurora is ready for another goal: to fly up to 100 kilometers high multiple times a day. If successful, this can set new records for speed, altitude, and climb rate for an aircraft that powers itself. In 2023, Mk-II Aurora reached speeds of 200 knots and altitudes of 9,000 feet during its test flights. Dawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft Mk-II Aurora sets eyes on supersonic flights flight tests in late 2024 for rocket aircraft mk-ii aurora Since then, Dawn Aerospace has upgraded rocket-powered aircraft for a new series of tests. One important test included running its engine for 60 seconds and then restarting it to show it could safely abort and retry a flight if needed, a key preparation for the supersonic flights. So far, the next set of flight tests, happening from July to September, is expected to involve up to twelve flights. The main goal is to push the vehicle to fly faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1.1) and reach altitudes of 70,000 feet. The next target in line is to show that the vehicle can fly twice in one day, proving its ability to be quickly reused.

Login or signup to continue reading All articles from our website & app The digital version of Today's Paper Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia All other regional websites in your area Continue Young people from remote and regional communities across north Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands will get hands-on experience with the aviation industry through Raising Horizons. The program, run by Indigenous aerospace consultancy Gunggandji Aerospace, is particularly focused on getting more First Nations girls into aviation, but is also open to boys. Gunggandji Aerospace founder and chief executive Daniel Joinbee said it's about showing the students what's possible in aviation. "I want to change the narrative about what we're capable of doing," he told AAP. "Get out into communities and talk to young kids about what are the opportunities and pathways into aviation and space, because it's not just being a pilot and it's not just being an astronaut." Gunggandji Aerospace CEO Daniel Joinbee wants to show Indigenous kids what's possible in aviation. (HANDOUT/GUNGGANDJI AEROSPACE) Mr Joinbee is an air force veteran and Gunggandji man from the community of Yarrabah in far north Queensland. It was while consulting for Boeing that he realised there was a gap in the sector, prompting him to start the nation's only Indigenous-owned aerospace consultancy. The Raising Horizons program, which is set to begin in Townsville in January 2025, is a partnership between Gunggandji Aerospace, Rex Airlines and NRL Cowboys House, with funding from the federal government. The students will be connected with mentors throughout the program, something Mr Joinbee said is important to support them on their journey. "One of the things that women in aviation already say is that there's a lack of mentors for emerging females in the industry to get behind them," he said. "There will be males on the program as well and it's just as important for these young men to see that there are women in these leadership roles, because that's how we create holistic social change. "It's not boys as fighter pilots and girls as crew attendants - everyone has a place in aviation and it is an exciting career that we can all actively participate in." But Mr Joinbee said it's important to keep the young people engaged long after they've completed Raising Horizons. "It's not just about the eight module program, and then we high-five the kids and say 'all the best, see you later'," he said. "There has to be follow-through, there has to be ongoing mentoring and there has to be a bigger sense of more." Gunggandji Aerospace also facilitates "non-traditional pathways" into the aviation sector for young adults. Mr Joinbee said they're designed to help First Nations people who have not finished high school, have been incarcerated or are parents of young children to get into aviation and space industries. His vision is for aviation to be a viable career option for all First Nations people. "I just want to see that aviation is seen as an accessible pathway for mob," he said.

Article Content:
GE Aerospace ( GE 0.39% ) , formerly a part of General Electric, had a blistering hot start to the first half of 2024. The stock price rose 58% in the first six months of 2024, crushing what were solid gains by the S&P 500 (up 15%) and Nasdaq Composite index (up 19%) over the same period. Investors are apparently optimistic about this aerospace industry leader, judging by its stellar first-half share price performance. A potential downside is that the run-up in GE Aerospace stock has left it trading at a pricey valuation. Is it still a buy today? Expand NYSE : GE GE Aerospace Today's Change ( -0.39 %) $ -1.22 Current Price $ 310.72 Key Data Points Market Cap $329B Day's Range $ 307.05 - $ 312.72 52wk Range $ 159.36 - $ 316.67 Volume 2.7M Avg Vol 4M Gross Margin 37.67 % Dividend Yield 0.00 % The birth of GE Aerospace After struggling for years, General Electric's management enacted a drastic transformation in the company's makeup. In November 2021, the sprawling conglomerate, which built everything from light bulbs to jet engines to medical technology, announced it would spin off several of its businesses into two new publicly traded companies. GE Healthcare ( GEHC 0.10% ) was spun off in early 2023 and took with it GE's health-related business segments. In April 2024, GE's energy businesses were spun off as GE Verona ( GEV 0.64% ) . What was left under the GE stock ticker was renamed GE Aerospace. Now that these businesses have separated from each other, their management teams can better focus on their specific operations. And for investors, these maneuvers allow them to evaluate each business independently. A dominant player in the aircraft engine market GE Aerospace designs and manufactures jet and turboprop engines for commercial, military, and business aircraft. CFM International, its 50/50 joint venture with the French aerospace company Safran Aircraft Engine, manufactures the Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion (LEAP) engine, which is used in the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320, and Comac C919. CFM International is the leading player in the global aircraft engine market, with a 39% share as of 2020. On its own, GE Aerospace had a 16% market share , so combined, it had a hand in 55% of the total market. Although aerospace stocks tend to command premiums due to their long-term growth prospects, GE Aerospace now trades at more than 32 times its expected one-year forward earnings -- nearly twice the valuations of peers RTX and Lockheed Martin . GE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. Ongoing supply chain issues could weigh on GE Aerospace this year, resulting in fewer deliveries than expected. An analyst at JPMorgan Chase recently lowered second-quarter estimates for the aerospace manufacturer, while a Jefferies analyst covering GE Aerospace anticipates that LEAP engine deliveries will slide by 5% in 2024. The long-term outlook is bullish These potential headwinds and the stock's already-high valuation could weigh on its share price performance in the near term. However, investors have a good reason to be bullish on GE Aerospace for the long term. That's because its real bread-and-butter is its aftermarket business , where it maintains and repairs its engines. Because aircraft engines need regular servicing to ensure safety and optimal performance, GE Aerospace benefits from a steady demand for parts and services over their lifecycle. Image source: Getty Images. Another positive long-term trend for GE Aerospace is the growing demand for air travel. Precedence Research projects that the size of the aircraft engine market will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.9% through 2032. Rising passenger traffic will necessitate larger airline fleets, resulting in more demand for engines, parts, and overhauls -- demand that GE Aerospace stands ready to capitalize on. Is GE Aerospace still a buy today? GE Aerospace faces potential headwinds from fewer deliveries that could weigh on the business, potentially limiting the stock's near-term upside given its premium valuation. That said, the company is incredibly well positioned with its dominant position in the aircraft engine market, and it should be an excellent long-term performer. Its aftermarket business should provide steady cash flow -- analysts at UBS are modeling for compound annual growth of 13% over the next five years from GE Aerospace's aftermarket business. While GE Aerospace stock commands a premium valuation, it remains a solid stock to buy and hold as it reaps the benefits of growing demand for air travel.

The rapid evolution of technology is reshaping the way to produce, distribute and consume renewable energy. The ability of developing nations to adopt new technologies will determine their transition acceleration rate. Speaking ahead of the 13th Ghana Economic Forum (GEF) organised by the B&FT, he stressed that key to the National Energy Transition Framework is reliable and efficient adoption of new technologies which can drive the changeover from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Prof. Gyamfi, an expert in energy efficiency and renewable energy, further underscored the pivotal role that harnessing the power of innovation and embracing cutting-edge technological solutions will play in expediting the shift toward a more sustainable and resilient energy system. “Globally, about 84 percent of energy is from fossil fuels – and that brings about high emissions leading to the climate change and environmental issues experienced today. So, we need to shift; but the shift to renewable energy might not happen at the pace we expect because it requires a shift in technology. “For instance, in terms of transport, it is over 90 percent dependent on fossil fuels and oil. So if we want to change to renewable energy, we have to change the vehicle technology system that will be able to use bio-fuels and other renewable energy forms like e-vehicles,” he said. The Ghana Economic Forum (GEF) is an annual event aimed at fostering dialogue among key stakeholders on critical economic issues facing Ghana. The 13th edition is under the theme ‘Unlocking Opportunities: Re-engineering Ghana’s Economic Model for Sustainable Development‘. The GEF provides a platform for policymakers, business leaders, economists and academics to share insights, debate policy directions and explore innovative solutions to drive Ghana’s economic growth and development. This year’s forum is particularly significant as it features keynote addresses and interviews with two presidential candidates, reflecting the intersection of economic policy and upcoming elections. As the world faces pressing challenges related to climate change and sustainability, the pace of energy transition has become a critical focal point for experts and decision-makers. Technology has emerged as a game-changer in the energy transition journey – from breakthroughs in renewable energy generation to advancements in energy storage and grid optimisation. One key advantage of a technology-driven changeover is its reliability in ensuring a smooth and seamless transition. By leveraging data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, energy stakeholders can enhance visibility, efficiency and transparency across the entire energy value chain. From solar panels and wind-turbines to smart meters and energy management systems, the proliferation of innovative technologies is creating new opportunities for both developed and developing nations to make significant strides toward decarbonisation and sustainability. Embracing technology is not just a choice; it’s a necessity in today’s energy landscape. By investing in research and development, fostering collaboration between industry players and academia, and promoting policy support for technology deployment, we can accelerate the energy transition and unlock a greener future for generations to come, Prof. Gyamfi explained. The GEF plenary session on energy, of which Prof. Gyamfi is a panellist, will explore the current state of Ghana’s energy sector, focusing on issues such as energy security, renewable energy adoption and regulatory frameworks.

Energy storage capacity to see robust uptick By ZHENG XIN | China Daily | Updated: 2024-08-01 09:22 A driver charges his new energy vehicle in Chongqing. [SUN KAIFANG/FOR CHINA DAILY] Fueled by innovative technologies and rapid advances in the renewables sector, China's energy storage capacity is poised for significant growth, the National Energy Administration said on Wednesday. The country's power storage capacity has steadily increased this year, with over 44 million kilowatts already in operation by the end of June, up 40 percent year-on-year, the energy authority said during a news conference in Beijing. The government has been continuously advancing energy storage technologies, with several compressed air energy storage, flow battery storage, and sodium-ion battery storage projects put into operation across the nation, Bian Guangqi, an NEA official, said at the conference. New energy storage, or energy storage using new technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, liquid flow batteries, compressed air and mechanical energy, is an important foundation for building the country's new power system, which enjoys advantages such as quick response, flexible configuration and short construction timelines. According to Bian, new energy storage systems are playing a critical role in ensuring grid connection of renewable energy, with the equivalent utilization hours of new energy storage in the operating areas of State Grid Corp of China, the country's largest power utility, reaching 390 hours during the first half of 2024, approximately doubling from the first half of 2023. Meanwhile, figures for that of China Southern Power Grid's operating areas reached 560 hours, nearly matching the total utilization for 2023, he said. According to Deng Simeng, a senior analyst in renewables and power research at global consultancy Rystad Energy, battery storage is drawing significant attention due to its crucial role and benefits, which include smaller devices, flexible site requirements and shorter construction periods compared to wind, solar and other traditional power sources. As numerous gigawatt-scale renewable base projects come online in Northwest China, the local grid system must integrate this renewable capacity, optimize power output and manage the intermittency issues associated with wind and solar energy, said Deng. Given the rapid expansion of renewable installations, accelerating the development of new energy storage solutions will be a crucial breakthrough for the northwestern region. This will help mitigate renewable curtailment and ensure a more resilient and secure power grid, she added. According to the administration, the northern and northwestern parts of the country have seen the fastest development of new-type energy storage facilities, accounting for over 50 percent of the newly operational energy storage installations nationwide. In terms of application scenarios, independent energy storage and shared energy storage installations account for 45.3 percent, energy storage installations paired with new energy projects account for 42.8 percent, and other application scenarios account for 11.9 percent. The installed capacity of renewable energy has achieved fresh breakthroughs. In the first half of 2024, the nationwide newly installed capacity for renewable energy power generation reached 134 million kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 24 percent, accounting for 88 percent of the total new power generation capacity in the country. The NEA issued a notice in April titled "Promotion of New Energy Storage Integration and Dispatch Utilization", aimed at standardizing the integration of new energy storage into the grid and promoting efficient dispatch utilization of new energy storage. The notice outlined specific requirements for grid enterprises, power dispatch agencies and new energy storage project units. The country has also been expanding the scale of charging facilities, with the total number of charging piles nationwide reaching 10.24 million as of the end of June, a year-on-year increase of 54 percent, including 3.12 million public charging piles and 7.12 million private ones. The total rated power of public charging piles exceeds 110 million kilowatts, meeting the charging needs of 24 million new energy vehicles, it said. In the first half of the year, the nationwide charging volume for new energy vehicles was around 51.3 billion kilowatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of 40 percent. Efforts are being made to address the charging infrastructure gap in rural areas, said Zhang Xing, a spokesman of the energy administration. "We have organized charging infrastructure construction and promotion activities in some counties and towns, and more than one-third of the provinces have extended charging facilities to all townships, strongly supporting the rural adoption of new energy vehicles," Zhang said.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email The Gwynt y Mor Irish Sea wind farm. Louisiana hopes to learn from the success of European nations in developing wind power. Associated press file photo Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save For more than a century, Louisiana has been an energy-rich state and a world leader in energy exploration, production and innovation. We have achieved this success thanks to our state’s abundant natural resources, highly skilled workforce unmatched anywhere else in the world and extensive network of pipelines that supply half America’s refining capacity. As we look to Louisiana’s future, the energy industry’s emerging expansion represents a golden opportunity for us to grow our economy in ways not seen since Louisiana’s first oil boom. The numbers speak volumes: Louisiana's energy sector sustains over 346,000 jobs, contributes $25 billion in wages and generates $54 billion in economic output. Our state provides direct access to America’s only deepwater offshore oil port, produces clean offshore energy supplies for our nation and allies and is home to some of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas export terminals. Marc Ehrhardt Provided photo Today, Louisiana’s robust energy infrastructure and experienced workforce remain an essential national resource, strengthening our state’s economy and supplying both America’s energy needs and global market demands. Right now, America’s energy sector is expanding as the demand for all types of energy production keeps growing. Louisiana is working to fulfill this demand and capitalize on the energy industry’s expansion. Energy producers around the world, like ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and dozens of others are investing billions of dollars into Louisiana’s working energy infrastructure. This includes: $50 billion in new project investment for energy production, manufacturing or related facilities according to Louisiana Economic Development More than $20 billion in clean hydrogen energy production projects with more than 10,000 future job opportunities A $27.5 million investment from Shell that will create the LSU Institute for Energy Innovation to study and direct the future of American energy $46.9 billion for six energy-related projects planned at the Calcasieu Ship Channel $3.6 million from ExxonMobil to lead innovation around future energy projects and educational programs teaching Louisiana students about new technologies such as advanced recycling, carbon capture and clean hydrogen. Tommy Faucheux Provided photo Louisiana can do more if we embrace our position as the leading energy innovation state in America. For example, Louisiana could gain up to $13 billion in private investments plus thousands of new jobs for carbon management and hydrogen energy production. Additionally, one offshore wind farm in the Gulf of Mexico could support 4,400 new jobs and $445 million in new investment. The need for oil and natural gas resources is not going away. By supporting our oil and natural gas investments and new opportunities in energy advancements, Louisiana can lead America’s energy expansion and be at the forefront of the great American energy renaissance. Let’s build on our ability to supply the world’s energy needs by producing even more energy through innovations like hydrogen and offshore wind. Mike Moncla Provided photo This isn't about replacing our traditional energy efforts. It's about enhancing them, while embracing innovation and preparing for the growing global energy demand. We know what the energy industry gives to Louisiana — a robust economy contributing more funding for local schools, police protection and coastal restoration plus an exciting future brimming with in-state, advanced careers. Industry leaders, energy advocates, scientists and local communities are backing the future of Louisiana energy by working together across our state, advocating for pro-energy policies and streamlining regulations to ensure that Louisiana remains at the forefront of energy production. It is vital that we remain firm in our support of Louisiana’s energy expansion for the people of the industry. Our action or inaction today will determine whether Louisiana’s position as a premier energy-producing state will be preserved or threatened. Let us stand united and resolve to do what it takes to not only maintain but fortify Louisiana's exceptional energy culture and way of life, now and well into the future.

The UK’s renewable energy budget has been increased to a record £1.5 billion, Ed Miliband announced on Wednesday. Of that, £1.1 billion will be allocated for offshore wind , which the government described as “the backbone of the UK’s clean energy mission”. The funding uplift represents more than a 50 per cent increase on the budget previously set in March. The renewable energy industry will bid for the sum in order to deliver clean energy projects in the UK. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the higher budget will “boost energy security, secure cheap power for families, and unlock economic growth and jobs for the country”. It will “accelerate the delivery of clean, cheap, low-carbon electricity to families and businesses, generated by renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels”, the department added. open image in gallery ( James Glossop/The Times/PA Wire ) Firms in the renewables industry will bid for a share of the funding through the government’s sixth renewable auction – known as the Contracts for Difference scheme – which provides developers with initial subsidies for clean electricity projects across Britain. Contracts for Difference works by developers bidding for contracts to help deliver renewable energy projects, with the scheme providing a guaranteed price for the clean electricity they generate. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the scheme gives industry greater certainty to invest, knowing that when electricity prices fluctuate, they will always get a set price for their projects. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband said it demonstrates that Labour is “backing industry to build in Britain”. Contracts are awarded through a series of auctions, where the lowest price bids are successful. open image in gallery £1.1 billion will be allocated for offshore wind, which the government described as “the backbone of the UK’s clean energy mission”. ( PA Wire ) It is aimed at encouraging lower energy bills, as the subsidies are paid back to the government when wholesale electricity prices are higher than the agreed Contract for Difference price. In a statement, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Families across the country have suffered during the cost of living crisis, as the UK’s over-reliance on fossil fuel markets was exploited by Putin. “Investing in clean energy is part of the Government’s plans to make Britain a clean energy superpower. This will boost the country’s energy independence, so that families and businesses are never left that vulnerable again.” In a statement, Mr Miliband said: “Last year’s auction round was a catastrophe, with zero offshore wind secured, and delaying our move away from expensive fossil fuels to energy independence. “Instead, we are backing industry to build in Britain, with this year’s auction getting its biggest budget yet. “This will restore the UK as a global leader for green technologies and deliver the infrastructure we need to boost our energy independence, protect billpayers, and become a clean energy superpower.” Energy Minister Michael Shanks added: “It is our mission for the UK to be more energy secure and to do that we need more renewable energy projects connected to the grid and powering our homes. “Increasing the budget by more than 50 per cent will boost industry confidence to back clean energy, attracting cutting edge clean technologies to Britain as we accelerate to a decarbonised power sector by 2030.” Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies Comments

By redirecting this energy towards AI computing and blockchain mining, we can significantly reduce the environmental impact of these technologies. My Journey Into Wasted Energy Utilization My journey into this innovative approach began while exploring ways to optimize energy use in our AI-driven projects. I realized that a significant amount of energy generated by various industrial processes was being wasted, so I investigated how we could harness this excess energy for our computational needs. The first step was to identify potential sources of wasted energy. We focused on industries known for high energy consumption and significant waste, such as manufacturing and power generation. Partnering with these industries required extensive negotiations. We needed to demonstrate the mutual benefits of redirecting their wasted energy to our operations. This involved detailed presentations on how this approach could enhance their sustainability efforts, improve their corporate social responsibility profiles and potentially offer financial incentives through energy credits or reduced operational costs. The Negotiation Process Negotiating these partnerships was no small feat. It required a deep understanding of both the industrial and technological landscapes. One key challenge was convincing industry stakeholders of the feasibility and reliability of using their wasted energy for our purposes. Many were initially skeptical and concerned about the stability of the energy supply and the technical challenges in transferring energy from their processes to our computing facilities. To address these concerns, we conducted pilot projects demonstrating this approach and the benefits of practical applications. We partnered with several manufacturing plants that produced significant waste heat. By installing heat recovery systems, we will convert this heat into electricity, which will then be used to power our AI data centers. The success of this study provided a compelling proof of concept, which helped gain the trust and cooperation of other industry partners. The Benefits Of Wasted Energy Utilization The benefits of utilizing wasted energy for AI computing and blockchain mining are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the carbon footprint associated with these technologies. By tapping into energy that would otherwise go unused, we minimize the demand for additional power generation, which often relies on fossil fuels. Secondly, this approach enhances the overall efficiency of energy use. Industrial processes become more sustainable as their energy waste is repurposed productively. This not only supports environmental goals but also offers economic benefits. Industries can lower their energy costs and earn incentives for contributing to sustainable energy practices. Moreover, using wasted energy can lead to more resilient and decentralized energy systems. Instead of relying solely on traditional power grids, which can be vulnerable to disruptions, AI and blockchain operations can benefit from multiple, diverse energy sources. This diversification enhances the stability and reliability of the energy supply for these critical technologies. The Future Of Energy Management The successful integration of wasted energy utilization into AI computing and blockchain mining represents a significant step forward in energy management . As the demand for computational power continues to grow, finding sustainable energy solutions becomes imperative. My experience has shown that we can turn potential environmental liabilities into assets with the right approach and partnerships. Looking ahead, I believe this model can be scaled and applied globally. Governments and regulatory bodies can play a crucial role by creating policies and incentives that encourage wasted energy use. For instance, offering tax breaks or subsidies for companies that implement energy recovery systems can accelerate the adoption of this practice. Furthermore, technological advancements will continue to improve the efficiency and feasibility of energy recovery and utilization. Innovations in energy storage, grid integration and heat recovery systems will enhance our ability to effectively capture and repurpose wasted energy. Conclusion My journey into negotiating the use of wasted energy for AI computing and blockchain mining has been enlightening and rewarding.

Latest News National Sports World Business Entertainment Royal Videos Hollywood Technology Health Trending Today's Paper Opinion Writer's Archive Magazines TNS Instep Money Matters YOU US Pakistan’s power crisis In October 2023, Pakistan had an energy deficit of 6,000MW, incurring an import bill of $7 billion By Simra Sohail July 17, 2024 A bulb can be seen in this image. — AFP/File Pakistan has been grappling with a severe energy crisis for several years. Energy demand continues to soar while the supply of conventional energy sources remains inadequate. This imbalance has resulted in frequent power outages, which not only hinder economic growth and disrupt daily life but also impede technological advancement. As the gap between energy supply and demand widens, the nation faces escalating power costs and increasing reliance on imports. In October 2023, Pakistan had an energy deficit of 6,000MW, incurring an import bill of $7 billion. According to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) 2022 annual report, Pakistan’s installed generation capacity adds up to 43,775 MW, of which merely 7.0 per cent comes from renewable energy sources. Addressing this crisis requires strategic investments in renewable energy infrastructure and policy reforms to ensure a sustainable energy supply for Pakistan’s future. The origins of Pakistan’s energy crisis can be traced back to the 1970s when Pakistan narrowly averted a major energy crisis when the government launched the Mangla and Tarbela dams. These projects ushered in a brief era of robust hydro-driven energy generation that effectively met the country’s demands. However, the 1980s saw a period of strong economic growth that caused energy demand to surge. Despite government efforts to increase generation, they failed to keep up with the escalating demand. The energy crisis in Pakistan stems from a multitude of interconnected and overlapping factors. Pakistan’s energy crisis is primarily driven by its heavy reliance on non-renewable and expensive fossil fuels, which make up 59 per cent of the energy mix. This dependence is exacerbated by outdated transmission lines, infrastructural flaws, and issues such as line losses, power theft, and inefficient energy usage. The country’s energy infrastructure is further strained by overpopulation, rapid urbanization, and industrialization. A World Bank report projects that Pakistan’s energy demand will increase by 70 per cent by 2030, while supply is expected to grow by only 45 per cent. Economic instability and a shortage of technical expertise compound these challenges. Additionally, systemic corruption and inefficiencies within generation and distribution companies (Gencos and DISCOs) significantly contribute to the crisis. The lack of consistent political will and effective energy policies, coupled with shortsighted commitments to independent power producers (IPPs) and the burden of circular debt, perpetuate Pakistan’s enduring energy challenges. To address Pakistan’s energy crisis, a multifaceted approach is urgently needed. The country must diversify its energy mix by investing heavily in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Given that only a paltry 7.0 per cent of Pakistan’s energy currently comes from renewable sources, significantly increasing this share is important. This transition not only reduces dependency on costly fossil fuel but also aligns with global trends towards sustainable energy. Additionally, expanding and upgrading the transmission infrastructure is vital to mitigate the chronic issues of line losses and power theft, which have long plagued the system. Modernizing these outdated transmission lines will enhance efficiency and reliability, ensuring that generated power reaches consumers. Addressing systemic corruption and inefficiencies within the generation and distribution companies (Gencos and DISCOs) is paramount. The government must implement stringent anti-corruption measures and overhaul management practices to eliminate waste and financial mismanagement. This should be coupled with a consistent political will to enforce these reforms and hold accountable those who fail to comply. Revisiting and renegotiating short-sighted agreements with IPPs can alleviate some of the financial burdens contributing to circular debt. Such measures would restore financial stability to the power sector. Additionally, the bureaucratic red tape that hinders project implementation must be streamlined to avoid delays and inflated costs, ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. Enhancing local technical expertise is critical for sustainable energy development. Investing in education and training programmes for engineers and technicians will build a skilled workforce capable of maintaining and advancing the energy infrastructure. This long-term investment is necessary to keep pace with technological advancements and ensure the efficient operation of energy systems. Public-private partnerships can attract investment and innovation, leveraging the private sector’s efficiencies and expertise to bolster the public energy sector. Utilizing untapped and renewable energy sources with high potential and capacity -- wind (50,000 MW), solar (40,000 MW), hydro (40,000 MW), and Thar coal (100,000 MW) -- alongside tidal, biofuels, and nuclear potential, would be a great stride in this regard. By harnessing these resources, Pakistan can bolster its energy supply and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The government must also prioritize energy conservation and efficiency measures. Implementing policies that encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances and practices can reduce overall demand. Public awareness campaigns should highlight the importance of energy conservation and the economic benefits it can bring to the country. These efforts, combined with structural reforms, can help bridge the projected gap between energy supply and demand, ensuring a stable and sustainable energy future for Pakistan.

Yahoo is using AI to generate takeaways from this article. This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Rhode Island recently took a monumental step toward committing to a green future. The newly passed Energy Storage Systems Act is a great example of state-based legislation taking the right steps toward a healthy future for all. According to What's Up Newp — a Newport news outlet — the Energy Storage Systems Act was signed into law June 26, with the purpose of enabling an affordable, renewable energy grid through more energy storage capacity. The act "sets concrete goals and action plans to build a resilient grid that can accommodate the green energy transition," stated state Senator Dawn Euer, per the news outlet. Also included in the legislation are requirements of the Public Utilities Commissions to adopt a framework for "the adoption of electric rate tariffs to apply to energy storage systems connected to the electric grid." The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank and the Office of Energy will oversee and fund projects that will help meet the key milestones of storage capacity for renewable energy projects, reported WUN. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Energy Storage Systems Act is highly beneficial to energy transition in that it holds Rhode Island accountable for implementing energy storage infrastructure to ensure affordable clean energy can be used in the most efficient way possible. The adoption rates of renewable energy like solar and wind can be reliant on how well it can be stored. The American Clean Power Association noted that energy storage "enables us to produce clean energy when it's abundant, store it, and send it back to the electricity grid when needed." When states take the lead in creating legislation like this, it benefits energy users as it makes clean energy more accessible and affordable. The Rhode Island legislation follows in step with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act by working to not only produce more clean energy, but also ensure that clean energy is efficiently embedded into existing energy infrastructure so that it is easy to access and affordable, per the Department of Energy. More clean energy means a healthier and safer environment for all. Watch now: Uber-wealthy couple makes unprecedented move with $300 million land Rhode Island Representative Arthur Handy commented on the new legislation, per What's Up Newp: "This legislation is critical to both take advantage of the renewable energy we have to bring online and to build a sustainable grid in the face of severe storms and other effects of climate change."

A spring has more potential energy when it is compressed or stretched. A steel ball has more potential energy raised above the ground than it has after falling to Earth . In the raised position it is capable of doing more work . Potential energy is a property of a system and not of an individual body or particle; the system composed of Earth and the raised ball, for example, has more potential energy as the two are farther separated. Potential energy arises in systems with parts that exert forces on each other of a magnitude dependent on the configuration, or relative position, of the parts. In the case of the Earth-ball system, the force of gravity between the two depends only on the distance separating them. The work done in separating them farther, or in raising the ball, transfers additional energy to the system, where it is stored as gravitational potential energy.

Nuclear energy is also a form of potential energy. Britannica Quiz 27 True-or-False Questions from Britannica’s Most Difficult Science Quizzes The potential energy of a system of particles depends only on their initial and final configurations; it is independent of the path the particles travel. In the case of the steel ball and Earth, if the initial position of the ball is ground level and the final position is 10 feet above the ground, the potential energy is the same, no matter how or by what route the ball was raised. The value of potential energy is arbitrary and relative to the choice of reference point. In the case given above, the system would have twice as much potential energy if the initial position were the bottom of a 10-foot-deep hole. Gravitational potential energy near Earth’s surface may be computed by multiplying the weight of an object by its distance above the reference point. In bound systems, such as atoms, in which electrons are held by the electric force of attraction to nuclei, the zero reference for potential energy is a distance from the nucleus so great that the electric force is not detectable. In this case, bound electrons have negative potential energy, and those very far away have zero potential energy. Potential energy may be converted into energy of motion , called kinetic energy , and in turn to other forms such as electric energy. Thus, water behind a dam flows to lower levels through turbines that turn electric generators, producing electric energy plus some unusable heat energy resulting from turbulence and friction .

Health Care Two-thirds say health care not getting enough attention in election: Gallup by Lauren Irwin - 09/30/24 8:28 AM ET by Lauren Irwin - 09/30/24 8:28 AM ET Share ✕ LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email Alex Brandon and Morry Gash, Associated Press Former President Trump, left, and Vice President Harris. Two-thirds of Americans say health care is not getting enough attention from both political parties in the presidential election, a new survey found. According to the survey , conducted by Gallup and nonprofit West Health, 67 percent of respondents overall say health care is not receiving enough attention. Only 6 percent say it’s getting too much attention and 27 percent say health care is receiving the right amount. Democrats and independents were more likely than Republican respondents to say health care is not receiving enough attention, though 53 percent of GOP voters say the candidates could focus on it more, the survey found. Seventy-one percent of respondents who tuned in to last month’s debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump said the candidates did not spend enough time talking about health care issues. Independent voters are weary of both candidates’ stances on health care, Gallup noted. Independents slightly favored Harris on health care issues, like improving access to care, improving quality of care and lowering costs of prescriptions, but Trump trailed closely behind on many issues, the survey found. According to the poll, 63 percent of Americans say a candidate’s position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the single most important health care-related issue in the election, or among the most important ones. A candidate’s position on lowering health care costs follows close behind with 57 percent support. Forty-three percent say a candidate’s policies related to mental health care access are among the most important health-related issues in the election. Older voters tend to favor a candidate’s position on Medicare and Social Security while younger voters prioritize mental health and lower costs, the survey found. It also found Democrats were more optimistic than their Republican and independent counterparts to say access to affordable health care will improve in the next five years, though no group was overwhelmingly optimistic that things will change. The survey was conducted Sept. 9-16 among 3,660 adults and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

Report Solutions for America: Getting Health Care Reform Right August 17, 2010 5 min read Download Report Marion Smith Counselor to the President Marion Smith, through his research and writing at The Heritage Foundation, relates... Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close THE ISSUE: The health care system needs reform, but not the types of changes enacted under the new health care law. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act moves the health care system in the wrong direction. This highly unpopular law would assert federal control over health care benefits and financing, erect a complex one-size-fits-all health system, and centralize America’s health care decisions in Washington. Instead, Congress should transform the health care system into one that empowers individuals and families, not Washington, to control more of their health care decisions. THE FACTS: Health Care Spending. The U.S spends over $2.6 trillion on health care, roughly 17 percent of gross domestic product. More Government Control. Health care spending will increase by $311 billion between 2010 and 2019 under the new law. Soon, the government will control over half of all health care spending. Rising Crisis in Health Care Entitlements. The Medicare program alone faces a $30.8 trillion unfunded obligation with an onslaught of 77 million retiring baby boomers. Medicaid has become a growing fiscal problem for the states, accounting for over 21 percent of state spending —second only to education. No Two States Are Alike. State health insurance markets differ radically, reflecting differences in demography, levels of poverty, regulation, and underlying health care costs. Rates of uninsurance range from 25% in Texas to 5% in Massachusetts, while premiums for individual policies range from $2,606 in Iowa to $6,630 in New York. THE SOLUTIONS: Repeal Obamacare. There is a precedent for repealing highly unpopular and misguided laws: the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. History may be repeating itself. Recently, over 70% of Missouri residents rejected a key provision of Obamacare­—the requirement that individuals purchase a health insurance plan designed and approved by government bureaucrats. The rebellion at the state level, in fact, is both widespread and multi-dimensional. Some states will vote on similar repeal measures; in others, legislation has been introduced challenging various aspects of the law; still others have banded together to challenge the constitutionality of the individual mandate in lawsuits. The House of Representatives even voted recently to repeal one provision of Obamacare that will impose draconian paperwork requirements on millions of small businesses. The easiest way to address all these grievances: repeal Obamacare. Promote Personal Control Through Tax Equity. Today, workers who purchase coverage through their employer receive an unlimited tax break on the value of their health care benefits. However, those who purchase coverage on their own receive no comparable tax break. Ideally, the current tax exclusion should be replaced (or at the very least capped) with a system of universal tax credits for taxpayers. Concurrently, existing health care spending, such as Medicaid and SCHIP (the State Children’s Health Insurance Program) should be redirected to help low-income individuals and families purchase private health insurance. Putting Americans in charge of their health care dollars and decisions will go along way toward bringing about greater efficiency and cost reduction to the health care system. Fix Current Government Health Programs. To address the country’s looming entitlement crisis, Medicare and Medicaid must be transformed. Specifically, Medicare should be a defined-contribution system in which the government provides a contribution for benefits and seniors are able to apply their contribution to the health plan that suits them best. Medicaid should be restructured to mainstream healthy moms and kids into private health insurance through premium assistance while patient-centered models of care should be integrated into Medicaid to give the disabled, the elderly, and their families a say in the care and services they receive. Updating these programs would make the costs both more predictable and sustainable for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. Promote Federal–State Partnerships. A one-size-fits-all federal solution cannot accommodate the unique and diverse health care challenges facing the states. States should take the lead in health care reform by identifying the key health care challenges facing their citizens, structuring a consumer-based marketplace for health insurance, and expanding affordable health care options for their citizens, including setting up pooling arrangements to protect persons with pre-existing conditions while not unduly burdening taxpayers. Beyond reforming the tax treatment of health insurance and restructuring health care entitlements, the federal government should promote interstate commerce in health insurance, extend certain protections for those who maintain continuous coverage, and provide states with technical assistance and relief from federal rules that inhibit innovation. Provide Portability. Individuals—not the government—should be able to choose the health coverage that best suits their needs. To accomplish this, private health insurance must be portable—that is, owned by Americans so they can take their package from job to job. Portability, in turn, will require lawmakers to end the bias against individuals now in the tax code (see above) and for states to take the lead in guaranteeing that individuals can choose from among competing plans in transparent and lightly regulated marketplaces. ------------------ SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS: Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on the Uninsured Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on States Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Doctors Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Future Generations Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Seniors Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Businesses Repeal Obamacare - Impact of Obamacare on Taxpayers Repeal Obamacare - The Case Against Obamacare: A Health Care Policy Series for the 112th Congress Personal Control - Health Care Tax Credits: Designing An Alternative to Employer Based Coverage Personal Control - Health Care Tax Credits: Best Way to Advance Affordability, Choice & Coverage Fix Current Gov.

Jim Cramer on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN): ‘Leerink Analysts Downgraded Regeneron To A Market Perform Hold After A Negative Eylea 2mg Biosimilar Preliminary Injunction Ruling’ Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc September 28, 2024 8 min read REGN We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it’s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well. In the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn’t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing. "At first, I didn’t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half— a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you’ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated." Jim Cramer's 1st Investment Lesson: Know What You Own Jim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses. During his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: " Know what you own ." Story Continues "During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That’s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own." From Childhood Curiosity to Financial Empire: The Rise of Jim Cramer Jim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him. The business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like "open," "range," and "close" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market. His dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn’t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn’t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked. The Stock Game Not long after, Jim introduced this "stock game" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing. "Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this "stock game" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That’s how I fell in love with the stock market." Jim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.

Manitoba Health-care support workers 'not feeling the love' from province as strike looms Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said Thursday nobody loves health-care aides more than he does, but as thousands of them prepare to walk off the job in early October, they say they’re not feeling the love back from the provincial government. Strike by 25,000 support workers could begin Oct. 8 Gavin Axelrod · CBC News · Posted: Sep 26, 2024 8:47 PM EDT | Last Updated: September 27, 2024 Play Listen to this article Estimated 5 minutes The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew speaks during a health-care staffing update Thursday. (CBC Manitoba ) Social Sharing Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said Thursday nobody loves health-care aides more than he does, but as thousands of them prepare to walk off the job in early October, they say they're not feeling the love back from the provincial government. "That was a real slap in the face, a real slap in the face," said Tracey Drexler, an operating room assistant at the Victoria Hospital. Kinew's comments came during a press conference where the province said it had staffed 873 net new positions — 290 of which are health-care aides — as the provincial government nears its target of hiring 1,000 new health-care workers throughout the year. In the backdrop of that announcement, 25,000 health-care support workers represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the Manitoba Government and General Employees' Union are poised to strike Oct. 8, unless the government dishes out an acceptable contract offer before then. Kinew said Thursday he hopes the current offer is accepted. "This deal is 2½ times more than the last deal that health-care has got," Kinew said during the press conference. "There's more money on the table. More health-care aides working in the system and more help is coming." When asked how the premier arrived at that figure, a spokesperson for Shared Health told CBC they couldn't speak to the specific details of the offer, other than to say "its total value is 2.5 times that of the last collective agreement." Strike by 25,000 Manitoba health-care support workers could begin Oct. 8 as unions serve notice Kinew also said Manitoba's NDP government has "taken steps to make life more affordable" and said health-care aides will save "at least" $10 a week because of the gas tax holiday, which was extended until the end of the year Wednesday. With the provincial gas tax set at 14 cents per litre, in order to save $10, a driver would have to purchase 71.4 litres of gas per week. But Drexler said some of her colleagues can't even afford cars. "We just want a living wage," said Drexler, who has worked in the sector for over two decades, spending the last two years at the Victoria Hospital. "When I started this job, I could live comfortably. Now with a second job, I am barely putting food on the table." CUPE health-care co-ordinator Shannon McAteer said the strike mandate "speaks volumes," because some workers who make $17 an hour are "willing to put it on the line." "They're willing to go on strike to get what they deserve, get the respect, get the recognition, get the wages and working conditions that they desperately deserve," she said. Some support staff looking for new jobs In a news release Thursday, CUPE said it surveyed more than 5,000 health-care support workers as part of a bargaining survey done in March. The survey said nearly 50 per cent of health care support workers have been, or plan to, look for a new job, according to responses from workers in the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Shared Health, Southern Health-Santé Sud and the Northern Regional Health Authority. The report also said around 65 per cent of respondents looking for a new job were looking outside the public health care system entirely. The report also found only 28 per cent of health-care aides reported staffing levels were sufficient to provide proper care to patients, residents or clients. Additionally, around 75 per cent of workers surveyed reported working short-staffed once or more a week. "They're not feeling the love," McAteer said. "I think that's the way of saying it." Kathleen Cook, the health critic for the Opposition Manitoba Progressive Conservatives, also said retention is a "critical part of what the NDP needs to focus on." CUPE recommends new deal for health-care workers, faces criticism after MGEU workers rejected similar deal MGEU health-care workers vote to reject new collective agreement McAteer said she remains hopeful a deal can be reached, but isn't feeling optimistic about that happening before Oct. 8. "Health care used to be an employer of choice and now they are not," she said. "People are looking to get out of health care, so announcing today that they're so happy or pleased or they think they've done amazing to fix the crisis and health care, that's what doesn't give me a lot of optimism because we just don't see it." Meanwhile, Drexler said walking off the job isn't something support workers take lightly. "We all know that it's going to be the patients that are going to suffer and the caregivers that are going to suffer and the people who depend on home care to live their lives and go to work that aren't going to have that home care coming to help them out of bed in the morning," she said. "And it weighs heavy on us, this is not something that we do easily."

Chris and Vicky will further deepen our bench of expertise." Mr. Bayliss has nearly a decade of investing experience, most recently as Vice President at SoftBank Investment Advisers, the manager of the SoftBank Vision Fund, where he successfully executed numerous key healthcare transactions and supported portfolio companies. Prior to SoftBank, he was an Analyst for Marcato Capital Management, a hedge fund focused on long term concentrated investments. He graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Economics.

The new hires are the latest addition to a team of twelve professionals, all committed to supporting the firm's investment strategy focused on providing liquidity to private healthcare investors. Revelation Partners Revelation Partners provides flexible capital solutions to the healthcare ecosystem. They invest broadly across all healthcare sub-sectors, including medical devices, life science tools and diagnostics, biopharmaceuticals, healthcare technology, and healthcare services. The firm's long-term approach allows it to address the issues faced by a wide range of counterparties, including founders, company management teams, institutional investors (including general partners), and limited partners.

A new study by Overnight Glasses reveals that many Americans are struggling to afford healthcare due to rising costs and limited access. Alaska, New York, and New Jersey were ranked as the most expensive states for healthcare services. Pexels A new study by Overnight Glasses ranks Alaska as the most expensive state for healthcare in the United States. The study found average health insurance costs in Alaska to be $948 per month, where MRI expenses reach a staggering $656. The analysis examined key healthcare costs across all 50 states to identify the regions where residents face the highest financial burden. Healthcare Costs Across The United States The study evaluated healthcare costs based on several factors, including: Health insurance premiums MRI expenses CT scan expenses Emergency room expenses Vision exam expenses Dental exam expenses These metrics were combined to create a composite score on a 100-point scale. A higher score indicates higher healthcare costs in a state. Alaska's healthcare system remains one of the most expensive in the United States despite its relatively small population of 733,536. Writer's pick California Bans All Plastic Bags; Sues ExxonMobil For 'Lying About Recylcing Being A Viable Solution For Plastic Waste' The state earned a top composite score of 82.97 in the study, solidifying its position as the costliest state for healthcare services. In addition to high costs for health insurance and MRIs, Alaska also reports steep expenses for CT scans ($499.25) and emergency room visits ($2,265 on average). New York And New Jersey: High-Cost Healthcare States New York closely follows Alaska in second place with a composite score of 74.43. The state has the second-highest healthcare spending per capita at $14,007 and ranks third in MRI costs at $599. Additionally, high costs for vision exams ($112) and dental exams ($209) contribute to its overall ranking as a high-cost state for healthcare. New Jersey ranks third with a composite score of 64.57. The state is known for having the highest emergency room costs in the United States, with an average cost of $3,377 per visit. Coupled with expensive diagnostic procedures like MRIs and CT scans, New Jersey residents face some of the most substantial financial challenges in healthcare. Additional States with High Healthcare Costs Completing the top five most expensive states are: Vermont (composite score: 58.77) California (composite score: 56.99) Massachusetts (composite score: 55.55) Vermont faces high health insurance premiums ($908) and spending per capita ($12,756). Despite its large population, California struggles with significant emergency room costs ($3,238). Massachusetts also has high healthcare spending per capita ($13,319) and an average health insurance cost of $639. Washington: Highest Healthcare Spending Per Capita Washington ranks 9th overall, but it stands out with the highest healthcare spending per capita, at $14,381. Although its costs for health insurance and vision exams may be lower than those of some other states, Washington's overall expenditures place it firmly among the most expensive regions for healthcare. Delaware rounds out the list in 10th place, with healthcare spending per capita of $12,899 and emergency room costs of $1,746. The Importance of Proactive Healthcare Strategies A spokesperson from Overnight Glasses commented on the study findings, emphasising the importance of proactive healthcare strategies. "For individuals navigating these costs, being proactive—like exploring insurance options, utilising preventive care, and comparing healthcare providers—can make a big difference." "As states continue to grapple with these expenses, there's a clear need for innovative solutions that prioritise both access and cost-effectiveness to ease the financial burden on residents," the spokesperson added. This comprehensive study highlights residents' significant financial challenges in states with high healthcare costs. The data reveals that healthcare expenses continue to rise, placing a substantial burden on individuals and families. For a detailed analysis, including weightings and data sources, please refer to the complete report available from Overnight Glasses. The Paradox Of US Healthcare Spending Despite the US leading in healthcare spending, many Americans still struggle to afford necessary medical care, highlighting a critical gap in the system. It is worth noting that Americans spend more money on healthcare on a per capita basis compared to people in any other developed nation. However, a new study by Gallup and West Health reveals that nearly half of Americans have not been able to pay for medical treatment or prescription drugs in recent times. Approximately 45 percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup and West Health reported recently skipping medical treatment or medications due to cost or lack of accessibility. Writer's pick Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Health Network To Pay $65M After Hackers Post Nude Photos Of Cancer Patients Online Among this group, roughly eight percent indicated that they would be unable to afford necessary care if they needed it today. Gallup and West Health refer to this population segment as "cost desperate." According to the study, although 55 percent of Americans are considered "cost secure," meaning they can afford necessary medical care and medications, this percentage has decreased from 61 percent in 2022. This decline is consistent with comments made by then-US president Donald Trump in 2017, who suggested that healthcare in other countries is superior to the US system. The Burden of Rising Insurance Deductibles According to the Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF ), the average family insurance deductible in the United States has increased significantly, rising from $2,500 in 2013 to approximately $3,800 in 2022. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies insurance plans with deductibles of $3,200 or more as high-deductible plans. Even Americans with health insurance are facing challenges in affording and accessing care. Many individuals complain that their insurers are creating barriers to treatment through practices such as prior authorisation denials and claim denials. As an example, on Monday, demonstrators gathered outside UnitedHealthcare headquarters to protest the company's alleged refusal to approve care through these methods. "Health insurance coverage has expanded in America, but we are finding it is private health insurance corporations themselves that are often the largest barrier for people to receive the care they and their doctor agree they need," Aija Nemer-Aanerud, campaign director with the People's Action Institute, told CBS Minnesota . A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare informed CBS Minnesota that the company has resolved the issues raised by the recent protests.

More than 25,000 health support workers could walk off the job Oct. 8, affecting the lives of thousands of hospital patients, personal-care home residents and people who rely on home-care services. The employees, who are represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 204 and the Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union, include health-care aides, laundry workers, dietary aides, ward clerks, recreation co-ordinators and other support staff. The unions are negotiating with Shared Health, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, Prairie Mountain Health, the Interlake-Eastern Regional Health Authority and Southern Health. MALAK ABAS / FREE PRESS Shannon McAteer, health care co-ordinator for CUPE Manitoba, speaks at a news conference announcing a potential strike date alongside Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union president Kyle Ross on Tuesday. If an agreement isn’t reached before Oct. 8, thousands of staff in Winnipeg, Brandon, Selkirk, Dauphin, Winkler, Steinbach and Portage will hit the picket lines. “Workers can find jobs at Tim’s, McDonald’s or the deli counter at Co-Op for far more money and work that is physically and mentally less demanding,” MGEU president Kyle Ross said at a news conference Tuesday morning. Ross said support staff are looking to “close the ever-widening pay gap” between them and other health-care providers who’ve received pay raises in recent collective bargaining agreements. MGEU said the starting wage for health-care support workers in Manitoba, $17.07 per hour, is the lowest in the country. They are considered essential workers, meaning Manitoba law requires them to provide necessary health services. What will change if a strike occurs are non-essential aspects of support and care. That could mean fewer baths and reduced food services, among other effects. Angela Bouchard, the lead negotiator for MGEU’s support services staff, said the two unions have agreements with the employers as to which parts of the job are essential. “Some classifications will be reduced. Home care — we have about a 30 per cent reduction across the board, health-care aides — we might see a five to 10 per cent reduction, clerical staff — anywhere from 25 to 50 per cent reduction,” she said. Health-care workers represented by MGEU rejected a contract offer last month. The rejected deal included a one per cent wage increase retroactive to April 1 and an 11.25 per cent wage hike spread over the four years of the contract. Workers represented by CUPE also rejected their offer and voted to strike after the union recommended workers accept the offer. Shannon McAteer, CUPE’s health-care co-ordinator, said she didn’t regret endorsing the previous offer. “It was a fair and reasonable deal, but we heard loud and clear that the members want better working conditions, they want better wages, they want to be respected by their employer and the government,” she said. MALAK ABAS / FREE PRESS Manitoba Government and General Employees’ Union president Kyle Ross announces a potential strike date during a news conference Tuesday. Since that deal was rejected, Ross said both MGEU and CUPE responded to the employer with an offer on Sept. 5 but have not heard back since. McAteer did not say what terms either union has put forward now, saying they were not going to “bargain in the media,” but said monetary gains are part of the counter-offer. In July, nurses avoided a strike after several rounds of bargaining. At the time, the Manitoba Nurses Union was told by Shared Health a mandate meant they could not offer additional monetary benefits.

When asked if there was concern health-care support workers would be told the same, Ross said both MGEU and CUPE were willing to work with the province. “Let’s be clear, they haven’t offered us what they’ve offered the nurses. The nurses have been offered more,” he said. A Shared Health spokesperson said additional bargaining dates are being scheduled now. “While we remain hopeful that an agreement will be reached and a strike’s impact to health services avoided, essential-service agreements are being finalized and we are preparing for all contingencies in order to maintain essential health services for Manitobans,” he said in an email. malak.abas@freepress.mb.ca Malak Abas Reporter Malak Abas is a city reporter at the Free Press .

Report: Health care worker shortage seen across New Mexico "It seems like everybody has a story about having to wait weeks or months to receive health care," said Fred Nathan, the founder of Think New Mexico. "A lot of it has to do with demographics." Report: Health care worker shortage seen across New Mexico "It seems like everybody has a story about having to wait weeks or months to receive health care," said Fred Nathan, the founder of Think New Mexico. "A lot of it has to do with demographics." SEVEN NEWS. NEARLY ALL NEW MEXICO COUNTIES ARE FACING A HEALTH CARE WORKER SHORTAGE. LUIS MUNOZ SPOKE TO THINK NEW MEXICO, WHICH RELEASED A REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO FIX IT. WELL, LATE LAST YEAR, NEW MEXICO RANKED NUMBER 31 NATIONALLY FOR THE RATIO OF DOCTORS TO PATIENTS, BUT SOME STILL STRUGGLE TO FIND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE, AND ONE GROUP THINKS THEY KNOW WHY. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HAS A STORY ABOUT HAVING TO WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE. FRED NATHAN IS A FOUNDER OF THINK NEW MEXICO, A THINK TANK TO HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES OF NEW MEXICANS. THEIR NEWEST REPORT SHOWS NEW MEXICO IS BELOW THE NATIONAL BENCHMARK ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE ROLES. SOME OF THE DATA EXPLAINS THE ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 39% OF THE STATE’S DOCTORS ARE OVER 60 YEARS OLD, EXPECTED TO RETIRE BY 2030. IT ALSO INCLUDES TEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE WORKER SHORTAGE. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED A HEALTH CARE PERMANENT FUND AND WHAT THEY COULD DO IS TAKE ABOUT $2 BILLION OF ONE TIME MONIES THAT WE’RE GETTING FROM OIL AND GAS AND PUTTING THAT IN A FUND AND TAKING THE INCOME FROM THE FUND TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS. ANOTHER SOLUTION, NEW MEXICO JOINING INTERSTATE COMPACTS, SOMETHING NATHAN SAYS WOULD COST NEW MEXICANS NOTHING. THIS IS A COMPACT IS AN AGREEMENT IN THIS CASE BETWEEN STATES THAT SAYS YOUR DOCTORS CAN PRACTICE IN OUR STATE AND OUR DOCTORS CAN PRACTICE IN YOUR STATE. NEW MEXICO HAS JOINED ONE OF THESE AGREEMENTS FOR NURSES, AND IS ONE OF FIVE STATES THAT HAVE JOINED TWO OR LESS SUCH AGREEMENTS. NATHAN SAYS IT’S REALLY ABOUT THE FAMILIES LOOKING FOR CARE. THEY CALLED IN TO OTHER STATES AND THEY FOUND EXPERTS WHO COULD ADVISE THEM. BUT THOSE DOCTORS REFUSED TO TALK TO THEM BECAUSE WE’RE NOT A MEMBER OF THE DOCTOR COMPACT. AND SO THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT, BE PRACTICING WITHOUT A LICENSE IN NEW MEXICO. NOW, NATHAN SAYS THIS SHORTAGE IS SOMETHING NEW MEXICO HAS OVERCOME BEFORE WITH THE HELP OF GOVERNMENT ACTION. REPORTING. I’M MELISSA MUNOZ, KOAT ACTION SEVEN NEWS. WE ASKED NEW MEXICO NURSES ASSOCIATION FOR COMMENT, BUT Updated: 8:11 AM MDT Sep 24, 2024 Editorial Standards ⓘ Alyssa Munoz Reporter Advertisement Report: Health care worker shortage seen across New Mexico "It seems like everybody has a story about having to wait weeks or months to receive health care," said Fred Nathan, the founder of Think New Mexico. "A lot of it has to do with demographics." Updated: 8:11 AM MDT Sep 24, 2024 Editorial Standards ⓘ Alyssa Munoz Reporter Nearly all New Mexico counties are facing a health care worker shortage, according to research from Think New Mexico report. Late last year, New Mexico ranked 31st nationally for the ratio of doctors to patients, but some New Mexicans still struggle to find accessible health care. "It seems like everybody has a story about having to wait weeks or months to receive health care," said Fred Nathan, the founder of Think New Mexico. "A lot of it has to do with demographics. Our population, we're the fourth oldest state. We have a lot of baby boomers who are needing more and more health care at the same time. We're losing doctors. We've lost 30% of our doctors between 2017 and 2021 primary care physicians." He said his organization is a "think tank" to help improve the lives of New Mexicans. Their newest report shows New Mexico is below the national benchmark across different health care roles. Some of the data explains the expected shorting stating over 39% of the state's doctors are over 60 years old, expected to retire by 2030. In the report, there are 10 recommendations to improve the shortage, one that Nathan said would be most impactful is using the state's one-time surplus from oil and gas taxes to create a $2 billion permanent fund for health care. "If the legislature created a health care permanent fund, what they could do is take about $2 billion of one-time money that we're getting from oil and gas and putting that in the fund and taking the income from the fund to pay for health care costs," Nathan said. Another solution: New Mexico joining interstate compacts — something he said would cost New Mexicans nothing. "This is a compact, an agreement in this case, between states that says your doctors can practice in our state, and our doctors can practice in your state," Nathan said. New Mexico has joined one out of 10 of these agreements for nurses. The state is one of five states that have joined two or less such agreements. Nathan said this is really about the families looking for care, including one family who was looking for a second opinion on their son's cancer diagnosis. "They called into other states, and they found the experts who could advise them. Those doctors refused to talk to them because we're not a member of the doctor compact. And so, they would, in effect, be practicing without a license in New Mexico," Nathan said. 10 proposals in the report: Reforming the state's medical malpractice actJoining all ten interstate healthcare worker compacts Creating a centralized credentialing system Making New Mexico's student loan repayment program for health care professionals more competitive Making New Mexico's tax policy friendlier to health are workers Enhancing Medicaid reimbursement rates to health care providers Growing more of our own health care workers by expanding access to health-care-related career and technical educationExpanding access to higher education in health care fields by increasing salaries for the faculty training future health care professionals and providing a tax credit for the preceptorsImporting more international medical graduates into New MexicoUsing some of the state's one-time surplus from oil and gas taxes to create a $2 billion permanent fund for health care Nearly all New Mexico counties are facing a health care worker shortage, according to research from Think New Mexico report .

[Standard, File] A local pharmaceutical manufacturer is set to enhance Kenya's global presence through new exports. SQUARE Pharmaceuticals marked a milestone with its first shipment from the Athi River plant on Friday. The flag-off ceremony included officials from SQUARE Pharmaceuticals Kenya and Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) Director Dr. Iruki Kailemia. The shipment consisted of 5,500 boxes of Angilock tablets, a medication for high blood pressure that combines two ingredients to help control blood pressure levels. Somalia will be the initial destination. "This achievement reflects our dedication to providing high-quality healthcare solutions," Kailemia said, noting plans to supply other African and European countries from the plant. The firm has operated in Kenya since 2004, with its manufacturing facility opening in 2023. Kailemia said the export will boost confidence in Kenyan-made pharmaceuticals among local healthcare professionals. 'This export demonstrates that local pharmaceuticals can meet international standards," he added.

Home / News / Making health care more affordable Health Policy Making health care more affordable By Iman Ramadan September 19, 2024 Hide caption Show caption iStock/Vitalii Petrushenko Jump to Section Share Post LinkedIn Facebook WhatsApp Email Copy link September 19, 2024 – Throughout the fall, Harvard Chan faculty will share evidence-based recommendations on urgent public health issues facing the next U.S. administration. Meredith Rosenthal, the C. Boyden Gray Professor of Health Economics and Policy, offered her thoughts on the challenges related to health care affordability and opportunities for action in the short- and long-term. Q. Why is health care affordability such a pressing public health issue? A. Affordability is a widespread problem even as fewer Americans go without health insurance. The amount people spend directly on health care (not including insurance premiums), known as “out-of-pocket” costs, has been growing faster than inflation and this has several important implications. Surveys consistently show that people delay or forgo care due to cost, worry about their ability to pay for health care bills, and incur medical debt. Health care affordability—or a lack thereof—can harm individual health. Affordability impacts whether people can get the care they need, like insulin to manage their diabetes or following up on a mammogram. If those are too costly, people will delay or skip care, which has significant impacts down the line on both health outcomes and cost. As health care expenses continue to go up, household budgets have to adjust—which means people can’t afford the same kind of groceries or housing they’re used to. That is a public health problem, which has particularly burdensome effects on lower-income, high-need families. Finally, rising costs create an increased risk that people will face catastrophic health care situations that have massive financial implications, with consequences ranging from mortgaging their homes to personal bankruptcy. That also has a direct consequence on people’s well-being. Meredith Rosenthal Q. What are the biggest challenges facing the next administration on health care affordability? A. The biggest challenge is simple: The forces that make health care increasingly unaffordable are complicated. The biggest threat we’ve found is consolidation in medicine. For example, there is a growing trend of hospitals and other corporate entities buying up physician practices and then negotiating as a unit with health insurance companies, driving up prices significantly. To address the root causes, we have to recognize where medical monopolies are forming and try to prevent them from passing on inflated prices to consumers. Q. What are your top policy recommendations to address health care affordability? A. There are two kinds of solutions to improve affordability: the band-aids and the systemic shifts. The band-aids are short-term solutions that can improve affordability for folks in need now, including providing government subsidies to help consumers afford their copays. This assistance would alleviate the immediate price shock for patients and make care more accessible, which is a good thing. However, there is a downside—with the government on the hook for the bill, health care conglomerates are incentivized to raise prices even further. The short-term benefit can create long-term challenges. Another band-aid option is to cap the prices that, for example, hospitals can charge. This could get closer to the heart of the issue but brings its own serious risk; providers could opt out of the market for certain services, which could create shortages. Nailing that balance is a real challenge. Then there are efforts to address the underlying forces that drive price increases—chief among them antitrust enforcement to address the vertical integration currently occurring in health care, which is when independent physicians, hospitals, and physician groups merge to create a health care network. The combined powers of large consolidated health systems and other types of health care corporations mean that some entities can set health care prices with little oversight or pushback. The federal government has antitrust laws in place to address these sorts of monopolies, but it has traditionally been reluctant to challenge health care mergers, especially when those mergers involve vertical integration or other types of consolidation. Enforcing these antitrust laws is a very complicated task that requires coordination between the federal government and state attorneys general, as well as significant political will to stand up to the influence of health systems that have real sway in their communities. Given the challenges and drawbacks of band-aid solutions and systemic shifts, the ideal policy recommendations would strike a balance of short- and long-term solutions. Instituting present-day policies that save consumers money while building to break up the vertical monopolies dominating health care is the best-case scenario to create real and long-lasting relief for consumers. Q. What’s the evidence supporting those recommendations? A. My Harvard Chan School colleague Anna Sinaiko and I have found that vertical integration is increasing —and driving price increases. We’ve also found that vertical integration of primary care physicians and large health systems does drive an increase in per-patient spending —but has no impact on readmission rates, meaning the promise of “integrated” care remains elusive and the extra spending associated with integration is not necessarily making patients healthier. The cost increases alone are important for public health, which we know because there is a strong body of research indicating the importance of health care affordability to people’s physical and mental well-being. For example, Katherine Baicker, a former Harvard Chan School economist now at the University of Chicago, led several papers studying the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon following passage of the Affordable Care Act. The studies found self-reported physical health benefits , increased rates of diabetes detection and management , and better follow-through on preventive care. Beyond the physical benefits, the peace of mind offered by health coverage was noticeable. Newly enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries demonstrated lower rates of depression, thanks in part to reduced financial strain. By making care more affordable and accessible, we can significantly improve health. Q. What do you hope could be accomplished to make health care more affordable in the next four years? A. Policymakers need to consider both short-term fixes to help people most affected by high health care prices and longer-term policies that get at the root causes of declining affordability. Some “band-aids” could be readily implemented—including extending increased health insurance subsidies that were put into place during the public health emergency [of the COVID pandemic] to help people afford their coverage. We could also pursue targeted policies, such as expanding limits on out-of-pocket costs for critical medicines—for example, medicines that control asthma and cardiovascular disease—similar to the recent policies enacted to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin. These high-value treatments that keep people of out hospitals could be partially paid for by savings on health care expenditures and yield better outcomes. On the antitrust enforcement side, hope for action in the immediate future is mixed at best. Efforts to regulate health care prices at the federal and state level may have some role to play going forward, although such efforts face substantial political headwinds. For example, federal law permitted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate prices with manufacturers for a small number of drugs. Manufacturers sued the government but the price negotiations proceeded, with the results announced earlier this year. The federal government should try to learn from its first foray into price negotiation in Medicare and look for ways to continue to leverage its buying power to keep some of the highest cost drugs accessible and affordable—but those benefits only relate to Medicare. Whether and how Medicare’s new price limits can affect privately insured patients remains unclear. I hope that the next administration will make progress in this area, but true change will likely take longer than four years.

[Courtesy] The private sector plays a crucial role in Kenya's healthcare market, contributing to nearly 50 per cent of healthcare services, a report has revealed. Dubbed 'The State of Kenya's Health Market 2024', the report identifies several challenges within Kenya's healthcare market, including fragmented coordination between public and private healthcare providers, limited data sharing, financial constraints and supply chain issues. The report launched on Thursday indicates that despite improvements in healthcare service delivery, Kenya's healthcare system remains heavily reliant on donor funding, with counties financially dependent on national health financing. Based on an assessment across six key counties, the report highlights the challenges and opportunities that could reshape the country's healthcare system while offering critical insights into Kenya's evolving healthcare market and outlining strategies to improve access to high-quality healthcare services. Speaking at the launch on behalf of Health CS, Dr Martin Sirengo said the research is essential for both national and county governments, and it highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in reshaping our healthcare system. Sirengo emphasised the importance of addressing these challenges, particularly in maternal healthcare. . Keep Reading Kenya's healthcare inequality persists as self-care, local production gain momentum 35 private hospitals closed over SHA fraud No cash, no services: Private hospitals declare "With all these interventions, why has the maternal mortality ratio not come down? We need to find answers to this problem," he remarked. Dr Sirengo said the time has come for the public and private sector to establish strategic partnerships and sustainably deliver UHC. He said with the government, private sector and development partners united in this vision, Kenya is poised to make significant strides in transforming its healthcare landscape and ensuring the well-being of all its citizens. Sirengo's sentiments were echoed by Dr Lyndon Marani, Technical Advisor for the USAID PSE Program who highlighted the importance of a robust legal and regulatory framework in driving the transformation of Kenya's health sector. He noted that the Kenya partnership and coordination framework offers a mechanism for managing the entire healthcare market. Dr Marani, however, acknowledged the need for county-level engagement documents to address implementation challenges. Marani also pointed to the Digital Healthcare Superhighway initiative, which aims to develop a digital ecosystem that will provide greater data availability, enabling decision-makers to better understand and strengthen the health market. "Kenya's health market is vast, covering a wide range of services and products. These counties were selected to help identify key opportunities for improving market efficiency and patient outcomes," Marani said, referring to Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Homa Bay. Sylvia Wamuhu Chief of Party for the USAID PSE Program said there is a need for collaboration with the Ministry of Health to enhance the quality of services offered by private healthcare facilities. "We are supporting private health facilities to enhance the competitive services they offer , ensuring that the quality of services provided meets the standards recommended by the Government of Kenya," Wamuhu said. She said one of the program's key goals is to increase the visibility of locally produced health products. "As Kenyans, we need to change the perception that locally manufactured goods do not meet quality standards, they do," she stated. In her remarks, Dr Margaret Njenga, CEO of Population Services Kenya, highlighted the critical role of the not-for-profit sector in Kenya's healthcare market, working alongside public and private sectors to provide high-quality, affordable healthcare. "We are bringing in the government, development partners, and the private sector so that patients can get high-quality services that are affordable," she said. She pointed out the financial constraints affecting healthcare facilities, despite Kenya's progress. "As much as we have made progress as a country, we are yet to reach the recommended Abuja Declaration of 15 per cent health financing. Right now, we are at 11 per cent, and much more needs to be done," said Njenga.

Article Insights Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck are most popular: within Technology topic(s) As this fall's election approaches, headwinds have been brewing in DC and state legislatures for private equity health care dealmaking, many of them with bipartisan support. While a key Senate committee scrutinized patient care ramifications from the Steward Health Care bankruptcy and California passed the first attorney general review of health care acquisitions, the FTC's muscular opposition to health care roll-ups and noncompetition covenants continues to reverberate. On Sept. 12, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing titled " Examining the Bankruptcy of Steward Health Care: How Management Decisions Have Impacted Patient Care ." The hearing focused on the consequences of the mismanagement of Steward Health Care and impacts on surrounding communities. Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) labeled the U.S. health care system as broken, prioritizing corporate profits over patient care. He blamed the role of private equity, particularly Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre deploying financial strategies that left hospitals deeply in debt and forced to close while he and his partners profited significantly. Chairman Sanders described private equity as driving up health care costs and diminishing care quality and demanded both accountability and reform. Ranking Member Bill Cassidy (R-LA) shared concerns about the level of patient care and mismanagement of hospitals by Steward Health Care. Chair Sanders and Ranking Member Cassidy critiqued de la Torre's absence and indicated they are considering holding the CEO in criminal contempt for violating the congressional subpoena. At the same time, states are increasingly placing the corporate consolidation of medicine under a microscope. Indeed, officials in 10 other states have adopted rules or passed laws requiring closer scrutiny of health care markets. Earlier this month, the California state legislature passed a bill to require attorney general review for all health care acquisitions by private-equity firms and hedge funds. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Texas in Ryan vs. Federal Trade Commission set aside the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) controversial noncompete rule last month ruling that it would not become effective on Sept. 4 as previously scheduled and cannot be enforced by the FTC (see Brownstein's prior alert on the case here ). The case narrowly averted, for the time being, the FTC's noncompete rule banning all noncompete agreements for workers both proactively and retroactively, except under certain narrow circumstances, including an exception for a noncompete agreement entered into in the context of a sale of a business. However, numerous state legislatures have already taken up the charge of severely limiting or outright banning noncompetition covenants, with outright bans in California, Minnesota, North Dakota and Oklahoma and many other states including Colorado banning noncompetes with limited exceptions, such as high earners or key employees. While some state legislatures around the country have included carve-outs from their noncompete bans for high earners and for protection of legitimate intellectual property interests, particularly when developed by the departing employee, as well as noncompetes restricting a seller in connection with the sale of a business, the FTC did not permit these carve-outs from its noncompete ban. Without these tools, businesses would need to identify other approaches to secure intellectual property from unfair competition and protect the goodwill that they acquire upon the acquisition of another business. The FTC's aggressive opposition to noncompetes followed its lawsuit against U.S. Anesthesia Partners, Inc. (USAP) and its private equity sponsor, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, asserting they crafted a "multi-year anticompetitive scheme" to consolidate anesthesiology practices in Texas by "rolling up" and monopolizing the market for anesthesiology in Texas. In so doing, FTC Chair Lina Khan staked out a strong position on roll-up strategies, alleging that Welsh Carson created USAP in 2012 to acquire large anesthesia practices as part of a plan to increase prices and drive profits. The complaint further alleged that the private equity sponsor and USAP entered into price-setting agreements with independent anesthesiology practices and allocated markets under an agreement with a significant competitor. While the court later granted private equity firm Welsh Carson's motion to dismiss it from the lawsuit, the case is still pending against USAP. For its part, private equity argues that it plays a critical role in supporting quality, affordable health care in the United States. According to the American Investment Council, private equity has invested nearly $1 trillion into U.S. health care since 2006, representing nearly 12.7% of all health care investments during this period, helping fund innovations, deliver more effective treatments and increase access to care for millions of Americans and, in some cases, significantly decreasing patient mortality. While the FTC may yet appeal the Texas court's ruling on its noncompete ban, it has maintained its aggressive stance against health care mergers generally and private equity-backed rollups specifically. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care has created a rare moment of bipartisanship, with both the left and the right scrutinizing patient care and mismanagement. Dealmakers should proceed with caution in navigating a challenging regulatory environment for competition and consolidation issues. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Michael W. King Allen P.

Article Content:
The overall performance of the US health care system ranked last compared with nine other high-income countries in a new report. John Minchillo/AP/File CNN — The US spends more on health care than any other high-income country, but a new report suggests that “Americans are sicker, die younger and struggle to afford essential health care.” Compared with nine other high-income nations, the United States ranked last overall this year, with a lower life expectancy and higher rates of death and disease despite spending the most on health care, according to the report , released Thursday by the independent research group The Commonwealth Fund. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - JANUARY 31: Respiratory Therapist Nirali Patel works with a COVID-19 patient in the ICU at Rush University Medial Center on January 31, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. Respiratory therapists work with physicians and nurses to help patients restore and maintain normal lung capacity and blood/oxygen levels. After two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an estimated 1,000,000 American deaths. Scott Olson/Getty Images Related article US spends most on health care but has worst health outcomes among high-income countries, new report finds The three top-performing countries in the report were Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. “This report reveals that our health system is continuing to lag far behind other nations when it comes to meeting our citizens’ basic health care needs. The US spends more on health care than any other country, and Americans are sicker, die younger and struggle to afford essential health care. We spend the most and get the least for our investment,” Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of The Commonwealth Fund, said in a news briefing. “As a primary care doctor, I see the human toll of these shortcomings in our system on a daily basis. I have patients who need medications they can’t afford. I spend time going back and forth with insurance companies who have denied care I know my patients need, and I see older patients who arrive sicker than they should because they’ve spent the majority of their lives uninsured,” Betancourt added. “This report underscores the many lessons we could learn from others on how to strengthen our health care delivery and outcomes,” he said. “It provides a blueprint for health leaders and policymakers on how the US can achieve more equitable, affordable care for all Americans.” Countries with highest health care rankings Researchers at The Commonwealth Fund compared and analyzed the performance of health systems across 10 countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The researchers took a close look at how the health systems performed on 70 measures across five key domains in those countries: access to care, the health care process, administrative efficiency, equity and health outcomes. The assessments were based on data from the World Health Organization, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Our World in Data and international surveys that the Commonwealth Fund conducts. The countries with the highest overall rankings across the five key areas were: 1. Australia 2. The Netherlands 3. The United Kingdom 4. New Zealand 5. France The countries that had the lowest overall rankings across the five key areas were: 6. Sweden 7. Canada 8. Switzerland 9. Germany 10. The United States When the researchers analyzed each country by each key domain, the United States ranked last on access to care, indicating that Americans face the most barriers to accessing and affording health care. The nation also ranked last in health outcomes, including acute illnesses, chronic diseases and death. The researchers noted that people in the United States live the shortest lives and face the most avoidable deaths among the 10 countries, and the US had the highest rates of excess deaths related to the Covid-19 pandemic for people younger than 75, according to the report. The United States ranked ninth in equity, indicating that disparities persist in how people with various incomes and from different backgrounds may access and experience health care. The country also ranked ninth in administrative efficiency, indicating that doctors and patients in the US are more likely to report problems related to insurance approvals and billing. Jae C. Hong/AP/FILE Related article New poll shows jump in adults who rate the quality of US health care as ‘poor’ “Administrative requirements can cost time and money for patients and doctors,” Reginald Williams II, vice president of international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund, said in the briefing. “Many countries have simplified their health insurance and payment systems, usually through legislation, regulation and standardization. For example, other countries apply standardized payments to all physicians for services, and do that on a regional basis, so that doctors know what they’ll be paid, and patients know what portion they’ll be responsible for,” he said. “They make it much simpler.” The one domain for which the United States ranked high was the care process, which suggests that the health care it delivers includes aspects or attributes that are considered essential for high-quality care. The researchers noted that “all countries have something to learn from one another.” Yet there were relatively small differences in the overall performance among all of the countries except the United States, which was “the only clear outlier.” The other nine countries may have different health care systems, but they all had universal coverage, the researchers wrote, which ensures that any copayments for health services are small, improving both access and affordability. “A lot of the lagging performance of the United States’ health care system has to do with access to care and equity of care, both of which are heavily influenced by the availability and quality of insurance,” Dr. David Blumenthal, former president of The Commonwealth Fund, said in the briefing. “The United States lags both in having 20-plus million Americans still uninsured – 7% to 8% of the population – though an historic low, still very high by international standards,” he said. “It also lacks in terms of the ability of lower-income people to get access to basic services.” Portrait of a doctor listening to an elderly woman patient's heartbeat andreswd/E+/Getty Images Related article Older Americans worry they can’t afford their own health care Additionally, the researchers found that health care spending was similar in the other countries but not in the US, which spends far more on health care than its peers yet has the worst overall performance. The two countries with the highest overall rankings, Australia and the Netherlands, had the lowest health care spending To improve the state of its health care, the US can expand insurance coverage, shrink disparities in care, and reduce the administrative burden and complexities of insurance plans, the researchers wrote. It’s also important for the United States to “invest in interventions outside of health care to address the social drivers of health: poverty, homelessness, hunger, discrimination, gun violence, substance use,” Williams said. The report also called for a more robust primary care system in the United States. For instance, “primary care physicians in the Netherlands are required to have coverage after hours. As a person in the Netherlands, you always can get access to your primary care physician or a covering physician, 24/7, and that, of course, is not true in the United States,” Blumenthal said. “Americans are most likely to report difficulties getting after-hours care, resulting in their having to use emergency rooms for after-hours care,” he said. “That’s a very simple intervention that would reduce the cost of care, reduce the access problems and reduce the administrative complexity of care.” ‘The American electorate makes the choices’ The upcoming US presidential election could play a significant role in the future of the nation’s health care system, Blumenthal said. “The American electorate makes choices about which direction to move in, and that is very much an issue in this election,” he said. “If we are continuing to lay the foundation for improvement of our health care system, elections that result in expansions of insurance coverage, based on the existing programs, would take us in the direction that makes us closer in performance to other international comparisons.” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

The rankings in the new report parallel those in a paper that The Commonwealth Fund released last year that found the US had the highest rates of deaths from avoidable or treatable causes and the highest maternal and infant death rates yet still spends more on health care than any other high-income country. “We’re not getting the best value for our health care dollar,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in either report, said last year. To help fix the holes in the US health care system, Benjamin said, there are three steps the nation can take. “We’re still the only nation that does not have universal health care or access for all of our citizens,” Benjamin said. Second, “we don’t do as much primary care prevention as the other nations, and we still have a public health system, which is fractured,” he said. “The third thing is, we under-invest compared to other industrialized nations in societal things. They spend their money on providing upfront support for their citizens. We spend our money on sick care.”

Title: Insider Stock Buying Reaches S$756 . 1k On Quantum Healthcare

Insider Stock Buying Reaches S$756.1k On Quantum Healthcare editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) September 18, 2024 3 min read It is usually uneventful when a single insider buys stock. However, When quite a few insiders buy shares, as it happened in Quantum Healthcare Limited's ( Catalist:V8Y ) case, it's fantastic news for shareholders. While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Quantum Healthcare Quantum Healthcare Insider Transactions Over The Last Year In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Chin Thean Quek bought S$300k worth of shares at a price of S$0.002 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of S$0.002 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Quantum Healthcare insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices. In the last twelve months Quantum Healthcare insiders were buying shares, but not selling. They paid about S$0.0033 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! Catalist:V8Y Insider Trading Volume September 19th 2024 Quantum Healthcare is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find small cap companies at attractive valuations, this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket. Insiders At Quantum Healthcare Have Bought Stock Recently Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Quantum Healthcare. CEO & Executive Director Gim Chua Tan bought S$48k worth of shares in that time. It's good to see the insider buying, as well as the lack of recent sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small. Does Quantum Healthcare Boast High Insider Ownership? Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Quantum Healthcare insiders own 71% of the company, worth about S$11m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders. Story Continues So What Does This Data Suggest About Quantum Healthcare Insiders? We note a that there has been a bit of insider buying recently (but no selling). Overall the buying isn't worth writing home about. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Quantum Healthcare insiders feel good about the company's future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Quantum Healthcare. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Quantum Healthcare (2 are a bit concerning) you should be aware of.

Innovation How To Handle Healthcare Cybersecurity Challenges With Machine Learning Algorithms By Alexei Dulub , Former Forbes Councils Member. for Forbes Technology Council COUNCIL POST Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Sep 18, 2024, 07:15am EDT Share Save Alexei Dulub is the founder and CEO of PixelPlex , an R&D company powering meaningful digital transformation across industries. getty The healthcare sector is increasingly reliant on digital technologies, demonstrating a strong commitment to using advanced tools for better patient care and more efficient data management. However, this has also made the industry a lucrative target for cybercriminals. Machine learning (ML) algorithms offer a promising solution in this challenging scenario. Here, I’ll dive into how ML goes beyond just being a popular term to become a powerful tool in safeguarding our most sensitive healthcare data. Key Cybersecurity Risks In The Healthcare Sector First of all, I’d like to share the specific reasons why healthcare data is so attractive to cybercriminals. Reason number one is the high value of personal health information (PHI), which includes detailed medical histories, insurance information and personal identifiers. This data can be sold on the black market or used in identity theft schemes. Healthcare systems are also vulnerable due to their integrated platforms, ranging from electronic health records to patient portals, each presenting potential access points for cybercriminals. Last but not least is the critical nature of healthcare services. This aspect makes these organizations attractive targets for ransomware attacks, as they are more likely to pay quickly to resume operations and patient care. Cybersecurity Threats Facing Healthcare Providers Here is a list of the most common cybersecurity risks that not only exploit the vulnerabilities mentioned above but also pose significant threats to the confidentiality of patient data and the continuity of healthcare services. • Theft Of Patient Data: Cybercriminals often target patient records to sell on the black market or use in fraud schemes. • Insider Threats: Employees or associates with access to the healthcare systems can misuse their access for personal gain or inadvertently cause a data breach. • Ransomware Attacks: These involve encrypting an organization’s data and demanding payment for its release. • Phishing Scams: These scams trick employees into revealing sensitive information or credentials, leading to unauthorized access to healthcare systems. How Machine Learning Boosts Healthcare Cybersecurity We regularly apply ML algorithms in our software development projects and, specifically, in healthcare projects. Based on my experience, I can say that ML is a big step forward in healthcare cybersecurity compared to older methods. Traditional ways, like signature-based detection, have their limits. Basically, this method works by matching known virus patterns, but it can't spot new or slightly changed viruses that aren't already in its database. So, it's not great at catching new types of cyber threats that keep changing. In contrast, ML employs algorithms that learn from data, adapting continuously to new information. This capability allows ML systems to identify and respond to threats in real time, a crucial advantage in healthcare cybersecurity where the threat landscape is rapidly evolving. Let's explore other advantages that show why ML is an ideal solution for tackling cybersecurity threats in healthcare: Enhanced Data Analysis ML algorithms can analyze complex and diverse data sets more effectively than traditional methods. They can uncover hidden patterns and correlations that might indicate a security threat, offering a deeper insight into potential vulnerabilities. Automated Incident Response ML can automate responses to detected threats, significantly reducing the time and resources needed for manual intervention. This automation is vital in healthcare, where quick response to security incidents is crucial. Scalability ML solutions can efficiently handle the vast amounts of data generated in healthcare. They can scale up as data volume grows, ensuring consistent protection. Predictive Capabilities These systems can spot future security risks by looking at data patterns and trends. This helps in strengthening defenses early to prevent upcoming attacks. Customization ML algorithms can be tailored to the specific cybersecurity needs of a healthcare organization. Five Best ML Practices To Safeguard Your Organization I’d like to share the best ML practices we use in our projects. These practices can help strengthen your organization's cybersecurity defense. 1. Identify unusual patterns and data flows. ML algorithms swiftly analyze data to identify deviations from normal behavior, such as unusual login attempts or unexpected data access. This enables healthcare organizations to detect and prevent potential breaches or attacks promptly. 2. Detect phishing attempts. Traditional email filters might miss sophisticated phishing attempts, but ML can fill this gap. ML algorithms can analyze email content, including subtle cues and patterns that are typically overlooked, to identify and flag phishing emails. 3. Analyze cyber threat trends in real time. ML can then help create suitable defense mechanisms. By understanding the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, healthcare organizations can adapt their cybersecurity strategies accordingly. 4. Automate threat intelligence gathering. ML can automate the process of collecting and analyzing threat intelligence from various sources. This continuous, automated gathering and analysis of data enable healthcare organizations to stay ahead of new vulnerabilities and attack strategies, ensuring that their security measures are always relevant. 5. Implement ML-driven risk assessment. ML can analyze historical data and current trends. This helps in identifying potential areas of vulnerability within the organization's network, allowing for targeted strengthening of defenses. ML Challenges You Need To Address When applying ML, dealing with data privacy and ethical issues is really important. ML in healthcare means handling a lot of patient data, which brings up big privacy concerns. It's crucial to keep this data safe and private. Also, there are ethical issues with how ML is used, particularly in decision-making processes that affect patient care. There's a pressing need for transparency in these algorithms to prevent biases and ensure fair treatment across all patient demographics. Another significant challenge is ensuring that all employees receive comprehensive training on ML technology. They need to understand not only how to use it but also the fundamental principles of ML, its capabilities and its limitations. Overall, when used wisely and responsibly, ML becomes a powerful tool for healthcare providers to fight cyber threats. Its ability to adapt, learn and predict fits well for tackling the ever-changing and complex cybersecurity issues in the healthcare sector.

The tool highlights the most important legislation that nurses and healthcare leaders should be aware of heading into national election season SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Incredible Health , the largest career marketplace for permanent healthcare workers, announced today the launch of its Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses , furthering the company's mission to help healthcare professionals live better lives. In a healthcare landscape where legislative efforts play a critical role in shaping the environment in which nurses and healthcare leaders operate, Incredible Health's Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses aims to ensure these professionals and leaders are well-informed on policies that impact their work and well-being. By highlighting key national and state-level legislation and policies, this tool helps healthcare professionals navigate these complex issues and serve as an essential resource and call to action to ensure their voices are heard during upcoming elections. Incredible Health's commitment to supporting the one million nurses and 1,500 hospital locations on its marketplace nationwide includes continuing to provide resources for nurses to find their dream jobs, connect with peers, and stay informed. The company also helps health systems find and retain top permanent nursing talent. The Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses is a natural extension of the company's vision to help healthcare professionals live better lives, and find and do their best work. The Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses, available on Incredible Health's website and mobile apps, enables health systems and nurses to access a quick "at a glance" insight into the policy proposals that affect them most. In addition to highlighting relevant policies, the tool provides links to Incredible Health and third-party resources, actionable steps for getting involved with advocacy efforts, and facts on key policy supporters. "Presidential elections always dominate news cycles, but it's important to recognize that healthcare policy is shaped by federal, state, and local policies, as well as licensing boards, and is built by one piece of legislation at a time," said Iman Abuzeid MD, CEO and co-founder of Incredible Health. "We see it as our responsibility to ensure that nurses have easy access to policy information that impacts their lives, careers, and professions. Our Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses features clear calls to action, making it simpler for nurses and healthcare leaders to engage in the legislative process and advocate for the changes they want to see in their workplace and for the future of this critical workforce." The Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses includes policy insights focusing on: Nurse Mental Health and Wellbeing - The pandemic significantly impacted nurse mental health and well-being, with lingering effects of increased stress and burnout still felt today. The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act , signed in 2022, aims to improve access to and reduce the stigma of mental health treatment for healthcare workers. Congress is considering reauthorizing and funding the Act with a focus on reducing administrative burden, which is a top driver of burnout. Nurse mental health is an area of focus for Incredible Health, where millions of nurses have benefited from its Nurse Wellness Toolkit . Educational Support - Supporting nursing education is key to the future of the nursing profession. Legislation like the Stop Nurse Shortages Act increases access to accelerated nursing degree programs, increases the number of clinical training sites, and offers student financial assistance to increase the number of graduating nurses, including graduates from underrepresented backgrounds. Policies like these aim to increase the supply of qualified healthcare workers, which is especially critical as the US faces a nursing shortage that 90% of healthcare executives in Incredible Health's 2024 Healthcare Executive Report predict will worsen in the coming years. Workplace Safety and Violence - Workplace safety and violence are among the most pressing issues facing the nursing profession today. According to Incredible Health's 2024 State of US Nursing Report , 50% of nurses have been verbally and/or physically assaulted by a patient or a member of the patient's family within the past year. The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act calls on the Department of Labor to issue an occupational safety and health standard that requires covered employers within the health care and social service industries to develop and implement a comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan. "Nurses are critical to our healthcare system and patient care, yet they are often left out of the conversations that directly impact their profession. With tools like Incredible Health's Healthcare Policy Navigator for Nurses, nurses are given the power to understand and actively participate in shaping the policies that impact them," said J. Corey Feist , JD, MBA, CEO & Co-Founder of the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation. "We must always ensure that healthcare legislation is informed by those who are on the frontlines every day and that nurses feel empowered and equipped to advocate for their rights and working conditions."

Title: Bipartisan support for health care price transparency

Opinion The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill Price transparency is key to reducing health care costs by Vivian Ho, opinion contributor - 09/13/24 12:00 PM ET by Vivian Ho, opinion contributor - 09/13/24 12:00 PM ET Share ✕ LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email An ambulance drives through the Texas Medical Center Thursday, June 25, 2020, in Houston. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) Health care has emerged as a fault line in this year’s election campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris supports expanding the Affordable Care Act , while former President Donald Trump wants to scale it back. Yet there’s one health care policy that the Biden-Harris and Trump administrations both supported and can coalesce around again: price transparency. This bipartisan health care fix is supported by 92 percent of Americans, according to a new poll by Echelon Insights and SocialSphere. Thirty-two economists, including me, recently sent a letter to U.S. senators, urging them to pass the Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0 , co-sponsored by Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). This bill requires providers and insurers to publish their actual prices, including their cash and negotiated insurance rates, empowering consumers with choice and competition. Such systemwide price transparency can substantially reduce health care costs while boosting the economy and worker paychecks. Prices are a necessary component of functioning markets, and their absence in American health care is a major reason for runaway costs that burden patients, employers and workers. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , the average annual employer-sponsored family health insurance premium is $24,000, a 50 percent increase over the last decade. Hidden health care prices cause an information asymmetry that gives hospitals and health insurers unfair pricing power over consumers who are forced to pay with the equivalent of a blank check. It’s no surprise that health care costs are a top concern for voters. The Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University recently analyzed hospital and health insurance charges in Houston and found wide price variations for the same care — a sign of market failure. For example, among patients covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the average price of a hospital stay for 25 common diagnoses was $18,858 in the Houston Methodist hospital system, more than twice as much as at several independent hospitals in Harris County. The average price for 32 outpatient services negotiated by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas in Harris County varied from $1,500 to $3,000, depending on the hospital. The average price for 19 outpatient services negotiated by Aetna in Harris County ranged from less than $2,000 to more than $6,000, again depending on the hospital. Our analysis was only able to compare prices for a limited number of diagnoses and services because the data was non-standardized and incomplete. The Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0 would finally unleash all prices throughout the health care system in a standard format, allowing consumers to spot price variations and choose high-value care. Armed with this price information, employers could steer employees to less expensive care and share savings through lower premiums. Employers would also finally get access to their complete claims receipt data, which they could compare with health plan spending and posted prices to avoid overbilling, errors and fraud. Prices foster competition, greatly reducing pervasive waste and unproductive middle players that proliferate in the dark and drive-up costs. According to a 2019 JAMA study , 25 percent of U.S. health expenditures, which reached $4.5 trillion in 2022 , is administrative waste and unnecessary overcharging. This study implies an annual economic stimulus of around $1 trillion from an efficient and transparent system. Economists of all backgrounds support price transparency as a fundamental solution to the American health care cost crisis. But you don’t need to be an economist to understand the importance of upfront prices. Ordinary Americans already price shop for all other goods and services and would do so for non-emergency health care if given the chance. With the help of tech innovators and consumer-friendly apps, health care price disclosures would empower patients and businesses to choose affordable care. This Congress should conclude its term by passing the bipartisan Health Care PRICE Transparency Act 2.0. It would bring Republicans and Democrats together during this contentious campaign season. More importantly, it would take a big step toward a pro-consumer health care system that reduces costs, raises worker pay and stimulates the economy at this time when it’s needed most.

Nihatcan Yanik Sep 30, 2024 Decentralized solver pools offer a solution to liquidity fragmentation in DeFi Fragmented liquidity and complex cross-chain transactions have made DeFi less accessible for users. Listen 0:00 14438 Spotlight Sponsored Content Clip Finance aims to simplify the DeFi experience with decentralized solver pools and a one-click solution for seamless cross-chain liquidity. The decentralized finance (DeFi) space is enjoying an explosive growth, with forecasts expecting DeFi to reach $48 billion by 2031. However, the underlying tech faces a fundamental problem — liquidity is scattered across an expanding ecosystem of blockchains. Users often find themselves navigating a web of bridges, protocols and complicated processes. Making the end-user a part of the backend processes, this fragmentation leads to wasted capital, high transaction costs and missed opportunities. As DeFi matures, the demand for a more efficient way to access liquidity across multiple chains grows. Yet, the complexity of building cross-chain solutions has resulted in high barriers to entry, keeping the benefits of DeFi confined to a select group of sophisticated users. Without a simpler and more effective way to manage liquidity across different platforms, the dream of a truly interconnected financial ecosystem remains out of reach. Decentralized solver pools for cross-chain transactions Clip Finance, a universal capital coordination protocol, steps into the fragmented DeFi landscape with a mission to make cross-chain liquidity accessible to everyone. The platform allows users to deposit assets across multiple blockchains with a single click, eliminating the complexity that has plagued DeFi users. Decentralized solver pools, which tackle the issue of liquidity fragmentation head-on, are at the heart of Clip Finance’s innovation. These pools enable users to stake their assets, which are then used to facilitate and fulfill cross-chain transactions. By contributing to these pools, users help bridge liquidity across different blockchains. The process is powered by solvers — decentralized nodes that monitor, propose and validate transactions across chains. This decentralized system distributes transaction fulfillment and breaks down the traditional barriers that limit cross-chain liquidity access to only a few entities, making it more inclusive and efficient. How Clip Finance’s decentralized solver pools work. Source: Clip Finance Liquidity providers can earn yield in this decentralized process by contributing to real transaction activity. Instead of relying on token emissions, as many DeFi projects do, Clip Finance’s model offers yield driven by real capital utilization, aligning growth with tangible activity in the ecosystem. Simplicity meets efficiency Clip Finance’s one-click cross-chain transaction system offers users a simpler way to move liquidity between blockchains and deposit into DeFi strategy from any other chain. What used to require multiple steps — navigating different platforms, dealing with approvals and worrying about bridge security — can now be handled with just a single click. Streamlining asset movement, Clip Finance integrates directly with DeFi protocols and offers a software development kit (SDK) that enables other platforms to incorporate this one-click solution. By reducing the technical overhead, Clip Finance empowers more users to participate in DeFi, opening the doors to a more inclusive financial system. Tokenomics that incentivize growth Another key differentiator for Clip Finance is its tokenomics model. Unlike many DeFi platforms that release tokens based on the passage of time, Clip Finance ties token unlocks to the platform’s total value locked (TVL) growth. This means that as the platform scales, users who contribute liquidity are directly rewarded in alignment with the platform’s success. Clip Finance’s roadmap. Source: Clip Finance This performance-based token model incentivizes long-term engagement and growth, ensuring that rewards are tied to the actual expansion of the Clip Finance ecosystem. “Money across different blockchains will be consolidated in a way where end-users will not know whether their stablecoins are on Ethereum, Linea, Solana, Sui, Apros or any other chain,” said Clip Finance CEO Artur Schaback, adding: “They will simply be able to use their stablecoin like it’s in their wallet.” With its decentralized solver pools and one-click cross-chain deposit functionality, Clip Finance opens new doors for liquidity providers and users to earn yield from real market activity, not just inflationary token emissions. By simplifying liquidity management and enhancing cross-chain interoperability , platforms like Clip Finance help DeFi realize its full potential as a truly interconnected, accessible financial system.

Audio By Carbonatix The Bank of Ghana (BoG) says it has tightened its supervisory and monitoring systems in the financial sector to reduce the alarming number of fraud cases. This was after its latest annual Fraud Report showed that the number of staff involved in fraudulent activities in banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking Institutions (SDIs) rose from 188 in 2022 to 274 in 2023, representing an increase of 46 percent. In addition money lost through fraud cases increase by 7 percent to hit 88 million cedis in the same period under assessment. Speaking to Joy Business, the Deputy Director of the Financial Stability Department at the BoG, Dr. John Dadzie disclosed that measures have been outlined to compel banks to submit a roadmap to curing the canker. “The Bank of Ghana is concerned about fraud prevention across all banks. We do not differentiate between institutions with higher or lower fraud rates. Upon releasing our reports, we write to all banks to submit strategies outlining their plans to minimize fraud incidence and related losses”, he said. Dr. Dadzie stated that the aim of the BoG is reduce fraud in the financial sector to the lowest level to discourage staff and the public from being enticed to engage in fraudulent acts. He added that it is the wish of the bank to stop from fraudulent activities from occurring in the first place. “Fraud is fraud and from the regulators point of view, we are looking at not having fraud situations at all. Even if a bank has one or two incidences of fraud, the impact could be very significant”, he pointed out. Declining to mention specific names of banks involved, Dr. Dadzie said the mandate of the central bank is to put in measures that will prescribe punitive actions for anybody involved in fraud in the financial sector. “The Bank of Ghana is very much concerned not just in terms of who has more or less. Fraudulent activities are unacceptable, and from a regulator point of view, we aim to eliminate such occurrences entirely. Even isolated incidents of fraud can have significant consequences for banks”.

Mogadishu, Sep 17 : The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) said it has approved a grant of $6.6 million to strengthen Somalia's financial architecture for inclusive and equitable growth. AfDB said in a statement issued on Monday that the Somalia Financial Sector Development Project will also enhance financial sector expertise through targeted training and assistance. The project will focus on improving the capacity of financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Somalia, the Somali Development and Reconstruction Bank, and the Financial Reporting Center, to formulate efficient credit delivery and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, Xinhua news agency reported. "This will also build robust national financial systems that offer increased long-term finance availability, reduced intermediation costs, and improved financial infrastructure," said Ahmed Attout, AfDB's director of the Financial Sector Development Department. Somalia has long grappled with security threats from armed groups that depend on illicit financing, and strengthening its financial institutions is thus crucial for its stability and that of the wider Horn of Africa region, according to the AfDB. AfDB said the reforms seek to build a competitive and globally connected financial sector in Somalia, enhancing stability, trust, and financial inclusion, and attracting private investment. "This is a timely intervention that will enhance governance, accountability, skills, and technology development while fostering private sector growth through regulatory improvements and financial sector development," Attout said. According to the Bank, institutional barriers, as well as insecurity, have made Somalia's integration into the global financial system difficult. The absence of intermediary and correspondent banking services has further isolated the country from international financial networks, limiting critical remittance inflows.

AfDB said in a statement issued on Monday that the Somalia Financial Sector Development Project will also enhance financial sector expertise through targeted training and assistance. The project will focus on improving the capacity of financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Somalia, the Somali Development and Reconstruction Bank, and the Financial Reporting Center, to formulate efficient credit delivery and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, Xinhua news agency reported. "This will also build robust national financial systems that offer increased long-term finance availability, reduced intermediation costs, and improved financial infrastructure," said Ahmed Attout, AfDB's director of the Financial Sector Development Department. Somalia has long grappled with security threats from armed groups that depend on illicit financing, and strengthening its financial institutions is thus crucial for its stability and that of the wider Horn of Africa region, according to the AfDB. AfDB said the reforms seek to build a competitive and globally connected financial sector in Somalia, enhancing stability, trust, and financial inclusion, and attracting private investment. "This is a timely intervention that will enhance governance, accountability, skills, and technology development while fostering private sector growth through regulatory improvements and financial sector development," Attout said. According to the Bank, institutional barriers, as well as insecurity, have made Somalia's integration into the global financial system difficult. The absence of intermediary and correspondent banking services has further isolated the country from international financial networks, limiting critical remittance inflows.

Dr Ernest Addison — BoG Governor Financial sector fraud unacceptable Graphic Business Editorial Business News Sep - 17 - 2024 , 04:50 It has emerged that the level of fraud cases reported within the country’s financial services sector is still rising despite efforts by the Bank of Ghana to get players within the industry to check the practice. For instance, data collated from the three sub-sectors, banks, Special Deposit Taking Institutions (SDIs), and Payment system platforms (PSPs) indicated that overall, the count of fraud cases increased to 15,865 in 2023 from 15,164 in 2022, reflecting a 5% rise. These cases, the report noted, corresponded to a total loss value of approximately GH¢88 million in 2023 as compared to GH¢82 million in 2022, indicating an increase of about 7%. This staling revelation was contained in the publication of the annual Fraud Report by the Bank of Ghana (BOG), 2023, which seeks to create awareness of fraud occurrences and trends identified within the reporting year with the view to promote the soundness and integrity of the banking system. The 2023 report presents fraud typologies observed in relation to services provided by banks, SDIs and PSPs. (Read the full story on the front page). The Graphic Business finds the development worrying just as it is a disturbing trend because it speaks ill of a sector that is battling to recover fully from the impact of the government’s Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP). We believe that considering the value of a financial sector to the development of every economy, there should be no room for such sad events which goes to undermine confidence and trust in such an important sector. What we believe, should not be lost on us is the fact that the level of financial inclusion in the country is still low despite the use of electronic payments and, therefore, such cases further goes to reduce the confidence people have in the sector. We also want to remind the players in the sector that the impact of the banking sector reforms, coupled with the DDEP, has seriously affected the confidence people have in the financial sector and, therefore, it behoves them to strictly follow the BoG directives to ensure that they minimise or better still, reverse this worrying trend. It is increasingly becoming evident that the players in the financial services sector are dropping the ball by focusing more on deposit mobilisation without putting in the necessary measures in a sustained manner to check such fraudulent activities within their institutions. The Graphic Business is very oblivious to the competition within the sector and what players are doing to win more customers to stay afloat within the environment. However, it is equally crucial to note that the measures needed to fully secure the deposits of their customers are paramount. It will be unacceptable in our opinion, for any player within the sector to assume that they will take up the cost when such incidents arise. Our strong point is premised on the fact that the more the cost emanating from fraudulent practices within the financial sector rises, the more the institutions find ways to pass on the cost to their customers in a subtle way. There are countless instances where financial institutions develop lame excuses to raise their charges abysmally at the expense of their customers and this is why we believe that such fraudulent acts within their systems, which gives them reasons to do so, must be checked at all costs to save the customer. Going through the report, we find that the BoG has introduced new directives that these financial institutions must follow as a way to check the practice. The Graphic Business expects that the financial sector players will strictly adhere to the directives no matter the extent to which it might create some discomfort or inconvenience for their customers. To us, there is a need for financial institutions to start a campaign to educate their customers and the public regarding the directives and the reasons adduced so that their customers will bear with them when they execute the directives. We need a sound, flexible and potent financial sector. Its relevance to the building of our economy should also not be lost on us at any point through complacency or otherwise because without a strong financial sector, there will not be a strong economy.

SHARE President of the Association of Corporate Affairs Managers of Banks in Nigeria (ACAMB), Rasheed Bolarinwa is advocating for a stronger working relationship between the Nigerian Data Protection Commission (NDPC) and players in Nigeria’s banking and financial sector. During a working visit to the NDPC headquarters in Abuja on Monday, Bolarinwa met with Dr. Vincent Olatunji, the National Commissioner/CEO of NDPC, to discuss aligning efforts on regulatory oversight and data protection compliance. Bolarinwa emphasised the importance of minimizing regulatory risks by fostering a clear understanding of the NDPC’s mandate within the financial sector. He stressed that reducing data protection infractions and ensuring compliance, can only be achieved through stronger communication and advocacy efforts. As both the ACAMB President and Chairman of NIPR’s Finance Hub Management Committee, Bolarinwa urged the Data Protection Commission to enhance awareness campaigns about its operations, pledging ACAMB’s full support in this endeavor. He highlighted ACAMB’s commitment to helping financial service providers better understand the Commission’s objectives, thereby ensuring compliance with data protection laws. He added, “As social engineers responsible for managing perception and corporate reputation, we cannot afford to have our brands breach the Data Protection Act. Such violations, according to him has could damage corporate trust and harm the business’s long-term sustainability.” In response, Olatunji assured ACAMB of the NDPC’s willingness to collaborate with financial sector players, clarifying that the Commission’s role is not punitive but rather to ensure full compliance with the Data Protection Act. He welcomed ACAMB and NIPR Finance Hub’s offer to support the Commission’s advocacy efforts. NDPC top brass who joined the CEO to host the ACAMB were; Babatunde Bamigboye Esq. Head Legal Enforcement and Regulations Dept; Mrs. Fitto Watirayhel Danladi; Head People Management & Administrator and Olayinka Oyebanji, Technical Advisor to the National Commissioner/CEO. The NDPC’s mandate is to safeguard individuals’ data privacy rights, foster safe personal data transactions, and prevent the misuse of personal data, among other objectives.

57% of Americans Trust Financial Institutions to Protect Their Data By PYMNTS | September 12, 2024 | Open banking , which allows third-party providers to access banking data through secure application programming interfaces (APIs), has gained momentum globally as a means to enhance financial services .

Δ But a PYMNTS Intelligence report, “ Can Open Banking Win Trust to Drive Real-Time Payments? ,” created in conjunction with The Clearing House , shows how data security and privacy remain obstacles before open banking can realize its potential in the American financial landscape. U.S. Regulators Push Forward on Open Banking Although 46% of U.S. adults are interested in open banking, adoption lags at a mere 11%. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed a new rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act that aims to expand open banking in the U.S. This regulation would require financial institutions to share consumer data with authorized third parties while implementing enhanced privacy and security measures. Although the proposal is a significant step toward broader adoption of open banking, it has faced criticism from industry groups like The Clearing House Association and the Bank Policy Institute , which argue that it does not sufficiently protect consumer data. Their concerns focus on practices such as credential-based access and screen scraping, which they believe could jeopardize data security. Consumer and Business Skepticism Hampers Adoption U.S. and U.K. stakeholders remain skeptical about open banking due to concerns about data security. In the U.K., where open banking has been operational since 2018, 84% of consumers distrust its safety and 72% believe it benefits third-party providers more than consumers. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Additionally, businesses cite cybersecurity concerns as a barrier despite recognizing open banking’s potential benefits. In the U.S., while 60% of Americans view open banking favorably, significant concerns persist about data storage and collection practices. Only 57% of Americans trust financial institutions to protect their personal information, underscoring the need for improved trust and transparency. Open Banking’s Potential to Revolutionize Real-Time Payments Despite these challenges, open banking has the potential to transform the payments industry by facilitating real-time payments. Open banking could enhance the efficiency of account-to-account (A2A) transactions, offering a cost-effective alternative to credit card payments by reducing fees and fraud. According to the report, proponents estimate A2A payments could reach $200 billion in consumer-to-business transactions in North America by 2026. The U.K. government is also encouraging the use of open banking to improve real-time payment systems and reduce transaction times. For open banking to revolutionize real-time payments, it must address ongoing concerns about data security and privacy. Effective regulation and collaboration between public and private sectors are crucial in ensuring that the final rules safeguard consumer information while promoting innovation. By addressing industry concerns and creating a secure environment for data sharing, open banking can achieve its full potential, driving forward the adoption of real-time payments and expanding financial inclusion across various demographics.

Go to Body all > Business Excess household, corporate debt is inhibiting Korea’s economic growth, BIS report says Posted on : 2024-09-12 17:56 KST Modified on : 2024-09-12 17:56 KST Facebook 페이스북 Twitter 트위터 The report explained that while increased investment based on borrowing helps increase growth in the short term, an increase in liabilities can detract from future growth potential (Getty Images Bank) South Korea’s level of household and corporate debt has reached a level with the potential to inhibit economic growth, an international organization concluded. The warning message was that South Korea has passed the era when debt once promoted growth and has arrived in one where the benefits are outweighed by even greater negative impacts. An examination Wednesday of a recently published report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that in most emerging economies, credit to the non-financial sector has dramatically increased amid a long-term trend of low interest rates since the 2000s. “Credit to the non-financial sector” conventionally refers to liabilities associated with households and companies but excluding financial institutions. Since 2000, the ratio between credit to the non-financial sector and gross domestic product (GDP) has risen by an average of over 1.3 times among emerging economies in Asia. China’s ratio nearly doubled over the same period. In some respects, increased credit to the non-financial private sector contributes to growth through greater access to funds and investment in real assets and education. Beyond a certain point, however, its net effects become negative, the report observed. From BIS Bulletin No. 91 “Credit and resource allocation in EMEs: taking stock of two decades of falling interest rates.” An examination of the correlation between amount of debt and growth rates shows a proportional relationship early on — but at a certain point, a peak is reached, and the relationship becomes inversely proportional, creating an “inverted U-shaped” curve. The report explained that while increased consumption and investment based on borrowing help increase the growth rate in the short term, an increase in the amount of liabilities translates into a growing principal and interest repayment burden that detracts from future growth potential. It also noted that while most emerging economies are still in the space where increased credit to the non-financial sector stokes growth, Asian countries in particular have reached an inflection point where it has begun inhibiting growth. The report listed the economies of Korea and China in recent years as its primary examples. For both countries, right around when the ratio of credit to the non-financial sector to GDP hit the 100% mark is when their economic growth peaked and started to fall. A look at Bank of Korea figures shows that as of the end of last year, Korea’s ratio of credit to the non-financial private sector to GDP was 222.7% (BIS standard). The ratio fluctuated around the 100% mark in the 1980s (jumping to 160% in the direct aftermath of the Asian financial crisis) before surpassing 150% in the second quarter of 2007 and 200% in the first quarter of 2020. The BIS also pointed out that as growing household credit typically leads to increased demand for housing, it can “weigh on growth” because productivity gains are low in the construction and real estate sectors. The larger the increase in the share of construction and real estate loans, the greater the plunge in labor and total factor productivity growth for a country. “The shift might reflect — to some extent — overinvestment in construction and services, which could have adverse and persistent effects on aggregate labour productivity and income growth long after the credit impulse towards housing subsides,” the report noted. In its conclusion, the report noted that the inverted U-shape between credit and growth is “not set in stone” and can be mitigated with policy initiatives. Namely, it listed increasing the role of equity markets and dampening unbalanced credit growth, as well as increasing productive firms’ access to credit.

Title: Berkshire Hathaway Holds Bank of America , American Express , Visa , and Mastercard Stock , but So Does This Low - Cost Vanguard ETF

Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A +0.17% ) ( BRK.B +0.03% ) achieved a new milestone in August, surpassing $1 trillion in market cap for the first time. Although Berkshire is known for its public equity investments in companies like Apple and Coca-Cola , the value of the rest of the business is actually much higher. In fact, Berkshire's holdings in public companies are worth about $320 billion compared to the $1.026 trillion market cap for Berkshire as a whole. Berkshire has a treasure trove of property and casualty insurance segments, ownership of BNSF Railway, 92% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses, and more. It also has a combined $79.41 billion invested in Bank of America ( BAC +0.39% ) , American Express ( AXP +0.62% ) , Visa ( V +1.14% ) , and Mastercard ( MA +0.97% ) . While you could buy Berkshire Hathaway stock to get exposure to these top companies and Berkshire's private holdings, a simpler and perhaps more effective way of investing in the financial sector is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Financials ETF ( VFH +0.45% ) . In fact, Berkshire Hathaway stock is the fund's second-largest holding with an 8.1% weighting. Here's why financials are one of the market's most diversified and value-orientated sectors and why the Vanguard Financials ETF could be worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. Getting to know the financial sector The financial sector is the second most valuable sector behind technology -- making up 13.3% of the S&P 500 . It includes a diverse array of industries, from big banks to regional banks, investment banking, insurance providers, payment processors, financial exchanges, and more. Although the financial sector generally benefits from economic growth, not every part of it reacts to economic factors in the same way. For example, banks can benefit from higher interest rates by collecting more interest income from consumers. But credit card companies make money by the number of transactions and the average amount of each transaction. So, they would prefer lower interest rates and higher spending rates. Similarly, investment banks and venture capital firms may prefer lower capital costs to spur merger and acquisition activity. However, an insurance company depends more on regulations than economic conditions. Stodgy low-growth pockets of the financial sector tend to have dirt cheap valuations and pay rising dividends. In contrast, faster-growing companies may pay small dividends (or none at all) and focus more on reinvesting in the business. Diversification is especially important in the financial sector. For example, several regional banks failed in early 2023. Having diversification across the industry and not just one niche can help protect against a crisis. But too much investment in banks or insurance companies would have led investors to miss out on the boom in credit card companies. One of Berkshire's best long-term winners has been American Express -- which is now its second most valuable position behind only Apple. The combined market cap of American Express, Visa, and Mastercard nearly matches the combined value of the three largest U.S. banks by market cap -- JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America, and Wells Fargo -- illustrating the importance of payment processors to the financial sector. A balanced sector with plenty of opportunities The Vanguard Financials ETF is a simple, low-cost way to unlock diversification and invest in a blend of growth, income, and value stocks. The ETF has a mere 0.1% expense ratio, or just $.10 per $100 invested. And with a minimum investment amount of just $1, it's easy to dip your toes in the ETF without allocating a large chunk of your portfolio. Thanks to the inexpensive valuations of so many large financial companies, the ETF has a 16.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and a yield of 1.8% -- which is especially impressive considering the fund is up 20% year to date. The following table shows that the fund's top 10 holdings include a variety of leading companies from different segments of the financial industry. Company Weighting in the Vanguard Financials ETF JPMorgan Chase 8.6% Berkshire Hathaway 8.1% Mastercard 5.5% Visa 4.1% Bank of America 4.1% Wells Fargo 3% Goldman Sachs 2.3% S&P Global 2.2% American Express 2.1% BlackRock 1.8% Data source: Vanguard. Combined, the top 10 holdings make up 42% of the fund, which represents balance and diversification. Let the Vanguard Financial Sector ETF work for you The Vanguard Financial Sector ETF is a low-cost way to invest in Berkshire Hathaway and other top financial stocks. It's a useful tool for getting baseline exposure to various companies. Some investors may look to pair the ETF with individual stock holdings if they want extra exposure to particular companies. For example, if you're extra confident in the growth potential of payment processors, then you may want to consider buying Visa, Mastercard, and American Express to increase your exposure beyond what the ETF provides. The Vanguard Financial Sector ETF is worth a closer look for investors who want to put new capital into the market without chasing high-flying companies with sky-high valuations.

Title: South Africa GDP growth is an  illusion  benefiting the few

News / National South Africa GDP growth is an 'illusion' benefiting the few by Staff reporter 05 Sep 2024 at 09:17hrs | 187 Views The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have dismissed the recent GDP growth figures released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) as "misleading", accusing the government and financial institutions of creating a false narrative of economic recovery while key sectors continue to struggle. Stats SA's report indicates that South Africa's economy has grown by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2024, but the EFF argues that this growth has not translated into job creation or real improvements for the majority of South Africans. In a statement released on Tuesday, the EFF said, "This so-called growth is an entrenchment of market-oriented and financial sector-centred policies that have benefited only a small portion of society, primarily banks. The people of South Africa should never be hoodwinked into celebrating what must correctly be seen as jobless growth." According to the party, the finance sector contributed 0.3 percentage points to the growth, while labour-intensive sectors like agriculture, forestry, and mining all declined. The EFF emphasized that unemployment has risen, citing the latest figures showing a 0.6% increase, amounting to 158,000 more people without jobs. The party further pointed out that unemployment in the agricultural sector alone rose by 45,000 people during this period, undermining any claims of economic progress. "The reality is that this growth benefits the capitalist establishment through the financial sector, and is the intended agenda of this very government, which is established by private sector interests to deliver narrow profit maximization for the few at the expense of the majority of South Africans," the EFF said. The party also highlighted the impact of high interest rates on South Africans, noting that many households are struggling to repay their debts and are at risk of losing their homes and vehicles. "The financial sector has grown on the back of the suffering of South Africans who are repaying high amounts on their homes, vehicles, and debts, and in many instances, losing these assets to the financial sector because they can no longer afford them," the statement added. In response to these challenges, the EFF has called on the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to reduce the repo rate by 150 basis points in an effort to ease the cost of living for South Africans. They argue that the current economic policy framework only serves to enrich the few at the expense of the many, and have warned that continuing down this path will lead to further social unrest and economic inequality. "The people of South Africa should not be misled by a narrative of economic growth, while they remain unemployed and gripped by poverty. This growth has not benefited the masses, and those claiming easy victories ought to be careful, as they will be held responsible for the increased unemployment rate, crime rate, and rising cases of sexual assaults and rape," the EFF cautioned.

Title:   Resetting  the economy : NDC 2024 agenda for structural reforms and sustainable growth

Article Content:
Audio By Carbonatix 'Resetting' an economy usually involves substantial changes or reforms aimed at correcting structural weaknesses, boosting efficiency, and promoting sustainable growth. These measures can vary depending on a country's specific circumstances, but generally include the following: Restoring macroeconomic stability: Addressing issues such as high inflation, persistent fiscal deficits, excessive debt levels, restructuring SOEs, and reducing risks to the fiscal, etc. This might also require monetary and exchange rate policy reforms, fiscal austerity measures, or debt restructuring. Deep structural reforms: Modifying the fundamental frameworks of the economy to enhance productivity and competitiveness. This could involve further deregulation, labour market reforms, and changes to trade policies, etc. Institutional reforms: Improving the effectiveness of institutions that support economic activity, such as the legal system, regulatory bodies, and financial institutions. This could include tackling corruption, improving governance, and strengthening property rights. Financial sector reforms: Addressing issues within the banking and financial sector to restore stability and ensure efficient capital allocation. Specifically, this might involve recapitalizing banks, enhancing regulatory frameworks, resolving non-performing loans, and promoting local ownership in Ghana’s financial sector, etc. Social and human capital development: Investing in education, healthcare, and social protection systems to reduce poverty and inequality, promote healthcare and education and ensure long-term sustainable growth. Innovation and technology: Promoting innovation, advancing technology adoption, and fostering digital transformation to create new growth opportunities. Hence, the term "reset" implies a comprehensive and fundamental overhaul rather than incremental adjustments (or “upgrading,”). Such resets typically occur in response to a crisis or prolonged stagnation, similar to what Ghana is currently experiencing. Historical examples include the structural adjustments in Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s, transformations in Eastern Europe post-communism, and efforts to address economic turmoil in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008. The specific details on the NDC’s comprehensive reset agenda for a better Ghana, are all contained in their 2024 Manifesto for reference. **The writer is a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) DISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.

Anantha Nageswaran. File. | Photo Credit: PTI Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India V. Anantha Nageswaran on Monday (September 2, 2024) said that since the consequences of what happens in the financial sector reverberate throughout, therefore it carries a significant weight of responsibility on its shoulders Mr. Nageswaran, while speaking at the CII Financing 3.0 Summit in Mumbai said that the big difference between the financial sector and other sectors is that the consequences of what happens in this [financial] sector reverberate throughout the economy and beyond. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Financing Summit 3.0 is aimed at addressing key issues and come out with relevant recommendations to provide an impetus to financial sector’s role in supporting India’s growth. Mr. Nageswaran also emphasised on 3Cs -Collaboration, Challenges, and Confidence that has significantly shaped Indian economy’s progress. India has one of the brightest global economic growth prospects, he said, cautioning that the country needs to avoid ‘financialization’ as it marches towards the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047. India’s stock market capitalization is around 140% of the GDP, he said, adding, the record profitability of the Indian financial sector and high levels of market capitalization, or the ratio of market capitalization to GDP, give rise to another phenomenon which deserves closer examination. “When the market becomes bigger than the economy, it is natural, but not necessarily reasonable, that the considerations and priorities of the market dominate the public discourse and also influence the policy discourse. I am referring to the phenomenon called financialization, or the financial market’s dominance of policy and macroeconomic outcomes,” he said. Financialization is the dominance of financial market expectations trends, and importantly, interest in public policy and macroeconomic outcomes, he said at CII Financing 3.0 Summit here while making a disclaimer that these are his personal views and not as CEA. As India looks ahead to 2047 with optimism and hope, he said, this is something it has to avoid, because the consequences of such financialization is there for all to see in the developed world. “Unprecedented levels of public and private sector debt, some visible to regulators and some not, economic growth dependent on continued increase in asset prices to offset the leverage that have built up and hence a massive surge in inequality. India must be wary of these outcomes and avoid this trap,” he said. Developed countries are encountering these challenges after they have become materially prosperous, he said, adding per capita, India is just stepping into the lower middle income category. “Therefore, as we deliberate on preparing our financial system to support our economic aspirations, India can ill afford the financialization and its ramifications that afflict advanced societies. In other words, we cannot afford to let the tail wag the dog,” he said. Observing that retaining policy autonomy and space to insulate the economy from the vagaries of global capital flows is critical, Nageswaran said India relies on global capital flows despite modest current account deficit. “India has one of the brightest global economic growth prospects. It is up to us to sustain it, and it is also up to us to use that to our advantage in carving out policy space for ourselves,” he said. In short, he said, the country has to find a fine balance between national imperatives and investor interest or preferences. Of course, he said, “it also means becoming a global agenda setter, rather than an agenda taker. That will be a good thing. While some actions can be initiated now, such as, for example, an Indian entity making the effort to become a global credit rating agency, the outcome and the impact will take much longer to materialize.” “Economic size and economic clout will influence our ability to become a global agenda setter, and that, in turn, will favourably impact our economic performance. We have to work on both, therefore simultaneously, but agenda setting aspirations cannot run ahead of acquiring economic strength, size, heft and vitality,” he said.

This development, Finance Minister Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam said – during the August 2024 Monthly Press Briefing on the Economy, marks a crucial step for government’s efforts to restore confidence in the financial sector. The funds, part of a larger relief package approved by the Cabinet, are aimed at providing relief to thousands of investors whose funds have been locked up in defunct fund management companies since the financial sector clean-up began in 2017. This move comes at a critical time, as government faces mounting pressure to resolve lingering effects of the financial sector reforms. “This intervention is being done despite the tight fiscal space, evidence of government’s commitment to provide relief for investors in the defunct AMCs – especially the pensioners,” Dr. Adam stated during the briefing. He added that the emphasis on pensioners is an acknowledgement of the financial sector clean-up’s social impact on a vulnerable segment of the economy. According to the Finance Minister, the GH¢1.5billion package will be released in three tranches – with the first GH¢700million already processed for release through the Controller and Accountant-General. This initial disbursement is expected to significantly increase the number of fully settled investors under the bailout scheme. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will oversee distribution of funds with a particular focus on Blackshield Fund Management Ltd. – one of the largest affected AMCs. The bailout is projected to fully settle 82,096 Blackshield investors, representing 92 percent of its claimants, and 12,069 investors from other fund management companies, accounting for 78 percent of their claimants. In total, government expects this latest intervention to bring the number of fully settled investors to 94,165 – representing 90 percent of the total 105,178 validated claims. An analyst with a fund management firm, who wished to remain anonymous due to his position in the market, said: “While this bailout is a positive step, it’s important to note that it comes nearly seven years after the initial financial sector reforms. The delay has caused considerable hardship for many investors, particularly retirees who relied on these funds for their daily sustenance”. The announcement has been met with cautious optimism in financial circles. Market watchers are keen to see how quickly the funds will reach affected investors and what impact this will have on overall market confidence. Analysts say as the country continues to navigate its economic challenges, including high inflation and the ongoing IMF programme, government’s ability to fulfil its financial commitments will be closely scrutinised. They added that successfully implementing this bailout could play a crucial role in restoring trust in the financial system and attracting both domestic and foreign investments. “As of date, several bank depositors (savings and loans, microfinance and discount houses) whose claims were certified by the receiver in 2019 and 2020 have yet to be reimbursed. Are they among the GH¢700million…if not, when? “What has changed since Blackshield customers were first excluded from payments made to fund management companies? And are those fund management customers who received only 25% of their locked-up funds going to receive the rest of their monies? In all these, what are the timelines for government to bring these processes to an end?” quizzed Korsi Dzokoto, an analyst. Mr. Dzokoto also pointed out inconsistencies in government’s communication regarding the bailout programme, saying: “How much does government’s clean-up of the banking system cost? We have heard amounts ranging from GH¢21billion to GH¢25billion. “In the main budget, government announced GH¢4billion to pay-off locked funds in the banking and fund management sectors, including GH¢2.3billion for NIB recapitalisation. In its mid-year budget, government mentioned GH¢1.5billion.” The MoF has however maintained that the bailout package’s remaining tranches will be released in due course, with the timeline to be communicated in subsequent briefings.

Home Business Adopt more supportive, empathetic approach towards MSMEs, lenders told Friday, 23 August 2024 | PTI | Mumbai Share T T T T 0 Adopt more supportive, empathetic approach towards MSMEs, lenders told Friday, 23 August 2024 | PTI | Mumbai Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Swaminathan J has asked financial institutions to adopt a more sensitive and empathetic approach towards MSMEs, and deploy supportive measures like restructuring options for loans, to support the sector which plays a key role in the economy. In a speech at the Annual Day of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) here, the deputy governor said MSMEs face challenges like access to affordable finance, delayed payments, infrastructure bottlenecks, and requirements of compliance, among others. The journey of Indiaâ€™s economic transformation cannot be complete without the robust development of the MSME sector. â€œMSMEs are not just the backbone of our economy, they are the engines of growth, innovation, and employment,â€ he said at the event held on Wednesday. However, for these enterprises to truly thrive and scale up, the financial sector must step up with innovative solutions, sensitivity, and a forward-looking approach, Swaminathan said. â€œThis is not just about providing credit; itâ€™s about enabling these enterprises compete globally, drive exports, and contribute to the nationâ€™s goal of becoming a developed economy by 2047. While financial instruments and support mechanisms are crucial, the way we engage with the MSME sector, our sensitivity to their challenges and our commitment to their success, will ultimately determine the strength and sustainability of this partnership,â€ he said. The deputy governor also emphasised that considering the key role that MSMEs play in the economy, the financial sector should adopt a more sensitive and empathetic approach towards them. â€œWhile financial discipline is crucial, the unique challenges faced by MSMEs, such as low capital base, lack of scale, cash flow constraints from delayed payments, fluctuating market conditions, and external economic pressures, necessitate a more nuanced approach to assessment as well as follow-up,â€ he said. While timely repayment of dues is crucial to maintain the health of the financial system, financial institutions should focus on deploying supportive measures such as restructuring options, grace periods, and tailored repayment plans that give MSMEs the breathing space they need to recover and get back on track while encountering difficult situations, the senior official said at the event attended by representatives of financial sector, among others.

Wednesday, November 12, 2025 Advertise with us News SEARCH NEWS NEWS HOME » BUSINESS Financial sector should enhance digitisation in credit delivery to help MSMEs: RBI Deputy Governor Share Tweet COMMENT Mumbai (Maharashtra) | August 22, 2024 2:41:42 PM IST Speaking at the Annual Day of the Foreign Exchange Dealers on Thursday Swaminathan J, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that the financial sector should leverage digitisation in credit delivery to help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The Deputy Governor highlighted the adoption of digital payment systems by MSMEs as an opportunity, adding that the bankers should explore these opportunities. Underscoring the significance of the financial sector in enhancing the export of the MSMEs, the Deputy Governor asked for tailored and focused services for MSMEs. He stated that the financial sector can significantly provide aid to the MSMEs by offering services such as pre-and post-shipment finance, factoring, and invoice discounting. "The financial sector can play a crucial role in boosting MSME exports by offering targeted support and tailored services that address the unique challenges these businesses face in the global market," he said. "We have seen significant traction towards end-to-end digitalisation of credit delivery in the past few years, largely in Retail and to some extent in the MSME sector. I would urge bankers to explore these opportunities further for greater digitalisation of their transactions with MSMEs," the RBI Deputy Governor added. He further stated that financial institutions can expedite approval times and significantly lower the costs of availing credit by using digital tools for application processing, verification, and disbursement. Pointing out the data footprint generated from these transactions, he said that a better risk assessment system can be developed. "Extending finance after a proper understanding of the cash flows of MSMEs, including factoring in the possible delayed payments from their buyers, will ensure a proper reading of the actual working capital cycle and ensure adequate financing," he said. "Many small business owners lack the knowledge and skills to effectively manage their finances, which can hinder their growth. The sector can significantly aid MSMEs in managing risks through export credit insurance and currency risk hedging solutions," the Deputy Governor said. "While financial discipline is crucial, the unique challenges faced by MSMEs--such as low capital base, lack of scale, cash flow constraints from delayed payments, fluctuating market conditions, and external economic pressures--necessitate a more nuanced approach to assessment as well as follow up," he added pointing out at the need to adopt a more sensitive and sympathetic approach towards the MSMEs. Going further, the Deputy Governor emphasised the need to spread awareness and enhance financial literacy among MSMEs.

Jaipur, Aug 14 : RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan Janakiraman at a global conference here on Wednesday highlighted that while the "evolving technological landscape" in the financial sector presents huge opportunities it also shows significant challenges that have to be taken care of. Jaipur, Aug 14 (IANS) RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan Janakiraman at a global conference here on Wednesday highlighted that while the "evolving technological landscape" in the financial sector presents huge opportunities it also shows significant challenges that have to be taken care of. He highlighted four risks against which financial institutions needed to step up their vigil. These include cyberattacks, the quick outflow of funds due to digital payments, third-party risks and the risk from fintech companies that operate outside the regulatory system. "In an era where digital transformation is reshaping every facet of banking and finance, the integration of advanced technologies into the financial sector, brings both unparalleled opportunities and significant risks," Swaminathan said. "The evolving technological landscape presents both significant challenges and opportunities for deposit insurers. By adopting a proactive, risk-based approach -- including enhanced oversight, risk-based premiums, reliance on supervisory ratings, faster claim settlements, and industry collaboration -- deposit insurers can effectively manage these risks," he observed. In his address on the second day of the global conference of the International Association of Deposit Insurers - Asia Pacific Regional Committee (IADI-APRC), Swaminathan pointed out that by assuring depositors that their funds up to the coverage limit are protected, deposit insurance fosters confidence and stability within the banking sector. Deposit insurance stands as a key pillar of the financial safety-net system, playing a crucial role in maintaining financial stability. Deposit insurance also helps prevent bank runs that could escalate into broader financial crises, he added. The financial sector is a prime target of frequent cyberattacks due to the vast amounts of sensitive data and capital it handles. Significant cyber incidents can cause micro-prudential risks for individual financial institutions, namely solvency, liquidity, market, operational and reputational risks. "Therefore, protecting critical infrastructure from breaches is of paramount importance, and it requires not only advanced technical defences but also a robust culture of cybersecurity awareness across all levels of the organisation. Financial institutions therefore need to have robust business continuity preparedness by testing their systems periodically encompassing possible adverse combinations," he said. He said that today a significant portion of banking transactions and services are conducted through digital channels. The expansion and widespread adoption of digital payment systems has enabled rapid, low-cost transactions and easy withdrawals via online banking and mobile apps. However, this shift increases the risk to operational stability and resilience, necessitating ongoing investments in IT systems and technology to manage peak loads effectively. Additionally, the 24/7 availability of online and mobile banking can heighten vulnerabilities, potentially accelerating bank runs and liquidity crises during periods of stress, as customers may withdraw funds even outside of traditional banking hours and without having to visit a Bank branch, the RBI Deputy Governor explained. He also highlighted the risks of the increasing dependence on third parties. The digital transformation in banking has also led to a multitude of distinct third-party entities getting involved in the provision of a single product or service, creating a complex web of technical and operational dependencies. However, the impact of failure in any link in this chain can often be catastrophic as was seen in a global IT services outage incident last month. Further, third parties could be points of intrusion for ransomware and other cyber threats. The rise of fintech companies and the entry of entities that operate outside the traditional regulatory and supervisory framework introduce new dimensions of risk to the financial sector. While fintech innovations have greatly enhanced financial inclusion, efficiency, and customer experience, they also present challenges related to data security, consumer protection, and regulatory compliance, Swaminathan added.

Speaking as part of a high-level panel at the 13th Ghana Economic Forum (GEF) organised by the B&FT, under theme ‘Re-engineering Ghana’s Economic Model for Sustainable Development: A Robust Financial Sector, Political Leadership & National Development Plan is Key’, they insisted there must be a well-defined picture of the collective future aspired to by all Ghanaians. “A development plan should do a couple of things. First and foremost, locate where we are now, ask additional questions and then cast a vision for the future,” a former Commissioner at the National Planning Development Commission (NDPC) Dr. Eben Armah said. He noted the previous 40-year development plan, launched in 2017, was not effectively implemented due to a lack of political commitment and stakeholder alignment. Dr. Armah stressed the importance of broad-based engagement to ensure the new plan – Vision 2057, which he said would span 25 years, eight election cycles and coincide with Ghana’s 100th year of independence – has full ownership and continuity regardless of changes in political leadership. “Once we’re set in stone that there is agreement, it becomes a plan. Nobody can change it,” he said, underscoring the need for all stakeholders within the political economy and the Executive to be on board with the development strategy. Addressing the financial sector’s role, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) Abena Amoah highlighted the capital markets as a crucial tool for national economic transformation. “The capital markets are such an important tool for national economic development and transformation… Foreign capital is good but we need to have a framework that better mobilises domestic capital,” she said. Ms. Amoah elaborated on the need to mobilise domestic savings, saying they would be channelled into investments, infrastructure and business development. She also underscored the importance of policy support and a conducive macroeconomic environment for growth of the capital markets. Sharing Ghana Statistical Service data – which showed that the country’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 2013 constant prices grew from GH¢29.81billion in 2013 to GH¢50.64billion in 2023, a modest 10-year increase of around 70 percent – she noted that the capital market is a reflection of the broader economy. “High interest rates and a depreciating currency affects all of us. We cannot live sustainably,” the GSE MD added, highlighting the need for policymakers to address macroeconomic challenges impacting the financial sector and broader economy. The GSE’s market capitalisation has reached record highs over the past 14 months and currently sits at around GH¢92billion, yet market observers have decried the impact of inflation and currency depreciation on the stock market’s real growth. A concern raised by a financial advisory consultant, Richmond K. Frimpong, was a seeming lack of coordination among the regulators’ various components of the financial sector – including banking, insurance, pensions and asset management. He argued that a more integrated approach, potentially through the creation of a “national financial services authority”, could help channel domestic savings more effectively into productive investments. “Instead of just having a regulator that looks at one arm depending on their own strength and leadership, we need to have a superstructure that’s able to look at where domestic savings is sitting in that ecosystem and channel policy – then bring it to the centre in driving financial literacy,” said a financial sector expert. The Financial Stability Council was established in 2018 in the wake of the sector clean-up to “identify and evaluate the threats, vulnerabilities and risks to the financial sector’s stability”, but has come under criticism for other developments in the financial sector since its establishment. The council is chaired by the Bank of Ghana Governor and its members are a Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana; a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance; and the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Others are the National Insurance Commission (NIC) Commissioner, the Chief Executive Officer-National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) as well as the CEO-Ghana Deposit Protection Corporation (GDPC). Mr. Frimpong also highlighted a need to address the financial literacy gap among Ghanaians, with the panelist estimating that only about 20 percent of the population has a clear understanding of different available financial products and services. “Until now, they have seen the backdrop of challenges we’ve had during the last few months and years in our financial health system, where the work that’s gone on over the years bringing people to appreciate why financial independence and cooperation is critical – and why it is required for somebody to put some funds somewhere for a rainy day,” he said. On his part, Kwame Jantuah – Chairman-Oil and Gas sector, Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) – stressed the critical role of political leadership in driving the economic transformation agenda and ensuring continuity for the national development plan across election cycles. He stated that economic challenges currently facing the country, while significant, are not insurmountable. Mr. Jantuah advocated for a more strategic and concentrated approach to national development. He underscored the necessity for a collective consensus on prioritising the nation’s most pressing issues, urging that all stakeholders come together to identify and tackle these priorities in a systematic and collaborative manner. “Our economic problems, though formidable, are not beyond our ability to resolve. It is imperative that we adopt a focused approach to our development, whereby we reach a consensus on what truly matters most. Once we agree on these priorities, every stakeholder must commit to addressing them with unwavering dedication and unity of purpose,” he said. The Dean-PSA Law School, Professor Ernest Kofi Abotsi, doubled down on calls for the adoption of a “long-term, bipartisan economic plan based on the constitution”. He argued that this approach will help address the country’s persistent economic challenges by preventing short-term, politically motivated policies which are often discarded with changes in government. Prof. Abotsi believes a shared economic blueprint will ensure policy consistency and stability without sacrificing social protection. “A sustainable economic future requires a delicate balance between growth and equity. By fostering a bipartisan economic blueprint, we can create a nation where prosperity is shared and social safety nets are strengthened,” he noted.

Ethiopia Opens Doors for Independent Forex Bureaus Amid Financial Reform Ethiopia begins licensing independent foreign exchange bureaus as part of its financial sector liberalization. The move follows the recent floatation of the birr currency and the approval of a $3.4 billion program from the IMF, aiming to transform the financial landscape and address economic challenges. Devdiscourse News Desk | Updated: 08-08-2024 21:48 IST | Created: 08-08-2024 21:48 IST AI Generated Representative Image SHARE Ethiopia has taken a crucial step in its financial sector liberalization by licensing independent foreign exchange bureaus, the central bank announced on Thursday. This initiative follows the recent floatation of the local birr currency, which was part of the government's broader economic reform program. Late last month, Africa's second-most populous nation secured a four-year, $3.4 billion program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), enabling long-awaited debt restructuring. The National Bank of Ethiopia's strategy aims to reshape and expand the financial sector significantly, according to central bank governor Mamo Mihretu. 'With the licensing of independent FX bureaus, we are making yet another important milestone in the opening up of Ethiopia's financial sector and aligning it with global norms and best practices,' Mihretu stated. Facing high inflation and chronic foreign currency shortages, Ethiopia defaulted on its debt at the end of last year, making it the third African economy to do so recently. The nation has been in talks with the IMF to establish a new lending program, following an abandoned 2019 agreement impacted by conflict in Tigray. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed defended the move to a market-determined exchange rate, emphasizing that it aimed to close the gap between official and black market rates. (With inputs from agencies.)

Erwin Haryono. - File photo JAKARTA: (Bernama-Antara) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has assessed that Indonesia's economic growth remains robust despite external turbulence, with inflation maintained at the target range and a resilient financial sector, reported Antara news agency. "Indonesia's prudent policy framework in both the monetary, fiscal, and financial sectors is assessed by the IMF as having created a solid foundation for macro stability and social welfare," said Head of the Communications Department of Bank Indonesia (BI) Erwin Haryono in Jakarta on Thursday (Aug 8). IMF's assessment of Indonesia's economy in the 2024 Article IV Consultation report was released yesterday (August 7). The IMF Board of Directors expressed appreciation and positive remarks regarding the policy measures taken by Indonesian authorities. This was noted in several key areas: Indonesia's commitment to fiscal discipline, inflation reduction within the established target range, data dependent monetary policy, market deepening efforts, and enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Other important points included strengthening the macroprudential policy framework, the growth agenda towards high-income status by 2045, and commitments to achieve zero emissions by 2060, including measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. In its report, the IMF projected that Indonesia's economic performance would remain high, at 5 per cent and 5.1 per cent in 2024 and 2025 respectively, amidst risks such as commodity price volatility, slowing growth in major trading partner countries, and spillovers from prolonged high interest rates in global finance. The IMF recommended maintaining fiscal prudence, appreciating Indonesia's monetary policy stance, continuing reforms to protect the resilience of the financial sector, supporting financial market deepening, and bridging structural gaps to achieve higher and more inclusive growth to support Indonesia's Vision 2045. The IMF's positive outlook aligns with Bank Indonesia's assessment, which anticipates continued strong growth and resilience of the Indonesian economy against global spillovers. Bank Indonesia will continue to strengthen policy coordination with the government to mitigate global uncertainty risks while maintaining independence in achieving its legislated goals. Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies will also be reinforced to maintain macroeconomic stability, financial sector stability, and economic growth momentum.- Bernama-Antara Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

App HOME NEWS INSTITUTIONS POLICIES ARCHIVE 中文 HOME NEWS INSTITUTIONS POLICIES ARCHIVE 中文 China to power modernization drive through financial sector reform: official Updated: August 2, 2024 21:20 Xinhua BEIJING, Aug. 2 -- China will make further efforts to deepen the reform of its financial sector, aiming to support the country's modernization endeavors, a Central Finance Commission official has said. Wang Jiang made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee's third plenary session outlined major tasks to deepen reform in the financial sector. China's financial sector still faces prominent problems such as financial risks, the relatively low quality and efficiency of financial services, corruption, and relatively weak financial supervision and governance capacities, said Wang, who also works with the Central Financial Work Commission. To implement the guiding principles of last month's CPC plenum, efforts should be made to improve the central bank system and the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and work should be done to build a modern financial institution, market, product and services system, he said. The capital market's functions related to balancing investment and financing should be improved, the reform of the financial regulatory system should be deepened, and the incentive and constraint mechanisms serving the real economy should be optimized, Wang noted. The official also called for the promotion of the financial sector's high-standard opening-up, and strengthening formulation of financial laws and regulations. He called for efforts to accelerate the construction of a modern financial system with Chinese characteristics, focus on preventing and defusing financial risks, strengthen financial regulation comprehensively, and continue increasing financial support for the real economy through reform. "We must strike an effective balance between all aspects of reform, coordinate efforts to prevent risks, strengthen regulation, promote development, and strive to achieve the best results," Wang said.

Mint Explainer Mint Explainer: How middle-level banking staff is paying the price for digitalization-led growth Nandita Venkatesan 3 min read 02 Aug 2024, 12:32 pm IST India has been at the forefront of the digitalization “revolution” through initiatives such as India Stack, UPI and consent-based data sharing. Summary The digitalization comes with its trade-offs. While it could contribute to higher growth, it's disrupting jobs landscape in the financial sector, shows the RBI's Currency and Finance report for 2023-24 Gift this article This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Subscribe now MUMBAI : In Currency and Finance report for 2023-24 , the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) points out that digitalization is disrupting the jobs landscape in the financial sector and driving out middle-level banking staff. This comes even as digitalization is expected to constitute a fifth of India's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2026, doubling from 10% at present. The central bank also flagged potential challenges related to digital upskilling and the required employee adaptability. Mint explores the pros and cons of digitisation as highlighted in the RBI's 29 July report. What will be the impact of digitalization on India’s economic growth? According to the RBI, India has been at the forefront of the digitalization “revolution" through initiatives such as India Stack, unified payments interface (UPI) and “consent-based data sharing". The banking system has also contributed to the digital push by enabling direct benefit transfers. The central bank estimates the impact of digitalization on India’s economic output as measured by gross value added (GVA), under four scenarios: 1) Business as usual. 2) Only increase in capital investments 3) Increase in capital as well as information and communication technologies’ (ICT) investments. 4) ICT and capital investments, combined with investments in human capital. Investments in digital tech infrastructure can help India achieve real GVA growth (growth stripped of inflation) of 8.2% by 2030, according to the report. This is versus the current growth of 7.2% as of 2023-24. However, the central bank contends that India can achieve “maximum growth" only when labour reforms are also undertaken. Labour reforms can push India’s growth above 9%. “The investment-led growth path may lose momentum unless supported by reforms that focus on productivity, human capital and higher labour force participation," the RBI stated. Also Read: Reform the UPI system: We need sustainable digital payments infrastructure How would digital push, though, affect the labour force in the financial sector? The central bank states that with most clerical jobs in the financial sector facing automation, the low- and middle-tier jobs are being displaced by technology. This calls for greater investments in upskilling. Employees in support roles have decreased in India’s financial sector while the number of professionals/technicians have risen, mirroring a global trend, the RBI says. The share of support staff (e.g. customer service representatives) in the banking sector has steadily fallen in the past decade from 50% to 26% in 2022-23. The proportion of bank officers to support staff stands at 74:26 as of 2022-23. Also Read: Eco survey flags impact of AI on workers, puts onus on pvt sector to create jobs What solutions has the RBI proposed? Financial institutions need to invest in digital upskilling of their staff, according to the report. “Digitalization may induce human resource challenges in the financial sector, necessitating strategic investments in upskilling and reskilling," governor Shaktikanta Das stated in his foreword to the report. The report also flagged some potential challenges in the skilling drive. These include adaptability of employees and management to imbibe new digital tools and high turnover rates in banks leading to loss of institutional knowledge once the employee exits the company. Also Read: RBI’s jobs data has economists baffled, spurs a quantity versus quality debate What is the situation world-wide? Over the past decade, the global digital economy has grown 2.5 times faster than the physical world economy, accounting for over 15% of global GDP (United Nations, 2023). A report by investment banking major Citigroup released in June this year shows that the banking sector will be the hardest hit, with automation threatening 54% of human jobs. This is followed by insurance (48%) and software sector (36%). By 2028, the "profit pool" for the global banking sector could increase 9%, or $170 billion from the adoption of AI, rising from just over $1.7 trillion to close to $2 trillion, the report states.

Money Fintech Americans Want ‘Open Banking’ But Don’t Know What That Means By Ron Shevlin , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Observations from the Fintech Snark Tank Follow Author Jul 31, 2024, 05:21pm EDT Oct 23, 2024, 12:19pm EDT Share Save Comment Laptop safe with gold bars isolated on white background 3D rendering getty OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANK More and more, whenever I see the term “open banking” being used, my eyes roll and I think “ok, let’s see how this over-used, under-defined term is being used this time.” Recent incidences: 1) An academic study titled “ Open data and API adoption of US Banks ” which equates the use of APIs with open banking, and 2) a Pymnts article titled “ 46% of US Consumers Say They’re Ready for Open Banking .” Does Open Banking Equal API Adoption? The authors of the academic study say the report focuses on “the implications of API and open banking adoption for traditional banks in the US.” The report found that “banks that adopt APIs tend to face lower competitive pressure, are less capital-intensive, and experience: 1) an increase in ROA and Tobin’s Q, and 2) a decrease in loan loss provisions.” The causal inference here—that adopting APIs leads to increased ROA and a decrease in loan loss provisions—is pretty shaky. Getting back to “open banking,” though, the report cites research that found that: “Open banking and bank data portability might result in unintended consequences for bank and fintech competition and borrower welfare. Allowing voluntary data porting by consumers can lead to possible unraveling (i.e., customers are compelled to share data as non-disclosure will be perceived negatively by providers) and negative data externality for customers who don’t share data. The loss of customer information due to fintech competition can disrupt information spillover within banks (e.g., by using payment data to learn about consumers’ credit quality).” MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR How To Buy Cryptocurrency Best Cryptocurrencies To Buy Now Best Cryptocurrency Exchange Proponents of open banking never seem to address these unintended consequences. Are Open Banking Payments Really Open Banking? When I saw that “46% of US consumers say they’re ready for open banking” my first reaction was “Really? What do these Americans think ‘open banking’ is?” It turns out that it’s not really “open banking” the article was talking about—it’s “open banking payments .” The article says: “Open banking payments stand on the verge of widespread acceptance. This payment method, which allows users to complete transactions directly from their bank accounts using familiar online banking credentials, offers an alternative to traditional methods by bypassing credit card details.” The article cites a study which found that younger consumers are more interested than older ones in “open banking payments” and that the “disparity suggests that open banking providers should focus their marketing efforts on younger demographics, who are more inclined to integrate this payment method into their routine transactions.” Three reactions here: 1) “Open banking payments” doesn’t sound like “API adoption” 2) Interest in “open bank payments” doesn’t mean interest in “open banking,” and 3) What are “routine” transactions? ‘Open Banking’ is a Meaningless Term The term “open banking” has become nearly meaningless. “Open banking providers” may want to redefine the space they playing in. The academic study claims that it provides “insight into the role of competitive pressures on the decision to adopt an open banking strategy.” Just one problem: There is no such thing as an “open banking strategy.” And proponents of open banking—whatever that might be—who believe that “consumers want it” should check a Q4 2023 Axway survey which found that only 55% of Americans have heard of open banking, and just 32% say they understand it. It’s a step too far to say Americans want—or are ready for—open banking. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions

Business Business Politically-motivated lending causing bad loans to spiral: WB Tue Jul 30, 2024 12:00 AM Last update on: Tue Jul 30, 2024 10:11 AM Rejaul Karim Byron , AM Jahid Tue Jul 30, 2024 12:00 AM Last update on: Tue Jul 30, 2024 10:11 AM The amount of bad loans has been spiralling in Bangladesh owing to rampant politically-motivated lending and inadequate credit risk management, according to a World Bank report. "Non-performing loans (NPLs) are rising, triggered by widespread related-party and politically directed lending on the back of weak credit risk management," it said. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The global lender prepared the report as a project information document for a $400 million loan project for Bangladesh, which is still under scrutiny. This project is designed to support financial stability and inclusion by enhancing financial sector infrastructure and safety net and fostering access to catalytic private sector finance in Bangladesh. The WB said NPLs had officially increased by 20.7 percent year-on-year at the end of December 2023 to 9 percent of the loan portfolio, but that was significantly understated due to lax NPL definition, poor accounting and disclosure standards and regulatory forbearance. Read more What’s really causing our non-performing loans to skyrocket? State-owned banks account for almost half of the NPLs, it added. "Growing NPLs and rising cost of funds lower banks' returns and ability to build additional capital buffers, while the requirement to distribute dividends even by loss-making banks further depletes banks' reserves and increases risks to depositors and creditors," it added. The WB said the four watchdogs who regulate the financial sector -- namely Bangladesh Bank, Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, and Microcredit Regulatory Authority -- lack operational independence, powers, skills, and the modern legislation necessary for sound financial sector development. Despite recent efforts supported by the World Bank and other international financial institutions, much of the financial sector regulatory framework still needs to be brought in line with international standards, it said. The banking sector's risks are also being triggered because of long-standing poor governance, weak market discipline, and low capital buffers, according to the report. "The reported aggregate banking sector capital adequacy ratio (CAR) – 11.64 percent in December 2023 – is too low given the high level of risks in the banking sector. At least 16 banks are undercapitalised, with special BB waivers for deferred loan loss provisions (LLP) and capital increases." Besides, the existing framework for intervening in ailing financial institutions is weak, with authorities relying on mergers and capitalisation using state money to deal with failing banks, it said. In December 2023, the central bank adopted a new Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, supported by the WB, but it will not be fully in force until April 1, 2025, it said. As a way forward, the World Bank said broad-based financial sector reforms are crucial for mobilising the private capital necessary to drive further growth. "This in return requires the authorities to address in a timely and orderly manner the persistent financial sector vulnerabilities which distort credit flows and, if left unattended, may lead to large losses to the budget and the people's savings." The WB also said the financial sector safety net and crisis preparedness framework need to be strengthened in the face of rising stability risks. The deposit insurance system (DIS) for banks and non-bank deposit-taking institutions, while established under BB two decades ago, is not fully operational and does not comply with international standards, according to the report. It said deposit insurance coverage is low and the payout mechanism is undeveloped and was never tested. While BB revoked the licences of several banks in the past, it did not trigger insured deposits despite a large accumulated DIS fund of nearly $ 1.2 billion as of the end 2023. "The crisis response framework remains fragmented, non-transparent, and underdeveloped, including access to lender of last resort, least cost resolution and liquidation tools, use of government funds to bail out domestic systemically important banks, mandate and operations of financial stability committee, and crisis communications framework." Upgrading the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the central bank is also required to safeguard market confidence and foster sustainable financial intermediation, it said. The global lender added that while the banking sector has shown rapid growth in loans and deposits over the past decade, private sector access to credit is now constrained by tightened liquidity in the banking sector and rising interest rates. Private sector credit growth slowed to 9.9 percent in the first nine months of FY24 from 16.2 percent in the same period a year earlier. New letters of credit declined from $8 billion per month in FY22 to $5 billion per month in FY24, according to the report.

Home News Opinion Digital initiative, financial inclusion and MSME troika takes centre stage for Budget 2024 Digital initiative, financial inclusion and MSME troika takes centre stage for Budget 2024 The Budget announcements on DFM will bolster the efforts of the financial sector to support India's economic growth. This budget is expected to set the agenda for the next five years and provide a framework for regulators, financial institutions and market participants Moneycontrol Opinion July 24, 2024 / 09:57 IST DFM takes centre stage in this year's Budget. By Gurpreet Chhatwal The Union Budget for full fiscal 2025 strongly emphasises the critical role the financial sector needs to play in supporting economic growth through a series of welcome announcements. These will arm the lenders in increasing credit flow to the crucial sectors of the economy and optimise outcomes in 3 critical areas — credit expansion, financial inclusion and stressed assets resolution. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad And the tools used are referred to as the DFM troika , i.e., digital or tech-enabled initiatives, financial inclusion, and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) support measures. Digital Initiatives First, technology initiatives in agriculture through successful implementation of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) can expand lending to this segment, supported by strengthened underwriting and monitoring to control the traditionally high non-performing assets in the sector. Related stories Bigger Banks, Bigger Ambitions: Why India must build banks with global heft ‘Predictable tactic’: India slams Pakistan for blaming it over Islamabad car blast Weight loss drug Wegovy to become cheaper as Novo Nordisk cuts prices by up to 37% Technology is also expected to contribute to strengthening the recovery ecosystem, with an integrated technology platform to improve implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. This, coupled with other proposed changes, such as strengthening of the tribunal and appellate tribunal, can improve its efficacy from the perspective of both enhancing recovery levels and speeding up the resolution process. Financial Inclusion Two, from an inclusion perspective, the government’s thrust on supporting affordable housing continues with a planned central assistance of Rs 2.2 lakh crore in the next five years. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Together with the proposed interest subsidy, this will support growth for companies offering affordable-housing finance. These companies, on the back of a favourable regulatory dispensation and solid underlying demand, have been growing faster than traditional housing finance companies. Further, the proposed 3% interest subvention on education loans to youth currently not eligible for Government benefits should lead to robust growth in the segment. Several other steps focused on women and youth have also been announced. Boost to MSME Sector Third, and perhaps the most overarching thrust, has been on the MSME front — a number of measures have been proposed to support credit flow to this sector, such as introduction of a credit guarantee scheme for facilitating term loans to MSMEs for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, solidifying credit assessment criteria of MSMEs by public sector banks and providing guarantee from a government-promoted fund to ensure flow of credit to this sector even during stress periods. Further, the role of SIDBI has been enhanced from its hitherto primarily refinance focus to expanding direct lending to MSMEs in addition to raising the limit of MUDRA loans. Also, for facilitating MSMEs to unlock their working capital by converting their trade receivables into cash, the turnover threshold of buyers for mandatory onboarding on the TReDS platform has been reduced. To be sure, today the Indian financial sector is in sound health with strong profitability and comfortable capital buffers. The banking system’s provisioning cover and net non-performing assets are also at their all-time best levels. The measures announced in the Budget are expected to bolster the efforts of the financial sector in supporting overall economic growth by expanding the addressable credit base across various borrower segments, while at the same time supporting lenders’ asset quality. All said, the criticality of the financial sector in achieving the government’s objectives of growth and development is clearly reinforced by the plan for a financial sector vision and strategy document. While the final contours are awaited, this budget is expected to set the agenda for the next five years and provide a framework to guide the efforts of the government, regulators, financial institutions and market participants.

Financial sector outlook appears bright, but needs to brace for vulnerabilities: Survey The outlook for Indias financial sector appears bright, but it needs to brace for likely vulnerabilities, said Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament on Monday.The Indian financial sector is at a turnpike moment, it said, adding that the dominance of banking support to credit is being reduced, and the role of capital markets is rising.For a country that aspires to be a developed nation by 2047, this is a long-awaited and welcome development, it said. PTI | New Delhi | Updated: 22-07-2024 13:30 IST | Created: 22-07-2024 13:30 IST Country: India SHARE The outlook for India's financial sector appears bright, but it needs to brace for likely vulnerabilities, said Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament on Monday. The Indian financial sector is at a ''turnpike moment'', it said, adding that the dominance of banking support to credit is being reduced, and the role of capital markets is rising. For a country that aspires to be a developed nation by 2047, this is a long-awaited and welcome development, it said. ''Being reliant on and exposed to the capital market, however, comes with its challenges and trade-offs. As India's financial sector undergoes this critical transformation, it must also brace for likely vulnerabilities and prepare itself with regulatory and government policy levers to intervene and hedge, as required,'' it said. Even as banks, non-banks and corporates battled balance-sheet excesses, the consequences of the credit boom of the first decade of the new millennium and the inevitable bust that followed in the second decade, the broad industry kept advancing the cause of financial inclusion and financial deepening, it said. ''Moving forward, healthier corporate and bank balance sheets will further strengthen private investment. The positive trends in the residential real estate market indicate that the household sector capital formation is increasing significantly,'' it said. As India embarks on the vision to become a developed country by 2047, it is imperative that financial intermediation costs decline globally, the Survey prepared by Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran and his team said. It further said the financial sector needs to support capital formation and promote trade, business, and investments in MSMEs, enabling them to scale. ''It also needs to provide insurance protection and retirement security to all citizens. The share of insurance and pension fund assets in GDP stands at 19 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in India, compared to a high of 52 per cent and 122 per cent in the US and 112 per cent and 80 per cent in the UK, leaving scope for further improvements,'' it added. Financial sector firms – public or privately owned – must become customer-centric. Without that, most quantitative metrics will remain elusive, it recommended.

business-india India's financial sector is sound and resilient: RBI Governor IANS July 20, 2024 Mumbai, July 19 RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday that amidst global challenges and uncertainties, India stands out as a fast-growing major economy with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, backed by a healthy and resilient financial sector. "The recent annual financial results of banks and NBFCs indicate that the financial system remains sound and resilient. Further, macro stress tests done by the Reserve Bank reveal that the banking sector will continue to remain resilient even under stress scenarios," he observed at a media event here. Given the strong macroeconomic configuration, favourable demographics and significant pace of digitalisation, the Indian financial sector is poised to scale new heights, he added. In terms of market dynamics, the financial landscape in India is undergoing a structural transformation, driven by factors like innovations in technology, financial deepening, and changing savings and investment patterns. Each of these shifts has a bearing on how financial entities carry out their business and adapt to the emerging risks. The Reserve Bank has also been actively fostering innovation by envisaging mechanisms like the United Payment Interface (UPI), regulatory sandbox, co-lending models and account aggregator framework, Das said. With the synergies provided by mobile phone penetration, internet availability, reoriented payment systems and the multitude of customer data points, lending institutions as well as financial markets have been able to leverage upon such mechanisms to amplify their reach to the target segments and also carry forward the agenda of a more inclusive financial sector, he pointed out. Overall, there has been a transformation in the banking and financial landscape in the last decade driven by technological innovations, changing consumer preferences and the emergence of alternative business models. While these have fostered competition and collaboration, they also have implications for consumer trust and regulatory oversight. Such structural changes also create opportunities as well as challenges. Financial institutions like banks, NBFCs and others need to carefully assess the impact of these changes on their business models, resilience and sustainability, the Governor added.

According to SEBI's latest circular, the inclusion of IFSCA in the list of financial sector regulators will allow SEBI-registered CRAs and ERPs to conduct their rating activities within the IFSC-GIFT City framework. The ESG ratings undertaken by ERPs under IFSCA guidelines will now fall under the purview of IFSCA. This means that any issues arising from the activities of these CRAs and ERPs in the IFSC will be addressed by IFSCA. IFSCA will handle complaints related to services provided by ERPs within the IFSC. This includes enforcement actions and the furnishing of information to third parties, including statutory or judicial bodies. Under Regulation 28E(d) of SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, and Para 7.1 of the Master Circular for ERPs dated May 16, 2024, ERPs are authorized to undertake ESG rating activities as required by other financial sector regulators.

According to the BoG, the move is to entrench the gatekeeping role of the Central Bank in the financial sector. “Poor Corporate Governance contributed significantly to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the financial sector, which led to the failure of some Regulated Financial Institutions (RFIs) licensed by the Bank of Ghana (BoG), consequently necessitating the 2017-2019 banking sector clean-up. “In order to sustain the gains made from the clean-up, the BOG issued the Corporate Governance Directive in 2018 as well as the Fit and Proper Persons Directive in 2019 to strengthen and embed sound corporate governance practices in RFIs and to entrench the gatekeeping role of the BOG in the financial sector”, a notice signed by BoG’s secretary, Sandra Thompson stated. “The BOG reminds the public that persons who have been directly implicated in the 2017-2019 Financial Sector clean-up, and all previous directors of failed banks and SDIs since the enactment of Banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking Institution Act, 2016 (Act 930) do not qualify to hold key positions under the fit and proper persons criteria,” it continued. The banking sector clean-up exercise took place from mid-2017 to January 2020. It resulted in a reduction in the number of banks from 34 to 23, while 347 microfinance institutions, 15 savings and loans, and eight finance houses had their licenses revoked for various breaches, according to the Central Bank.

Islamabad, Jul 6 (IANS): Pakistan's macroeconomic environment in the calendar year 2023 remained challenging amid rising inflation, weak foreign exchange inflows, pressures on external account and local currency, and low business confidence, particularly in the first half, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said. However, the policy measures and regulatory interventions that were taken to address growing imbalances coupled with securing a nine-month stand-by agreement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) helped improve the macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2023, the SBP said in its financial stability review for 2023, Xinhua news agency reported. Inflation started falling, economic growth recovered, and the exchange rate stabilised towards the year-end, the central bank said in the report. Against this backdrop, the financial sector exhibited strong growth and performance, and maintained financial soundness and operational resilience, it added. The asset base of the financial sector expanded by 27 per cent in 2023, mainly driven by the banking sector, according to the report. Follow Daijiworld News Network on Top Stories

Home Business Financial system shows steady performance, soundness in 2023: SBP Review Business Financial system shows steady performance, soundness in 2023: SBP Review 595 - Advertisement - KARACHI, Jul 05 (APP):State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Friday said that the financial sector exhibited strong growth maintaining its financial soundness and operational resilience due to policy measures, regulatory interventions and assistance by multilateral organizations and consequent economic recovery and declining inflation. The central bank, in its media statement on ‘Financial Stability Review 2023’, mentioned that financial sector grew by 29.5%, its asset base expanded by 27.0%, banking sector’s CAR improved to 19.7% and loan provisioning coverage surged to 92.7% by end December 2023. Assessing the overall risks to financial stability as manageable the SBP stressed on policy continuity and termed structural reforms critical for sustained improvement in country’s macroeconomic fundamentals and the resilience and performance of the financial sector. The Financial Stability Review (FSR) for CY2023, prepared and published as a statuary requirement, presents performance and risk assessment of various segments of the financial sector and also assesses the financial soundness of major user of credit and financial services. During the calendar year 2023, E-banking transactions continued to drive growth while SBP moved to implement the third phase of Raast’s person-to-merchant (P2M) mode to facilitate digital payment acceptance for merchants and businesses. The FSR highlighted healthy performance of non-bank financial sector during CY2023 with strong expansion in asset base of Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) while the insurance sector witnessed growth in assets and gross premium. Despite challenges to macroeconomic environment in the first half of 2023, the policy measures and regulatory interventions taken to address growing imbalances coupled with securing of 9-month Stand-by-Agreement (SBA) from IMF helped in improving the macroeconomic conditions in second half of CY2023, the SFR observed. Inflation started falling, economic growth recovered, and exchange rate stabilized towards the year’s end, the Review stated adding that, in this backdrop, the financial sector exhibited strong growth and performance and maintained its financial soundness and operational resilience. The asset base of the financial sector expanded by 27.0 percent in CY2023, which was mainly driven by the banking sector. “The growth in assets was primarily driven by investments in government securities while private sector advances contracted in the backdrop of stressed macro-financial conditions,” the Review noted adding that expansion of the banks’ balance sheet was mainly funded by deposits, which posted a 20-year high growth in a high return environment. During the period, non-performing loans (NPLs) to loans ratio marginally increased to 7.6 % by end December 2023 from 7.3% in December 2022, and the provisioning coverage further improved to 92.7%, it added. Healthy earnings of the banking sector on the back of high rates and expansion in earning assets supported the solvency position and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to 19.7% by end December 2023 well above the minimum regulatory requirement. The Islamic banking institutions continued to maintain growth momentum in CY2023 and its resilience further improved with strong earnings and comfortable asset quality indicators, the Review states adding, however microfinance banks (MFBs) sector continued to experience stress in CY2023. The Review found overall position of the non-financial corporate sector encouraging as solvency indicators and repayment capacity remained satisfactory. It stated that the large borrowers of banking sector had exhibited stable repayment capacity and there were no significant delinquencies. The FSR also highlighted the operational resilience of Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) during CY2023 where E-banking transactions continued to drive growth in retail payments and SBP moved to the third phase of Raast (P2M) mode. The SBP said that overall risks to financial stability appear to be manageable due to anticipated moderation of macroeconomic stress and strong buffers and risk management capabilities of the banking sector. The latest stress test results suggest that the banking sector has adequate resilience to withstand the severe but plausible macro-financial shocks in the medium term, the FSR assessed adding “However, policy continuity on structural reforms remains critical for both sustained improvement in country’s macroeconomic fundamentals and the resilience and performance of the financial sector.” RELATED ARTICLES Business Punjab taking strides in digital transformation: Minister Mujtaba Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 11:32 PM Business Customs foils attempt to smuggle silver via IMO Karachi Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 10:50 PM Business FCCI, NIC-UAF to strengthen collaboration for youth entrepreneurship, skills development Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 9:48 PM Most Popular UN chief slams suicide attack in Islamabad, extends condolences to victims’ families Wed, 12 Nov 2025, 12:05 AM Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six runs in first ODI Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 11:58 PM UN chief slams suicide attack in Islamabad, extends condolences to victims’ families Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 11:37 PM Punjab taking strides in digital transformation: Minister Mujtaba Tue, 11 Nov 2025, 11:32 PM

XINHUA Further efforts are expected to drive the digital transformation of the financial sector, in order to ride the global digitalization wave and better support the development of real sectors like manufacturing, officials and business executives said. Future trends in digital finance include increased use of mobile banking, digital employees, AI-driven risk control, edge computing in the internet of things and green finance. This transformation will require multiskilled professionals with both financial knowledge and digital skills to convert socioeconomic needs into financial products, they said. Liu Weiliang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, said: "Digital technology is reshaping the financial sector's service patterns, operational models, and industry paradigms. Digital finance can boost the real economy by lowering service costs, reducing information asymmetry and enhancing service efficiency." "While many institutions still rely on branch networks and professional employees for customer acquisition and service, future competitiveness will depend on the scale of financial databases and computing power, rather than asset size, numbers of regional branches or workforce," Liu said at the Digital Finance Forum, an event during the ongoing Global Digital Economy Conference. Wu Lianfeng, vice-president at International Data Corporation's China branch, also shared his views on the future characteristics of digital transformation in the financial sector. "We will see more use of mobile banking, where a smartphone functions as a fully equipped mini-bank, handling over 90 percent of work. Digital employees will manage 90 percent of customer service and financial asset management tasks. Artificial intelligence-driven risk control is crucial, with 90 percent of banks adopting AI for effective risk management." "Edge IoT will revolutionize microfinance, making financial services more inclusive and supporting the real economy. Additionally, green finance will also see substantial growth. By 2025, 25 percent of loans from leading global banks will be linked to sustainability," he said. Edge IoT refers to the practice of processing data near the source of data generation, rather than sending it to a centralized cloud or data center, to improve real-time decision-making. Experts also called for further efforts to leverage leading industries, enterprises and megacities to drive the digital transformation in the financial sector. Song Xiaojun, vice-chair of a research institute that is part of China Construction Bank, noted that digital technologies like AI began to be applied in the financial sector over a decade ago. Banks, as a major force within the financial sector, have made significant strides in digital transformation, utilizing digital tools for information management, precise customer need analysis, risk prevention and control, and differentiated interest rates on different industries and clients. "China has the largest user base globally and significant fintech hardware investments. However, there is a shortage of multiskilled professionals who understand finance, relevant industries and internet technologies, capable of converting socioeconomic needs into financial products," Song said. "China's digital economy is worth 40 trillion yuan ($5.5 trillion), yet the financing amount of data asset mortgage is only 169 million yuan, indicating substantial growth potential and a need for data asset support," he added. Talking about the role of megacities in leading digital transformation of the financial sector, Xu Xinchao, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing municipal government, said the city is piloting numerous supportive policies and measures, and building data infrastructure, promoting data aggregation and application in key industries, and ensuring the efficient realization of data asset value. Li Xin, government head of Shijingshan district of Beijing, said the district is advancing a digital renminbi pilot zone. It has also set up an innovation center for data asset circulation and an intelligent computing power center. The district has signed partnership agreements with 10 institutes and businesses to incubate a batch of digital finance projects at the just-concluded Digital Finance Forum.

Experts also called for further efforts to leverage leading industries, enterprises and megacities to drive the digital transformation in the financial sector. Song Xiaojun, vice-chair of a research institute that is part of China Construction Bank, noted that digital technologies like AI began to be applied in the financial sector over a decade ago. Banks, as a major force within the financial sector, have made significant strides in digital transformation, utilizing digital tools for information management, precise customer need analysis, risk prevention and control, and differentiated interest rates on different industries and clients. "China has the largest user base globally and significant fintech hardware investments. However, there is a shortage of multiskilled professionals who understand finance, relevant industries and internet technologies, capable of converting socioeconomic needs into financial products," Song said. "China's digital economy is worth 40 trillion yuan ($5.5 trillion), yet the financing amount of data asset mortgage is only 169 million yuan, indicating substantial growth potential and a need for data asset support," he added. Talking about the role of megacities in leading digital transformation of the financial sector, Xu Xinchao, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing municipal government, said the city is piloting numerous supportive policies and measures, and building data infrastructure, promoting data aggregation and application in key industries, and ensuring the efficient realization of data asset value. Li Xin, government head of Shijingshan district of Beijing, said the district is advancing a digital renminbi pilot zone. It has also set up an innovation center for data asset circulation and an intelligent computing power center. The district has signed partnership agreements with 10 institutes and businesses to incubate a batch of digital finance projects at the just-concluded Digital Finance Forum.
