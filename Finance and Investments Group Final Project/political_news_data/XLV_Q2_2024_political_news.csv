Crystal Pyrak : Idaho new parental consent law may cause unintended harm,20240630T084500Z,,spokesman.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"This column reflects the opinion of the writer. Learn about the differences between a news story and an opinion column. X Email Reddit SMS Crystal Pyrak, M.D. By Crystal Pyrak, M.D. Welcome, summer! As families across Idaho gear up for outdoor adventures and quality time together, I’m compelled to address a significant legislative change that will impact pediatric health care access starting July 1. Senate Bill 1329, recently passed into law, introduces critical adjustments that warrant our attention and concern. This new law primarily focuses on increasing parental involvement in minors’ health care decisions. While parental consent is undeniably crucial in certain medical situations, the broad scope of this legislation extends its impact across all health care providers who interact with minors, including physical therapists, counselors and chiropractors. This legislative breadth necessitates compliance from a wide array of health care professionals, not just doctors. The repercussions for noncompliance with the law are severe, including potential jail time. This punitive measure has understandably instilled fear among health care providers, leading many to contemplate reducing or limiting services for minors altogether. Consequently, adolescents may experience a significant loss of autonomy in managing their health care decisions, previously acquired through practice and guidance from trusted health professionals. Moreover, the law’s stringent requirements have had a chilling effect on community-oriented health care activities. Providers, fearful of legal liabilities stemming from inadequate parental consent, are increasingly withdrawing from volunteer services at events like sports games and educational gatherings. This withdrawal not only affects the availability of health care services but also diminishes valuable community interactions and support. It’s also important to note that youth mental health and substance abuse screening is often most effective when a parent is not present. I encourage all parents to talk to your child’s physician about working together to ensure your child can receive supportive and effective mental health screening and services. Recognizing the challenges posed by the new law, health care entities across Idaho are striving to streamline the parental consent process. Efforts are underway to ensure that parents are informed and empowered without unnecessary burdens or confusion. However, despite these efforts, the implementation of the law requires careful monitoring and flexibility from all stakeholders, including parents and health care providers. It’s crucial for Idaho residents to remain vigilant about any negative impacts resulting from this new law. If you observe instances where minors are denied access to necessary health care services or if you notice a disruption in community health initiatives, I encourage you to engage with your legislators. While the legislation may be rooted in good intentions, any law that hampers patient-provider relationships or instills undue fear among health care providers risks causing unintended harm. As we embark on a season of outdoor enjoyment and family bonding, let’s also stay informed and proactive about legislative changes that affect our health care system. Let’s work together to ensure that minors in Idaho continue to receive the care they need while fostering a supportive environment for health care providers to serve our communities effectively. By remaining attentive and advocating for thoughtful adjustments where necessary, we can uphold the well-being of our youngest citizens and the integrity of our health care system.

A February poll by KFF, a nonprofit group that researchers health policy issues, found that unexpected medical bills and the cost of health care are at the top of the list of peoples’ financial worries, with about three-quarters of the public saying they’re at least somewhat worried about being able to afford unexpected medical bills or the cost of health care for themselves and their families. “It was a huge swing and a miss,” Drew Altman, the president and CEO of KFF, said of the debate. “There was no meaningful attention to health care and, more importantly, to health care costs, which is absolutely an issue of major concern for voters.” People in the U.S. pay roughly twice as much for health care than any other nation on earth, Gostin said, and yet the country's health outcomes are inferior to most peer nations. What's more, health care costs continue to rise in America. National health care spending — which includes spending on physicians, services from hospitals, and prescription drug costs — is projected to grow to almost $4.8 trillion in 2023, increasing faster than the projected growth of the overall economy, according to a report published this month from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said Biden and Trump’s attention on insulin was likely an appeal to the large core of voters with diabetes who have been advocating for lower insulin costs for years. More than 8 million Americans rely on insulin to survive, according to the American Diabetes Association . Still, Caplan said, insulin and drug costs in general are just one component of the overall health care system. “It was a hugely missed opportunity,” Caplan said. “Drug costs are a problem, but so are hospital charges and nursing home costs. Driving down drug prices helps, but it’s far from going to solve our cost issues.” There will be another opportunity, Altman said, for Biden and Trump to address health care costs during the next presidential debate, which is scheduled for September. Beyond the debate stage, Altman said he expects Biden to keep hammering away at health care costs because it's an issue the president has an advantage over Trump. Another KFF poll published in May found that more independent voters trusted Biden over Trump when it came to many areas of health care, including health care costs. “Despite the fact that there was little or no focus on it, it will be a continuing focus for Biden and the Democrats,” Altman said. “I expect Trump to stay silent on this issue.”"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am passionate about all things digital health. Follow Author Jun 28, 2024, 01:21pm EDT Share Save Comment In Healthcare and Finance money is solicited by cyber hackers as result of data theft. StockImages The Hidden Costs of Data Breaches in the Healthcare Sector While the Kraken exchange exploit cost them more than $3 million dollars in stolen cryptocurrency, Change Healthcare was exploited for more than $22 million in cryptocurrency, even more than the average cost of a cyber security incident which can cost a healthcare organization more than $10 million dollars. The average cost of a data breach across industries was $4.45 million, yet the average cost of a healthcare data breach was the highest among all industries at $10.93 million in 2023. In today's digital age, data breaches have become a common threat across various industries. While the financial sector is often perceived as the primary target for cybercriminals due to the direct monetary gain involved, recent studies show that breaches in the healthcare sector are significantly more costly. The reasons for this disparity are rooted in the unique nature of healthcare data, the complexities of the industry, and the profound impact on affected individuals. 1. The Value of Healthcare Data Healthcare data is incredibly valuable on the black market. Unlike financial data, which can be rendered useless relatively quickly through account freezes and fraud alerts, healthcare information has a longer shelf life. Medical records contain a wealth of sensitive information, including personal identification details, medical history, insurance information, and even payment details. This data can be exploited for various malicious activities, such as identity theft, insurance fraud, and the creation of fake medical records. 2. Regulatory Fines and Penalties The healthcare industry is heavily regulated to protect patient privacy and data security. Regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States impose strict requirements on how healthcare providers handle patient information. Breaches of healthcare data often result in substantial fines and penalties from regulatory bodies. These fines can be much higher than those in the financial sector, reflecting the critical importance of safeguarding patient data. 3. Long-Term Consequences The repercussions of a healthcare data breach extend far beyond the immediate financial loss. Patients affected by data breaches can suffer long-term consequences, including medical identity theft, compromised health outcomes, and loss of trust in healthcare providers. Addressing these issues requires significant resources, including credit monitoring services, legal fees, and public relations efforts to rebuild trust with patients and the public.

Operational Disruption A cyberattack on a healthcare organization can severely disrupt its operations. Unlike financial institutions, which can often continue functioning while addressing a breach, healthcare providers may face significant operational challenges. Ransomware attacks, in particular, can force hospitals and clinics to shut down critical systems, delay treatments, and compromise patient care. The cost of these disruptions, both in terms of financial loss and human impact, can be staggering. 5. The Cost of Remediation Remediating a healthcare data breach is a complex and expensive process. Healthcare organizations must conduct thorough investigations to understand the extent of the breach, implement enhanced security measures, and comply with regulatory requirements for breach notification and reporting. Additionally, they often need to provide affected patients with identity theft protection services, further adding to the overall cost. 6. Loss of Trust and Reputation The loss of trust and damage to reputation can be devastating for healthcare providers. Patients trust healthcare organizations with their most sensitive information, and a breach can shatter that trust. Rebuilding a damaged reputation requires time, effort, and significant financial investment in marketing and public relations campaigns. For smaller healthcare providers, the impact of a breach on reputation and patient trust can be particularly challenging to overcome. Conclusion While financial data breaches are undoubtedly costly and damaging, the unique characteristics of healthcare data and the stringent regulatory environment make healthcare breaches even more costly. The long-term consequences, operational disruptions, and the profound impact on patient trust underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare sector. As cyber threats continue to evolve, healthcare organizations must prioritize data security and invest in advanced cybersecurity technologies and practices. By doing so, they can protect their patients' sensitive information, maintain regulatory compliance, and mitigate the financial and reputational risks associated with data breaches.

Around 71% of the breaches originate due to the hacking of a healthcare provider. Research carried out by the US-based cybersecurity company Incogni, alongside data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, detailed how since 2020, healthcare providers were reported to have experienced 1,572 breaches, accounting for 57.6% of all American healthcare profiles that have been exposed. At the same time, the report by Incogni found the same pattern with reported ransomware attacks finding that since 2020 approximately 76.1% of attacks targeted healthcare providers. The most common cause for a breach is described by the research as hacking and IT incidents, accounting for 1,622 breaches and affecting 136.8 million healthcare profiles. The biggest breach named in the report was the 2021 breach of the optometry company 20/20 Eye Care Network, which saw the healthcare data of approximately 3.3 million Americans breached after hostile actors were able to access the company’s cloud storage systems. Darius Belejevas, head of data protection service Incogni, said: “The transition to electronic health systems has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to the healthcare sector, but it has also introduced significant risks. The exposure of sensitive health information can have devastating consequences for individuals, as their data might be further used by data brokers or even criminals. Incogni advocates for more stringent privacy and security measures for entities that manage patient information. “As breaches continue to compromise patient privacy, they also put patients’ safety at risk and erode their trust in the healthcare system. Moreover, they can lead to identity theft, medical fraud, and other forms of exploitation.” The healthcare-centric cybersecurity market is expected to steadily grow alongside the rise in attacks on healthcare facilities. Research by GlobalData found that the global cybersecurity market will be worth $334bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% between 2022 and 2030. Additionally, separate research by UK cybersecurity company Sophos , found that only 24% of healthcare organisations were able to disrupt a ransomware attack before the attackers encrypted their data – down from 34% in 2022. The reasons for cyberattacks on healthcare facilities vary across several causes, but in the past few years cyberattacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities have been used as a tool for disruption from hostile states such as Russia .

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways When President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump face off Thursday during the first general election debate, health policy experts say tackling the exorbitant cost of health care is as much a top issue for voters as the U.S. economy. Health care costs in the United States continue to rise — and Americans increasingly say they are unable to afford the care they need. There is no issue in health care even remotely close to voter frustration over the high prices patients have to pay for medical care, said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “People tend to think about health care as separate from the economy,” he said. “But when you talk to voters, it’s not separate at all in their heads. Health care is a dimension of their pocketbook economic concerns.” National health care spending is projected to have increased 7.5% in 2023 to almost $4.8 trillion, faster than the projected growth of the overall economy, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . The estimated health care spending per person — the average amount spent on health care services for each individual — reached $14,423 in 2023, up from $13,493 in 2022 and $13,012 in 2021. The rising cost is hitting Americans’ wallets. About half of U.S. adults say it is difficult to afford their health care costs, according to a recent poll from KFF . About 1 in 4 say they — or a family member — had problems paying for health care in the past year. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement That often means people will have to skip or delay the care that they need, said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician at the Cambridge Health Alliance, who was not involved in the polling. A family member may try to provide financial aid, he added, but attempts to help another can sometimes aggravate problems for the entire family — most notably with medical debt. ""For American households, health care costs are one of the most important economic issues,"" he said. “What we spend on health care is going to be one of the biggest line items for a lot of families, particularly families with children or with elderly people with chronic diseases.” No sweeping reform Although Trump has revived threats to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, major health care reform is unlikely to be a central issue during the debate, Altman said. Biden is likely to tout the Inflation Reduction Act, which he signed into law in 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Among the provisions is allowing Medicare, for the first time, to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Earlier this year, the government began negotiating prices on the 10 costliest prescription drugs covered by Medicare, which included heart medications and diabetes drugs. The government is expected to publish the new negotiated prices by Sept. 1. Earlier this month, the administration also announced a plan to eliminate debt from medical reports . Aside from Obamacare and abortion, Trump has provided little detail on what health care policy would look like in a potential second term. He made addressing the high cost of prescription drugs a tentpole of his previous term, including a push to allow states to import drugs from Canada and a rule that would tie prices for certain drugs to prices paid by countries overseas. The greatest challenge for both Biden and Trump will be pitching health care cost policies that both sides of Congress can get behind, said Robin Feldman, a professor of law and director of the Center for Innovation at UC Law San Francisco. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Notions of unity and compromise seem to be a distant memory in Congress, as they are in the nation,” she said. ”The idea of a big major sweeping reform has felt unlikely in recent years,” Gaffney said. Breakthrough reforms remain challenging — but important. “This distinction between health care as an issue and the economy as an issue at this point drives me crazy, because for real people, there is no distinction,” Altman said. “It’s one of their biggest economic concerns.” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com About Our Ads"

The study, published June 24 as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ), found that when health care prices increased, non-health care employers responded by reducing their payroll and cutting the jobs of middle-class workers. For the average county, a 1% increase in health care prices would reduce aggregate income in the area by approximately $8 million annually. The study was conducted by a team of leading economists from Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Harvard University, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. “When health care prices go up, jobs outside the health care sector go down,” said Cooper, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health and of economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “It’s broadly understood that employer-sponsored health insurance creates a link between health care markets and labor markets. Our research shows that middle- and lower-income workers are shouldering rising health care prices, and in many cases, it’s costing them their jobs. Bottom line: Rising health care costs are increasing economic inequality.” To better understand how rising health care prices affect labor market outcomes, the researchers brought together insurance claims data on approximately a third of adults with employer-sponsored insurance, health insurance premium data from the U.S. Department of Labor, and IRS data from every income tax return filed in the United States between 2008 and 2017. They then used these data to trace out how an increase in health care prices — such as a $2,000 increase on a $20,000 hospital bill — flows through to health spending, insurance premiums, employer payrolls, income and unemployment in counties, and the tax revenue collected by the federal government. “Many think that it’s insurers or employers who bear the burden of rising health care prices. We show that it’s really the workers themselves who are impacted,” said Zarek Brot-Goldberg, an assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. “It’s vital to understand that rising health care prices aren’t just impacting patients. Rising prices are hurting the employment outcomes for workers who never went to the hospital.” For the new study, the authors used hospital mergers as a vehicle to assess the effect of price increases. From 2000 to 2020, there were over 1,000 hospital mergers among the approximately 5,000 U.S. hospitals. In past work , the authors found that approximately 20% of hospital mergers should have been expected to raise prices by lessening competition, according to merger guidelines from the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. These mergers, on average, raised prices by 5%. “We can use our analysis to estimate the effect of hospital mergers,” said Stuart Craig, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School. “Our results show that a hospital merger that raised prices by 5% would result in $32 million in lost wages, 203 lost jobs, a $6.8 million reduction in federal tax revenue, and a death from suicide or overdose of a worker outside the health sector.” The study also showed that because rising health care prices leads firms to let go of workers, a knock-on effect of hospital mergers is that they lead to increases in government spending on unemployment insurance and reductions in the tax revenue collected by the federal government. “It’s vital to point out that hospital mergers raise spending by the federal government and lower tax revenue at the same time,” said Cooper. “When prices in the U.S health sector rise, it’s actually a net negative for the economy. It’s leading to fewer jobs and precipitating all the consequences we associate with workers becoming unemployed.” Other authors of the study were Lev Klarnet from Harvard University, Ithai Lurie from U.S. Department of Treasury, and Corbin Miller from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Article Insights Goodwin Procter LLP are most popular: within Transport topic(s) On April 26, 2024, almost a year after issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Privacy Rule, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) finalized the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy (Final Rule). In practice, the Final Rule shields patients' protected health information (PHI) related to a patient seeking and/or receiving lawful reproductive health care and to a health care provider facilitating and/or rendering such health care services from civil, criminal, and administrative scrutiny. We review key facets of the rule below. Background The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (the Privacy Rule) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally prohibits covered entities such as health care providers and health plans (Covered Entities) from disclosing PHI without patient authorization except for treatment, payment, and health care operations. However, pursuant to certain exceptions under the Privacy Rule, Covered Entities have historically been allowed to disclose PHI without patient authorization in connection with certain public health activities; health oversight activities (e.g., in response to a request from a health oversight agency for audits; civil, administrative, or criminal investigations; proceedings; or actions); or judicial and administrative proceedings when disclosure is ordered by the court or pursuant to a non-court-ordered subpoena when the disclosing party receives satisfactory assurance that the receiving party will appropriately safeguard the PHI(i.e., reasonable efforts were made to ensure the individual subject of the PHI was given notice of the request or to secure a qualified protective order). The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ( Dobbs ) and the subsequent passing of laws restricting abortion in some states have created concern about law enforcement authorities and others accessing PHI using the exceptions that allow the disclosure of PHI for health oversight and judicial and/or administrative proceedings and using it to prosecute patients and health care providers. The OCR proposed changes to the Privacy Rule to address these concerns last year. The Final Rule Uses and Disclosures: Prohibited Purposes The Final Rule expands and strengthens patient privacy protections by prohibiting Covered Entities and their business associates (together with Covered Entities, Regulated Entities) from using or disclosing patients' PHI related to the provision of ""lawful reproductive health care,"" including abortion care, for the following ""prohibited purposes"": (1) conducting a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation or imposing criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating lawful reproductive health care, or to identify any person to initiate such activities; or (2) identifying any person to conduct criminal, civil, or administrative investigations for such activities. 1 Lawful Reproductive Care ""Lawful reproductive health care"" is defined as health care that ""affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system, including its functions and processes,"" and that is: (1) lawful under the laws of the state where such healthcare is provided under the circumstances in which it is provided (e.g., an abortion performed at 12 weeks' gestation in a state that permits abortions through 24 weeks' gestation): or (2) protected, required, or authorized by federal law, including the US Constitution, 2 regardless of the state where such health care is provided (e.g., miscarriage management care provided as necessary, stabilizing care under the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act [EMTALA] to a patient in an emergency department in a state with a fetal-heartbeat-based abortion ban). 3 Presumption of Lawful Reproductive Health Care Under the Final Rule, there is a presumption that reproductive health care provided by a person other than the Regulated Entity receiving the request for disclosure of PHI is lawful, and that related PHI is, therefore, protected from disclosure, unless one of two conditions is met: (1) the Regulated Entity has actual knowledge that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided, or (2) the Regulated Entity receives information from the person making the request for the use or disclosure of PHI that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the reproductive health care was not lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided. 4 For example, the Regulated Entity knows, or receives credible information from the requesting entity, that an abortion was illegally performed in a state where such care is banned or was performed by a unlicensed individual. Attestation When PHI related to lawful reproductive health care is requested for health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, or disclosures to coroners and medical examiners, the Regulated Entity must obtain an attestation from the requesting party that the use or disclosure of such PHI is not for a prohibited purpose. 5 Public Health The Final Rule also modifies the definition of ""public health"" to clarify that public health activities do not include activities: ""(1) To conduct a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating health care; (2) To impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating health care."" 6 Notice of Privacy Practices Covered Entities are required to revise their Notice of Privacy Practices to reflect the Final Rule's updated privacy and other protections for reproductive health care. 7 Supporting Access to Care and Protecting Patient Privacy In making these updates to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, HHS-OCR continued to emphasize its goal of encouraging individuals' trust and confidence in accessing high-quality reproductive health care by ""carefully balancing individuals' privacy interests with others' interests in using or disclosing PHI."" 8 HHS-OCR referenced concerns that patients may be reluctant to seek such care if they fear that their PHI could be requested from Regulated Entities to investigate and potentially impose liability upon them for having sought, obtained, or facilitated lawful reproductive health care. 9 Alternatively, patients who doubt the confidentiality of their discussions with healthcare providers may choose not to disclose their complete or accurate medical or reproductive-health care history for fear of repercussions. This could, in turn, hinder health care providers from offering safe and effective information or treatment recommendations to their patients. Health care providers may also be reluctant to provide legal reproductive health care for fear of facing investigation or liability in the fluctuating legal environment that currently surrounds such care. HHS-OCR implemented the Final Rule to mitigate these concerns by protecting particularly sensitive PHI. Key Insights Regulated Entities must comply with the Final Rule by December 23, 2024, but Covered Entities have until February 16, 2026, to make necessary corresponding updates to their Notice of Privacy Practices. 10 As rulemaking develops in this area and as the Final Rule goes into effect, Regulated Entities offering reproductive health care services should update their policies and procedures related to the use and disclosure of PHI as appropriate. Regulated Entities that receive requests for disclosures of PHI related to lawful reproductive health care should ensure they are not disclosing PHI for any prohibited purpose and should obtain attestations when appropriate. In addition, Covered Entities should ensure that their Notice of Privacy Practices accurately reflects their practices with respect to compliance with the Final Rule's additional privacy protections for reproductive health care. It is important to note that health care providers providing reproductive-health care services who are not engaging in ""standard transactions"" under HIPAA (i.e., pre-authorization services and/or submission of electronic claims to health plans) and other entities not regulated by HIPAA (e.g., fertility- and pregnancy-tracking apps) are not considered Regulated Entities under HIPAA, and their patients' or users' personal information is, therefore, not considered PHI and would not be protected from use or disclosure under the Final Rule. As rulemaking develops in this area, Regulated Entities offering reproductive health care should consult with legal counsel to determine how state- and federal-level reproductive health laws may affect their businesses and to ensure their PHI disclosures are compliant with applicable laws.

As healthcare expenditures surge, organizations face mounting pressure to optimize financial efficiencies. Outsourcing non-core functions such as medical billing and claims processing to specialized BPO providers offers substantial cost savings by streamlining operations, reducing labor costs, and optimizing resource allocation. This strategic approach not only enhances productivity but also empowers healthcare entities to prioritize core competencies like patient care and innovation. Leveraging offshore capabilities further enhances cost-effectiveness while ensuring compliance and service excellence amid financial constraints. Navigating Financial Challenges: Mitigating Hidden Costs in Healthcare BPO Strategies Hidden outsourcing costs present a significant challenge in the healthcare BPO market. Despite anticipated cost savings, companies often underestimate the financial complexities associated with outsourcing. From vendor selection challenges to managing transition costs and enhancing data security, unforeseen expenses can erode anticipated benefits. Addressing these financial intricacies through meticulous planning and strategic partnership management is crucial for healthcare organizations aiming to maximize the value of BPO arrangements while minimizing financial risks. Data-Driven Growth: Leveraging Advanced Analytics for Strategic Healthcare BPO Success Advanced data analytics emerges as a transformative opportunity driving growth in the healthcare BPO market. By leveraging sophisticated analytics tools, service providers can optimize operational workflows, enhance customer retention, and improve financial performance. These capabilities enable healthcare organizations to identify cost-saving opportunities, ensure regulatory compliance, and deliver personalized service offerings tailored to specific industry needs. Embracing data-driven strategies not only enhances operational efficiency but also positions BPO providers as indispensable partners in the evolving landscape of healthcare service delivery. Protecting Patient Trust: Safeguarding Data Integrity in Healthcare BPO Operations Data security remains a critical challenge confronting the healthcare BPO market, threatening patient confidentiality and regulatory compliance. With the proliferation of digital records and outsourced processes, the risk of data breaches escalates without robust cybersecurity measures and comprehensive training programs. Compliance with stringent regulations such as HIPAA requires proactive measures to uphold data integrity and mitigate potential risks to patient trust and organizational reputation. Addressing these challenges through collaborative efforts and technological innovations is essential to maintaining the highest standards of data security and confidentiality in healthcare BPO operations. Innovative Care Delivery: Transforming Efficiency in Healthcare BPO Services The healthcare BPO market ecosystem revolutionizes service delivery through strategic outsourcing of administrative and medical functions to specialized providers. From streamlining medical billing and claims processing to enhancing telehealth support with AI and automation, these innovations drive operational efficiency and accuracy. By reducing operational costs and elevating service quality, the ecosystem empowers healthcare executives to prioritize patient-centric care while navigating the complexities of modern healthcare delivery. Request Sample Pages: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=472 Streamlining Healthcare Documentation: Dominance of Medical Transcription in BPO Services The medical transcription segment has secured the largest share within the Healthcare BPO industry, particularly in patient care. Known for its efficiency in transcribing medical records, this segment offers healthcare organizations swift and precise transcription processes. Outsourcing medical transcription not only meets stringent quality standards but also alleviates workload and reduces costs. Specialized BPO providers ensure accuracy through rigorous checks, allowing healthcare providers to focus on core activities while maintaining compliance with industry regulations. Optimizing Claims Processing: Claims Adjudication Leads Healthcare BPO Market Services Claims adjudication services dominate the Healthcare BPO industry under claims management, playing a crucial role in processing and resolving healthcare claims. Healthcare payers rely on efficient adjudication to determine coverage and facilitate timely reimbursements. Outsourcing these services enhances accuracy and operational efficiency, mitigating risks and ensuring compliance. By leveraging specialized BPO expertise, payers can streamline processes and uphold customer satisfaction while focusing on core business functions. Driving Pharmaceutical Success: Sales and Marketing Services Spearhead Healthcare BPO Growth Sales and marketing services claim the largest share in the Healthcare BPO market's non-clinical segment, driven by pharmaceutical companies outsourcing these functions to enhance market presence and focus on core competencies like R&D. BPO providers bring industry-specific knowledge and advanced technologies to optimize marketing efforts, reduce costs, and adapt to market dynamics efficiently. Outsourcing enables pharmaceutical firms to remain agile and competitive, accelerating growth and innovation in the healthcare BPO sector. Leading the Charge: North America Dominates Healthcare BPO Market as Source Geography North America holds the largest share in the Healthcare BPO market as a source geography, attributed to widespread EHR adoption mandated by HIPAA 5010 regulations. These regulations promote standardized electronic transactions in healthcare, driving demand for BPO services to manage and optimize electronic health records. The region's complex healthcare operations and stringent regulatory environment necessitate external support, positioning North America as a primary hub for healthcare BPO services. Recent Developments in the Healthcare BPO Industry Accenture Expands AI Expertise: Acquisition Enhances Behavioral Science and CRM Activation Accenture Plc's acquisition of Health Unlimited in April 2024 marks a strategic move to expand service offerings and harness generative AI potential. This acquisition bolsters Accenture's capabilities in behavioral science, customer strategy, and CRM activation, aiming to enhance personalized healthcare solutions and operational efficiencies.

WELL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES 2023 ESG REPORT 2 Copilots in healthcare transformation A WORD FROM OUR CEO Who we are Our ESG program ESG foundation: Disciplined governance and risk framework ESG priority 1: Provider support and digital enablement ESG priority 2: Safeguarding patient data ESG priority 3: A healthy place to work A WORD FROM OUR CEO WELL is leading the way in healthcare transformation As I reflect on the past year at WELL Health and as the Company continues to grow, navigate and solve for the challenges facing the Canadian healthcare system, WELL's dedication to working alongside healthcare providers and Canadian public sector stakeholders to transform healthcare delivery and experiences for providers and patients remains steadfast. WELL's AI-powered copilots are transforming all parts of the healthcare ecosystem by helping to free healthcare providers from their overwhelming administrative burden so they can spend more time with patients. Our journey has been guided by our mission to positively impact health outcomes by leveraging technology to empower and support patients and healthcare providers. We approach this challenge with a steadfast commitment to innovation, collaboration and compassion. At WELL, we envision a future where healthcare is not just reactive but proactive. Where every individual receives personalized care tailored to their unique needs. And where healthcare providers are fully empowered with technology designed to reduce administrative tasks and burnout, help them more effortlessly and efficiently view a patient's complete health history and make diagnoses, and ultimately focus more completely on care delivery because less time is needed for administrative tasks. By harnessing the power of cutting- edge technology and fostering collaboration and interconnectivity across the healthcare ecosystem, we are working towards this vision every day. WELL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES 2023 ESG REPORT 3 Copilots in healthcare transformation A WORD FROM OUR CEO Who we are Our ESG program ESG foundation: Disciplined governance and risk framework ESG priority 1: Provider support and digital enablement ESG priority 2: Safeguarding patient data ESG priority 3: A healthy place to work Reflecting on our accelerated growth in 2023 Over the past year, our commitment to innovation has driven us to new heights. In 2023 we expanded our Canadian outpatient clinic network by about 85 per cent to 167 clinics. We have solidified our position as the leading end-to-end healthcare company, empowering providers with the digital tools they need to reduce their administrative burden and burnout and deliver exceptional care. Our suite of digital healthcare solutions encompasses a wider range of healthcare services than ever: from cutting-edgeAI-powered tools designed to eliminate time-consuming and inefficient administrative tasks and to help identify ""needle- in-a-haystack"" indicators of complex and rare disease in patients, to cutting-edge telemedicine marketplaces designed to provide federal, provincial and territorial healthcare systems with much needed provider availability - as well as EMR systems, billing management, cybersecurity and a host of other tools. Our launch of three successful AI innovations in particular has been a landmark development - not just for our company, but for the entire healthcare ecosystem. WELL AI Voice is giving back up to 3.5 minutes per patient visit, or more than two hours to the practitioner each working day.* WELL AI Decision support is literally helping providers save lives by identifying patients with undiagnosed complex and rare diseases, so providers can help patients get the care they need before their health deteriorates further. WELL AI Inbox Admin is freeing up as much as 20 hours a week per clinic by taking care of routine admin tasks such as managing incoming faxes. WELL's record financial achievements for 2023 In 2023, WELL demonstrated strength across all of its key operational and patient metrics, including: Record annual revenue increased by 36 per cent over the prior year, to nearly $776.1 million. Annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 8 per cent to a record $113.4 million. Earlier this year, I was pleased to provide a robust outlook for 2024 with increased guidance for annual revenue of between $950 million and $970 million as well as a new guidance range of $125 million to $130 million for Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects an acceleration of our year-over-year growth. WELL's record financial achievements can be attributed to the company's discipline and focus on tech-enabling healthcare providers and supporting them by simplifying, * Assumes 35 patients per day. At WELL, we envision a future where healthcare is not just reactive but proactive , where every individual receives personalized care tailored to their unique needs.

I said it last year, but it is still applicable today: our financial success is also a by-product of our success in carrying out our environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. ESG accomplishments fuelled our success This is our third annual ESG report and our progress in just a few short years has been remarkable. A few of the highlights of what you'll discover in this report: We expanded our care provider support by launching groundbreaking AI tools that will revolutionize healthcare practices: WELL AI Voice, WELL AI Decision Support and WELL AI Inbox Admin, as well as the WELL Longevity+ program which uses AI and advanced diagnostics to prevent disease. We enhanced our data protection capabilities, in part through Cycura's acquisitions of Seekintoo and Proack Security for round-the-clock managed threat detection and offensive security assessments, and through the use of AI tools in our internal operations. We received our first certification as a Great Place to Work ® company. This award recognizes the totality of our commitment to creating a healthy, fulfilling and respectful work environment through our diversity, equity and inclusion training and policies, health and well-being programs, fair and equitable compensation practices, and so much more. WELL continued our commitment to giving back to the communities where we live and work with employee and corporate support of numerous charities and employee volunteer hours. We strengthened our dedication to best practices in corporate governance by enhancing our reporting framework, risk management strategy and training programs. Our work doesn't stop there. We have exciting plans in the works for 2024, including more team training opportunities, new innovations and enhanced tools for providers, and an expanded public health division to solidify our work in this sector. Our commitment to carers At the heart of our success is our unwavering focus on caring for the care provider so they can concentrate entirely on caring for us, their patients. We believe that by supporting healthcare providers, we empower them to provide the best possible care to their patients. This ethos drives everything we do, from product development to customer support. Looking ahead, we are excited to exemplify what is possible in healthcare. Thank you for joining us on our journey to transform the healthcare ecosystem in Canada.

At WELL, we envision a healthcare system where patients around the world have greater access to services, and where physicians are empowered with technology designed to enhance their delivery of healthcare while allowing them to focus more on doing what they do best - caring for their patients. We are brining this vision to life within our own brick-and-mortar and virtual healthcare clinics, as well as in the thousands of healthcare environments we support across North America and other parts of the world. Purpose Healthcare providers, and the teams that support them, are the driving force behind healthcare delivery, patient healthcare experiences and, ultimately, health outcomes. At WELL, our purpose is to modernize and improve healthcare delivery by empowering healthcare providers with cutting-edge digital technology, products and services that are designed to streamline care delivery, enhance and transform healthcare experiences, automate and digitize administrative tasks, and alleviate many of the inefficiencies and challenges faced by healthcare providers and the patients for whom they care.

WELL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES 2023 ESG REPORT 6 Copilots in healthcare transformation A word from our CEO WHO WE ARE The need for transformation has never been greater Our mission, vision, purpose and focus Today's healthcare landscape The WELL difference The WELL Health universe and structure WELL at a glance Our ESG program PROBLEM At WELL Health, we understand that today's healthcare provider faces myriad challenges which can affect their ability to deliver effective patient care, limit the number of patients they can treat and lead to burnout. At the same time, the entire ecosystem is threatened by labour shortages and unequal access to care, which is creating havoc in our national healthcare system. SOLUTION Our innovative technologies offer solutions to these challenges by reducing the administrative burden, increasing the quality and number of patient interactions, and strengthening communication, referrals and information sharing across the healthcare ecosystem. This can translate into lower physician burnout rates, better health outcomes for patients and an improved health ecosystem overall.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 17, 2024, 07:00am EDT Share Save Author Hitesh Dev is the COO at Devout Corporation and a health tech consultant, supporting Federal and Commercial organizations since 2002. getty I grew up in India and came to the U.S. for my graduate studies. My mom is a pediatrician and still manages her practice at the age of 75. While growing up, I sometimes helped my mom with clinic management, paperwork and pharmacy settlements. I recently visited India and got my Executive Check done at a fraction of the price. This experience motivated me to write this article. The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other high-income country , yet it does not achieve commensurate outcomes in terms of life expectancy and overall health. Meanwhile, India, with its diverse and vast population, has managed to create cost-effective healthcare solutions . By examining the key elements of India's healthcare system, I believe U.S. healthcare providers can identify actionable strategies to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. 1. Cost-Efficient Healthcare Delivery Public-Private Partnerships India's healthcare system is working on leveraging public-private partnerships (PPPs) to extend healthcare services to a larger segment of the population. These partnerships enable the sharing of resources, expertise, and infrastructure between the government and private entities. Healthcare providers could enhance its healthcare reach by fostering similar PPPs, and encouraging collaboration with government bodies to reduce costs and improve access to care. Low-Cost Healthcare Models India has pioneered low-cost healthcare models that focus on delivering high-quality care at minimal expenses. Institutions like the Aravind Eye Care System and Narayana Health have demonstrated that it is possible to provide world-class medical services affordably. Providers can adopt low-cost healthcare models, particularly for common procedures and routine care to significantly reduce expenses. Encouraging innovation in cost management, and care delivery can lead to more affordable healthcare solutions. Federal and State Governments would need to step in and provide incentives to providers/health institutions to have their resources dedicated to low-income groups. Also, this should become a license requirement for doctors and medical institutions. 2. Technological Innovations Telemedicine and Remote Consultations India has made significant strides in telemedicine, allowing patients in remote areas to access specialist care, reducing the overall cost of healthcare by minimizing the need for physical infrastructure and travel expenses. Healthcare providers can expand telemedicine services by implementing robust telemedicine infrastructure to improve accessibility and efficiency. Healthcare providers would need to work with insurance companies to provide incentives for patients to leverage telemedicine services. Also, rural patients would see the value in telemedicine if providers were able to use remote diagnosis tools and portable devices. Use of Mobile Health Technologies Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are becoming widely used in India to monitor and manage health conditions, provide health education and ensure adherence to treatment plans. These technologies are cost-effective and scalable. Integrating mHealth technologies into the U.S. healthcare system can enhance patient engagement, improve health outcomes, and reduce costs by enabling continuous monitoring and early intervention. In order for mHealth to succeed, providers would need to become more tech-savvy as well as proactive in responding to patient queries, and appointment requests and work in collaboration with pharmacies and insurance companies. 3. Community-Based Health Programs Preventive Health Initiatives India is engaging in community-based health programs focused on the prevention and early detection of diseases. These initiatives involve community health workers who educate and screen populations for various health conditions. Providers should consider investing in preventive health programs to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and lower long-term healthcare costs. Emphasizing prevention and early detection can lead to significant savings. Integrating Traditional Medicine India is known for providing traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Yoga as an option into its healthcare framework, offering alternative and complementary treatments that can often be cost-effective. Exploring the integration of offering alternative and complementary medicine into the U.S. healthcare system can provide cost-effective treatment options and enhance patient choice. Providers can encourage research and evidence-based practice in these areas to support their inclusion. 4. Administrative and Operational Efficiency Streamlining Administrative Processes Healthcare providers are employing streamlined administrative processes to minimize overhead costs. This includes reducing paperwork, optimizing staffing, and implementing efficient billing systems. U.S. providers can significantly reduce administrative costs by adopting streamlined processes, utilizing electronic health records (EHRs) more effectively and minimizing bureaucratic inefficiencies. This can be done by reducing the paperwork associated with insurance claims, HIPAA compliance requirements, and the number of lab and imaging requirements as mandated by insurance companies. Task Shifting and Multiskilling India is engaging in task shifting —where tasks are delegated to less specialized health workers—helps address workforce shortages and reduce costs. The multiskilling of healthcare workers ensures that they can perform various roles. Implementing task shifting and multiskilling in the U.S. healthcare workforce can optimize resource utilization and reduce labor costs. Create training programs that focus on enhancing efficiency and service delivery. Conclusion The U.S. healthcare system faces significant challenges related to high costs and inefficiencies. By learning from the Indian healthcare system, providers can adopt several strategies to enhance cost savings and improve patient outcomes. Implementing these lessons requires a commitment to innovation, policy reform, and a focus on value-based care. By doing so, I believe the U.S. can make substantial strides towards a more sustainable and equitable healthcare system.

For You: Housing Market 2024: 50 Most Affordable Cities for Homebuyers Try This: Become a Real Estate Investor for Just $1K Using This Bezos-Backed Startup “Rent in this city now averages $2,700 per month” – or whatever the figure is. And you think to yourself, how can anyone afford to live there? It’s a good question, and the people at RentCafe have the answer. A 2024 study by the group, which analyzes the rental market, showed that high rent often comes with a high annual income in that same locale. RentCafe found 30 cities where renters can maximize their income – where the rent and monthly expenses don’t overwhelm their budget – even if the rental price is above the national median of $2,138 as of June 2024. In its analysis, RentCafe used the median income, average rent and average prices for the basics in 189 cities across the United States in its calculation. The cost of things such as utilities, food and healthcare are limited to specific bills. These certain grocery items frequently appear in a shopping cart and specific medical procedures, and they don’t reflect average monthly spending. RentCafe found that some places where rent is most easily affordable are traditionally expensive places to live, including the suburbs around Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., where incomes are commensurate.

Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close Maryland is a microcosm of the serious problems besetting the health care system in the United States. Health care in Maryland is a $15 billion industry in which doctors and patients are losing control and the number of uninsured persons is rising. The state's health care policy-an incoherent bundle of regulations and contradictions-is driving up the cost of health care while artificially trying to hammer down prices. In 1996 alone, the cost of a hospital stay increased almost twice as fast as the national average. Yet, by mid-February 1998, legislators had introduced 85 new health care and companion bills and 18 mental health bills in the state's General Assembly. Politics, not patient choice, has been the driving force behind the growth of Maryland's health care system. The health care behemoth grew rapidly after the enactment of the Health Care and Insurance Reform Act, an 81-page, last-minute bill pushed through in 1993 at the height of the national debate on the failed Clinton Health Security Act. One legislator aptly described it as the ""Clinton Plan in miniature."" As a result, Maryland's system now features: No fewer than five regulatory bureaucracies to control health care delivery at a cost of over $30 million a year. A government-run health care database that violates a patient's right to privacy . In Big Brother fashion, sensitive information on every visit to doctors and hospitals is entered without a patient's consent. Ironically, Marylanders can protect the confidentiality of their driving records, but not that of their medical records, in the state's computerized data banks. More mandates on the health insurance market than are imposed by any other state . As a result, many Marylanders are unable to purchase a benefits package tailored to their own specific needs but are forced to pay for access to treatments and procedures that legislators target for politically favored body parts. According to a recent U.S. General Accounting Office report, Maryland's mandates add 22 percent to the cost of a typical health benefits package. This puts Maryland-based insurance plans at a competitive disadvantage when trying to attract the business of federal workers and retirees in the popular, consumer-driven Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Policies that frustrate the federal medical savings account (MSA) program enacted by Congress in 1996. An agency that sets all rates hospitals may charge for medical services , regardless of supply and demand. Prices bear little or no relation to market forces. Under this rate-setting system, a hospital in Prince George's County charged $13,434 for an angioplasty in 1994 while one in Baltimore charged only $4,492. HEALTH CARE SPENDING Maryland ranks 1st among the states in Medicaid payment per child and adult beneficiary, 7th in spending on physicians' services, and 11th in spending on miscellaneous medical services. Yet its health care initiatives have done little to expand the availability of health insurance. The number of uninsured persons has climbed from approximately 570,000 in 1992 to over 700,000 today. The cost of uncompensated care reached $408.1 million in 1996 and is climbing still. And contrary to the claims of supporters of the health care regulatory system, recent figures indicate the system is not controlling hospital costs effectively. In 1996, the cost of a hospital stay increased by 4.5 percent, compared with a national average of 2.3 percent. During the second half of 1997, under the state's complicated price-fixing system, Maryland's hospitals saw their profits cut in half; 15 of the state's 52 hospitals lost money. A BETTER SYSTEM Excellent medical care, increased access, and a return in value for investment can be achieved only by sound policies that rely less on bureaucratic regulation and more on consumer choice and price competition. Legislators across the United States can learn what not to do by examining Maryland's efforts to micromanage health care through a burgeoning bureaucracy. Instead of adding more mandates and rules to an already top-heavy regulatory structure, state legislators should focus on policies that improve health care opportunities for workers and their families. Specifically, they should: 1. Promote personal ownership and portability of health insurance by giving tax credits to middle-income workers and vouchers to low-income workers. 2. Protect the confidentiality of patient records to ensure that no personal information is transmitted to any public or private entity without a patient's consent. 3. Reduce costs and replace benefit mandates with solid catastrophic coverage. 4. Eliminate outdated regulations and dismantle unnecessary bureaucratic programs. If health care access and affordability are genuine goals, a far better approach would be to empower individuals and families to make health care choices that suit their own needs, restore the independence and integrity of the medical profession, and force insurance companies to compete for consumers' dollars. The health care delivery system at all levels should be accountable directly to the individuals and families being served. -Dale Snyder is a Severna Park, Maryland, consultant specializing in issues related to health care and labor and employment.

https://borgenproject.org/health-care-education-to-all/,,Where There Is No Doctor : Providing Health Care Education to All,20240613T160000Z,https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Health-Care-Education.jpg,borgenproject.org,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"For more than 50 years, Hesperian Health Guides has provided health care education to remote communities, aiming to address and reduce the global health disparity. The Scarcity of Health Care With advances in technology and medicine contributing to the increase of global life expectancy, there remains a persistent disparity in access to quality health care between higher and lower-income countries. According to a 2020 study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is only one doctor for every 3,324 people in Africa. In contrast, in Europe, there is one doctor for every 293 people. The varied distribution of people versus health care workers highlights the scarcity of adequate health care in some regions of the world. To achieve universal health coverage, organizations like Hesperian Health Guides are providing health care education to rural areas where there is little to no access to doctors. Where There Is No Doctor Following his experience of working at Project Piaxtla, a primary health care program operated by disabled village health workers in western Mexico, David Werner wrote and published “ Where There Is No Doctor (Donde No Hay Doctor)” alongside his colleague Jane Maxwell. It is the first health care manual to consider the people of low-income and rural settings. Originally published in Spanish, “Where There Is No Doctor” explained complex health topics in a comprehensible language. Since the 1973 publication of “Where There Is No Doctor,” Hesperian Health Guides has issued more than 40 titles to 221 countries. Its books, which have been translated into more than 85 languages, explain topics such as general health, women’s health, children’s health, environmental health, disabilities, health rights and advocacy and more. With each book taking about four to 10 years to complete, the nonprofit continuously updates and revises its handbooks. Making a Global Impact Pivotal stakeholders in global public health commend the accuracy, accessibility and clarity of Hesperian Health Guides. For example, since the ’80s, every Peace Corps volunteer has been supplied with copies of Hesperian handbooks. Through donations, the Hesperian distributes its books to various community health workers, including missionaries, midwives, teachers, community organizers, nonprofit organizations, health educators and government agencies. Each stakeholder utilizes the Hesperian Health Guides to address the health concerns of their community while actively reducing the global health disparity. According to its 2023 annual report, Hesperian Health Guides has helped about 2,700,000 people . For those with access to the internet, the organization’s free HealthWiki has been providing health care education to more than 36 million people since the website’s launch in 2011. Conclusion With the recent decrease in access to essential health services, global health inequalities persist. Vulnerable populations with low levels of access to health care suffer the most as they are exposed to more health risks. Efforts to increase equitable access to health care are crucial to reducing the global health disparity. By providing health care education to rural communities, Hesperian Health Guides addresses global public health inequities in an effort to better the personal, community and environmental health of all. – Naima Rasheed Naima is based in New York, NY, USA and focuses on Good News, Global Health for The Borgen Project.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 13, 2024, 07:45am EDT Share Save By Brian Fugere, Chief Product Officer at symplr . getty The role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in healthcare has garnered considerable attention in recent years. From clinical documentation to remote patient monitoring, AI/ML technology is finding a foothold in nearly every part of healthcare’s digital transformation. Originally focused in clinical areas, healthcare’s digital transformation has expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic to include addressing growing operational and workforce challenges. That expansion shows no signs of slowing down, and the global healthcare AI market is expected to be valued at $427.5 billion by 2032 as innovations such as personalized medicine, predictive analytics, and the demand for more efficient, convenient patient care continue to evolve and shape market dynamics. I find there is exciting near-term potential for an AI/ML-fueled transformation in healthcare operations and, by extension, patient safety and experience. I believe those in healthcare can learn from how other industries have integrated AI/ML and, through strategic implementation, streamline and automate operations to address some of the most pressing pain points they face today. Pressing Healthcare Challenges Primed For AI/ML Solutions Today, healthcare organizations and frontline caregivers have become increasingly burdened with managing complex workflows and administrative tasks. From staff schedule creation and conflict resolution to administrative duties like charting, clinicians and nurses often find themselves bogged down by manual, repetitive tasks that consume valuable time and resources. A study conducted by the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) found 60% to 80% of nurse managers’ time is spent on recruitment, staffing and scheduling. I see caregivers spending too much time on non-value-added tasks contribute to crippling levels of clinician burnout and an ongoing clinician shortage. In fact, a survey of healthcare IT leaders by my company revealed that workforce challenges are the number one threat faced by healthcare organizations in 2024. While it’s important to continue to invest in solutions to address clinician burnout and bring more trained caregivers into the field, I believe the fastest way to start addressing workforce challenges is by making their day-to-day easier. McKinsey & Company recently published a report showing that 10% to 20% of nurses’ time during a 12-hour shift is spent on ""activities that could be optimized through tech enablement."" The report estimates that by simply reducing the burden of mundane tasks, investments in technology and workflow design could potentially reduce the nursing workforce shortage by as many as 300,000 inpatient nurses. Learning From Other Industries Improving Workflows With AI/ML One of the ways in which I'm seeing AI/ML pick up steam in healthcare is by drawing inspiration from other industries that have benefitted from AI/ML technology. For example, the manufacturing industry is using AI/ML capabilities to create more efficient workflows for production and assembly to cut costs. In addition, companies are using AI/ML to automate and streamline operational IT workflows to both improve their current business processes and create more sustainable IT systems. The healthcare industry can apply these learnings from other industries to similarly optimize workflows. For instance, AI/ML-powered technology can be used to augment supply chain sourcing and inventory management. It can also help health systems manage contracts by detecting auto-renewals for services that may no longer be needed and reducing redundancies, especially following a merger or acquisition when it’s common to end up with duplicate services. Another specific AI/ML technology from manufacturing that can be adapted for healthcare workflows is predictive maintenance. Similar to how manufacturing plants use AI algorithms to predict equipment failures before they occur, healthcare facilities can leverage predictive analytics to forecast equipment maintenance needs in advance. By implementing predictive maintenance solutions, healthcare organizations can reduce unplanned downtime, minimize disruptions to patient care and extend the lifespan of expensive medical equipment. However, healthcare leaders must consider several unique challenges when adopting solutions from other industries. Unlike manufacturing, healthcare environments are highly regulated with stringent data privacy and security requirements. Additionally, healthcare workflows often involve complex decision-making processes and interdependencies among various stakeholders, which may not always align with off-the-shelf solutions designed for other sectors. Strategically Harnessing AI/ML As we continue navigating the complexities of the modern healthcare environment, we can expect to see AI’s influence expand as more healthcare organizations look for opportunities to innovate and improve operations. Yet, as organizations embrace the potential of AI-driven solutions, they must remain vigilant in ensuring ethical use, data security and regulatory compliance. By harnessing the power of AI responsibly and strategically, we can unlock new possibilities for improved healthcare delivery and, ultimately, improve outcomes for patients worldwide. Whether it's automating appointment scheduling, optimizing staff scheduling or streamlining billing processes, the right AI/ML-powered tools can help drive efficiency and productivity to pave the way for a more efficient and patient-centered healthcare ecosystem.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., introduced legislation Tuesday, June 11, 2024 aimed at warding off future cases of ""corporate greed"" in the health care landscape (State House News Service photo). State House News Service By John L. Micek | jmicek@masslive.com (*This story was updated at 3:57 p.m. on Tuesday, June 11, 2024 with additional reporting.) With Steward Health Care plunged into bankruptcy, one Massachusetts lawmaker says she has a plan to make sure it doesn’t happen again. With a Steward-owned facility in Brighton as her backdrop, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday pitched legislation, dubbed the "" Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act ,” that would hit violators with jail time, and give state attorneys general and the U.S Justice Department more tools to fight the improper corporate exploitation of health care. “When private equity gets hold of health care systems, it is literally a matter of life and death, so if you drive a hospital like Steward into bankruptcy, putting patients and communities at risk, you should face real consequences,” Warren said in a statement. Dallas-based Steward, which owns eight facilities in Massachusetts, filed for bankruptcy in early May . The company has since said it plans to sell its hospitals, as it looks to pay off tens of millions of dollars in debt . Warren, joined by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, her fellow Bay State Democrat, has been sharply critical of Steward’s operations under its CEO, Dr. Ralph de la Torre . Read More: Steward CEO tells employees bankruptcy filing will not have ‘negative impact’ “What Dr. de la Torre, Cerberus Capital Management, and Medical Properties Trust did to Steward-owned hospitals in Massachusetts and across the country is unforgivable. They promised to improve health care, but instead traded lives and livelihoods for profit,” Markey said. “Private equity firms and their enablers will continue to steal from America’s health care system to feed their corporate greed unless we stop them. We need guardrails now to guarantee CEO wealth doesn’t come before the public’s health.” As it’s currently written, the legislation would: “Create a new criminal penalty of up to 6 years in prison for executives who “loot health care entities” such as nursing homes and hospitals , if that looting results in a patient’s death;” “Provide state attorneys general and the DOJ with the power to claw back—and return to the health care company—all compensation, including salaries, issued to private equity and portfolio company executives within 10 years before or after an acquired health care firm experiences serious, avoidable financial difficulties due to that looting;” ● “Authorize an associated civil penalty of up to 5 times the clawback amount,” ● “Prohibit payments from federal health programs to entities that sell assets or use assets for a loan collateral made to a real estate investment trust (REIT); repeal a rule in the Tax Code that allows taxable REIT subsidiaries to invest in the operation of health care entities; and remove the 20 percent pass-through deduction, passed in the 2017 Trump tax cuts, for all REIT investors,” ● “Require health care providers receiving federal funding to publicly report mergers, acquisitions, changes in ownership and control, and financial data, including debt and debt-to-earnings ratios,” and ● “Mandate a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report to Congress on moral injury in health care,” Warren’s office said in its statement. “The crisis at Steward health care illustrates the risks of allowing private equity and corporate America to play financial games with our public health care dollars. Hospitals become real-estate investments, clinicians become financial assets, and patients suffer the consequences when a risky investment scheme goes south,” Hayden Rooke-Ley, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington D.C-based think tank, said in the joint statement. In a statement, a spokesperson for an industry group accused Warren and Markey of “political opportunism” with their proposal. “America’s health care system faces incredible challenges – no matter how local facilities are funded. Private equity in Massachusetts helps develop cures, supports urgent care facilities, and improves access for patients,” Drew Maloney, the president and CEO of the American Investment Council, said, noting that Warren’s bill “is a purely political attack – not a real solution that will help patients, providers, and hospitals.” Did LaMar Cook have a political patron for gov.’s aide job?

California Legislature Passes Bill Raising Minimum Wages ( UPDATED ) | Seyfarth Shaw LLP,20240611T173000Z,https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15521_4328.jpg,jdsupra.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"June 11, 2024 Paging Healthcare Workers! California Legislature Passes Bill Raising Minimum Wages (UPDATED) Jonathan Brophy , Parnian Vafaeenia Seyfarth Shaw LLP + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook X Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: Update: On May 31, 2024, Governor Newsom passed S.B. 828, which delays implementation of S.B. 525, the health care minimum wage law signed by Governor Newsom on October 13, 2023. S.B. 828 delays all of the minimum wage adjustments in S.B. 525 by one month. This means that S.B. 525, which was set to take effect on June 1, 2024, will instead take effect on July 1, 2024. It further means that the minimum wage increases scheduled to take place after 2024 will take place on July 1, rather than June 1, of each year. Seyfarth Synopsis: On September 14, 2023, the California legislature passed S.B. 525 , which will raise minimum wages for health care workers across the state. The bill includes five separate minimum wage schedules for covered health care employees depending on the nature, size, and structure of the employer’s business. Unless Governor Newsom vetoes the bill (which is not expected), the bill will take effect on June 1, 2024. Grey’s Anatomy might be set in Seattle, but now it’s all eyes on California’s health care workers. Starting June 1, 2024, S.B. 525 will raise minimum wages for health care workers across the state to a minimum of $18 per hour, or up to $23 per hour, depending on the applicable wage schedule, and based on the nature, size, and structure of an employer’s operations. From Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital To The Denny Duquette Clinic – Most Health Care Employers Are Covered The bill’s provisions will apply to “Covered Health Care Employers,” as that term is defined under the soon-to-be newly added Labor Code sections 1182.14 and 1182.15, including: Hospitals: licensed general acute care hospitals, licensed acute psychiatric hospitals, and other special hospitals. Clinics: specialty care clinics, dialysis clinics, community clinics, psychology clinics, government run clinics, rural health clinics, and urgent care clinics. Psychiatric and Mental Health Facilities: mental health rehabilitation centers, county mental health facilities, and psychiatric health facilities. Licensed Skilled Nursing Facilities: including those that are owned, operated, or controlled by a hospital or integrated health care delivery system or health care system. Home Health Care: including licensed home health agencies and a patient’s home when health care services are delivered by an entity owned or operated by a general acute care hospital or acute psychiatric hospital. Licensed Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly Integrated Health Care Delivery System Work Sites Ambulatory Surgical Centers Certified for Medicare Participation Physician Groups County Correctional Facilities Providing Health Care Services The term “Covered Health Care Employers” expressly excludes: (1) hospitals owned, controlled, or operated by the State Department of State Hospitals; (2) tribal clinics exempt from licensure; and (3) outpatient settings conducted, maintained, or operated by a federally recognized Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization. The Scrub Nurse, The Chief, And More Are Included The term “covered health care employee” is also defined broadly under both the new Labor Code section 1182.14 and section 1182.15 to include employees who provide patient care, health care services, or services supporting the provision of health care. Examples span from nurses and physicians to clerical workers, gift shop workers, janitors, schedulers, and billing personnel. Contracted and subcontracted employees are also included if they: Perform contracted or subcontracted work primarily on the premises of a health care facility to provide health care services or services supporting the provision of health care; Are employed by an employer that contracts with the health care facility employer, or with a contractor or subcontractor to the health care facility employer, to provide health care services, or services supporting the provision of health care; or Perform work for a health care facility employer that directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other person, exercises control over the employee’s wages, hours or working conditions. Covered Health Care Employees will be able to enforce their rights under this new law through civil action, in the same manner they can currently enforce other minimum wage requirements. The Anatomy Of Employers’ Minimum Wage Obligations The bill includes five separate minimum wage schedules, but the minimum wage rates set forth under two of these schedules are identical. Thus, Covered Health Care Employers will fall within one of the four following groups: 1. Group 1: Covered health care facilities with 10,000 or more full-time equivalent employees, covered health care facility employers that are part of an integrated health care delivery system or health care system with 10,000 or more full-time equivalent employees, covered dialysis clinics, and covered health facilities that are owned, affiliated, or operated by a county with a population of more than 5,000,000 as of January 1, 2023. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025: $23 per hour. June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2026: $24 per hour. June 1, 2026 to August 1, 2027: $25 per hour. 2. Group 2: Covered hospitals with high populations of Medicare/Medicaid patients, covered rural independent health care facilities, and covered health care facilities that are owned, affiliated or operated by a county with a population of less than 250,000 as of January 1, 2023. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2033: $18 per hour with 3.5 percent increases annually. June 1, 2033 to August 1, 2034: $25 per hour. 3. Group 3: Covered primary care community or free clinics that are open for limited services of no more than 40 hours a week and that are not conducted or maintained by a government entity, covered community clinics along with any associated intermittent clinics exempt from licensure, covered rural health clinics, and covered urgent care clinics that are owned by or affiliated with a community clinic. June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026: $21 per hour. June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2027: $22 per hour. June 1, 2027 to August 1, 2028: $25 per hour. 4. Group 4: all other covered health care facilities June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2026: $21 per hour. June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2028: $23 per hour. June 1, 2028 to August 1, 2029: $25 per hour. Following these minimum wage increases, the Director of Finance will calculate an adjusted minimum wage on or before August 1 of the following year, and on or before each August 1 thereafter – seemingly in perpetuity. The calculation will increase the minimum wage by 3.5% or the rate of change in the averages for the U.S. Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers , whichever is lower. Even The New Residents Might Be Entitled To A Salary Increase Notably, the minimum wage requirements summarized above will impact a Covered Health Care Employer’s exempt California employees as well, to the extent those employees qualify as Covered Health Care Employees. These employees will have to earn a monthly salary equivalent to no less than: (1) 150% of the applicable health care worker minimum wage or (2) 200% of the State’s generally-applicable minimum wage—whichever is greater—for full-time employment in order to qualify as exempt under California’s laws. Any Other Changes Next Season? In one small piece of consolation to employers, the new legislation provides that no city, county, city and county, including charter cities, charter counties, or charter cities and counties can enact any ordinance, regulation, or administrative action relating to wages or compensation for Covered Health Care Employees before January 1, 2034. So, at least local ordinances won’t be weighing Covered Health Care Employers down and requiring complicated and varied compliance. Workplace Solutions Health care employers should reach out to the authors or your favorite Seyfarth attorney for solutions and recommendations on addressing compliance with the new Labor Code sections 1182.14 and 1182.15 before June 1, 2024.

Supplied Dubai: Dubai Health Authority conducted 615 inspections during the first quarter of this year. Of these inspections, 70 per cent were conducted remotely via the ‘Rased’ smart system for licensing and smart inspection of health facilities. The Rased system, linked to the Sheryan system, enables health inspectors to instantly assess the status, type, classification, licensing, tasks, and compliance of healthcare facilities in line with Dubai Health Authority’s approved licensing conditions. Faris Al Mazmi, Director of the Clinical Audit and Control Department at DHA’s Health Regulation Sector emphasised the Authority’s support for the private medical sector, positioning it as a strategic partner to uphold exceptional services, adhere to health requirements, and enhance competitiveness regionally and globally as a vital sector attracting medical tourism. Smart licensing Al Mazmi explained that the Rased system for smart licensing and inspection of healthcare facilities in Dubai is based on cutting-edge technologies and smart solutions employed by the Authority to accelerate stakeholder service, enhance operational efficiency and performance. It follows a methodology that upholds the best standards and quality practices in alignment with the Authority’s commitment to values of accountability, transparency, flexibility, innovation, and a focus on human-centric healthcare services. 5,000 healthcare facilities He pointed out that the Rased system, which covers over 5,000 healthcare facilities in Dubai and approximately 60,000 healthcare professionals, actively contributes to streamlining data management through visual smart solutions. These solutions enable the Authority’s staff to communicate with relevant individuals in healthcare facilities to provide the required service or conduct inspections. He emphasised the system’s importance in documenting and saving time and effort by expediting work processes, where transactions are completed within one day instead of five working days as previously seen in field inspections. Private medical sector Al Mazmi praised the cooperation of the private medical sector in the emirate, their adherence to Authority-approved licensing standards and conditions, and their alignment with global developments in the healthcare sector. This enhances the strength and resilience of Dubai’s healthcare system, solidifying the emirate’s position as an ideal destination for seekers of medical treatment, recovery and well-being.

Δ The PYMNTS Intelligence report “ Small Business Real-Time Payments Barometer: Healthcare Edition ” found that 38% of healthcare provider SMBs said real-time rails are their preferred payment methodology. Another 28% also issued real-time payments last year but noted the process was not their preferred way to send money. The report, which was based on surveys with 646 healthcare providers generating less than $10 million in annual revenue, found that SMBs in the healthcare-provider segment now use real-time payment rails more widely than other forms of payment. In the last year, 83% of the businesses surveyed either sent or received real-time payments, while 57% used real-time rails for payments moving in both directions. In the last 12 months, around two-thirds of healthcare provider SMBs used real-time methodologies ( which can include debit cards, instant PayPal and pay-by-bank), making real-time options collectively more popular than other leading payment methods. Credit cards were the second-most popular, used by 55% of healthcare provider SMBs to send money, followed by checks, which were used by 42% of the organizations surveyed. Meanwhile, legacy methods such as ACH transfers (34%) and wire transfers (8%) retain traction in the market. Four in 10 healthcare provider SMBs identified a real-time payment rail as their most used form of payment — more than twice the shares that said credit cards or checks — highlighting a preference for instant settlement in the healthcare space. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue A variety of real-time payment options have become healthcare-industry SMBs’ go-to. In the lead is pay-by-bank, which 15% of healthcare provider SMBs said is their most used payment method. PayPal comes in second at 13%. Just 6.3% of healthcare providers use debit cards the most; last year, debit cards were used 41% of the time . The shift suggests that debit cards may be losing their appeal to healthcare provider SMBs, perhaps now serving more as a backup payment rail and alternative to credit cards. Going forward , real-time payments are expected to continue to gain traction with healthcare provider SMBs. Eighty-three percent of businesses surveyed said they have at least moderate interest in receiving real-time payments in the next year, while 68% said they are very or extremely interested. When it comes to sending money, 82% have moderate interest, while 64% are very or extremely interested.

https://www.kevinmd.com/2024/06/unveiling-the-unseen-the-hidden-costs-of-health-care-associated-infections.html,,Unveiling the unseen : the hidden costs of health care - associated infections,20240609T193000Z,https://www.kevinmd.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_139022972-21.jpg,kevinmd.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Share Tweet Share Many aspects of health care-associated infections are unseen. The bacteria that cause infections like C. difficile or catheter-associated urinary tract infections are invisible to the naked eye. Beyond the financial burdens of additional treatment and longer hospital stays, less obvious costs often fall below the radar in the form of suffering, distress, and shattered trust in the health care system when patients fall victim to preventable infections. And, often low profile and behind the scenes, health care epidemiologists and infection preventionists lead the prevention efforts against health care-associated infections. Health care epidemiologists are crucial to the safe functioning of every hospital and health system and should be considered valuable allies to the C-suite. These professionals investigate pathogens and the workflow processes of health care personnel to uncover hidden reservoirs of bacteria and paths of transmission. They work with a multidisciplinary team to identify threats before they spread. This includes working with engineers and plumbers to prevent outbreaks from microbes hiding in sink traps. They also support operations and staff at all levels to ensure hand hygiene supplies are accessible and health care personnel follow the policies and processes for hand hygiene. They work closely with housekeeping and environmental services to ensure microbes do not spread from high-touch surfaces such as bedrails and doorknobs to patients, visitors, and staff. Health care-associated infections cost the U.S. health care system billions of dollars every year. In our rapidly evolving health care landscape, with fast-paced technological innovations, the prevention of health care-associated infections remains one of the most pressing and overlooked challenges. Infections acquired within a health care setting pose a significant threat to patient well-being and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial burdens impacting not only individual patients but their families and communities. While the costs of health care-associated infections are well-documented, prevention yields undeniable financial savings as well as patient and societal benefits. For example, urinary tract infections linked to catheter use are one of the most common and costly preventable infections in health care. Patients grappling with catheter-associated urinary tract infections may experience prolonged physical suffering and emotional distress. They require additional treatments and longer hospital stays, and their trust in the health care system can be shattered, influencing future health care-seeking behavior. Multidrug-resistant organisms introduce another layer of complexity. For a patient who contracts an antibiotic-resistant strain while hospitalized, the limited treatment options due to drug resistance extend the duration of illness and increase the likelihood of complications, compounding the full financial toll on the health care system and the physical and emotional toll on patients. Preventing health care-associated infections requires special training in infectious diseases, an understanding of microbes’ interactions with the host, and an understanding of how people—patients, visitors, and staff—intermingle within a health care facility’s built environment. Investing in a knowledgeable health care workforce that can bring prevention to every aspect of the health care operation is crucial. Health care professionals well-versed in principles and practices of infection control establish processes to remove or prevent the use of unnecessary medical devices, such as urinary catheters, that can cause infection; track down multidrug-resistant organisms, and teach everyone from nursing staff to cafeteria aides how to avoid spreading the bacteria that cause deadly infections. The time to invest in prevention isn’t when we are deep in a pandemic or reacting to a local outbreak, but instead when we are in our regular health care business status quo. Investing in outbreak prevention through health care epidemiology isn’t just about saving money; it’s about saving lives. When health care professionals are armed with the knowledge and expertise to prevent infections, they become a formidable barrier against the unseen costs of HAIs.

Article Insights Crowell & Moring LLP are most popular: within Insurance, Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Accounting and Audit topic(s) On April 18, 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS') Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) issued the Digital Healthcare Equity Framework (the Framework) to guide users and stakeholders to consider equity throughout the entire lifecycle when implementing digital healthcare solutions. AHRQ also released a separate implementation guide (the Guide) to outline best practices and examples to implement the Framework. The Framework's guiding principles provide a clear purpose for the Framework and development of its domains while the separate Guide provides actionable steps on how to implement the Framework. Digital healthcare developers and vendors, health systems, health plans, and clinical providers should review the Framework and Guide to assess equity during each phase of the digital healthcare lifecycle for digital health technologies. Specifically, the Framework recommends that these stakeholders should consider the Framework's principles and recommendations to address the accessibility, purpose, security, privacy features, usability, and safety concerns applying to digital solutions. The Framework According to AHRQ, although there are considerable opportunities for digital healthcare technologies, substantial disparities due to race, ethnicity, geographic location and socioeconomic status still exist in access to and utilization of healthcare services. To advance digital health equity and ensure that disadvantaged communities are not left behind, the Framework has been designed to specify the aspects that need to be considered in this systematic and intentional approach to digital healthcare equity. This consensus-based Framework was prepared by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University for AHRQ based on review of existing literature and interviews with technical experts. The Framework is designed as a tool to help users and other stakeholders intentionally consider equity during each phase of the digital healthcare lifecycle: 1) the planning and development phases (e.g., for digital healthcare developers and vendors); 2) the acquisition phase (e.g., for a health plan); and 3) the implementation/maintenance and monitoring/improvement/equity assessment phases (e.g., for health systems or provider practices). Additionally, the Framework addresses three domains, including Patient and Community Characteristics, Health System Characteristics, and Health Information Technology Characteristics, with eight subdomains. The Framework outlines six principles: Ensure digital healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies ameliorate, not exacerbate, inequities; Represent equity through person-centeredness; Encourage inclusivity and participatory creation of digital healthcare solutions; Support effective implementation in diverse settings; Ensure specific attention to policy/regulatory relevance or impact of the proposed solutions; and Focus on impact and outcomes for patients, health systems, and communities. The Guide Published separately from the Framework, the Guide provides a step-by-step path for users, including digital healthcare developers and vendors, health systems, health plans, and clinical providers, who want to implement the Framework. The Guide includes general recommendations that organizations should adopt to start on the path toward equity in digital healthcare solutions, including focusing on organizational readiness (e.g., by performing an organization self-assessment); identifying an equity champion to help develop a business model and assess the economic sustainability and impact of the equity intentionality approach; developing a diverse workforce; ensuring that equity assessments and feedback loops are built in to processes related to healthcare solutions that involve digital technologies; and tracking equity as part of organizational metrics. We have outlined specific recommendations in the below table. Stakeholders (Digital Healthcare Lifecycle Stage) Recommendations Digital Healthcare Developers and Vendors (Planning and Development Phases) Identify and engage potential users of the digital healthcare solution, particularly those in historically marginalized demographic groups, to ensure it will meet the needs of the intended audience. Understand the cultural characteristics and beliefs of the communities for which a digital healthcare solution is proposed to identify potential barriers to using the proposed solution.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 06, 2024, 09:00am EDT Share Save CEO of KMS Lighthouse . Leading the company's vision to disrupt the knowledge management market. getty In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare technology, ensuring patient safety remains a paramount concern. By harnessing innovative technologies such as AI, data analytics and digital health platforms, healthcare providers can implement robust knowledge management (KM) systems to capture, disseminate and apply critical insights. I'll explore how technology-enabled initiatives empower healthcare teams to identify adverse events, implement evidence-based practices and foster a culture of continuous learning. At a time when healthcare providers must thoroughly serve their patients' needs while protecting their personal information, technologies like electronic health records (EHRs), clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and telemedicine are enhancing patient safety practices. Knowledge management is critical in making these technologies effective by streamlining access to up-to-date medical knowledge, evidence-based guidelines and patient data, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, reduce errors and improve outcomes. Hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices owe it to their patients and themselves to leverage every available tool to uphold the highest standards of care. I'll explore the dynamic relationship between KM and healthcare technologies, delving into the transformative impact their integration is having on creating cultures of continuous learning and quality improvement while safeguarding patient well-being in the digital age. Knowledge management’s role in healthcare technology improves the creation, sharing and application of knowledge to support patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes. Over the years, it has evolved to include the following. Electronic Health Records Before: Patient records were primarily paper-based, making it challenging to share information across different healthcare providers and settings and increasing the risk of medical errors due to incomplete or unavailable patient information. Today: EHRs have digitized patient records, allowing healthcare professionals to access comprehensive patient information, including medical histories, test results and prescribed medications, from any authorized location. Communication, coordination and decision-making are improved , and the likelihood of medical errors is reduced. Clinical Decision Support Systems Before: Healthcare professionals relied heavily on individual knowledge and experience, which could result in clinical practice variations and potential oversights. Today: CDSS integrates evidence-based guidelines, best practices and patient-specific data to provide real-time alerts, reminders and recommendations to healthcare professionals, ensuring they adhere to standardized protocols while reducing the risk of medication errors, adverse drug interactions and other preventable mistakes. Knowledge Repositories And Expert Systems Before: Medical knowledge was primarily stored in textbooks, journals and the collective experience of healthcare professionals, making it more challenging to consistently access and apply the latest research and best practices. Today: Healthcare organizations use knowledge repositories and expert systems to consolidate and disseminate up-to-date medical knowledge, clinical guidelines and best practices. This means that healthcare professionals have easier access to the latest evidence-based information to enhance treatment effectiveness. Telemedicine And Remote Monitoring Before: Patients in remote or underserved areas had limited access to specialized healthcare services, increasing the risk of delayed diagnoses and suboptimal treatment. Today: Telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies enable healthcare professionals to monitor and provide care to patients remotely, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of specialists across geographical borders. Access to high-quality care is improved , bridging the gap between remote and centralized healthcare and reducing the risk of complications due to delayed interventions. Continuing Medical Education (CME) And E-Learning Before: Healthcare professionals relied heavily on in-person training and seminars to stay current with the latest medical knowledge and best practices—an often time-consuming and logistically challenging endeavor. Today: Online CME platforms and e-learning resources provide convenient access to educational materials, allowing providers to continuously enhance their knowledge and skills. This, in turn, helps ensure they’re equipped with the latest knowledge when making decisions on a patient’s healthcare options. By using an integrated knowledge approach, healthcare providers can create, share and apply institutional knowledge to promote evidence-based practices, standardize care protocols and empower medical professionals with the information they need to optimize patient care outcomes. Three Ways Technology Is Improving Patient Safety Many researchers claim that medical error is the third-leading cause of death in the U.S., often due to poor communication, a lack of access to comprehensive patient data and best practice deviations. Healthcare providers can improve patient care by investing in innovative technologies and implementing a robust knowledge management system. 1. Artificial Intelligence: AI’s predictive capabilities enable providers to offer proactive, preventative care that improves outcomes and reduces costs. In hospitals, AI-powered clinical decision support systems integrate evidence-based guidelines, best practices and patient-specific data to provide healthcare professionals with real-time reminders and recommendations. For instance, AI systems can analyze a patient's medical history, current medications and lab results and then alert physicians to potential adverse drug interactions or contraindications , reducing the risk of medication errors. 2. Data Analytics: Advanced healthcare analytics can potentially revolutionize the medical sector . Clinics can use data analytics tools to identify patterns and trends in patient data, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and improve care processes. For example, by analyzing patient outcomes data, a clinic can identify risk factors for certain conditions and tailor preventive care strategies accordingly. 3. Digital Healthcare Platforms: These online services moved to the forefront during the pandemic. Today, doctors' offices can use telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to leverage knowledge management systems and provide patients with access to specialized care and expertise, regardless of geographic location. For instance, a rural-based primary care physician might consult with a major medical center specialist, sharing patient data and medical records through a secure digital platform, ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment for a patient. Every patient deserves a healthcare provider they can trust to keep them safe. When finding the right information at the right time can literally save lives, it’s crucial for the healthcare sector to implement solutions that facilitate timely access to accurate medical knowledge, evidence-based guidelines and patient data. Knowledge is capital for the healthcare industry, and information technology can have a significant impact on patient safety. Healthcare-focused knowledge management systems align people, data and technologies to provide patients with secure environments where informed decisions can be made to prevent errors and improve the quality of care—a win-win for patients and providers.

The Health Minister said a multifaceted approach has been adopted to address these challenges. “Rest assured, we are committed to tackling these issues with utmost seriousness and pledge to strengthen our strategies wherever and whenever necessary,” he said in a statement on Thursday (June 6). Taking note of the various issues faced by healthcare workers including burnout, which has been constantly highlighted in the press, Dzulkefly said that healthcare staff are invaluable assets and deserve comprehensive support. He noted from the World Health Assembly that countries around the world are facing significant healthcare challenges. “In a 2023 testimony to their House of Representatives, officials admitted that the Philippines was facing a shortage of over 114,000 physicians and 127,000 nurses. ""Unfortunately, there is no quick fix to this problem of human resources. Furthermore, we fully agree with the urgent need for a cultural shift and making the well-being of our healthcare workforce a priority."" Dzulkefly said this includes fostering a healthier work-life balance and a fair compensation structure. “The Health Ministry is earnestly revisiting longstanding practices, such as excessively long on-call hours,” he added. The ministry's mitigation measures include optimising patient distribution through hospital clustering; exploring public-private partnerships for outsourcing services; mobilising staff to high-demand departments; and extending operating hours at health clinics to reduce strain on hospitals. Workforce gaps are also being identified through a ""supply and demand"" survey conducted in collaboration with the World Bank. ""While we hope for an expansion of our human resources, our financial resources are admittedly constrained. Therefore, among other measures, we introduced 'contract for service' or 'contract doctors' in 2016. “Addressing these constraints will require critical reforms and a financing strategy to build a sustainable and resilient healthcare system. We are now undertaking these reforms earnestly. “To our dedicated healthcare professionals, we ask for your patience as we navigate this critical transformative journey. Your understanding and continued contributions are deeply appreciated as we work towards positive change. “Let us maintain an open dialogue as we progress together,” he added. A recent ad hoc poll by the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) found that only 5% of healthcare facilities operate with adequate staffing levels. Regarding the factors contributing to staffing shortages, nearly half (48.3%) of the 117 respondents cited doctors resigning (28.8%) or being transferred (13.6%) as key reasons. Healthcare advocates warn that the apparent inability of workers to cope may further exacerbate the manpower shortage in the healthcare sector.

Guidance, in the form of updated FAQs, indicate that all affected covered entities may delegate HIPAA notice obligations to Change Healthcare. This Holland & Knight alert is part of our continuing ""OCR in Overdrive"" series focused on emerging regulatory developments at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the impact on patient privacy and data security requirements for healthcare providers and their business associates. After months of uncertainty and multiple letters from industry associations advocating on behalf of the healthcare industry with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR), covered entities with protected health information affected by the February 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare now have some clarity regarding Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) breach notice obligations. OCR announced on May 31, 2024, that its Change Healthcare FAQs have been updated to indicate that all affected covered entities may delegate HIPAA notice obligations to Change Healthcare. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, "" What HIPAA Security Rule Surprises Await Healthcare Providers for the Second Half of 2024? ,"" May 13, 2024.) FAQ Highlights OCR provided a summary of key FAQ updates: Covered entities affected by the Change Healthcare breach may delegate to Change Healthcare the tasks of providing the required HIPAA breach notifications on their behalf. Only one entity – which could be the covered entity itself or Change Healthcare – needs to complete breach notifications to affected individuals, HHS and, where applicable, the media. If covered entities work with Change Healthcare to perform the required breach notifications in a manner consistent with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, they would not have additional HIPAA breach notification obligations. Although the OCR's position alleviates covered entities' obligations and costs associated with providing HIPAA breach notice, including notice to OCR, it does not remove all obligations. As noted in the FAQs, covered entities remain obligated to assure that notices issued by Change Healthcare comply with the Breach Notification Rule (45 C.F.R. 164.404 and 408) obligations with regard to timing, content and form. There has been some debate in the industry regarding when the ""clock starts ticking"" on the 60-day notice deadline. OCR has cleared up that question by stating in its FAQ, in bold, that "" OCR will not consider the 60-calendar day period from discovery of a breach by a covered entity to start until affected covered entities have received the information needed from Change Healthcare or UHG. "" (UHG refers to UnitedHealth Group, which acquired Change Healthcare in 2022.) Business associates, such as electronic medical record vendors and other companies that contract with Change Healthcare for services that are then provided to a covered entity, also benefit from this OCR FAQ update. OCR has made it clear that only one entity is required to provide notice and that Change Healthcare's notice, to the extent delegated by covered entities, is sufficient. What Now? Covered entities and business associates affected by the Change Healthcare cyberattack should take the steps below following the publication of the updated FAQs: HIPAA-regulated entities that have relationships with Change Healthcare should contact their account administrators or other contacts to request information from Change Healthcare regarding notices. Covered entities should assess whether business associates serving the covered entity contracted with Change Healthcare for those services and, if so, contact those business associates to coordinate any breach response. Business associates that contract with Change Healthcare as HIPAA subcontractors should work with Change Healthcare to help ensure that Change Healthcare is providing any required notices. Covered entities should determine the dates by which Change Healthcare is required to provide notice beginning on the date that Change Healthcare (or a business associate contracting with Change Healthcare) provides notice of the breach to the covered entity. Covered entities should request copies of all notice drafts in order to review the timing, content and form, including Change Healthcare's mailed notice, OCR notice, media notice and substitute notice. State laws are NOT addressed in the OCR notice. Therefore, all affected organizations, both covered entities and business associates, should work with Change Healthcare to delegate state notice obligations, as applicable and permitted by state laws. Review business associate agreements with Change Healthcare and other suppliers to assess if amendment is warranted to assure that future breach notice and other obligations are clear. Privacy officers may consider registering for OCR's list-serv for email updates.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- In a world where healthcare can be a maze, a group of Rice University students is helping everyday people find their way. ""I spoke with doctors and found the true issue with facing healthcare wasn't just making sure the patients are able to live healthy lives, the actual conditions themselves, but in fact, navigating the healthcare insurance system,"" Arunima Jaiswal said. Jaiswal is one of nine women who created The Healthcare Navigator , an online platform to save patients time and money. Kayla Grimes is the Founder and President of the Houston-based startup. ""We give you the ability to actually measure the doctors and the hospital's performance and quality so that you can be assured that the care that you're going to is quality care. We also help with price transparency specifically."" Grimes said. Navigating the healthcare system alone can be overwhelming. According to the National Institutes of Health, 88% of Americans are health illiterate, meaning they struggle to understand the intricacies of their healthcare needs. Grimes knows the difficulty firsthand. In her five years working in the healthcare field, she saw the struggles patients-even her own grandmother-went through. ""Seeing her go through her medical issues and seeing the pitfalls and me helping her and guiding her through it, I knew that not everyone is lucky to have someone like that to tell them like, no, you don't wanna do that at all."" Grimes shared. The Healthcare Navigator has six features, including Cost Compass, which pulls and compares prices for procedures. Also, Pocket Doc, where you can find the best doctors that fit your needs. The creators worked with the National Patient Advocate Foundation to gather the data. ""You can filter for so many things so that you don't have to keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. Just put in what you want, and that's it,"" Grimes said. The Healthcare Navigator is offered to individuals for $15.99 a month. The service is also available to employers and schools looking to empower their employees and students.

Staff at the Kettering General Hospital, Leicester General Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Glenfield Hospital and Northampton General Hospital have begun three days of strike action. Leanne Weatherley, the Unison branch secretary at Kettering General Hospital, said she was ""standing in solidarity with fellow [healthcare assistants] who should be recognised and paid fairly"". Richard Mitchell, the chief executive of University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and University Hospitals of Northamptonshire NHS Group, which run all five hospitals, declined to comment. Kate Bradbrook/ BBC About 50 people were striking at the picket line outside the Kettering General Hospital According to NHS guidance, healthcare assistants on a band two salary of the organisation's pay scale should only be providing personal care, such as bathing and feeding patients. It is reported, however, that most of the healthcare assistants have routinely undertaken clinical tasks, such as performing electrocardiogram tests. Unison has campaigned for healthcare assistants to be regraded to a band three salary, and receive appropriate back pay for the clinical roles undertaken by them up to 2018. Unison East Midlands NHS staff striking on Tuesday said they were ""angry"" and want better recognition Ms Weatherly said: ""We are very angry... we are talking [about a] significant amount of money. ""Bosses are not negotiating and the deal they are offering doesn’t value the healthcare assistants. ""Our whole being is welfare of our patients. But, without recognising our staff we will be in trouble. The healthcare assistants are the backbone of the NHS."" Chris Jenkinson, Unison East Midlands regional secretary, said: “It’s time for the chief executive to realise these NHS workers are in no mood to back down. He should make the healthcare assistants a reasonable offer that addresses years of historical pay inequality.” The strike action is being held from 4 to 7 June from 07:00 BST to 14:30 each day.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 04, 2024, 08:30am EDT Share Save Founder and CEO of Insightly and a lifelong techie with a passion for all things startup. getty The world’s population is aging , and globally, the healthcare industry continues to rise to the challenge of serving this changing dynamic. The global healthcare market is expected to reach $780 billion by 2030, according to Verified Market Research. In just the U.S. alone, national healthcare expenditure reached $4.5 trillion in 2022, or $13,493 per person, per the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Advancements in healthcare technology will allow healthcare providers to improve efficiencies to serve the world’s needs. I think leaders in the tech space have an obligation to our global community to take the lead and continue to innovate with this vertical in mind. As a tech CEO, I feel compelled to do my part as both a consumer of healthcare and driver of innovation to help sustain the world’s healthcare infrastructure. I call on my fellow CEOs and leaders to do the same. Here’s how I believe that can show up in the daily operations of a technology company: Build with healthcare in mind. If you are creating products or services that are industry-agnostic, keep healthcare in the back of your mind. The healthcare industry is broad and has all sorts of permutations and combinations that most of us can’t even comprehend, but there are standard regulations that are in place for data security. For example, my business is in the CRM space, and we serve all types of verticals. However, we spent the extra time and effort to obtain HIPAA compliance for the platform. This way, our CRM is an option for companies in the healthcare space that need to hold and transmit data that is HIPAA-protected. Use your budgets and talents to innovate in the health space. Apple has wearable devices that track health vitals. Amazon has an online pharmacy. Google has the ability to use Bluetooth technology for contact tracing. Innovation costs a lot in both resources and money. Mega corporations often have the budgets to provide a runway for novel ideas to take shape. However, all sizes of tech companies attract amazing talent. When you see the possibility of an innovation in healthcare, take it and run with the idea. You never know who or what it could inspire next. Emerging tech companies are doing all sorts of things, such as making it easier to book medical appointments, innovating in hearing aids, improving billing processes and reducing paperwork. This work can be both lucrative and noble. Stay nimble. If the pandemic taught us anything, it was how the ability to adapt made a difference in the success and failure of a lot of companies. The tech industry’s quick response to go remote and help flatten the curve likely contributed greatly to controlling the spread of Covid-19. The rise of telemedicine also likely prevented many infections. We should continue to challenge ourselves to be ready for the next health-related event. Set the example with employee benefits. Even with a tumultuous couple of years, the tech industry continues to outpace many other industries in terms of salaries and benefits to its employees. As a tech employer, I want my company to do as much as possible to attract and retain the best people, so a great benefits package that includes excellent options for healthcare plans is a baseline for us. All tech companies that are able to should do the same to set the standard for other industries. I’m confident that the great minds of technology can support the health needs of our local and global communities. Even if you do not consider your business to be in or adjacent to the healthcare space, you can still do your part to contribute in any way possible to this defining vertical that impacts us all.

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will donate $1 million over the next three years to the Consortium of Florida Education Foundations (Consortium) to help fund its Career Pathways to a Healthier Florida program. The Career Pathways to a Healthier Florida program aims to help create and expand healthcare career pathways for underserved high school students across the state of Florida. “We are passionate about investing in the communities we serve and developing the next generation of healthcare leaders and professionals,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “It is important for us to work with the Consortium of Florida Education Foundations, which is deeply involved in communities across Florida, to expose students to opportunities available to create a fulfilling career in healthcare.” The Florida Chamber Foundation’s Workforce Needs Study estimates there to be a shortage of approximately 463,000 healthcare workers by the end of 2024 . Through the Career Pathways to a Healthier Florida program, the Consortium will develop and manage a grant process which allows local education foundations to apply for grant funds in support of local projects that foster healthcare career pathways. The program will fund 15 local education foundations in Florida over the next three years, focusing on activities that lead to nursing or allied health tracks and include work-based learning, healthcare career exploration activities and industry certifications. The Career Pathways to a Healthier Florida program grant is funded through the Healthier Tomorrow Fund, a community impact fund focused on addressing high-priority community needs and health equity. Since its launch in 2021, the Fund has committed more than $20 million in communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence and made grants to 90 nonprofit organizations. ""We are thrilled to partner with HCA Healthcare Foundation on this transformative initiative. This generous grant not only addresses a critical workforce need by fostering healthcare careers among Florida's youth, but also leverages our capacity to connect students to their communities for meaningful and potentially life-changing learning opportunities,” said Mary Chance, president & CEO of the Consortium. “Together, we're paving the way for a healthier, more prosperous future for Florida.” HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have a strong history of collaboration with the Consortium and its members. In 2023, the Consortium received a $25,000 Healthier Tomorrow Fund Partnership Cultivation Grant on behalf of the organization’s North Florida Division. HCA Healthcare has also partnered with several of Florida’s local education foundations through the Consortium’s Explore & Excel in Healthcare Careers program, which allows students to visit local hospitals for tours and learn more about education pathways that lead to healthcare careers and provides healthcare equipment for hands-on learning in classrooms. HCA Healthcare colleagues are also active as board members and volunteers with local education foundations. The 15 local education foundations awarded are: Education Foundation of Palm Beach County Education Foundation of Okeechobee St. Lucie County Education Foundation Education Foundation of Martin County The Education Foundation of Alachua County Escambia County Public Schools Foundation Public Education Foundation of Marion County Foundation for Seminole County Public Schools Foundation for Orange County Public Schools Clay Education Foundation Jacksonville Public Education Fund Pinellas Education Foundation Pasco Education Foundation Citrus County Education Foundation Manatee Education Foundation About HCA Healthcare Foundation The mission of the HCA Healthcare Foundation is to promote health and well-being and strive to make a positive impact in all the communities HCA Healthcare serves.

WHY IT MATTERS Published on April 19, the FAQ addresses HIPAA rules as it relates to the February 9 cybersecurity incident impacting Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, which had a widespread impact on healthcare organizations across the United States. ""Our updated FAQs webpage on the Change Healthcare breach reiterates that importance by making clear that individuals affected by this breach must be notified that their protected health information was breached,"" said OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer in a statement . OCR said that to avoid duplicative letters to patients: Covered entities affected by the Change Healthcare breach may delegate to Change Healthcare the tasks of providing the required HIPAA breach notifications on their behalf. Only one entity – which could be the covered entity itself or Change Healthcare – needs to complete breach notifications to affected individuals, HHS and, where applicable, the media. HIPAA-covered entities working with Change Healthcare ""to perform the required breach notifications in a manner consistent with the HITECH Act and HIPAA Breach Notification Rule"" would not be subject to further notification obligations, the agency noted. THE LARGER TREND In April, the Medical Group Management Association asked HHS by letter to ensure providers would avoid regulatory actions related to the Change Healthcare attack and require UHG to take on the required HIPAA breach notifications . UHG pledged to ""help ease reporting obligations on other stakeholders whose data may have been compromised as part of this cyberattack,"" and offered to ""make notifications and undertake related administrative requirements on behalf of any provider or customer."" In the future, chain reaction breaches like the Change Healthcare attack and subsequent outage affecting a broad swath of the healthcare ecosystem could get a lot more confusing, in terms of breach notifications. The Federal Trade Commission seeks to amend and expand its Health Breach Notification Rule to cover entities like third-party prescription apps not previously covered by HIPAA. ON THE RECORD ""Affected covered entities that want Change Healthcare to provide breach notifications on their behalf should contact Change Healthcare,"" Fontes Rainer said in a statement. ""All of the required HIPAA breach notifications may be performed by Change Healthcare."" Andrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.

Madan Gopal READ LATER SEE ALL Remove ‘Imposing one-size-fits-all price caps could severely undermine health-care quality’ | Photo Credit: Getty Images As we navigate the dynamic landscape of Indian health care, cost considerations are increasingly influencing every aspect of service delivery and patient care. With rising health disparities and uneven access to medical services, the need for equitable and sustainable health-care policies has never been more urgent than now. Ongoing discussions about setting rates for medical services are not just bureaucratic exercises. They fundamentally shape how we perceive, access, and deliver health care across India. In this globalised era, we see a variety of responses to similar challenges worldwide, shaped by differing cultural, economic, and systemic factors. By learning from these international examples, we can refine our strategies to manage health-care costs more effectively. Private hospitals are not only centres of specialised care but also innovation hubs. Take the examples of the Joint Commission International (JCI) and NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals)-accredited big hospital groups, which have embraced cutting-edge technologies to significantly enhance patient outcomes, especially in complex procedures. These institutions invest heavily in top-tier infrastructure and advanced technologies, enabling them to seamlessly integrate telemedicine and remote care, thus broadening access and building patient trust. India and the ‘managed care’ promise Price caps, quality and innovation As the Supreme Court deliberates on standardising medical procedure rates across government and private sectors, we must consider the allure of affordability. Yet, imposing one-size-fits-all price caps could severely undermine health-care quality. A Health Care Management Review study shows that hospitals under financial pressure from price caps report a 15% increase in patient dissatisfaction. Moreover, such caps could drastically slow the development of new treatments and technologies, notably in fields such as cancer research and robotic surgery, where significant investment is crucial. Could value-based pricing be our solution, where payments reflect health outcomes rather than service volume? The broader economic implications of health-care pricing policies reach far beyond the health-care sector itself. Properly implemented rate standardisation can alleviate health-care disparities, yet we must be cautious not to destabilise providers’ economic health. Economists recommend dynamic pricing models that adjust based on medical complexity and the financial status of patients, offering a fair solution. For instance, Thailand’s tiered pricing system, which considers patient-income levels and medical necessity, successfully balances cost and care and could serve as a model for India’s diverse economic landscape. Alleviating the scourge of private healthcare Legal and regulatory challenges Managing health-care costs effectively demands legislative reform. Tailoring approaches to accommodate local demographic and economic conditions can support rate standardisation and high-quality care. States such as Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have already pointed out gaps in rate fixation provisions, advocating for robust legal frameworks to navigate these issues successfully. Technology is revolutionising health care, making diagnostics faster and more accurate with artificial intelligence and improving care coordination through electronic health records. For example, telemedicine initiatives in Karnataka have slashed hospital visits by 40%, demonstrating how technology not only makes medical care more accessible, especially in remote areas, but also more cost-effective. This integration reduces pressure on health-care facilities while delivering timely care directly to patients’ homes. Moreover, innovations such as mobile health apps and wearable devices are crucial in managing chronic conditions outside hospitals, significantly cutting costs and enhancing patient outcomes. As we push these technologies forward, ensuring that they reach all population segments is key. Investing in infrastructure for broader Internet access and improving digital literacy will empower more people to benefit from these advancements, setting the stage for India to lead globally in health-care innovation. Recent surveys with health-care professionals across India show a consensus on the need for flexible pricing strategies that mirror the complexities of medical procedures and patient-care requirements. Engaging all stakeholders, including private health-care providers, is essential in order to grasp the nuanced dynamics and craft effective, sustainable policies. Who is responsible for healthcare in India: the government or the individual? Role of data in shaping policies In today’s big data era, health-care policy decisions should increasingly rely on data-driven insights. Data analytics can shed light on patient outcomes, treatment efficacy, and cost-efficiency, informing more nuanced rate-setting frameworks. Moreover, predictive analytics could foresee the long-term impacts of rate fixation on health-care innovations, helping policymakers adjust regulations to encourage innovation and accessibility. Balancing access, innovation, and affordability in health care is delicate but imperative. We recommend implementing pilot projects in select districts to gauge the impact of rate caps on health-care quality and innovation, allocating government subsidies to support research and development in private hospitals, and establishing public-private partnerships to integrate cutting-edge technologies in public hospitals, ensuring widespread access to advanced health-care solutions. As India aspires to be a global health-care leader, fostering an environment conducive to innovation while ensuring equitable access to quality health care is crucial. It is time to prioritise the well-being of every individual, as echoed by Dr. Vinod K. Paul, Member, NITI Aayog. “Affordable healthcare is not just a necessity but a priority for our nation, and we are committed to innovating and leveraging technology to bring down healthcare costs for every citizen.” Dr. K.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Jun 03, 2024, 07:30am EDT Share Save Virgil Bretz is co-founder and CEO of MacroHealth , a healthcare fintech platform. getty Spend 30 seconds perusing any comment section, and you’re likely to conclude that Americans can disagree on anything. While common ground seems to have nearly disappeared, there is one agreement that crosses gender, politics, race and religion—healthcare costs in the United States are absurd. In 2022, $4.5 trillion was spent on healthcare, twice as much per capita as peer nations. Even more frustrating, Americans aren’t getting what they pay for. While there have been countless legislative attempts to control costs, the results speak for themselves. This is largely because the proposed solutions to control costs across the industry are similar to our approach to patient care—designed to treat the symptoms, not the cause. Like the U.S. economy as a whole, U.S. healthcare is simply too massive, complex and unwieldy to ""control"" as a system. Instead, it is a marketplace. Upwards of 71% of Americans are covered by market-based private health insurance or Medicare Advantage. We have a market-based healthcare industry. I have worked within this healthcare marketplace for three decades, leading teams focused on developing market solutions that make buying and selling healthcare services simple, transparent and more powerful for providers, payers and patients alike. I co-founded MacroHealth, a health market platform transforming the way healthcare organizations select and connect to their networks of vendors and partners. Here are my observations: When markets function efficiently, they are the best structure for delivering greater quality, lower prices, low transaction friction and innovation to market participants. Yet, no one can seriously argue that our healthcare market is functioning efficiently. Why? A successful market requires information transparency, competition, consumer choice, innovation, the right amount of regulatory governance and trust to function. Reviewing this list, we have adequate market competition, consumer choice, the world’s leading medical innovations and more than enough regulatory governance. But what about transparency and trust? Transparency The biggest driver of U.S. healthcare market dysfunction is a lack of information transparency, specifically information about price and quality. Even those working in the healthcare industry do not know how much a medical procedure will cost until after they’ve received care. As a result, there is little ability or incentive to shop around. This is an absurd business model that is rarely tolerated. Imagine booking a flight, scheduling a ride to the airport or reserving a hotel room without comparing pricing, much less doing so without any idea how much it will cost. Think of Expedia or Uber—companies that created efficient marketplaces to enable consumers to compare prices, detailed product options and quality ratings in real time before committing to a purchase. These marketplaces equally allow the marketplace’s sellers—such as hotels or car drivers—to find, match and efficiently acquire customers. Healthcare needs similar intelligent marketplaces that allow health providers, organizations and consumers to make their best, most affordable and convenient choices. An online platform with tools and data that provide real-time information will lead to a market in which supply better matches demand, prices are transparent and equilibrium is achieved. This is the fastest and most efficient way to control costs. The healthcare industry isn’t as simple as booking a ride or reserving a hotel room. Expedia and Uber are newer platforms when compared to healthcare—an industry still heavily dependent on 40-year-old legacy technology infrastructure (think fax machines). In addition to the industry's opaque pricing mechanisms, a lack of real-time data sharing further hinders the efficient exchange, analysis and availability of critical marketplace information. Imagine if the Uber app on your iPhone couldn’t connect to the driver’s app on an Android phone, and the driver location and pricing data were only updated once a day. Transparency and the marketplace break down quickly. Trust Consumers generally trust the product side of the healthcare marketplace, trusting their doctors and care providers with their lives. However, confidence in the fairness of treatment prices is extremely low. With transparency, trust in pricing increases. Another dimension of trust in efficient digital marketplaces is the security of private information. Uber would not be a successful transportation marketplace if hackers could access your bank accounts. We just saw what happened to Change Healthcare, and this cyberattack is only the latest in the heavily targeted U.S. healthcare sector. A safe environment is a prerequisite for conducting business. Systems must be fundamentally built around cybersecurity, not simply wrapped in it. Building An Intelligent Healthcare Marketplace Consumers and businesses in every industry are justifiably excited about the emergence of generative AI. A healthcare marketplace that leverages AI's power could meaningfully impact healthcare price transparency and consumer costs. The volume of healthcare data and connections are measured in units that are difficult to fathom: petabytes (equivalent to 1,000 terabytes). No one person or group can navigate through this data to ensure each price and connection in the marketplace is accurate. People supported by AI can. Enabling transparency and building trust takes time, but new AI tools are emerging to achieve efficiency faster and sooner. The Path To A Better Healthcare Marketplace Acknowledging that healthcare costs aren't sustainable and that U.S. healthcare is not a system but rather a market, healthcare organizations can take these initial steps to support an intelligent health market: • Embrace Price Transparency: More informed market buyers and sellers will lead to better healthcare for more people. Continue to push price transparency initiatives past required regulations. • Ensure Security: More data security will lead to increased trust and system usage. Incorporate a checklist of industry best practices into frequent, recurring audits to ensure they’re implemented and used across the organization. • Employ Modern Information Technology: The infrastructure for sharing healthcare information needs to be modernized to meet new consumer experience expectations. With generative AI, we finally have tools to help organizations and consumers simplify and make sense of petabytes of complex data. Implementing these recommendations will help support a transparent, trustworthy U.S. healthcare marketplace that, in its future state, will be as easy as using Uber and Expedia.

This was the key theme the World Future Health Africa event on Thursday, the second day of the second edition of GITEX AFRICA being held in Marrakech over three days. Related 2nd edition of GITEX AFRICA kicks off in Morocco with Egyptian participation GITEX AFRICA seeks to accelerate the digital transformation in the healthcare sector on the continent, which has 1.5 billion people by leveraging investments. The event includes three sub-events; World Future Health Africa Investment Summit, World Future Health Africa Congress, and Digital Health Leadership Forum. Lack of healthcare across Africa During the event, it was revealed that 40 percent of Africans lack healthcare services and only 30 percent has comprehensive access to these services. Mazen Aladdin, the general supervisor of Egypt’s Healthcare Authority, affirmed that creating partnerships with the private sector is key for the development and improvement of the healthcare ecosystem in Africa, citing Egyptian expertise. Recently, Egypt’s House of Representatives debated a law that would allow the private sector to operate state-owned operate healthcare entities . Egypt’s t riple-eye healthcare strategy “We adopt the triple-eye strategy in the Egyptian healthcare sector. This includes an eye on the innovations and technologies, an eye on the internal cooperation, and an eye on the international collaboration for the sake of uplifting the quality of the medical services,” Aladdin told Ahram Online. He affirmed that the authority is working to empower the private sector to play a greater role in the healthcare sector in the country. He added that a new draft law will be announced regulating telemedicine and its operation in Egypt. The announcement is expected to be made during the third edition of the Africa Health Excon Egypt will host on 3-6 June. Healthcare budgets in Africa too low Nigeria’s Minister of Health and Social Welfare Tunji Alausa noted that the budgets dedicated to healthcare in Africa are minimal, representing below 10 percent of the country’s GDP. In this respect, he stressed that this portion has to be raised gradually to exceed 15 percent of the country’s GDP. He also affirmed that resource mobilization, establishing collaboration with the development partners, and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) tools are important ways to a more improved healthcare ecosystem in the continent. The Honorable Commissioner of the Nigerian Ministry of Health, Akin Abayomi, emphasized that the proper management of finances secured by African nations from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) is crucial for improving the continent's healthcare sector. He added that IFIs need to reconsider the amount of financing allocated to African countries dedicated to supporting the healthcare sector, in a way that enables these nations to advance digital transformation, accelerate telemedicine, and digitize medical services. Adopting AI an imperative Trixie LohMirmand, CEO of the GITEX AFRICA organizer KAOUN International, said during the event that leveraging AI solutions and boosting e-healthcare in Africa is crucial for the continent’s development on the level of the economy and the well-being of the people. She added that AI solutions and data-driven healthcare are now necessities for the continent, not just a desire or a choice. LohMirmand stressed that Africa will be a leader in e-healthcare and telemedicine within the coming few years, as the digital transformation in the continent has been accelerated over the past few years, in addition to the innovative businesses and solutions that the entrepreneurs and startups are providing for the continent.

After the seventh and final phase of voting in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, exit polls predicted a third term for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This anticipated win is likely to impact healthcare policies and areas where the Narendra Modi government has implemented various initiatives since 2014. Advertisement Since coming to power, the Modi government has introduced several key healthcare initiatives, including its flagship health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana. Ayushman Bharat, a health insurance scheme, provides coverage to over 500 million Indians, while the Janaushadhi Pariyojana offers generic medicines at affordable prices. The BJP's 2024 manifesto, titled ""Modi ki Guarantee,"" outlined several key promises, particularly focusing on the pharmaceutical industry and other significant areas. Healthcare and medicine commitments include continuing the free ration scheme for the poor, expanding the network of Jan Aushadhi Kendras, and extending the coverage of Ayushman Bharat Yojana to include senior citizens above 75 years of age and the transgender community. Health economists have said that if the BJP government comes to power, it will aim to make India a developed nation by 2047, focusing on infrastructure development, both digital and social, and transforming the country into a global manufacturing hub. Job creation and employment opportunities have also been promised, particularly through investments in the manufacturing sector. Advertisement ""Addressing the shortage of healthcare professionals could involve increasing the number of medical college seats and implementing measures to upskill the existing healthcare workforce, thereby addressing the critical shortage of trained professionals in the country. Additionally, specific health priorities such as communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and maternal health are likely to be outlined, with strategies proposed to tackle these issues effectively,"" said Arup Mitra, Professor of Economics, South Asian University (SAU), New Delhi. The Ayushman Bharat scheme has been praised for providing access to healthcare for millions of Indians but has faced criticism for limited coverage and payment delays to hospitals. Industry experts expect the upcoming government to address these issues. “The private sector cannot replace the public sector. Policymakers understand this, but it is crucial for them to realise that every programme must be sustainable. Currently, the pricing for both Ayushman Bharat and the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) needs adjustments. CGHS prices are slightly better than Ayushman Bharat, but both require revisions. Inflation occurs annually, and not revising prices for 10-14 years is unfair. The government must address this and improve transparency in payment mechanisms,” said Ashutosh Raghuvanshi CEO of Fortis Healthcare. Advertisement The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana has increased the affordability of generic medicines, although concerns about quality persist. The National Health Mission has seen some success in improving healthcare quality but continues to struggle with shortages of healthcare workers and infrastructure issues. A 2020 NITI Aayog report called for increased investment in healthcare to achieve universal health coverage, improved service quality, and affordability. The report stressed significant reforms needed to meet the healthcare needs of India's expanding population. “The Indian government must allocate at least 2.6% of the country's GDP to healthcare in order to achieve universal healthcare. However Modi government has brought in good health policies, there is more to be done by the upcoming government,” said Mitra. The official election results will be announced on June 4.

Health advocates said this is a telling sign that healthcare workers may not be able to cope for long. Referring to the findings of an ad hoc poll by the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) concerning house officers, medical officers and specialists, Hartal Doktor Kontrak spokesman Dr Muhammad Yassin said the activist group had predicted this years ago. ALSO READ: Power over parallel pathway plan “Almost all healthcare facilities are operating with insufficient staff, pushing their capacity to the limit. This will inevitably lead to burnout and resignations, and exacerbate existing problems,” he said when contacted. Dr Muhammad said there has been a lack of action to address issues related to poor working conditions and mistreatment of junior doctors by superiors. Therefore, he said, it was time for a Health Commission to be established so that the Health Ministry can manage its own manpower needs. “Currently, too much time is being wasted on resolving simple issues. For instance, consider the ongoing debates surrounding the parallel pathway fiasco, while the myCPD (Online Monitoring Continuing Professional Development) website has been down for months,” he added. ALSO READ: ‘It’s about national interest’ Independent healthcare advocate and former contract doctor Dr Sean Thum said while 117 respondents is a very small sample size, which may not represent the actual situation in its entirety, it at least gives a snapshot of what was currently going on. “These are warning signs that healthcare workers are finding it hard to cope due to a lack of manpower. “The Health Ministry has to be transparent about the number of healthcare workers at facilities nationwide, to ensure that proper remedies can be taken early,” he said. Dr Thum said the lack of manpower will lead to physical exhaustion and subsequently burnout among healthcare workers. “This will be detrimental to patients as tired healthcare workers are prone to making mistakes. This translates to poorer healthcare outcomes,” he added. ALSO READ: INTERACTIVE: Too many young healthcare workers earning below RM2,000 The survey received a total of 117 responses from workers in various government healthcare facilities, including hospitals and health clinics across the country. Participants in the survey were from Sabah (20), Sarawak (19), Johor (14), Kedah (13), Perak (10), nine each from Negri Sembilan, Penang and Selangor, Kuala Lumpur (seven), Pahang (four), Terengganu (two) and one from Perlis. As for the factors contributing to the lack of manpower, nearly half (48.3%) of the 117 respondents said doctors were quitting (28.8%) or being transferred to another facility (13.6%).

BOCA RATON, Fla. , May 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Omega Healthcare released the details of poster sessions co-presented with partners Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) recently at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024 , April 5-10, 2024 , in San Diego , and later presented at the Cancer Center Informatics Society 2024 Summit & Clinical Trials Workshop , April 29 - May 1 , in La Jolla, Calif. The sessions described how MSK and DFCI partnered with Omega Healthcare to deliver high-quality real-world data (RWD) for 6,000+ cancer patients as part of the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC). The poster session, titled "" Solving the real-world data challenge: A hybrid resourcing model to curate RWD at scale ,"" detailed a collaborative effort among MSK, DFCI, and Omega Healthcare to curate structured RWD for oncology research. The project aimed to contribute to the AACR Project GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC), which provides a publicly accessible cancer registry of real-world clinico-genomic data. The authors highlight the importance of choosing the right partner to work with RWD and the challenges researchers face in curating data in-house due to limited time and resources. Real-world data provides insights to improve decision-making and support research findings. Researchers, life sciences firms, and health tech companies need to focus on generating new insights and harness the economic potential of RWD to push innovation forward. Structured RWD for oncology research is critical to clinical decision-making as it facilitates the identification of trends and correlations that might not be apparent in unstructured data. ""The results of the project discussed in these sessions underscores how working with a curation partner like Omega Healthcare enables researchers to cost-effectively curate high-quality RWD while focusing on core research responsibilities,"" said Heather Grey , SVP/GM of RWD and Clinical Trials at Omega Healthcare. ""Still, such initiatives require strong collaboration and communication to deliver real-world data at scale. Many thanks to our partners at MSK and DFCI for sharing insights into how we worked together to achieve these results."" Presenters outlined the operationalization of a programmatic approach to data curation, involving Omega Healthcare's flexible staffing models leveraging skilled and licensed resources to support cross functional teams. Success factors included clear communication, cross-training curators, establishing quality assurance and delivery methods, and developing data visualizations and analytics. The Omega Healthcare CurateIQ flexible staffing model is centered around a highly trained and experienced team of experts with over 80% holding a master's degree or higher and more than 70% holding a medical degree. The results demonstrate that the collaboration helped MSK and DFCI deliver high-quality RWD for 6,475 patients in Phase 1 of the AACR GENIE BPC. Together, the teams decreased curation time and added new cohorts as they gained experience, maintaining project pace despite challenges posed by the pandemic, remote work, and staffing changes. ""We look forward to seeing our customers and partners at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL , May 31 - June 4, 2024 ,"" Grey said. ""We will be there to raise awareness of Omega Healthcare's CurateIQ health data solutions where we help healthcare organizations capture, manage, and report on medical and oncology data for research and bioinformatics needs.""

In 2023, the healthcare provider segment held a significant share of the healthcare cloud computing market, by product. This segment is projected to demonstrate the highest growth rate during the forecast period. The substantial share can be attributed to the increasing adoption of big data analytics and various healthcare IT solutions, driven by the impacts of the pandemic. Additionally, the shift towards value-based care and the increasing focus on patient outcomes drive healthcare providers to adopt cloud solutions that can support telemedicine, mobile health applications, and integrated care models. The necessity for compliance with stringent regulatory standards, such as HIPAA in the U.S., further accelerates the adoption of cloud technologies, as they offer built-in security and compliance features. ""By component, the services segment held the largest market share of healthcare cloud computing market in 2023."" In 2023, the services segment held the largest share of the healthcare cloud computing market. This growth is driven by the introduction of complex software and the necessity to ensure integration and interoperability, which require extensive training and regular upgrades. Services such as consulting, implementation, ongoing IT support, training, and post-sales maintenance are essential for healthcare providers to effectively transition to and utilize cloud-based systems. These services help address the complex requirements of healthcare IT environments, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems, maintaining compliance with regulatory standards, and optimizing performance. ""North America accounted for the largest share of the healthcare cloud computing market in 2023."" The healthcare cloud computing market is segmented into five major regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific (APAC), Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. In 2023, North America held the largest share of the market, followed by Europe and the Asia Pacific. This dominance in North America can be attributed to several factors, including favorable government initiatives and high healthcare expenditure. Additionally, the presence of many healthcare cloud computing companies headquartered in the region contributes to its lucrative market environment.

We will delve into the heart of healthcare by exploring the invaluable role of empathy in patient car while also uncovering why empathy is the cornerstone of compassionate healthcare delivery, even in an era increasingly defined by technological advancements. In our 2024 Future of Nursing Survey, healthcare professionals overwhelmingly underscored the critical importance of empathy amidst the growing reliance on technology. While technological innovations undoubtedly offer immense benefits, they also pose unique challenges to fostering genuine human connections in patient care. As we explore the intersection of empathy and healthcare, let's heed the insights shared by frontline healthcare heroes. Embracing Empathy: A Vital Component of Patient Care Empathy is more than just a buzzword in healthcare-it's a fundamental aspect of providing patient-centered care. Nurses, doctors, and other healthcare providers are not just treating illnesses; they're caring for individuals who are often experiencing vulnerability, fear, and uncertainty. Empathy allows healthcare professionals to step into their patients' shoes, to truly understand their emotions, concerns, and needs. It's about validating their experiences and demonstrating genuine compassion and support. In the words of Nurse Sarah from St. Jude's Hospital, ""Empathy is the bridge that connects us to our patients on a deeper level. It's about listening, truly listening, to their stories, fears, and hopes. When patients feel heard and understood, healing becomes more than just a medical procedure-it becomes a shared journey."" Challenges in the Age of Technology While technology has revolutionized healthcare in countless ways, it also presents significant challenges to maintaining empathy and human connection. Electronic health records, telemedicine, and automated processes streamline workflow but can sometimes create barriers between healthcare providers and their patients. The risk of depersonalization looms large as screens replace faces, and algorithms dictate care plans. Dr. Rodriguez from Mercy Hospital highlights this dilemma, stating, ""Technology has undoubtedly improved efficiency and access to care, but it's essential not to lose sight of the human element. We must find ways to balance technological advancements with the preservation of empathy and meaningful patient-provider relationships."" Integrating Empathy into Healthcare Practice So, how can healthcare organizations ensure that empathy remains at the forefront of patient care, even in a technology-driven landscape? Here are some actionable recommendations: Comprehensive Training: Implement training programs that emphasize the importance of empathy and communication skills for all healthcare staff. Encourage active listening, empathy-building exercises, and cultural sensitivity training. Promote Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Foster collaboration between healthcare professionals from various disciplines to provide holistic care that addresses patients' physical, emotional, and psychosocial needs. Utilize Technology as an Enabler: Leverage technology to enhance rather than replace human connection. For example, virtual support groups, telehealth platforms with built-in communication tools, and patient portals that facilitate ongoing dialogue can all foster meaningful connections between patients and providers. Encourage Self-Care: Prioritize the well-being of healthcare professionals by providing resources for self-care and stress management. Empathetic patient care begins with caring for oneself. While technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, let us never forget that behind every medical chart and diagnostic test result is a unique individual deserving of dignity, respect, and empathetic care. By integrating empathy into every aspect of healthcare practice and leveraging technology as a tool to enhance human connection, we can ensure that patient care remains truly patient-centered. Together, let's embrace the power of empathy to heal, comfort, and uplift those in need. Thank you to all the dedicated nurses and healthcare professionals for your unwavering commitment to compassionate care. Your empathy makes all the difference in the world.

Over the years, the global healthcare IT industry has transitioned from the application of IT solutions from basic administrative functions to core clinical tasks. The increased amount of data gathered through patient records has now led to the deployment of advanced IT solutions in the healthcare sector. This includes the deployment of advanced analytics solutions, population health management solutions, and AI solutions for a variety of clinical and non-clinical applications.

The inauguration includes the draft for the European Health Data Space (EHDS), which will govern digital health for all EU Member States and serve as a guide to transform the way digital health is implemented across the European Union.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions . Δ But too frequently, that world also ends there — as women spend significantly more time on household responsibilities and caregiving, leaving less time for taking care of their own health and wellness. That’s why PYMNTS sat down with Amy Bond , senior vice president of marketing at Synchrony , to hear her thoughts on the financial and logistical barriers that hinder women’s access to preventive healthcare services, as well as to unpack the need for effective financial solutions to alleviate these burdens. “Finances continue to be one of the major obstacles to healthcare … that’s why offering consumers financial solutions like CareCredit is really important, as it can potentially alleviate some of these burdens on women who would otherwise forgo healthcare or postpone it while prioritizing their family’s needs above their own,” Bond said. Working mothers, particularly single mothers, struggle to balance job responsibilities, caretaking and their personal wellness. This lack of time dedicated to personal health is a prevalent issue among many women, often due to their dual roles as employees and caregivers. “Younger generations tend to prioritize wellness on a more significant basis just because they don’t have as much family responsibilities and, typically, they’re only caring for themselves,” said Bond. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Just 71% of moms get preventive medical care, and around one-quarter do not seek care at all for themselves, while 78% of mothers prioritize their household’s health over their own well-being. Read more: Women’s Life Stage Priorities in Health and Wellness How to Overcome Obstacles in Health Access for Women PYMNTS Intelligence created the “ 2024 Women’s Wellness Index ” in collaboration with CareCredit , to assess what factors negatively impact women’s health and how to overcome them. The research shows that consumers are increasingly shouldering more out-of-pocket healthcare costs, which can lead to women postponing or forgoing necessary medical care. Bond emphasized that CareCredit’s health and wellness credit card aims to mitigate these financial pressures, offering women a way to manage healthcare expenses more effectively. Women in caregiving roles, especially those in the “sandwich generation” caring for both children and elderly parents, face compounded challenges, she said, noting that the myriad challenges women face in accessing healthcare can be broadly categorized into economic, logistical and social barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues, particularly for women. With the closure of schools, daycare centers and other facilities, many women had to increase their caregiving responsibilities, leaving even less time for their own health needs. This period highlighted the critical role of healthcare financing solutions, said Bond. “More and more people are bearing the responsibility of healthcare costs in general. So, it’s important for people to find responsible financial solutions to help then save for and manage for healthcare costs,” she said. Read more : Moms Prioritize Household Healthcare Over Their Own Employers also play a crucial role in supporting women’s health, as insufficient policies around paid family leave, affordable childcare and flexible work arrangements can exacerbate the challenges women face in accessing healthcare. As Bond explained, measures like paid maternity leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable childcare solutions can empower women to prioritize their health without sacrificing job security and financial stability. PYMNTS Intelligence has found that every additional $500 spent on women’s health results in a positive effect of their overall wellbeing. Higher income brackets correlate with better health attentiveness, highlighting the role of financial stability in accessing healthcare services. Bond also highlighted that there is a growing recognition that healthcare costs are an inevitable part of life. Against that backdrop, families may want to consider budgeting for healthcare expenses just as they do for groceries and gas. This proactive approach can help mitigate the financial impact of healthcare needs. Still, at the end of the day, addressing the ongoing and systemic barriers to women’s health requires a multifaceted approach, including providing financial support, increasing health literacy, improving healthcare infrastructure and enacting supportive policies.

At the project launch event, a cardiologist used MUSE(TM) NX to review electrocardiogram (ECG) data from a remotely located patient, demonstrating how the solution can integrate and manage the flow of information to support timely diagnosis, even when the patient is located far from the examining physician. The MUSE(TM) NX software is designed to help doctors access cardiac testing results, helping to enable faster and more accurate diagnoses. The pilot project will take place in Kiambu County, the second most populous county in the country. The partnership agreement will support Kenya’s National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases by helping clinicians better diagnose and treat cardiovascular disease, which is today the leading cause of noncommunicable disease mortality in the country ( http://apo-opa.co/3KoEX6J) . Building on 50 years of ECG innovation, the MUSE (TM) NX Cardiology Information System elevates connectivity and privacy to complement the high clinical standards our customers have long valued. MUSE NX allows for easy integration, enhanced security protection and fast update deployment, ultimately aiding fast and accurate diagnoses. With the support of GE HealthCare , Daktari Africa will work with the Kiambu County government to implement the MUSE(TM) NX system in health centers in the county. Dr. Charles Kamotho — Founder & CEO, Daktari Africa said ""This collaboration seeks to revolutionize cardiac care in Kenya by bringing advanced diagnostic capabilities to remote areas. Through tele-ECG screenings, we can facilitate early detection of critical conditions, reduce hospitalizations, and improve patient outcomes. We are pleased to be working with GE HealthCare to make a positive impact on healthcare delivery in our country."" Moussa Gholmieh General Manager for Patient Care Solutions, Emerging Markets, GE HealthCare , said: ""For the first time in East Africa , GE HealthCare is partnering with a telemedicine platform to bring advanced cardiac care to remote areas. This partnership with Daktari Africa is a significant milestone in our mission to bridge the healthcare gap and improve access to healthcare services. By leveraging the latest technological advances, we aim to make a significant impact on healthcare delivery in Kenya . By providing physicians with access to patient ECG information, the MUSE(TM) NX solution will support informed decision making and high-quality care for a disease that is placing an increasing burden on the nation’s health system. By combining clinical expertise, telemedicine specialization, and advanced healthcare technologies, we can help save time in the diagnosis and treatment process, increase staff productivity, and enhance patient care quality."" The GE HealthCare team will provide training to Daktari Africa and its partners after the installation of the MUSE(TM) NX system. This training will ensure that healthcare professionals are equipped with the necessary skills to maximize the platform’s impact.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xrp-healthcare-stops-xrp-to-xrph-swap-facility-ensuring-token-scarcity-on-june-7th-302155739.html,,"XRP Healthcare Stops XRP to XRPH Swap Facility , Ensuring Token Scarcity on June 7th",20240527T054500Z,,prnewswire.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"DUBAI , UAE , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- XRP Healthcare, a pioneering company at the intersection of blockchain and healthcare, has announced a strategic move to halt its XRP to XRPH token swap facility come June 7th, 2024 , or as soon as its allocated XRPH Swap facility tokens have been depleted. This decision comes in response to the unprecedented demand for its XRPH tokens, underscoring the importance of preserving the finite supply for its existing exchange platforms and the revolutionary XRP Healthcare Prescription Savings Card App available Google Play and Apple Store where it can be used in up to 68,000 pharmacies such as Walmarts, CVS and Walgreens for up to 80% savings off prescriptions and medications in return for $1.00 of XRPH tokens each time the card is used. Continue Reading XRP Healthcare Stops XRP to XRPH Swap Facility, Ensuring Token Scarcity on June 7th With a fixed total supply of just 100 million XRPH tokens and the issuing account blackholed to prevent any future issuance, XRP Healthcare is committed to maintaining the scarcity of its tokens. A Blackholed issuing account means that no additional tokens can ever be created, ensuring the total supply remains constant. This is in stark contrast to centralized financial systems, where governments and central banks can print more fiat money at will. Examples include the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank, both of which have engaged in significant monetary expansion in recent years - Over time, this increase in fiat money supply can lead to inflation, diminishing the value of the currency. ""Halting the swap facility is a crucial step in ensuring the long-term integrity and scarcity of XRPH tokens,"" said Kain Roomes , CEO and Founder of XRP Healthcare. ""By Blackholing the issuing account, we are aligning with the best practices in the cryptocurrency space to maintain the value of our tokens for our consumers."" Scarcity has long been a fundamental principle in the crypto world. A prime example is Bitcoin , which undergoes a ""halving"" event approximately every four years. The most recent halving took place in April 2024 , reducing the reward for mining new blocks by half. This process inherently limits the supply of new Bitcoins, contributing to its status as ""digital gold"" and often leading to significant price appreciation post-halving. ""By halting the swap facility, we are taking a proactive approach to managing our token supply, much like the mechanisms seen in successful cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ,"" said Laban Roomes, Business Development Officer at XRP Healthcare. ""This ensures our consumers benefit from a finite supply of XRPH tokens which day by day are becoming increasingly scarce"". XRP Healthcare has also made significant strides recently, with the XRPH token rising from a CoinMarketCap position of over 3500 to its current position of around 1400. Adding further to the trust and transparency the XRPH token supply is verified on CoinMarketCap (CMC), and operates as a validator node on the XRPL. Furthermore, the company's expansion plans in Uganda and the wider African region are well underway. This includes the successful registration of its Trademark in Uganda , a necessary requirement to brand private healthcare acquisitions of pharmacies, medical centres and hospitals with its logo - along with its commitment to be self-autonomous, and to not rely on any third parties. XRP Healthcare is raising its own funds to begin the mergers and acquisitions of private healthcare facilities in the region. The company has also appointed Uganda -born Peter Waiswa , an advisor to UNICEF, WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to their advisory board. XRP Healthcare appears to be completely focused on potentially disrupting and impacting the African healthcare system. ""In a market where the scarcity of digital assets is a critical component of their appeal, our initiative demonstrates a proactive stance in safeguarding the integrity and worth of XRPH tokens,"" added Whitney Lynn , Chairman of XRP Healthcare. ""This move not only responds to current market dynamics but also positions XRPH as a valuable and sought-after token in the burgeoning field of blockchain-based healthcare solutions."" About XRP Healthcare XRP Healthcare is the first Pharma and Healthcare platform on the XRP Ledger, enabling fast global payments, improving healthcare access in emerging markets, and creating real-world utility by transforming global healthcare through mergers, acquisitions and blockchain.

https://www.adn.com/opinions/2024/05/25/opinion-alaska-has-its-health-care-challenges-but-its-system-works-well-at-providing-care/,,"OPINION : Alaska has its health care challenges , but its system works well at providing care",20240525T181500Z,https://www.adn.com/resizer/32XLs72ZqRdVx3Ed0pJ5Q9t5Cws=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/UC7BM2KIDRDHVDHH4DC3Y545ZI.jpg,adn.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"iStock / Getty Images I read with interest the commentary, “Addressing maternity care deserts in Alaska,” by Madisyn Parker. Since I am a physician who specializes in maternity care and lives and works in Alaska, I thought I would share some thoughts based upon personal experience. The dictionary defines a “desert” as an area devoid of water or life. I used to live in Arizona, and much of Arizona, to the casual observer, appears to be a desert. But when the sharp eye looks more carefully, the Arizona desert is actually teeming with life. Geographically, Alaska is the largest state in the country. According to government data, there are some 162 communities in Alaska organized as a city or borough. In addition, there are at least 229 Alaska Native villages recognized by the federal government. Health care for anyone, especially for mothers and children, is not an easy thing to perform in Alaska. However, despite the vastness distances of Alaska, the sparse population and the tremendous challenges, I would not consider Alaska to be a maternity or child care desert. Like the Arizona desert, the maternal and child health care in Alaska is teeming with life. Nearly every Alaska village, no matter how small or remote, has at least one health aide who serves a vital role to help monitor the health of pregnant women or young children. Many villages or remote communities also have a nurse practitioner or physician assistant available. When a patient is identified as pregnant, patients receive important teaching about nutrition and healthy lifestyles, are offered common medications such as prenatal vitamins and iron, and are aligned with a health care team to receive prenatal care. Significant efforts are expended to ensure that children receive routine well-child health care, dental care and standard immunizations. There is a vast system of health care that funnels patients to larger and more complex hospitals and health care facilities in the state. For example, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region is made up of 75,000 square miles, with a population of more than 23,000 people who live among 58 rural communities not connected by road. Bethel, the regional service and transportation hub, has a hospital and clinic staffed with excellent health care practitioners who also visit the villages to bring health care to the people. There are multiple larger communities throughout Alaska that serve as hubs for smaller and more remote villages. These hubs in turn, refer patients to Anchorage when the health care needs dictate. Technology also plays an important role in health care in Alaska. Patients can connect by Internet or phone for medical care and teaching. We can and do monitor conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure in pregnancy by use of Internet or phone. In addition, numerous and highly dedicated health care practitioners that includes OBGYN and family physicians, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, and other more specialized physicians such as pediatric cardiologists, crisscross Alaska through outreach clinics to see patients and improve health care for pregnant women and children in rural and remote areas. Alaska has the largest and most complex air transport system in the United States. Medical evacuations and transportation of patients is performed on a daily basis across Alaska. Patients can be transported from a remote village to a regional hub, or to Anchorage, or even beyond to highly specialized hospitals available in Seattle or Portland. These medical evacuation teams are superb and risk their lives to transport patients across Alaska when the need arises. ADVERTISEMENT Several communities are equipped to have pregnant patients stay close to the hospital during the latter part of the pregnancy. Patients who live in the Y-K Delta can stay in Bethel, or they might travel to Anchorage. Patients in Southeast Alaska might stay in Sitka or Juneau, or come to Anchorage. Patients in the north might stay in Fairbanks. Alaska Medicaid and most private insurance companies are helpful in assisting with travel arrangements from their home village or community to a more robust health care facility. Most of the regional health care corporations also assist with funding for patients who need to stay in a large community for pregnancy or their child. In Anchorage, patients can stay in local hotels, the Ronald McDonald House, the Hickel House, or other places if necessary. Once a patient delivers her baby in Anchorage, she will receive assistance to return home with her baby and follow-up is arranged to check on the health of the mother and newborn baby. This includes lactation assistance for those mothers who choose to breastfeed their baby. All in all, considering the unique challenges of patients and their families, Alaska is a wonderful place to live. Although the challenges of providing high-quality health care to pregnant women and children are immense, thanks to the dedication and commitment of many outstanding health care professionals and committed organizations across the state, Alaska is a national leader in health care outcomes.

Article Insights Cohen & Gresser are most popular: with readers working within the Banking & Credit industries The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") last week announced the formation of a new task force to guide its enforcement strategy and policy approach to health care, with an apparent focus on industry consolidation and collusive behavior. According to the DOJ announcement released on May 9, 2024, the Task Force on Health Care Monopolies and Collusion (""HCMC"") will consider ""widespread competition concerns shared by patients, health care professionals, businesses and entrepreneurs."" Issues to be addressed include payer-provider consolidation, serial acquisitions, labor and quality of care, medical billing, health care information technology services, and access to and use of health care data. The task force will include both civil and criminal enforcement attorneys, as well as economists, industry experts, technologists, data scientists, investigators, and policy advisors from across the Antitrust Division's sections and offices. The announcement of the HCMC is unsurprising in many respects. The health care industry has long been a major target of antitrust enforcement, and the Biden DOJ has previously signaled its continued focus on health care competition. In December 2022, the Antitrust Division entered into a formal collaboration with the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services aimed at preventing collusion and promoting competition in health care markets. And just last month, the Antitrust Division launched an online portal for the public to report potentially anticompetitive health care practices. Moreover, there is precedent for efforts to consolidate antitrust enforcement expertise in complex industries. Last week's announcement is reminiscent of the Federal Trade Commission's 2019 formation of a task force focused on competition in technology markets. Notably, like that task force, the HCMC appears to be drawing on the agency's current resources rather than hiring additional staff, suggesting that the Antitrust Division's focus is on more efficient, and not necessarily broader, enforcement. In a National Law Journal article about the HCMC, Melissa H. Maxman, Washington DC Office Managing Partner, was quoted as noting that there are smaller health care companies that will be relieved to be examined under an enforcement approach that is targeted at their specific factual situations. ""Task forces sometimes can be inefficient,"" she added, ""[b]ut if ever there were a need for one, it would be in health care competition."" While the impact of the HCMC remains to be seen, the Antitrust Division's approach has the potential to facilitate a better informed and more comprehensive analysis of a market that poses unique regulatory and enforcement challenges. The Cohen & Gresser antitrust team has extensive experience representing businesses in the health care industry, including physicians, pharmacies, and manufacturers. If you have any questions about potential areas of focus for the HCMC, please contact either of the authors of this article. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Major Players Driving the U.S. Healthcare Industry’s Growth and Innovation The global healthcare industry is a massive and rapidly growing sector, valued at around $7.975 trillion as of 2023. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least half of the world’s population lacks access to essential health services. The U.S. healthcare industry is one of the largest and most complex in the world, accounting for nearly 20% of the country’s GDP. In 2021, the U.S. healthcare industry was worth $808 billion, with 65% of the revenue coming from patient care. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in revenue, with the U.S. healthcare system’s revenue declining by around 50% in 2020. Several healthcare companies play an important role in the US health industry. These companies include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), and Pfizer, among others. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leading healthcare company in the United States , with over 9,000 retail locations across the United States. CVS Health’s PBM business helps manage prescription drug costs for millions of Americans, making medications more affordable and accessible. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)’s total revenues increased 11.9% to $93.8 billion in Q4,2023 and the total revenues increased 10.9% to $357.8 billion for the full year. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also play an important role in US healthcare. It is one of the largest healthcare stocks in the US. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) developed the first single-dose COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine) in 2020.

In the U.S., sales surged 7.8% to $11.6 billion in the same period. The Booming Telemedicine Market and Rising Healthcare Costs: Global and U.S. Perspectives One of the innovations that is most revolutionizing the field of digital health is telemedicine. With a predicted CAGR of 17.2% between 2023 and 2030, the global telemedicine market, which was valued at $87.41 billion in 2022, is projected to grow to $286.22 billion by 2030. With China aiming to build 20,000 hospitals in the next ten years to improve access to healthcare, global healthcare spending outside the US is predicted to expand more quickly than within the US. Considerable investment opportunities arise from rising medical inflation in the private sector in Brazil, where 75% of the population is covered by universal health care. The expense of healthcare has been rapidly rising in the US. Everything increased in price by almost 81% between June 2023 and 2000, while healthcare expenditures increased by 114%. The COVID-19 epidemic has exacerbated the situation. COVID is becoming more and more like the flu, but treating and preventing it still comes with a high price tag. According to estimates from McKinsey, the US will pay an additional $200 billion annually on healthcare linked to COVID-19.

The organization will train its LNAs to work in the local health organizations, getting them up to speed on each location’s orientation, routines, and culture. It’s pairing that with a new online scheduling portal where health care providers can post shifts and LNAs can sign up for them in real time, even on short notice. “I like to think of this idea as the ‘Uber of health care,’ transforming the way health care staffing is scheduled and delivered,” said Kate Luczko, senior director of HealthForce NH, an initiative of the Foundation for Healthy Communities, in a statement.

A recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine argues for integrating carbon-footprint analyses into randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to promote sustainable clinical practices. However, this initiative raises critical questions about its underlying assumptions and the practical implications for health care delivery. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2402018 The Ideological Push for Green Health Care The article opens with a stark declaration: “Human-induced climate change and destruction of nature is a global health emergency. By [year], an estimated [number] billion people will reside in areas considered to be not well suited for sustaining human life. Extreme weather events, water and food insecurity, and the risk of infectious diseases are increasing. Immediate action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in all sectors of society is paramount to support a livable future”​​. Yawn, such alarmist statements often lack the rigorous scientific backing needed to justify drastic changes in policy. The drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in health care, is clearly rooted in ideology than in evidence-based necessity. Health Care’s Role in the Environmental Crisis? The article asserts: “Health care is a substantial contributor to the current environmental crisis. In [year], the [number]th United Nations Climate Change Conference health program urged the health care community to reduce emissions by building low-carbon, sustainable health care systems”​​. While health care does have an environmental impact, this in no way justifies the substantial shifts proposed. Health care’s primary mandate is to provide effective patient care, and diverting resources to achieve questionable environmental goals will clearly undermine this mission. The Case for Carbon-Footprint Analyses in RCTs The authors propose integrating carbon-footprint analyses into RCTs, suggesting that: “Evaluation of new interventions typically involves conducting randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that assess clinical benefits and harms. Only after clinical implementation, if at all, have the environmental effects of some interventions typically been assessed. We believe that an intervention’s carbon footprint should be examined in parallel with its clinical benefits and harms”​​. This approach, while seemingly comprehensive, adds layers of complexity to an already rigorous process. RCTs are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of medical interventions. Introducing environmental impact as a secondary endpoint would dilute the focus, effectiveness and increase the cost of these trials. Practical Challenges and Dubious Benefits The article highlights several challenges: “Differences among health systems, including variation in energy sources and equipment, can mean that carbon-footprint analyses may not be generalizable across health care systems, countries, and regions”​​. “Another challenge involves the current lack of freely accessible databases containing information from LCAs of health care products and processes”​​. These challenges underscore the impracticality of the proposal. The variability in health care systems globally makes standardizing carbon-footprint analyses difficult, if not impossible. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive data on life-cycle assessments (LCAs) further complicates the endeavor. Ideological Motivations Over Practical Necessity The push for carbon-footprint analyses in RCTs is clearly ideologically driven, not scientifically warranted. The fundamental goal of health care should be to improve patient outcomes, not to serve as a proving ground for environmental activism. This is particularly concerning when the benefits of such environmental considerations are speculative at best. Conclusion The recent call for integrating carbon-footprint analyses into RCTs represents a misguided attempt to merge health care with environmental activism. Prioritizing so-called sustainability in health care trials adds unnecessary complexity and diverts focus from patient care. Health care must remain focused on its primary objective: providing the best possible care for patients. Diverting resources and attention to environmental concerns, particularly when their benefits are not clearly substantiated, risks undermining the efficacy and integrity of medical research and practice. The pursuit of a green future and sustainable development in this context is an unfounded ideological goal that lacks any practical justification.

Why is healthcare being prioritised in this way? Investments in the healthcare and biopharma sector remain at the top of the agenda for the government alongside a deliberate programme of partnerships, which are aimed at bringing the best-in-class to Abu Dhabi. We’re confident that these partnerships will help us to bolster our global collaboration in healthcare. The ambition is to ensure Abu Dhabi is a globally recognised destination for trusted and advanced healthcare infrastructure, with a track record of excellence and fast-growing, data-enabled services. One example of this approach is being delivered by Malaffi, the region’s first health information exchange platform, which securely links all of Abu Dhabi’s hospitals. Malaffi now connects 2 billion unique medical records from more than 7 million patients who have received treatment in Abu Dhabi. The healthcare sector in the country is dynamic and constantly evolving so responsible innovation is allowing us to meet evolving population needs. Abu Dhabi is focussing on expanding the role that technology plays throughout the healthcare sector, and entities like the Department of Health play a leading role in the country’s 10-year digital transformation strategy. As part of this strategy, we have been consistently funding research and investing in cutting-edge technologies, with the impact of this investment expanding beyond our country into the region and the world. For instance, in 2023, the Federal Ministry of Finance allocated Dh4.8 billion ($1.3 billion) to the national healthcare sector, 7.6% of the total annual budget. Live Events This has been further supported through the establishment of a Research and Innovation Centre, which has a key role in attracting the world’s best researchers and innovators but also serves as a hub to advance global healthcare solutions. The centre covers areas such as genomics, big data, precision medicine, assistive technology, the Internet of medical things, nanomedicine, drug discovery, genetics, and epigenetics amongst others. This is about ensuring that Abu Dhabi and the UAE have one of the world’s best healthcare systems so that we can be ready to serve the nation’s needs in the future. ET Spotlight Q2: Growing and attracting healthcare talent—in clinical medicine and research and development—as well as creating centres of excellence is integral to the UAE Health 2071 strategy and remains crucial for future-proofing healthcare. How is the Abu Dhabi Department of Health (DoH) seeking to achieve success in this area? Human capital is an essential part of the overall system and we want to be in a position where we’re attracting the brightest and the best medical practitioners to the UAE, alongside the development of our homegrown talent. It’s a competitive environment and there are lots of nations who are also looking to replicate our success in this area. It’s something we need to continually focus upon. DoH is upskilling the right people as an essential prerequisite for implementing and ensuring the smooth application of advancement in the healthcare system. One of our key priorities in Abu Dhabi is to build a robust workforce that continues to attract the best talent to live and work in Abu Dhabi. As you’ve seen in the growth of the local population and the predictions for further rises, that strategy is working and more experts are choosing to base themselves in this region. We believe that the future of health lies in responsible innovation and its implementation. It is important not only to find solutions and technological advancements but also to embed them within our healthcare system while securing a highly skilled workforce to ensure the longevity and sustainability of the sector. We have been attracting talent and strengthening our partnerships with leading global healthcare providers and institutions to enable our capabilities at home. We are providing a hub for collaboration, responsible innovation, and investment that can make good health and quality care a universal standard. Our belief in those values is ensuring the UAE strategy comes to life and is delivered successfully. DoH knows that researchers and a highly qualified healthcare workforce are attracted to work in countries or cities that enjoy an agile regulatory ecosystem and can provide opportunities for advanced practices in the field whether in research, clinical trials/practice, leadership and management, or education. We aim to ensure that Abu Dhabi is seen as a global leader in that regard and events like ADGHW are integral to promoting that work amongst healthcare practitioners globally. Q3: Manufacturing capabilities are also central to building a self-sustaining infrastructure. How is the DoH working with global partners to size up its current health manufacturing capabilities? Our current partnerships span a variety of fields and aspects of healthcare where we seek collaboration on digitisation, genomics, and AI-based innovation solutions for diagnosis and treatment. The Department of Health works with local strategic partners such as the sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and international life science and tech companies such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche, AbbVie Biopharmaceutical, M42, Plug and Play, and so on. Those partnerships are critical to elevate our knowledge base and ensure we are consistently developing our capabilities. They have been integral to the improvements we’ve brought online in Abu Dhabi. That approach is prevalent in other areas such as the strategic partnership between the Cleveland Clinic and the Fatima bint Mubarak Centre, which is steering this collaboration and cooperation to leverage an advanced global research network and facilitate clinical trials, positioning Abu Dhabi at the forefront of personalised cancer treatment innovation. We are bringing internationally known brands together with local partners so that Abu Dhabi is not only a centre of excellence and home for responsible innovation, but also plays a role in developing healthcare knowledge globally. One of the best examples of partnership has been witnessed in the development of the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA), which is a PureHealth asset. It now encompasses over 14,000 staff, 14 hospitals, and more than 70 primary and ambulatory care clinics as of last year. It’s recognised as the largest healthcare service provider in Abu Dhabi and is an example of how PureHealth has helped to add scale to the healthcare sector here. PureHealth is also a partner of the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Centre (ADSCC), which successfully manufactured the UAE’s first CAR-T cells to treat an 11-year-old boy with leukemia last year. The engineered CAR-T cell therapies were recognised as a breakthrough in blood cancer treatment. The procedure involved manufacturing the cellular product (CAR-T), which relies on the use of immune cells from the patient, at ADSCC’s Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) laboratories. The treatment took five weeks and physicians withdrew the cells from the patient and genetically modified his immune cells in the laboratory to fight the cancer cells after intravenously injecting them into the patient. This example is just one area where Abu Dhabi has looked to innovate so that we can deliver solutions to patients. It’s an area we’re keen to develop further and innovation will remain a central component of our ongoing strategy. We want Abu Dhabi to be a place where manufacturing companies operating in the healthcare space recognise that this is the best site to be based to further their own ambitions. Q4: Health research is a priority to the UAE , growing at a rate three times faster than the global average with 80% of health research published by the UAE being conducted in partnership with international institutions. How is ADGHW accelerating synergies and what opportunities is that providing? Abu Dhabi has sought to grow its thriving medical education and training capacity by offering top-quality education across its academic institutions, bolstered by key partnerships with leading international medical schools and programs. As a result, we currently have 16 research universities and more than 72 authorized facilities to conduct human subject research. Strategic international partnerships are an essential part of our approach to local capacity building in the healthcare system. In a world where individuals can receive different care depending on their location, we aim to make good health and quality care a universal standard. In addition, we’re seeing that cross-border cooperation is also a key driver to bringing forward the future of healthcare – equipping us with the solutions and resilience needed to solve tomorrow’s challenges. Borderless collaboration and access to digital tools in healthcare are a global responsibility that benefits everyone. DoH believes that the future of health will lie in innovation and its implementation. It is important not only to find solutions and technological advancements but also to embed them within our healthcare system here in Abu Dhabi while securing a highly skilled workforce to ensure the longevity and sustainability of the sector. We have been strengthening our partnerships with leading global healthcare providers and institutions to enable our capabilities at home and provide a hub for collaboration, responsible innovation, and investment to make good health and quality care a universal standard. That work has also created opportunities in the digital space. There’s now an Abu Dhabi Life Science Hub in the Metaverse, which marks the virtual presence and headquarters for DoH and is allowing for the seamless facilitation of virtual consultations and services, the cultivation of deeper interconnectivity, and the stimulation of interactions amongst all stakeholders in the life sciences industry. That investment is providing a place where entrepreneurs, investors, medical professionals, and authorities are not just welcomed but actively encouraged to engage in the exchange of knowledge and ideas at the hub. It’s allowing DoH to interact with partners around the world to inspire and enable leaders from across disciplines and geographies to achieve a bold, collective vision for a brighter future of global health. Q5: The UAE has developed strategies involving all health authorities and laws to promote public health. Where does the UAE see the protection of patient rights in a world where AI and data will increasingly have no borders in the future? In a world where technologies are consistently pushing the boundaries of global healthcare, whether through digitalisation, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR), or other advancements, Abu Dhabi remains dedicated to the relentless pursuit of revolutionising its healthcare sector to exceed top international standards. Those standards ensure the protection of data, and we hold patient rights in the highest regard, as you would expect of any leading healthcare authority. The landscape of healthcare is undergoing a profound transformation with the arrival of precision medicine and personalised healthcare, moving from reactive treatment of disease to a more proactive and personalised view of individual and human health. These advancements are ushering in a new era of tailored and targeted interventions to enhance individual health outcomes. That’s where we see the development of AI and data solutions having their greatest impact and that’s the data that we seek to harness to ensure patient care is ahead of the curve and understanding where we can target necessary healthcare needs. Precision medicine is not a trend; it will be a revolutionary paradigm shift in healthcare. It involves understanding the unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that contribute to an individual's health profile. This approach recognises that 'one size fits all' does not apply to medicine, and each person's health journey is distinct. It means tailoring medical interventions based on an individual's genetic make-up, optimising drug selection, dosage, and treatment modalities. The goal is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and deliver healthcare that is truly personalised for each patient. That is one of the many reasons why DoH is seeking to collaborate on AI-based innovation solutions for diagnosis and treatment. Microsoft recently announced a $1.5 billion investment in Abu Dhabi and M42, one of the partners for ADGHW. An investment of that scale again demonstrates that this region can become a centrepiece for research and essential development into AI, leading to enhanced patient care. Q6: ADGHW will showcase Abu Dhabi’s healthcare system as an increasingly attractive regional and global medical tourism and healthcare investment destination. What investment flows are currently moving between India and the UAE and what trends are being noticed in this area going forward? India remains a key target market for the UAE where the nation is recognised as the seventh-largest investor in India, reflecting the historic and geographical ties between the two countries. Over US$ 18 billion was invested in the country during 2023 and that continues an ongoing pattern between the two nations. The healthcare sector in India is already estimated to be worth around US$ 372 billion so the existing links and the opportunity between our two nations are evident. There are many reasons why India has been able to grow the healthcare sector such as affordable treatments and the use of advanced technology, alongside its access to international markets but its ability to export that knowledge has also enabled Abu Dhabi to benefit and develop its own medical offer. Looking at trends, as well as the developments seen in precision medicine, both countries are dealing with similar issues and looking to share their knowledge and develop solutions. We’re both facing aging populations where chronic disease management will be integral to the future healthcare system and services. We are also witnessing a substantial increase in chronic diseases, coupled with a demographic shift towards an aging population. As life expectancy increases, we see a growing need for long-term care and support services. Addressing issues related to mobility, cognitive health, and maintaining a good quality of life as the population ages becomes paramount. However, we seek not just to treat illnesses, but to provide holistic and preventative care that enhances the overall well-being of our population. Healthcare dynamics are evolving all the time. It’s a dynamic sector so constant responsible innovation is required to keep meeting the needs of an evolving population and we share similar situations both here in the UAE and India. We will continue to work closely with Indian healthcare researchers, policymakers, technologists, and healthcare industry leaders and experts on these opportunities in the years to come, and our partnerships there are some of the strongest we have. Investors and healthcare providers from the Indian sub-continent were some of the main partners at ADGHW and we’re confident those relationships will stay strong in the years ahead.

Mariano and Representative John J. Lawn Jr., House chair of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, spoke to the critical nature of their proposed reforms to the Commonwealth’s health care system and recommitted their body to ensuring high-quality, affordable health care for all Massachusetts residents. We applaud the Legislature for taking on this necessary challenge in response, in part, to the Steward Health Care crisis. With Steward declaring bankruptcy and the future of its hospital network in question, physician associates, also known as physician assistants, must be able to practice with more flexibility in response to system needs and to preserve patient access to care. Massachusetts is home to more than 4,800 PAs, who work across all medical settings and collaborate with physicians and other health care professionals using a team practice model. A common-sense bill eliminating the requirement for PAs to have a supervising physician on file with the Commonwealth would remove an outdated barrier to practice while addressing the root of some of the inefficiencies in our health care system. Removing the supervising physician requirement at the state level would allow PAs to provide the best possible team-based care at the practice level. This administrative change would reduce unnecessary bureaucratic overhead at a time when access to reliable, quality care is most at risk. In light of lawmakers’ stated commitments to health care reform, we call on the Legislature to pass the Senate bill allowing PAs to practice at the top of their licenses while fulfilling their core mission of caring for patients.

Allos and Blair Dawson To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. Article Insights McDonald Hopkins are most popular: within Family and Matrimonial topic(s) with readers working within the Media & Information industries Reproductive privacy has received a boost with additional protections. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently issued a final rule, the 2024 Privacy Rule, to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to support reproductive health care privacy. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that led to many state abortion bans and other restrictions on reproductive freedom, the Final Rule is aimed at strengthening protection for individuals seeking reproductive health care. The application of its changes is narrowly tailored to certain limited circumstances involving lawful reproductive health care and clarifies that covered entities and business associates are not expected to know or be aware of laws other than those with which they are required to comply with. The Final Rule underscores the importance of safeguarding patients' rights and ensuring equitable access to reproductive health services. The Final Rule also expands protections for individuals accessing reproductive health care services, particularly concerning privacy and nondiscrimination. It defines reproductive health broadly to include healthcare “that affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.” It prohibits covered entities and business associates from discriminating against individuals based on their reproductive health decisions or the types of health care services they receive. It also prohibits covered entities and business associates from “conducting a criminal, civil, or administrative investigation into or impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care, where such health care is lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided; or the identification of any person for the purpose of conducting such investigation or imposing such liability.” Under the new rule, covered entities and business associates are required to implement robust privacy safeguards to protect individuals' sensitive health information related to reproductive health care. This includes implementing secure communication channels and strict confidentiality measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of such information. By strengthening privacy protections, the Final Rule aims to instill confidence among patients and encourage them to seek the care they need without fear of their sensitive information being disclosed outside of their relationship with their health care provider. One of the primary goals of this rule is to ensure equitable access to reproductive health care services for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, or reproductive choices. Covered entities and business associates are prohibited from denying services, imposing additional costs, or restricting access based on discriminatory practices. To ensure compliance with the new rule, the OCR will conduct audits and investigations to assess how well covered entities adhere to HIPAA regulations regarding reproductive health care. The Final Rule requires covered entities and business associates to revise their Notice of Privacy Practices to support reproductive health care privacy. Compliance is required by Dec. 23, 2024, except for updates to the Notice of Privacy Practices, which must be completed by Feb. 16, 2026. Non-compliance may result in penalties, corrective action plans, or other enforcement measures Covered entities and business associates should identify where reproductive health is located in the protected health information, review and update policies and procedures, implement secure communication channels, provide staff training and education on these changes, and monitor and audit compliance with HIPAA regulations regarding reproductive health information. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Authors Aysha F. Allos Blair Dawson"

The global private equity major is likely to invest about $150 million, or Rs 1,250 crore, to acquire about 26% stake in Infinx, two people aware of the development told ET. ""We expect this sector (healthcare BPO) to continue growing in India, driven by global demand, and believe that Infinx is well placed to meet this gap through its tech-enabled solutions,"" Akshay Tanna , partner and head of India private equity at KKR, told ET. ""We will draw on our local knowledge and healthcare expertise to support Infinx's growth and build a healthcare platform, including through organic and inorganic growth strategies."" He refused to disclose further details, but said India is one of the world's top providers of healthcare RCM solutions, given the depth of local talent and range of quality solutions. KKR is looking to build Infinx into a platform by doing bolt-on acquisitions - or, acquisition of smaller companies in the same line of business - over time and grow it, said one of the people cited above. Based in San Jose, Infinx Healthcare works with medical billing companies, radiology groups, physician practices and long-term care pharmacies, providing complete revenue cycle management (RCM) solutions. Live Events RCM refers to the process of identifying, collecting, and managing incoming payments. Launched in 2012 as Tandon Information Solutions , Infinx is also into medical transcription, eligibility and benefit verification, complete medical billing, medical coding (across specialty) and comprehensive account receivable management services. It has presence in four major cities in India and an employee base of over 4,000. ""KKR's investment is a testament to Infinx's success over the past decade,"" said Jaideep Tandon, chief executive of Infinx Healthcare . ""Success of our customers is central to us at Infinx and with KKR's support and experience in healthcare and technology we will be able to strengthen our capabilities to deliver innovative, AI-backed solutions to accelerate Infinx's growth, and help healthcare providers to provide exceptional care to their patients,"" he added. Headquartered in Mumbai and Silicon Valley, Tandon incubates startups in India. Its operating companies include Infinx Healthcare, Isharya and Syrma Technology . One of its startups, FreeCharge was sold to Snapdeal in 2015 for Rs 2,400 crore, which is regarded as one of the largest internet M&A deals in India. Founded in 1975, the group has invested in startups including payment gateway Razorpay , goods delivery platform Porter , used car platform Spinny , fast food delivery service Daily Ninja, and pharmacy Generico. It is promoted by chairman Manohar Lal Tandon, and his sons Sandeep, Jaideep and Sudeep who play leadership roles at Tandon Group . KKR has been an active investor in the healthcare sector globally. Early this month, it acquired Indian medical devices company Healthium Medtech (formerly Sutures India) from Apax Partners for Rs 7,000 crore ($840 million) enterprise value, outbidding a consortium of Mankind Pharma and ChrysCapital.

A young doctor recently took to social media to bemoan a lack of electricity, making it difficult for her to get ready for work, while the relative of a patient elsewhere complained about a 36-hour wait in a hospital ward for their octogenarian mother to be seen. And no, this was not Limpopo, these incidences were in Liverpool and London, England. Equitable universal healthcare for everyone, including here in South Africa, would be ideal, but what these UK examples show is that, even in well-funded countries, implementing and maintaining a public health system is increasingly difficult. The National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, currently in proposal phase in SA, is a roadmap to universal healthcare. But it has come under sharp scrutiny for its lack of detail and financial modelling. The right to healthcare, but … Professor Emeritus Martin Veller, former dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Wits, says that the birth of democracy sparked the idea of universal healthcare, but that the last 30 years have shown tthat it may not be possible. “The principle of NHI is one that is certainly widely recognised as a need, as it is enshrined in our Constitution. How you implement and interpret it is the problem. Certainly, in its current format, it is unlikely to be possible to implement,” says Veller. The main issue he cites is that the vast sum of funding needed to meet the basic tenets of universal healthcare is not available to government. “Secondly, there are insufficient healthcare professionals to care for the population,” he says, adding that overarching a project of this scale is the “poor track record of how the public sector has been run for the last 60 to 70 years, particularly for the disenfranchised in our society. NHI is not in their favour.” Veller adds, “Also missing from the discussion are our current healthcare outcomes, which are poor – way below the level of other countries with similar economies. A better healthcare system means that health outcomes, and as a result, the economy, would improve, but the NHI bill is being dangled like a carrot to win favour, despite its obvious limitations.” “What’s not mentioned is that true universal healthcare has never been achieved anywhere in the world – bottomless funding from the public purse is unrealistic. In the UK, you can wait several years for a hip replacement, during which time your quality of life declines along with your ability to earn an income. It is an interesting cycle; when the amount of money spent on an individual is linked to their earning potential.” Sectoral and systemic overhaul needed Adjunct Professor Alex van den Heever, the Chair of Social Security Systems Administration and Management Studies in the Wits School of Governance, is frank about the “grandiose proposal” that the NHI Bill in its current format represents. “It’s a paper plan. It’s not a real proposal. The problem is that the institutional and fiscal elements are not aligned. It is unrealistic and unimplementable and comes on the back of years of government having done very little in the healthcare system,” he says. Van den Heever stresses that there has also been no significant structural reform of systems or infrastructure in the public healthcare sector to entice private healthcare to integrate. “This is not how you access the private sector intelligence. Sophisticated design is needed,” he says. These experts agree that many people do not realise that the NHI proposals in circulation aim to centralise the health budget, eliminating current provincial mandates: “To put healthcare into a centralised government structure has enormous implications for the public sector,” says Van den Heever. “It is not based on the way our systems are designed, nor on the way health systems are designed around the world. The risk of the NHI being run like Eskom is mammoth.” He adds that patronage, the capture of public entities, and political interference, that all cause massive collapse and failure of any system, pose too great a risk. What’s the solution? Veller says a pragmatic approach could work. “We have to accept that we have a two-tier healthcare system that needs closer alignment. It is simply not fair that 85% of the population is denied access to what just 15% have in private healthcare. We must progressively find a way of integrating the two systems.” He says that the NHI should not be funded by increased taxation and that other means of income should be found to improve healthcare. “From a universal access to healthcare perspective, we must be able to guarantee that the current dispensation not only guarantees healthcare for everyone, but also quality healthcare and outcomes.” “We must fix the existing healthcare system. The NHI can be achieved only if what we already have is repaired. First, professionalise and depoliticise healthcare – that means the right people, doing the right job, under the right circumstances. Every cent spent, must be well spent.” While Veller is in favour of a universal healthcare system, he says there is work to be done before we reach a functional option. “It is high time that the public healthcare sector is properly administered and that systems are adequately audited. We must really start looking at incorporating academic health systems into the sector. Where medicine is practised under academia, it is improved and is better for everyone. There is no doubt that academic healthcare is worldclass and should be integrated into the public sector more rigorously.” Veller says that “at the institutional and individual level, we must incentivise excellence. Measure outcomes and incentivise people to do their jobs well, which happens in Thailand and Sweden.” To make the NHI work, Veller advocates: In the short term: We must improve what we have and make it work, and really work. Get rid of political interference that has prevented it from achieving good outcomes. In the medium term: An incremental introduction of private sector participation and buying of services by the public sector. Pricing and competition must be good and that will encourage the public sector to improve, too. If there is good quality control, there will be a gradual integration of the two. Long term: Integration. It is simply not appropriate in a country like ours that most healthcare needs cannot be accessed by a large majority of the population. Improved healthcare outcomes have been demonstrated to make economies grow across the world. The question is how to achieve universal healthcare but not the NHI, which requires a funding mechanism. He concludes: “As it stands, the NHI is unaffordable. The proposal must evolve beyond theoretical constructs. A pragmatic approach, informed by systems understanding and decentralised governance, is essential.” Only then can we bridge the gap between aspiration and implementation, thereby ensuring equitable healthcare for all South Africans."

Within this framework lies Nigeria, a nation where the pursuit of specialised medical care often traverses rugged terrains, encountering barriers that impede timely diagnoses and effective treatment plans. Yet, decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment plans and surgical procedures always carry significant weight, impacting the well-being and lives of patients. Given the complexity and variability of medical conditions, seeking a second opinion has emerged as a crucial practice in ensuring optimal healthcare outcomes. A second opinion in healthcare refers to the process of seeking input or advice from another qualified healthcare professional regarding a medical diagnosis or treatment plan. It involves consulting with a different doctor or specialist, often after receiving an initial diagnosis or treatment recommendation from a primary healthcare provider, with the purpose of seeking a second opinion is to obtain additional perspectives, confirm the accuracy of the initial diagnosis, explore alternative treatment options, or gain reassurance about the proposed course of action. Obtaining a second opinion has become increasingly recognised as a fundamental right and prudent practice in healthcare. One, misdiagnosis and diagnostic errors pose significant risks to patient safety and well-being. Studies have shown that diagnostic errors contribute to a substantial portion of adverse events and patient harm in healthcare settings. Seeking a second opinion can help mitigate diagnostic errors by providing an additional perspective, expertise, and scrutiny of clinical findings. This collaborative approach enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and ensures that patients receive appropriate and timely interventions. Healthcare is not one-size-fits-all, and treatment approaches can vary based on individual patient characteristics, preferences and underlying medical conditions. A second opinion offers patients the opportunity to explore alternative treatment options, verify the appropriateness of recommended treatments, and make informed decisions aligned with their values and goals. Additionally, in cases of complex or rare diseases, seeking multiple opinions can help tailor treatment plans to the unique needs of each patient, fostering personalised care and improving treatment outcomes. Read Also: Shettima charges pilgrims on global diplomacy, positive Nigerian values Empowering patients to actively participate in their healthcare decisions is central to patient-centered care. Seeking a second opinion empowers patients to advocate for their health, ask questions, and engage in shared decision-making with healthcare providers. By obtaining multiple perspectives and information sources, patients gain a deeper understanding of their medical condition, prognosis, and treatment options, enabling them to make informed decisions that align with their preferences and values. This sense of agency and autonomy fosters trust between patients and healthcare providers and enhances patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment plans. Healthcare professionals, like all humans, are susceptible to cognitive biases, knowledge gaps and variations in clinical judgment. Peer review and collaboration among healthcare providers are essential mechanisms for quality assurance and continuous improvement in healthcare delivery. Seeking a second opinion encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge sharing and professional accountability among healthcare providers. It serves as a safeguard against individual biases or blind spots, promoting evidence-based practice, adherence to clinical guidelines, and the highest standards of care. Amid a rising demand for top-tier healthcare solutions in Nigeria, Medvisit, a leading medical tourism company, has stepped forward with an innovative solution: international second opinion services. This groundbreaking offering provides individuals with access to a global network of board-certified specialists, ensuring swift and accurate evaluations of their medical conditions and treatment plans.

Gbenga Olaniyi, the Operations Manager of Medvisit, explained the rationale behind launching this service, pointing to the significant healthcare challenges encountered by many Nigerians. The genesis of Medvisit’s initiative lies in acknowledging these hurdles, especially the obstacles in accessing specialised medical care domestically. Through the introduction of international second opinion services, Medvisit endeavours to bridge this divide, empowering individuals with the expertise requisite for making informed healthcare decisions. “We aimed to bridge this gap by providing a platform that connects individuals with world-class healthcare providers and medical experts from around the globe. MedVisit strives to address the unmet healthcare needs of Nigerians by offering them access to advanced medical treatments and second opinions from renowned specialists.” Olaniyi emphasised that clients seeking a second opinion through Medvisit undergo a seamless process managed by a dedicated Care Team. Initially, clients submit their medical records, test results, and pertinent information. Subsequently, the team meticulously evaluates the case, matching the client with the most suitable specialist or group of specialists based on their unique medical condition and requirements. “The client’s information is securely shared with the selected specialist(s), who thoroughly review the case and provide their expert opinion, including recommendations for diagnosis, treatment options, or further investigative steps. We match clients with specialists, by considering a few factors such as the nature of their medical condition, the specialist’s area of expertise, and availability. We also consider the client’s preferences, such as gender or cultural considerations.” Regarding client evaluation, he emphasised their commitment to timely assessments and decision-making in medical scenarios. Medvisit has established efficient processes and dedicated case managers who closely monitor and follow up with their network of specialists. Second opinions and treatment plans are delivered promptly within a reasonable timeframe, with a focus on prioritising urgent cases and facilitating expedited evaluations when necessary. In terms of confidentiality, he assured that Medvisit prioritises the protection of sensitive medical information. Strict protocols and data security measures are in place, including encrypted communication channels, secure data storage, and access controls. Team members undergo training to ensure strict adherence to confidentiality guidelines, thereby safeguarding patient privacy and confidentiality. “We partner with local healthcare providers in destination countries to ensure compliance with regulations and facilitate seamless medical travel experiences. We place a strong emphasis on continuous improvement through feedback mechanisms. We actively solicit feedback from our clients through surveys, interviews, and open communication channels. Medvisit utilises secure video conferencing platforms for consultations, online portals for document sharing, and translation tools to bridge language gaps.” Highlighting the importance of accessibility and affordability in healthcare, he stressed that despite its expense, MedVisit prioritises making high-quality medical care available to all, irrespective of socio-economic status or location. Through partnerships with hospitals and specialists worldwide, MedVisit ensures that individuals have access to quality care at varying price points across different regions. Addressing misconceptions about seeking second opinions, he noted concerns that it might offend current healthcare providers. However, he emphasised that second opinions are standard practice globally, encouraged by professionals to ensure optimal care. MedVisit aims to dispel such notions by empowering individuals to actively engage in their healthcare decisions, recognising the value of diverse insights in achieving better outcomes. Looking ahead, he outlined MedVisit’s vision to become a global leader in medical tourism and second opinion services. Rooted in Nigeria, MedVisit seeks to expand its reach internationally, leveraging technology to overcome geographical barriers and deliver exceptional healthcare solutions globally.

ADGHW serves as a vital platform for healthcare policymakers globally, fostering the exchange of best practices and knowledge transfer among international counterparts, including those from India and beyond. Through interactive sessions, from panel discussions to workshops, and networking events, we encourage open dialogue among thought leaders, enabling them to learn from each other and collectively address challenges facing the industry. Beyond the summit, our ambition is for the event to act as an always-on platform for open, inclusive exchange and joint action for a healthier world. By leveraging Abu Dhabi's leading investments in healthcare and biopharma, along with strategic partnerships such as the recent MoU with India's Ministry of Health, ADGHW seeks to strengthen global collaboration in healthcare and drive meaningful advancements in healthcare policy and practice. As one example, in early 2024, the UAE signed an MoU with the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to further develop areas of precision health or personalised healthcare based on a person’s unique genetic, genomic, or biological composition to help achieve optimal health. The development of a genomic centre of excellence is being evaluated as one of the potential projects under the partnership. Such initiatives highlight Abu Dhabi’s commitment to embrace opportunities for shared learning and innovation, ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes for people worldwide. Q3: Abu Dhabi is fast becoming the leading regional centre for healthcare and life sciences research and innovation, with a wide range of fast-growing research opportunities across various focus areas, including big data, precision medicine, drug discovery, advanced therapies, biomedicine, genetics, and others. What challenges is DoH facing as it seeks to become a global leader in healthcare? As Abu Dhabi emerges as a regional hub for healthcare and life sciences, we are witnessing various opportunities for growth towards global leadership. We recognise the importance of nurturing a skilled workforce and attracting top talent amidst global competition. Adequate funding, infrastructure, and support services are crucial for fostering innovation. Agile regulatory frameworks also play a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity of healthcare and life sciences research. While navigating complex regulatory processes presents challenges, Abu Dhabi views this as an opportunity to uphold safety, efficacy, and compliance standards while adapting to emerging technologies and innovative therapies. The Emirati Genome Programme, with over 500,000 samples sequenced, stands as the world’s largest of its kind. Launched in 2019, it aims to develop a genetic map for UAE citizens, accelerating preventive and diagnostic healthcare solutions for current and future generations. Collaboration and partnerships play a pivotal role in fostering innovation and tackling healthcare challenges, requiring concerted efforts from academia, industry, healthcare providers, and government agencies, both domestically and internationally. Over the past years, the DoH has forged seven genomics partnership agreements with leading institutions worldwide, including Boston Children’s Hospital, Roche, and GlaxoSmithKline, to amplify research efforts and leverage diverse expertise in advancing healthcare solutions. Achieving seamless integration and coordination across the healthcare ecosystem is fundamental for delivering patient-centred care and translating research into practice. Despite challenges in promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange, maximising the impact of research and innovation on patient outcomes remains a primary focus. Q4: The UAE is already recognised as the Middle East’s premier commercial hub, known for the scale of government-backed opportunities and its ease of doing business. Why is healthcare seen as such a vital part of its future development? Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector stands out as an advanced and thriving industry. Over the years, this sector has made significant contributions to Abu Dhabi's GDP, with a consistent upward trend, driven by government initiatives aimed at attracting private investment. As a result, the Emirate has witnessed the establishment of numerous international hospital brands and healthcare facilities, including the Cleveland Clinic and the NYU Abu Dhabi Public Health Research Centre. The UAE's aspiration to become a leading destination for medical tourism also aligns with its broader healthcare goals. Abu Dhabi, in particular, is actively working to bolster its healthcare segment, capitalising on its advanced infrastructure and quality of care to attract medical tourists from around the world. On average, more than 15,000 visitors travel to the emirate for medical tourism annually. Government budget allocations for healthcare in 2023 remained consistent with the previous year, totalling Dh4.8 billion ($1.3 billion) and representing 7.6% of the total annual budget. This sustained investment underscores the government's commitment to prioritising the well-being of its citizens and residents. Q5: Abu Dhabi has been recognised as a leading and fastest-growing startup ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) thanks to factors such as the UAE’s strategic location and long-term residency (Golden Visa) programme. What further steps will be implemented to ensure that it retains its attractiveness to healthcare investors? The DoH actively support startups, recognising their potential to enrich the healthcare sector with innovation and expertise. Guiding these businesses from inception to global expansion, in 2023, we supported and enabled over 70 licensed startups and collaborated with more than 450 disruptor companies globally. A testament to our success is the remarkable 35.8% growth of our life-science cluster year on year in 2023, fostering innovation, attracting investment, and creating a vibrant ecosystem for healthcare advancement. In our pursuit of enhancing healthcare services in Abu Dhabi, we prioritise investment in primary care. Foreign investment is a central component of the sector’s outlook. The UAE issued a Federal Law on Foreign Direct Investment (No. 16 for 2020) which grants foreign investors ownership up to 100%. That is helping Abu Dhabi build a great healthcare system that supports the population's needs through high-quality investments in the healthcare market. ADGHW is a welcoming platform for startups and international partnerships to enhance our primary care services and support clinical research across the UAE. From genomics to translational research, we accelerate innovation to benefit patients globally. It's an exciting time in healthcare here, and we're committed to delivering meaningful results for patients in the long term. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Grushkin’s articles from Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton are most popular: with readers working within the Advertising & Public Relations industries Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton are most popular: within Compliance topic(s) As we previewed last year regarding SB 184 and the establishment of the California Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA), California now has taken a significant regulatory step aimed at restraining growth in health care costs. On April 24, 2024, OHCA's board (the ""Board"") voted to implement its long anticipated statewide health care cost target, beginning with a 3.5% cap on spending growth in 2025 and decreasing in the following years. As with OHCA's cost and market impact review (CMIR) reporting regime, 1 this cap will apply to ""health care entities,"" which include providers such as hospitals, facilities, outpatient clinics, large physician groups and clinical laboratories, payors and fully integrated delivery systems. Background on Cost Targets California joins several other states that have implemented a health care cost growth cap or target law, including Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. 2 In these states, cost-growth targets or caps have ranged from 2.8% to 5.1%. 3 As a general matter, the cost growth cap model functions as a percentage cap for year-over-year growth tied to certain economic indicators, such as total state domestic product, inflation or median family income. California's cost target is based on the average growth rate of median family income from 2002 to 2022, with the idea that ""health care spending should not grow faster than the incomes of California families."" 4 OHCA originally proposed starting with a 3% cost target based on median family income, but following comments from industry stakeholders, the cost target approved by the Board provides a glide path approach that gradually reaches 3% over a five year period. See the table below for particular targets established for certain years. 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 and after 3.5% (non-enforceable) 3.5% 3.2% 3.2% 3.0% Enforcement Consistent with the framework set in SB 184, OHCA's enacting legislation, the cost target for 2025 is non-enforceable. For years 2026 and after, however, OHCA will have the authority to take enforcement action against health care entities that exceed the boundary of the target. Enforcement measures available to OHCA include compelling noncompliant entities to give an explanation at public meetings, requiring the implementation performance improvement plans, and/or assessing administrative penalties. SB 184 makes payor data on health care expenditures the primary source of data relating to cost growth, and payors will be required to submit data on total heath care expenditures starting on September 1, 2024. Nevertheless, OHCA has the authority to collect data as needed from additional sources, including other state agencies (including the Department of Health Care Services and the Department of Managed Health Care) as well as health care providers. What's Next? The statewide cost target is just one cost target that OHCA is responsible for implementing. In the coming years, OHCA will develop non-statewide targets, which will include sector specific targets, and potentially geographical targets and targets associated with individual health care entities. In the meantime, we will keep our readers posted on any important activity and developments related to OHCA's new cost target regime, including any trends related to data collection and enforcement.

According to one of them, companies that control a market can lower the quality of their products with impunity. However, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) , a drugmaker with a monopoly in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, hasn't done that -- quite the contrary. Since it launched its first CF product some 12 years ago, the biotech hasn't stopped innovating and improving its lineup. And it still isn't done. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is making steady progress toward earning approval for a new CF medicine. Stellar clinical trial results CF is a rare disease that disrupts the proper functioning of internal organs, including the lungs and the pancreas. Though standards of care existed before Vertex, the biotech developed the only medicines in the world that target the underlying genetic causes of the illness. Its success in the past 12 years directly results from this work, though many have tried to emulate it. VRTX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts . So far, no other drugmaker has successfully challenged Vertex Pharmaceuticals in this area. And while others still struggle to produce positive clinical trial results in CF, Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't have that problem. In February, the biotech released data from several phase 3 studies for its next-gen CF therapy, vanza triple. The study pitted this newer product against Trikafta, which was itself a groundbreaking medicine capable of treating up to 90% of CF patients, approved in 2019. During the trial, vanza triple showed non-inferiority against Trikafta in improving lung functions in CF patients. In layman's terms, the trial candidate did not perform worse than the compared drug (in this case, Trikafta) by more than a pre-specified amount. Furthermore, the new therapy was superior in reducing sweat chloride, the presence of which, in high levels, often indicates CF. Here's the kicker: While Trikafta is taken twice a day, vanza triple boasts a convenient once-daily dosing. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently announced regulatory submissions for vanza triple in the U.S., and in Europe for patients six years and older, with more applications on the way. Looking beyond CF Trikafta is currently responsible for practically all of Vertex's sales. In the first quarter, the company's revenue increased by 13% to $2.7 billion. Trikafta revenue accounted for 92% of that total. Vanza triple will likely attract many eligible patients and somewhat cannibalize Trikafta's sales; according to some estimates, it could generate sales of $1.26 billion by 2028. Since this product will address a share of the market Vertex Pharmaceuticals already owns, it wouldn't substantially improve its prospects. Story Continues But more importantly, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is once again flexing its innovative muscles and succeeding where others keep failing. The biotech is now expanding its areas of focus. It recently earned approval for Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy developed with CRISPR Therapeutics . It started a rolling submission in the U.S. for suzetrigine, a treatment for acute pain. Vertex also kicked off a phase 3 study for inaxaplin to treat APOL-1 mediated kidney disease. This program looks particularly exciting. There are no approved therapies that treat the underlying causes of this disease. Yet Vertex Pharmaceuticals estimates that 100,000 patients suffer from it, more than the 92,000 CF patients in its target geographies. Could Vertex Pharmaceuticals repeat the success it had in CF with inaxaplin? Maybe, but the company's prospects don't depend on a single product or pipeline candidate. The bottom line is Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a well-run, innovative biotech company that should continue delivering market-beating returns for a long time.

Article Insights This article from Greenberg Traurig, LLP is most popular: within Food, Drugs, Healthcare and Life Sciences topic(s) On April 26, 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) published the HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy Final Rule (Final Rule) modifying the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Final Rule is effective June 25, 2024. Covered entities and business associates must be compliant with the Final Rule by Dec. 23, 2024. For context, in response to the June 24, 2022, U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (Dobbs) , OCR issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making April 17, 2023, to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule in order to better support the privacy of protected health information (PHI) related to reproductive health care (Proposed Rule). In light of Dobbs , OCR expressed concern that the confidentiality of reproductive health care information could be compromised or otherwise impacted by those who wished to use a person's reproductive health care information to conduct criminal, civil, or administrative investigations or to impose criminal, civil, or administrative liabilities on a person for the ""mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care that is lawful under the circumstances in which it is provided."" 1 OCR states that the Final Rule is intended to promote trust between individuals and health care providers and to support greater access to reproductive health care. New Definitions The Final Rule adopts several key definitions around reproductive health care. A ""person"" is defined as a legal entity or a ""human being who is born alive,"" thereby excluding fertilized eggs, embryos, and fetuses. ""Public health,"" for the purposes of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, means population-level activities to prevent disease in and promote the health of populations. Expressly carved out from the definition of ""public health"" is conducting criminal, civil, or administrative investigation or imposing criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any person for the act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating health care. ""Reproductive health care"" is defined as health care ""that affects the health of an individual in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes."" 2 Importantly, the new HIPAA definition of ""reproductive health care"" expressly provides that it shall not be construed to set forth a standard of care for reproductive health care. Purpose-Based Prohibition As originally set forth in the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule imposes a ""purpose-based prohibition"" on certain uses and disclosures of PHI related to reproductive health care. Covered entities and business associates are now prohibited from using or disclosing PHI for certain ""Prohibited Purposes"": To conduct criminal, civil, or administrative investigations into a person or to impose criminal, civil, or administrative liabilities on a person ""for the mere act of seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care ;"" 3 and To identify any person for any purpose described above. These purpose-based prohibitions apply either when the reproductive health care is lawful in the state where it is provided or when the care is ""protected, required, or authorized by Federal law, including the United States Constitution."" The Final Rule also imposes a presumption that all reproductive health care is lawful in a state unless the covered entity or business associate has (i) actual knowledge that the care was not lawful ""under the circumstances in which it was provided""; or (ii) received factual information from the person requesting the use or disclosure of the information that demonstrates a substantial factual basis that the care was not lawful ""under the specific circumstances in which it was provided."" Attestations In order facilitate compliance with this new purpose-based prohibition, OCR has conditioned a regulated entity's use or disclosure of reproductive health care PHI on its receipt of an attestation by the requesting party that the use or disclosure of the information is for a permissible or Prohibited Purpose. Attestations will be required when a request is made relative to health oversight activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, law enforcement purposes, and disclosure to coroners or medical examiners. OCR is clear that failure to comply with the new requirement could result in an enforcement action. Requesting parties may be subject to criminal liabilities if they knowingly obtain reproductive health care PHI in violation of HIPAA. Covered entities and business associates that permit the use or disclosure of reproductive health care PHI based on a defective attestation will also be viewed as having violated the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In terms of on-the-ground efforts to achieve compliance, regulated entities should take note that OCR will view compound attestations as defective and noncompliant. Notice of Privacy Practices (NPPs) The Final Rule also changes the HIPAA NPP requirements. These changes were previewed in February 2024, when HHS published the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Final Rule , which implemented changes to 42 C.F.R. Part 2 (Part 2) and reserved Part 2-related modifications of the HIPAA NPP requirement to this Final Rule. Specifically, the Final Rule implements the following changes to the HIPAA NPP relating to reproductive health care PHI 4 : The NPP must describe the types of uses and disclosures for which a reproductive health care PHI attestation is required, and provide an example; The NPP must describe the types of uses and disclosures that are not permitted due to their Prohibited Purposes, and provide an example; and The NPP must provide a statement notifying an individual that PHI disclosed pursuant to the HIPAA Privacy Rule may be redisclosed and no longer protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule (akin to the existing HIPAA authorization content requirement). Personal Representative Treatment The Final Rule also broadens a covered entity's discretion in deciding to treat someone as an individual's personal representative if, in the covered entity's professional judgment, such treatment is not in the best interests of the individual. HIPAA has long permitted covered entities to take such action upon a reasonable belief that someone could endanger the individual or that the individual has been or may be subjected to violence, abuse, or neglect by the person. The Final Rule limits covered entity discretion by stating that a covered entity does not have a reasonable belief for these purposes ""if the basis for their belief is the provision or facilitation of reproductive health care by such person for and at the request of the individual."" 5 In other words, OCR has determined that the HIPAA Privacy Rule will not support a covered entity's decision in this regard if such decision is founded on equating a personal representative's potential decisions regarding reproductive health treatment with subjecting the individual to abuse. Footnotes 1. 89 FR 32976, 32997 (April 26, 2024). 2. 45 CFR § 160.103 definition of ""reproductive health care."" 3. Seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating reproductive health care includes but is not limited to expressing interest in, using, performing, furnishing, paying for, disseminating information about, arranging, insuring, administering, authorizing, providing coverage for, approving, counseling about, assisting, or otherwise taking action to engage in reproductive health care; or attempting any of the same. 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a)(5)(D). 4.

Boroughs announced the formation of the Palmetto Health Care Fraud Task Force (PHCF Task Force), which has been created as a dedicated task force to combat health care fraud and recover taxpayer money in the District of South Carolina through criminal and civil actions. Other agencies that have joined the PHCF Task Force include investigators from the Department of Labor and the South Carolina Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. In February 2023, the FBI, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina, and other federal, state, and local agency partners began meeting as part of a Health Care Fraud Working Group with the goal of combatting health care fraud in the District of South Carolina. The PHCF Task Force was created after the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office saw great success from the Working Group meetings. The creation of the PHCF Task Force demonstrates an increased effort to bring to justice those who defraud the health care system, to deter future health care fraud and abuse, and to promote trust in the healthcare system. Additional resources available to the PHCF Task Force will include the FBI's Data Analytics Response Team (DART), numerous forensic accountants, and Intelligence Analysts from various agencies, which all will promote efficiency in prosecuting cases. Health care fraud is an enormous burden on South Carolina taxpayers. In 2023, taxpayer funded healthcare programs spent approximately $23 billion in South Carolina alone. Although it is difficult to approximate the amount of money lost to waste, fraud, and abuse each year, the Government Accountability Office estimates it could be as much as 10% of money spent. The PHCF Task Force will better equip the United States to detect wrongdoers and recoup money lost to fraud in South Carolina—which costs taxpayers billions each year. The PHCF Task Force and agencies involved in the Health Care Fraud Working Group will meet regularly to aggressively investigate allegations of false billings, COVID-19 fraud, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, and other schemes that victimize patients, health care providers, private insurers, and government insurers, such as Medicare, TRICARE, and Medicaid, in the District of South Carolina. “Health care fraud impacts our citizens, both as patients and taxpayers,” said Adair F. Boroughs, U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina. “The Palmetto Health Care Fraud Task Force demonstrates our commitment to working with our partners to protect those seeking quality medical care and the federal programs meant to support them. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina commends our partners for the creation of the Palmetto Health Care Fraud Task Force and will continue to vigorously prosecute and pursue those who abuse and take advantage of health care programs.” “Fraud committed within our health systems affects everyone and weakens public trust,” said Steve Jensen, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Columbia Field Office. “The FBI created the PCHF Task Force to bolster the local, state, and federal posture against health care fraud, and it will enhance our investigative approaches to hold offenders accountable. We appreciate our federal and state partners that have joined the task force in this effort.” “We welcome the PHCF Task Force and will continue to assist investigative partners combatting health care fraud,” said Tamala E. Miles, Special Agent in Charge with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). ""Our unwavering commitment at HHS-OIG remains steadfast in protecting Medicare, Medicaid, and the well-being of their beneficiaries from fraudulent schemes. The impact of defrauding federal health care programs diverts crucial resources from those deserving of vital medical attention and will not be tolerated."" The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina anticipates broader enforcement as a result of the PHCF Task Force, building on its past success. For example, in April 2019, the District of South Carolina announced its participation in a nationwide operation aimed at dismantling one of the largest Medicare fraud schemes in history. In March 2024, one of the Defendants, Andrew Chmiel, was sentenced to nine years in federal prison for his role in this scheme. The District of South Carolina also recently announced the successful prosecution of Jeffrey Brooks for submitting false durable medical equipment claims. Mr. Brooks pled guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and was sentenced to seven and a half years in federal prison. He also paid $850,000 to the United States as part of a civil settlement.

Article Insights Ankura Consulting Group LLC are most popular: within Compliance, Insurance and Wealth Management topic(s) Private Equity in Healthcare Over the past decade, private equity investors have shown a particular interest in acquiring or investing in various healthcare providers and services. This includes physician practices across multiple sub-specialties, home healthcare providers, behavioral healthcare clinics, skilled nursing facilities, urgent care clinics, and other specialty clinics. This trend is driven by the attractive returns that healthcare investments have generated, fueled by factors such as a fragmented market, industry growth due to an aging population, technological advancements, and evolving healthcare needs. Overall, the increasing dominance of private equity in healthcare is a testament to the sector's robust growth potential and the strategic opportunities it offers for investment and value creation. However, this trend also raises questions about the implications for patient care, costs, and the overall structure of the healthcare industry, which stakeholders must carefully consider. The focus on attractive returns promised by healthcare investments, along with a breakdown of factors such as market fragmentation, demographic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving healthcare needs, offers a comprehensive understanding of why private equity firms are drawn to this sector. According to S&P Capital IQ, the percentage of healthcare providers and services acquisitions with private equity involvement increased from 16 percent in 2013 to 27 percent in 2021 and 2022 before dropping slightly to 25 percent in 2023. Private Equity's Play in Healthcare and Why Providers Are Interested The healthcare sector's appeal to private equity investors stems from its fragmented nature and the opportunities it presents for achieving scale, enhancing efficiency, and reducing costs, all while potentially improving the quality of patient care. On the physician practice side, private equity seeks to consolidate multiple physician practices to create a larger entity. The typical approach involves acquiring a large ""platform"" physician practice, followed by a series of smaller ""add-on"" acquisitions to achieve scale. This strategy enables private equity investors to derive value through several key elements: Leveraging scale to negotiate more favorable reimbursement contracts with insurance providers; Reducing overhead costs through consolidation of back office and administrative functions and negotiating better terms with suppliers; Improving efficiencies through standardization of staffing ratios, enhancing revenue cycle management to increase collection rates and faster collection cycles, and leveraging the expertise of an experienced management team; Investing capital to upgrade infrastructure, providing additional patient access, and expanding ancillary revenue streams. Likewise, healthcare providers are increasingly interested in collaborating with private equity firms. In many cases, the motivations for providers may be similar to the reasons for entering a transaction with a private equity investor, including access to capital, the reduction of administrative responsibilities for the physicians allowing more time for patient care, and an improved bargaining power with payers and vendors. Private equity buyouts frequently offer providers an opportunity to retain partial ownership, allowing them an initial cash payout, diminished risk compared to operating independently, and the potential to share in the financial rewards of any subsequent transactions. Private equity can also accelerate the transition to value-based care by injecting capital investments in data analytics and care coordination initiatives. Private equity capital can unlock potential technological advancements, such as interoperable electronic medical records systems and artificial intelligence, which can drive better workflows, patient access, and care coordination. These innovations can help providers reduce the cost of care, avoid duplicative services, and improve population health management. Despite the growing trend of private equity investments in the healthcare sector, there are significant obstacles that challenge this continued expansion. Increasing Scrutiny From Regulatory Agencies On March 5, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hosted a virtual workshop titled ""Private Capital, Public Impact: An FTC Workshop on Private Equity in Health Care."" The workshop brought together prominent figures, including FTC Chair Lina M. Khan, Department of Justice (DOJ) Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, Health & Human Services (HHS) Inspector General Christi Grimm, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) COO Jonathan Blum, among others, to discuss the impact of the increasing role of private equity in healthcare. The workshop emphasized the need for competition, transparency, and protection of community interests in healthcare. A significant concern raised during the discussions was the mismatch between the short-term investment horizon of private equity firms and the inherently long-term commitment required for healthcare provision. The discussion cited examples in which healthcare providers faced financial difficulties or even closures after being acquired by private equity, illustrating the potential risks of prioritizing profit over patient care. The panelists repeatedly referred to private equity as ""corporate profiteering in healthcare"" and accused private equity investors of ""reducing healthcare to a spreadsheet."" FTC Chair Khan specifically noted that private equity roll-ups have historically escaped much of the agency's scrutiny due to the disparate nature of the acquisitions. This strategy has allowed private equity investors to consolidate into large entities that, in the FTC's view, have stifled competition. These comments suggest a heightened degree of scrutiny from the regulatory agencies going forward. A related discussion took place on April 3, 2024, during a U.S. Senate Committee hearing titled ""When Health Care Becomes Wealth Care: How Corporate Greed Puts Patient Care and Health Workers at Risk."" The discussion centered around private equity's tendency to reduce overhead costs to boost profits and how these practices can potentially negatively impact the quality of patient care. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that ""when private equity gets hold of healthcare providers, it is literally a matter of life and death,"" pointing to the dire consequences of prioritizing financial returns over quality of care. Looking Ahead: Navigating the Future of Private Equity in Healthcare As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, the role of private equity in this sector is a subject that will persistently attract both interest and controversy. The trajectory of private equity's role in healthcare will be influenced by several key considerations: Impact on Healthcare Quality and Access : There is a growing concern among stakeholders about the potential impact of private equity investments on the quality of healthcare services and patient access. While some argue that private equity can bring about much-needed efficiency and innovation, others worry that the profit-driven nature of such investments might compromise patient care and access, especially in underserved communities. Regulatory Oversight and Transparency : Recent activities, such as the FTC workshop and various congressional hearings, underscore the trend towards increased regulatory oversight and scrutiny of private equity transactions in healthcare. Impact on Investment Strategies : The increasing regulatory focus may lead private equity firms to adapt their investment strategies in healthcare to focus on a more long-term approach. This reevaluation seems imperative as the traditional short-term exit strategies of private equity, typically spanning three to five years, clash with the demand for longer-term commitment in healthcare investments. A viable path forward might involve a shift towards investments that are more closely aligned with the goals of improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes, such as value-based care. In conclusion, the future of private equity investment in healthcare is likely to be characterized by a more cautious approach, with a greater emphasis on regulatory compliance, transparency, and the alignment of investment activities with the broader goals of healthcare improvement. Reflecting on the insights from the FTC workshop and Senate Committee hearings, it is clear that private equity firms will need to navigate this landscape with a mindset that prioritizes long-term impact over immediate financial gains.

News Flag Status - HALF STAFF Listen NEW CASTLE (May 7, 2024) – Per capita health care spending in Delaware increased 6.3% in 2022 to $9,657, outpacing a 3% growth rate benchmark, according to the State of Delaware’s fourth annual Benchmark Trend Report presented Thursday May 2 to the Delaware Health Care Commission (DHCC) by Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Josette Manning. Along with tracking the year-over-year percentage change in total health care expenditures expressed on a per capita basis, the benchmark report also reflects data trends on nine health care quality measures and offers insight on health disparities to guide efforts to improve health equity throughout the State. Annual trend reports dating back to the initial release in 2019 reflect continued per-capita growth in health care spending beyond established benchmarks. That year, spending grew at a rate of 5.8%, exceeding a 3.8% spending benchmark. While a 3.5% benchmark was met in calendar year 2020, in 2021, reflecting the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, health care spending grew at a rate of 11.2% compared to a benchmark of 3.25%. The 6.3% per capita increase in 2022 is significant, but there was an expectation of some continuing health care spending rebound effect in the post-pandemic period. Moving forward into 2023 and beyond, DHSS expects Delaware’s health care market to be in a steadier state. “We recognize the economic burden of the rising costs of health care and the benchmark continues to be a valuable tool for the State to compare health care spending year over year, and drive targeted initiatives to improve health care delivery,” Secretary Manning said. “This report shows us there is still significant work to be done to improve the health outcomes of Delawareans.” Quality benchmark results The 2022 Trend Report also provides insight into Delaware’s health care quality on nine quality measures with data able to be analyzed by age, gender, and race/ethnicity for greater insight on health disparities. While the most recent report does show some improvement in use of opioids at high dosages, as well as the use of statin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease, and both breast and colorectal cancer screenings for patients with commercial coverage, opportunities to meet benchmark continue to exist in most areas. Of note given recent reports of a concerning spike in drug overdoses in Sussex and Kent counties, the quality measures underscore urgency regarding Substance Use Disorder/Opioid Use Disorder Outcomes in Delaware. Three of the measures – Breast Cancer, Cervical and Colorectal Cancer Screening – are new to the 2022 cycle of quality benchmarking. Overview of Quality Results: Adult obesity: The benchmark for 2022 was to reduce the percentage of Delaware adults who are obese to 31.9%. The 2022 result: 37.9%; an increase from 2021, and still 6.0 percentage points higher than the benchmark. Use of opioids at high dosages: The 2022 benchmark: 10.8%; the 2022 result: 10.4%. This is a positive observation. Opioid-related overdose deaths: The benchmark for 2022 was to reduce the mortality rate to 38.0 deaths per 100,000. The 2022 result: 50.2 deaths per 100,000. This is an increase from 2021 and is well-above the benchmark. Emergency department utilization: The benchmark for 2022 was to reduce Emergency department utilization to 160.7 visits per 1,000. The 2022 result: 168.4 visits per 1,000. The 2022 result is worse than 2021 and is higher (worse) than the benchmark. Persistence of beta-blocker treatment after a heart attack: The benchmark rate for 2022 was to increase the percentage of patients who receive beta-blocker treatment to 86.8% of commercial insurance patients and to 83.0% for Medicaid patients. The 2022 results: 76.5% for commercial insurance patients and 80.6% for Medicaid patients. Neither the commercial nor Medicaid results met the benchmark; however, Medicaid results remain consistent between 2021 and 2022. Statin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease: The benchmark rate for 2022 was to increase the percentage of patients who receive statin therapy to 83.1% of commercial insurance patients and 73.1% for Medicaid patients. The 2022 results: 82.0% for commercial insurance patients; 64.5% for Medicaid patients. Neither market met the benchmark, but there was improvement in the commercial results from 2021. Breast Cancer Screening: The new benchmark rate for 2022 was to increase the percentage of patients who receive breast cancer screening to 75.7% of commercial patients and 57.9% for Medicaid patients. The 2022 results: 77.0% for commercial insurance patients; 53.8% for Medicaid patients. The commercial results exceeded the 2022 benchmark. Cervical Cancer Screening: The new benchmark rate for 2022 was to increase the percentage of patients who receive cervical cancer screening to 76.2% of commercial patients and 55.1% for Medicaid patients. The 2022 results: 74.1% for commercial insurance patients; 52.6% for Medicaid patients. Neither market met the benchmark in the first year of reporting. Colorectal Cancer Screening: The new benchmark rate for 2022 was to increase the percentage of patients who receive cervical cancer screening to 61.0% of commercial patients. The 2022 results: 62.3% for commercial insurance patients. This is a positive observation. The State health care spending benchmark—an annual per-capita-rate-of-growth benchmark for health care spending and multiple health care quality measures that are to be evaluated and adjusted every three years—was established through Executive Order 25 signed by Governor John Carney in November 2018 and codified in August of 2023 through House Amendment 1 for House Bill 442 .

Entrepreneurship education goes beyond business skills; it cultivates an innovative mindset. Audio By Vocalize This month, I will be sharing lessons I have learnt from Harvard Medical School on leadership and innovation in surgery. As any good Luo will tell you (only a Kenyan will understand this), “you must say” what you have achieved. But my intention in mentioning Harvard is more to hopefully lend weight to what I am discussing today and not necessarily to show off. In the wake of a prolonged doctors' strike in Kenya, the call for systemic changes within the healthcare sector has never been louder. Amidst these calls, one critical area stands out, the necessity for entrepreneurship education in medical training. This article explores why introducing entrepreneurship into healthcare curricula is not only beneficial but essential for the future of healthcare in Kenya. Kenyan healthcare professionals face a multitude of challenges, particularly those employed in the public sector, where compensation does not always reflect the value of their work. The recent strikes highlight a broader issue: a system that often leaves its most crucial workers feeling undervalued and underpaid. Entrepreneurship education could be a key solution, offering these professionals the tools they need to create their own opportunities, whether through private practice, innovation or starting new healthcare ventures. Imagine a doctor who, upon identifying a shortage of affordable medical devices in their community, develops a low-cost solution using locally available materials. This scenario exemplifies the power of entrepreneurship in healthcare. By fostering an innovative mindset and equipping medical professionals with business acumen, entrepreneurship education can empower them to address critical gaps in the Kenyan healthcare system. Qualities such as curiosity, open-mindedness and persistence are essential for identifying unmet needs and developing creative solutions. Entrepreneurship programmes can help healthcare professionals develop these qualities by encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. Entrepreneurship doesn’t mean starting hospitals as most Kenyan doctors are likely to do, that’s why we have many small facilities with limited capacity, the healthcare landscape around the world is actually more focused on mergers and consolidation to achieve greater scale and reach whereas locally we frown on collaborating with each other. Entrepreneurship rather is about developing solutions within the systems in which we work, that benefit us and improve the system itself. Globally, there are numerous success stories where entrepreneurship education has transformed medical training. For instance, medical schools in the United States and Europe have begun integrating entrepreneurship into their curricula, resulting in improved healthcare solutions and increased job satisfaction among graduates. These examples serve as an example of what could be achieved in Kenya, showing that when healthcare professionals are empowered to be innovators, the entire sector benefits. Despite its benefits, the integration of entrepreneurship education faces several hurdles. Financial constraints, lack of faculty with entrepreneurial experience, and rigid institutional structures can all impede the development of such programmes. Moreover, the variability in how these programmes are implemented poses another significant challenge, making it difficult to measure and replicate success. To overcome these challenges, Kenyan universities could consider several strategies such as collaborations and partnerships. Engaging with successful entrepreneurship programmes at international universities and local businesses can provide models and resources. They could also consider curriculum innovation, incorporating theoretical and practical entrepreneurship components, such as case studies, simulations of developing new healthcare services and internships with startups in the medical field. Another area could be policy advocacy, encouraging policymakers to support entrepreneurship in healthcare education through funding and policy adjustments that incentivise innovation and address regulatory hurdles. Entrepreneurship education goes beyond business skills; it cultivates an innovative mindset. Qualities such as curiosity, open-mindedness and persistence are essential for identifying unmet needs and developing creative solutions. Entrepreneurship programmes can help healthcare professionals develop these qualities by encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. Courses can challenge students to identify the root causes of healthcare challenges in Kenya and explore innovative solutions that are both effective and affordable. We should also promote user-centric design, by emphasising empathy for patients, entrepreneurship education can encourage healthcare professionals to design solutions that directly address patient needs and improve healthcare experiences. I know that tech is all the rage currently but not all innovations necessarily have to be in tech and neither do they have to be high-tech to have impact. The Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, a not-for-profit organisation, has made significant strides in rehabilitating individuals who have lost limbs. Let's explore the innovations behind the Jaipur Foot and the Stanford-Jaipur Knee, both of which exemplify successful development processes that are particularly relevant to the Kenyan context. BMVSS's success lies in its unwavering focus on user needs and its commitment to frugal engineering principles. The Jaipur Foot, for example, demonstrates that impactful innovations don't always require high-tech solutions. Local manufacturing and cost-effective designs ensure accessibility to a wider population in Kenya, a nation facing resource constraints. Entrepreneurship education can equip Kenyan healthcare professionals with similar problem-solving approaches, enabling them to develop innovative solutions that are contextually relevant and financially sustainable. The integration of entrepreneurship education into healthcare training represents a transformative step for the future of healthcare in Kenya. By empowering medical professionals to be creators and innovators, we can ensure a more dynamic, responsive, and sustainable healthcare system. Let this be a call to action for educational leaders, policymakers, and the healthcare community to invest in the entrepreneurial potential of healthcare workers, paving the way for innovation and improved patient care.

Actional Information Improves Productivity and Efficiency 95% of healthcare leaders grasp the opportunity for data and analytics to enable clinicians to improve their productivity, 30% said data platforms lead to cost savings through better resource allocation and workforce management, and 25% said they enable better decision-making. 1 Healthcare organizations navigating workforce shortages, care team burnout, and higher operating expenses can leverage data to create strategies to do more with fewer resources while still delivering quality patient care and supporting their staff. 3 AI Fuels Innovation 84% of leaders have plans to integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, or large language models with their data platform, and 55% plan to aggregate unstructured data, such as images, audio, or PDFs, to reduce time-consuming manual review and unlock insights, like an undocumented condition, to better inform care delivery. 1 One healthcare organization used Arcadia's clinical co-pilot, Arcadia SageAI™ , to reduce the time needed to prepare for a patient visit by more than 20%. 4 Technology Makes Data More Useable Healthcare leaders named enhancing data literacy (58%), using AI (47%), and addressing productivity challenges (34%) as key priorities to make data more usable. 1 Moreover, 76% of large organizations (those with 15,000+ employees) said implementing a comprehensive enterprise data solution is essential. 1 Larger organizations have the greatest need to connect disparate data sources to derive comprehensive insights and actions across the enterprise. 5 Accelerating Data Recency Remains an Opportunity 61% of organizations refresh their data at least daily for business intelligence analytics, but when building and running artificial intelligence models, that number drops to 32%. 1 Only 47% of organizations leverage daily refreshed data for generating lists of care gaps and just 39% for patient stratification and building cohorts. 1 Activating data in real-time provides care teams with immediate access to the most current patient information, which ensures providers make decisions using the freshest insights. 6 “Our findings show that healthcare leaders view data analytics platforms as critical tools to confront growing workforce shortages, financial pressures, and the shift towards value-based care,” said Michael Meucci , President and CEO of Arcadia. “Investing in a strong data analytics platform can further transform these challenges into opportunities and progress towards a more efficient and effective healthcare system.” Download the report to discover how healthcare leaders plan to deploy a data analytics platform to power future innovations within their organizations. ____ 1 HIMSS Market Insights Survey , Data Analytics Platforms, 2024 2 “ 4 ways data is improving healthcare ,” World Economic Forum, 2019 3 “ The use of Big Data Analytics in healthcare ,” Journal of Big Data, 2022 4 Arcadia product performance measured in Q1 2024 5 “ Sharing Data, Saving Lives: The Hospital Agenda for Interoperability ,” American Hospital Association, 2019 6 “ How Healthcare is Leveraging Real-World Data to Improve Outcomes ,” Health IT Analytics, 2020 About Arcadia Arcadia transforms data into powerful insights and actions that accelerate healthcare transformation.

(Getty Images illustration) Let’s do a simple thought experiment. Pretend that every time you go to the grocery store there are no prices posted for the food products. You have no way of knowing how much anything costs until you get to the check out counter. And when you do get to the check out, someone else pays for over 80 percent of your groceries. On the one hand, you really don’t care what prices are because someone else is paying for the vast majority of your food. On the other hand, you are still paying for a significant portion of your groceries, so it would be handy to know prices. You can see what Idaho hospitals charge. Here’s what it will, and won’t, tell you. This thought experiment defines the current health care system in the United States. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A third party, either the government through insurance programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare, or employers through employee benefits pay for a very significant portion of health care in our current system. Consequently, until recently, prices in health care have not mattered to patients. Americans have been shielded from health care costs. Yet, insurance deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses have been increasing, putting more financial pressure on patients. At the end of the day, health care is an economic activity, just like buying groceries, or clothes, or shelter. The relationship between a provider and a patient is unquestionably the most personal activity we undertake, however, health care has costs. The one thing that all policymakers can agree on is that the rising costs of health care are unsustainable. We currently spend almost 20 percent of our economy, or gross domestic product, on health care in the U.S. Unless something changes, this number is predicted to reach over 30 percent of GDP in the next 10 to 15 years. To change this trajectory of increasing health care spending, price transparency is mandatory . Patients must have the ability to act as true consumers of medical care and be able to compare treatment prices from multiple providers. The federal government has mandated that hospitals publish their pricing structure, yet medical facilities have been extremely slow in meeting this requirement. The first step in controlling health care costs is to give patients, as consumers of medical care, the ability to obtain quality care at the most reasonable price. Competition in pricing is a fundamental of a free market and just as in grocery shopping, Americans should have the right to know prices for their medical care.

(Getty Images) A second public health emergency of this decade is beginning to take shape in New Hampshire. While the emergency does not involve an infectious disease, the health and well-being of New Hampshire residents are no less at risk. Health care organizations across the state are incurring unsustainable losses. Community Health Centers, among others, are being challenged like never before as they recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While circumstances vary, at least two common factors are responsible: 1) Inflation caused operational costs to grow dramatically throughout the pandemic; and 2) The number of people who no longer have health insurance increased, resulting in less reimbursement for a portion of the care that these organizations provide. The influx of federal COVID-19 funding helped to sustain our health care system through the pandemic, but also served to mask this critical problem. As Community Health Centers’ COVID-19 funding has reached its end, the health care system’s structural weaknesses have reappeared and deepened. Recent headlines announcing layoffs at one of the state’s major hospitals illustrate the pressures that hospital systems now confront. Not making headlines, thus far, is the grave distress that other health care providers in the state now face: Nearly all the state’s Community Health Centers are losing money, with increased expenses outpacing flat revenue this year; nursing homes are struggling; and the state’s mental health and developmental service providers are reporting similar concerns. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Smaller organizations are particularly at risk. Many have nearly exhausted their reserve funds and are facing the necessity of layoffs, site closures, and other extraordinary measures to ensure their survival. All these organizations play an important role in New Hampshire’s health care system, and in all our lives. A failure of any one of them could result in the unnecessary loss of life, additional health care spending, and delays in care that could impact everyone, regardless of their insurance status. Emergency stabilization funding is needed to support organizations at risk of failure and provide all stakeholders with the time needed to ensure the stability of a system all New Hampshire residents rely upon. Once stabilized, policymakers can work with health care providers to ensure that our state’s health care safety net is strong and durable. Adjustments to the health care economics in the post-pandemic arena are important tasks ahead of us, to account for the cost of uncompensated care, changing employment structures, and forward-looking investments in our workforce – but for now, things need to be stabilized.

The attacks have resulted in casualties amongst health care workers, patients, and other civilians including children. Although attacks have been reported across the country, the regions most severely affected include Dnipropetrovska, Zaporizka, Kharkivska, Odeska, Donetska, Khersonska, Sumska, and Chernihivska. As of 30th April 2024, Health Cluster partners complemented the efforts of first responders, to reach an estimated 3,447 persons with rapid humanitarian health assistance. Partners including UN agencies, the Global Red Cross Movement, local and international NGOs, have worked in close collaboration with the Ukraine Ministry of Health and local authorities to support the immediate delivery of emergency medical services and integrated primary health care including mental health support to people affected by the attacks. Through WHO as cluster lead agency and the WHO SSA platform, the Health Cluster team verified 110 attacks on health care in Ukraine from 29 December 2023 to 30 April 2024. These attacks resulted in 11 deaths and 46 injuries of health care workers and patients. This represents a 479 per cent increase in attacks on health verified since December 2023. Recent data from the WHO SSA platform reveals a disturbing trend in Ukraine: ambulance workers and health transport personnel are experiencing a risk of injury and death that is three times higher than other health care service workers. Since the escalation of the country-wide conflict in February 2022, the Health Cluster team through the WHO SSA has verified 1,742 attacks on health care, with 136 deaths, and 311 injuries. Attacks on health care negatively impact the delivery of health services to the entire population, disrupting humanitarian health assistance, and undermining the capacity of health workers to provide health care. In the first quarter of 2024 (Jan-Mar), Health Cluster partners have provided 865,342 people in frontline areas with lifesaving health care. While humanitarian access has reduced in Kharkivska, Donetska, and Khersonska, health partners continue to coordinate with local authorities to reach people in need while ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian workers."

https://www.christianpost.com:443/voices/health-care-choices-are-a-matter-of-religious-freedom.html,,Health care choices are a matter of religious freedom,20240430T133000Z,https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/25/92/259288.jpg,christianpost.com,English,United States,XLV,Healthcare,health care,"Pxabay/DarkoStojanovic Thanks to Health Care Sharing Ministries (HCSMs), victories for religious freedom have been won in three states this year. Tennessee’s Governor just signed key legislation recognizing that HCSMs are not health insurance, which ensures what nearly 25,000 Tennesseans already know, that they have the religious freedom to participate in HCSMs. By the time you read this, the governors of Utah and West Virginia may have signed similar bills passed by their legislatures. Let me explain why this is important. There are so many threats to our fundamental freedoms these days that sometimes peoples’ eyes glaze over when we talk about HCSMs and their connection to freedom of conscience and religious liberty. HCSMs have long been recognized as an alternative to health insurance, with many Americans choosing an HCSM because their consciences demand it. Increasingly, however, insurance regulators and other policymakers have accused HCSMs of being unlicensed insurance as a means of trying to shut them down. The root of the problem is not whether health care sharing ministries are insurance — since they operate without contracts and without transfer of risk, they simply don’t meet the definition of insurance in law. Even the bluest state government of Michigan admits health care sharing ministries are not insurance. The real issue is who exercises authority in health care decisions — is it a government agency that decides the right solution to overpriced medical services, or is it families and individuals? Should people of faith be allowed to access solutions that are consistent with their religious beliefs, or should the state set a one-size-fits-all solution with no opt-out? Are the people in charge of themselves, and as such, are they accountable to God for their decisions, or does the civil government control all of life, in this case, health care? You may be hearing echoes of a very old, very familiar conflict, a little like the one that drove colonists in North America to separate from England. Today, a handful of state governments keep harassing HCSMs because they insist on intentionally obfuscating the difference between health insurance with HCSMs. To understand who should exercise authority in health care decisions, let’s take another approach, one with at least as much explanatory power. Once upon a time, an ancient and notorious dissident sat by a massive stone edifice, a religious building of particular grandeur. His adversaries wanted the state to kill him (which they accomplished a few days later). His enemies employed a historically proven method for eliminating opponents. They asked him a gotcha question about taxes, but received a response that stunned them (Matt. 22:20-22). Jesus said, in essence, “Sure, pay taxes you owe to Caesar, but remember there are things in the world that do not belong to Caesar. Caesar will answer to God for his actions, just as you and I will answer to God for the things that do not belong to Caesar.” In this case, family health care decisions belong to the family, not Caesar. When a state legislature or a federal or state executive branch agency asserts the power to require certain health care actions, like funding abortion through health insurance premiums, Caesar has crossed from his turf onto the sacred domain of families. Legislatures and agencies try clamping down on HCSMs because they have trouble recognizing that some things don’t belong to Caesar, like a voluntary decision to be a member of a HCSM. It begins to look like the issue of whether Health Care Sharing Ministries are insurance is a red herring. The real issue is whether the state has control over everything that is health care, even a health care ministry. Should Health Care Sharing Ministries have to render unto Caesar that which is God’s? One thing we know for certain; the traveling teacher sitting by the temple in Jerusalem announced a principle for all time. All things do not belong to Caesar, including whether families choose health care sharing ministries instead of insurance regulated by the government. Katy Talento is the Executive Director of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries .She was the top health advisor at the White House Domestic Policy Council and an oversight investigator and legislative director for the U.S. Senate."

Thirty counties currently lack hospitals, staff and infrastructure serving the rural population. At the same time, many of the hospitals we do have lack nurses and rely on hiring traveling labor from other states, which is costly . It’s estimated Nebraska needs to hire 5,435 nurses to fill this gap. This is affecting Nebraskans’ health outcomes, especially in the areas of maternal health, primary care and end-of-life care . But there is an obvious solution: welcoming more skilled migrant health care workers.

Nebraska is home to a growing and diversified migrant population. In 2021, nearly 143,000 of the state’s residents were foreign born. A portion of these workers were heath care workers in their home countries, yet cannot work in their field in the United States. As it stands, foreign-educated nurses, nurse aides and physicians must undertake lengthy exams and training in order to work here. For nurses, Nebraska requires the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools exam, followed by the National Council Licensure Examination. Foreign-trained physicians, meanwhile, are often required to pass up to three U.S. Medical Licensing Exams and re-complete a residency program. Most international medical physicians must also apply for an H-1B or J-1 visa in order to come to the United States and enroll in residency programs. Unfortunately, fewer and fewer programs are sponsoring these visas due to cost and time requirements. Even when successful, these processes can take years for workers and their spouses, delaying the start of training. While most immigration policy is made at the federal level, Nebraska does have tools to address this situation. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Nebraska State Boards and hospitals could remove some of the requirements for foreign-trained doctors and nurses. Many of these policies are set at the state board level, giving our health care leaders flexibility to address the shortage. New Mexico, Oregon, Arizona, Utah and New York, for example, have already eliminated the CGFNS exam for nurses. Boards could also issue more temporary restricted licenses for foreign-trained physicians and allow them to work in rural areas without them having to re-complete a residency program. Many states have begun relaxing requirements and issuing temporary licenses to allow physicians to work in rural areas — and Illinois and Tennessee have passed legislation to allow foreign physicians a pathway to permanent licensure. Nebraska’s congressional representatives should put pressure on federal agencies to accelerate the visa granting process for foreign trained workers and their spouses. This would reduce the financial and emotional burden placed on families and more quickly staff positions in which health care labor is needed. Finally, to assess key challenges and progress over the long term, a consortium is needed, with relevant public and private sector collaboration to address the issue of foreign-trained skilled health care workers going forward. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement To be sure, foreign-trained health care workers do not have the same educational background as U.S.-trained staff. While this is a valid concern, frequent training once on the job could assure that staff stay up-to-date with advances and clinical guidelines. This is already a regular practice for traveling nurses and physicians, who receive training when they switch hospitals to stay up to speed. The same could be done with migrant health care workers, which would be more economical than hiring costly traveling health care workers. Critics might also point to the linguistic barrier that foreign staff may face. On the contrary, these workers would be a tremendous linguistic and cultural asset to the care of our growing migrant patient population. While the majority of the immigration narrative focuses on undocumented migrants, it is important to remember that skilled legal migrants also face difficulties and sometimes prejudice during their process toward being legally allowed to work in the United States. As Nebraska’s health care system suffers due to a lack of skilled workers, it is imperative that we incorporate more skilled health care migrants into the workforce so we don’t become a health care desert. These changes will require collaboration between government and the private sector, as well as a reduction in the stigma typically associated with foreign-trained workers and migrants. But the opportunity exists – we only have to be brave enough to pursue it. The post Migrants can help address Nebraska’s health care shortage appeared first on Nebraska Examiner . About Our Ads"

The new capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain and Manufacturing (SCM) , Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) , and Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) , will enable healthcare organizations to streamline processes, support increased productivity, help reduce costs, foster employee growth, and better serve patient needs. ""Healthcare organizations are under pressure to deliver a consistently high standard of care while controlling costs and addressing employee needs,"" said Steve Miranda , executive vice president, applications development, Oracle.

Across Kenya, these wages have not consistently risen in accordance with increased demand. Audio By Vocalize The intricate balance of supply, demand and wages plays a pivotal role in any sector, but none more so than in healthcare, where human well-being hangs in the balance. In Kenya, recent events have brought these issues into sharp focus, challenging the traditional economic principles that govern labour markets. This week’s article seeks to explore the connection between supply and demand for healthcare professionals, their wages and the phenomenon of market failure, especially in light of the recent doctors' strike and the trends in healthcare spending. The healthcare labour market is a unique intersection of economic forces. The supply of healthcare professionals is determined by several factors, including the rigorous training required, licensure and credentialing barriers and personal choices of individuals pursuing healthcare careers. Demand is shaped by demographic changes, such as an aging population, advancements in medical technology and evolving healthcare needs. Normally, a higher demand and lower supply would lead to increased wages. However, in Kenya's healthcare system, this straightforward economic relationship is complicated by additional layers such as government policy, the strategic importance of healthcare and international funding for public health initiatives. Wages for healthcare professionals are a reflection of this complex interplay. Across Kenya, these wages have not consistently risen in accordance with increased demand. Public sector wages, in particular, are often constrained by budgetary limits and do not rise as one would expect given the low supply of professionals. The recent NHIF expenditure data offers a window into this dynamic, showcasing a significant shift in resources towards private facilities, which tend to offer more competitive remuneration packages than their public counterparts. Furthermore, Kenya’s adherence to the Abuja Declaration, which stipulates the commitment to allocate at least 15 per cent of its annual budget to health, remains a target yet to be met, impacting the financial flexibility to increase public sector healthcare wages. Market failure is an economic situation where the allocation of goods and services by a market is not efficient. In the case of Kenya's healthcare system, several factors contribute to this inefficiency. There is an information asymmetry where patients lack comprehensive medical knowledge, externalities affecting public health outcomes, and a non-competitive market structure that hampers the public sector's ability to compete on wages with the private sector. This reality is evidenced by the NHIF expenditure trends, which have shown an increasing preference for private healthcare facilities over time. This not only points to a disparity in service utilisation but also implies a disparity in the wages between the public and private sectors. As the private sector and I might add foreign markets such as the US, UK and Australia attract more healthcare workers with higher wages, the public sector struggles to retain and recruit talent. In an already tight labor market, this exacerbates the shortage of healthcare professionals and puts upward pressure on public sector wages. The graph below visually represents the shifting landscape of healthcare expenditure in Kenya, emphasizing the trend towards private facilities and the subsequent impact on the public healthcare sector. The complexities of Kenya's healthcare labour market demand multifaceted and targeted solutions. Loan forgiveness or repayment programmes for those committing to public service can provide incentives for professionals to enter and remain in the public sector. Financial bonuses or enhanced pay for work in underserved areas can redistribute talent more equitably. International organisations and donors play a crucial role in this arena, not just as financiers but also as strategic partners in building sustainable healthcare systems. Their support could be pivotal in developing and maintaining public sector capabilities, including competitive wages for healthcare workers. To meet its commitments under the Abuja Declaration, Kenya must reevaluate its healthcare financing and work towards allocating the targeted 15 per cent of its GDP to health. This increased investment could support wage increases and ensure a more robust healthcare system. The shift towards private facilities and foreign migration also raises ethical concerns. Policies must ensure that they do not inadvertently deepen health inequities or create a reliance on international aid. The focus should be on fostering a self-sufficient, equitable healthcare system. The one solution however that will not work is attempting to reduce the wages of healthcare workers in the public sector. This will only serve one purpose, that is to hasten the migration of healthcare workers away from the public sector. The end result of that can never be good as the attainment of the government’s cherished goal of Universal Health Coverage cannot be attained by a fully privatised health system. The doctors' strike in Kenya is a manifestation of the pressures within the healthcare sector, driven by an inherent shortage of professionals and a trend towards private healthcare utilisation. Public healthcare wages are at a crossroads; reducing them is not an option when faced with an already low supply of healthcare workers. Solutions must be both innovative and ethical, ensuring that public healthcare remains a viable option and continues to serve the Kenyan population effectively. The pledge to the Abuja Declaration is not merely a fiscal target but a reflection of the value placed on health as a societal pillar, demanding concerted effort and resources to honour this commitment. The engagement of international organisations and donors should be aligned with the long-term goals of self-sufficiency, capacity building and sustainable development in the Kenyan healthcare system.

News from Country Offices | 17 April 2024 SHARE THIS PAGE MANILA, PHILIPPINES (17 April 2024) — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a €46.3 million ($50 million equivalent) policy-based loan to help improve access to quality and affordable health care in Georgia. Under ADB’s Health Sector Enhancement Program , the bank will disburse the financing once the government has implemented a range of reforms to improve health sector governance and regulation, increase publicly funded primary health care and specialized outpatient and diagnostic services, and enhance the sector’s operational efficiency and financial sustainability. “This program represents ADB’s comprehensive and integrated package of support to improve health care in Georgia,” said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov. “While it will help improve health care for all, this program will be particularly beneficial for the poor, women, and vulnerable groups.” Georgia has high levels of noncommunicable diseases—including heart disease, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes—which reduce life expectancy and healthy aging. Strengthening government-funded primary health care and outpatient services can help to manage these diseases—most of which are preventable. The program supports the redesign of the government’s primary health care benefits package, which should lead to better service coverage becoming more affordable especially for the poor and vulnerable. It also enables strategic purchasing to increase the share of quality health care providers contracted and supports changes in digital information systems to efficiently manage health care programs. “As part of improving health services, this program will also help Georgia prepare its health care providers and the general public against the impacts of climate change that affect health,” said ADB Senior Health Specialist Brian Chin. “Among the government actions supported are the establishment of an early warning system and an information campaign on climate-induced hazards such as heatwaves.” ADB has supported Georgia since 2007 and is one of the country’s largest multilateral development partners. ADB’s loans, grants, and technical assistance to Georgia total $4 billion . ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.

While attacks occurred nationwide, the most impacted regions include Dnipropetrovska, Zaporizka, Kharkivska, Odeska, Donetska, Khersonska, Sumska, and Chernihivska. Attacks in Kharkivska and Zaporizka utilized a tactic known as ""double tap,"" involving an initial airstrike followed by a second attack, targeting first responders aiding injured civilians, resulting in further casualties. As of 19th April 2024, Health Cluster partners complemented the efforts of first responders, to reach an estimated 2,907 persons with humanitarian health assistance since the December 2023 escalation of attacks. Partners including UN agencies, the Global Red Cross Movement, local and international NGOs, have worked in close collaboration with the Ukraine Ministry of Health and local authorities to support the delivery of emergency medical services and integrated primary health care including mental health services. Humanitarian access incidents have increased in Kharkivska, Donetska, and Khersonska, where the humanitarian space to deliver much-needed health assistance is reduced. Partners continue to coordinate with local authorities to reach people in need while ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian workers. Through WHO as cluster lead agency and the WHO SSA platform , the Health Cluster team verified 105 attacks on health care in Ukraine from 29 December 2023 to 19 April 2024 . These attacks resulted in 6 deaths and 45 injuries of health care workers and patients. Recent data from the WHO SSA platform reveals a disturbing trend in Ukraine : ambulance workers and health transport personnel are experiencing a risk of injury and death that is three times higher than other health care service workers. Attacks on health care negatively impact the delivery of health services to the entire population, disrupting humanitarian health assistance, and undermining the capacity of health workers to provide health care. Since the escalation of the country-wide conflict in February 2022, WHO has verified 1,731 attacks on health care , with 131 deaths , and 308 injuries ."

This incident has sent shockwaves through the health care industry, significantly impacting revenue cycles for numerous health care providers who rely on Change Healthcare’s services for billing, claims processing, and health care operations. The breach has exposed vulnerabilities in traditional health are payment systems and underscored the importance of securing patient data and financial transactions. Now, facilities already burdened by the high costs of health care delivery are suffering even more financial stress. In the aftermath, there has been a scramble to mitigate the impact, assess the extent of the data compromised, and implement stricter security measures to prevent future breaches. However, amidst this chaos, a sector of the health care industry remained notably unaffected: direct primary care (DPC) practices. DPC physicians operate under a model that eschews the traditional third-party payer systems for a membership-based structure, where patients pay a flat monthly fee directly to their health care provider. This model not only fosters a closer patient-doctor relationship but also insulates DPC practices from the disruptions seen in the wake of the Change Healthcare hack. DPC practices did not experience the same revenue cycle disruptions because they do not depend on third-party payers for their revenue. The DPC model’s independence from the conventional health care payment ecosystem inherently protects it from the direct impacts of such cyber-attacks on billing and claims processing systems. This recent incident highlights the resilience of the DPC model and its potential as a more secure alternative for health care delivery and financial transactions. The Change Healthcare hack serves as a critical reminder of the cybersecurity risks that loom over the health care industry. It emphasizes the need for robust security protocols and innovative approaches to health care delivery that prioritize patient data protection and financial stability. Direct Primary Care emerges as a beacon in this regard, showcasing a health care model that not only promises personalized care but also a higher degree of protection against the financial disruptions caused by cyber threats. While the health care industry continues to grapple with the challenges of cybersecurity and data protection, the resilience of the direct primary care model in the face of these threats offers valuable insights. It underscores the importance of exploring alternative health care delivery models that can provide not only better patient care but also greater security and stability for both providers and patients. The Change Healthcare hack is a wake-up call, urging the health care industry to reassess its vulnerabilities and consider the benefits of models like DPC that operate outside the traditional revenue cycle vulnerabilities. Christopher Habig is co-founder and CEO, Freedom Healthworks , a company dedicated to scaling the direct primary care (DPC) practice model, putting doctors back in control of patient care. Christopher’s journey into health care innovation was sparked by the frustration of seeing family members struggle among the insurance and hospital-dominated industry. He envisioned a system where health care could be accessible, high-quality, and affordable. This vision led to the inception of Freedom Healthworks, which provides the tools, technology, and support for doctors to run successful DPC practices. Christopher dedicates his time to educating both consumers and health care providers about the benefits of the DPC model through his podcast, Healthcare Americana , leading the Indiana Free Market Medical Association, and being a contributing member of the Indiana Physicians Health Alliance. His goal is to create a future for Americans where health care is synonymous with the caring, individualized attention that was its original hallmark.

On Friday, CUPE hosted the bargaining information rally where health-care workers, the public and allies were in attendance. “We had hoped the provincial budget would have recognized the crisis on the front lines of health care, but unfortunately, we didn’t see any meaningful plans to address retention of existing health care staff,” CUPE 5430 president Bashir Jalloh said in a release. “We are also now seeing that most of the health investments in the budget are being directed to private health services rather than desperately needed investments to build up and fix our public health care system.” According to a release, CUPE 5430’s recent cost-of-living survey shows a full 86 per cent of survey respondents said they cut back on their grocery budget to make ends meet, while 84 per cent said they also cut back on leisure activities and hobbies, 77 per cent said they delayed a major purchase and 73 per cent cancelled or scaled back vacation plans.

This regular full-time job doesn’t really suffice to the expenses that we have now,” Castro said. “Things are just getting higher and more expensive and we can’t do nothing about that.” The main request is to implement a competitive wage and Jalloh said nurses are leaving Saskatchewan for higher wages in other provinces. Health-care workers at the rally said they plan to continue bargaining and having rallies until they come to an agreement with the province.

These dramatic shifts have opened up a wealth of opportunities for creative entrepreneurs to carve out unique niches that address the diverse needs of patients and consumers. If you are intrigued by the prospect of starting a healthcare business, explore these viable options that may match your interests and skills. Relatedly, here are some health and wellness ideas by Business with Dave you can check out after reading: What is a Healthcare Business? Essentially, a healthcare business refers to any organization or entity that provides medical services to patients or delivers products and services to providers within the industry. The scope of a healthcare business can be expansive, covering everything from medical practices like doctor’s offices to businesses engaged in the sale of medical equipment. The industry’s broad range creates diverse opportunities for potential business ventures. Private Business and the Healthcare Industry Today Per worldwide management consulting firm, McKinsey & Company , the healthcare industry in the United States has evolved significantly, reflecting changes in several key areas: Overall Growth : The healthcare industry’s profit pools are anticipated to expand at a 4 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from $654 billion to $790 billion over the forthcoming years. This growth, however, faces challenges from high inflation rates and labor shortages, with improvement efforts expected to support recovery in the future. Payer Mix Changes : There’s a notable shift towards Medicare, driven by an aging population and the popularity of Medicare Advantage. Conversely, Medicaid enrollment might decline due to legislative changes. Are commercial segments expected to rebound and grow, influenced by shifts from fully insured to self-insured businesses? Impact of Endemic COVID-19 : Endemic COVID-19 could result in significant healthcare costs in the U.S., primarily for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 cases and long COVID?. Provider Segment : The growth forecast for provider profit pools has been revised to a 3 percent CAGR, down from an earlier estimate of 7 percent, largely due to increased costs from inflation and labor shortages. Despite these pressures, a rebound is anticipated in the coming years. Healthcare Services and Technology (HST) : The HST sector is expected to experience significant growth, with a notable CAGR of 10 percent, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing areas in healthcare. This expansion is driven by the rising adoption of technology among providers and payers, particularly in software, patient engagement, and clinical decision support. Pharmacy Services : This sector is anticipated to keep expanding, with profit pools projected to be substantial, driven by the ongoing use of medications and increasing prices for specialty drugs. Nevertheless, challenges include reimbursement pressures, diminishing profit margins, and the rise of specialty generics and biosimilars. The sector also encounters worker shortages and inflationary pressures, with some companies investing in technology to enhance capacity and lower costs. These developments highlight the dynamic nature of the healthcare industry, shaped by demographic trends, legislative changes, technological advancements, and ongoing challenges like inflation and labor shortages. Our Methodology for Selecting Top Healthcare Business Ideas In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare industry, entrepreneurs and small business owners are uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. At Small Business Trends, we understand the importance of making informed choices when it comes to selecting healthcare business ideas that not only promise growth but also align with individual business goals and capabilities. Here’s our methodology: Criteria for Evaluating Healthcare Business Ideas Market Demand (Weight: 35%) Assess current and projected demand for the healthcare service or product. Consider demographic trends, such as aging populations or increasing health consciousness. Regulatory Compliance (Weight: 25%) Understand the healthcare regulations and compliance requirements. Factor in the cost and complexity of meeting these standards. Profitability Potential (Weight: 20%) Evaluate the revenue models and profit margins of the business idea. Consider upfront investment vs. long-term financial gains. Innovation and Scalability (Weight: 10%) Gauge the potential for the idea to incorporate innovative approaches or technologies. Assess scalability and the potential for expansion. Social Impact (Weight: 10%) Consider the potential positive impact on community health and well-being. Evaluate the idea’s alignment with social healthcare needs and ethical considerations. Best Profitable Healthcare Business Ideas Healthcare offers a plethora of business opportunities for medical professionals and entrepreneurs interested in the industry. The most suitable medical business ideas for you will depend largely on your specific qualifications, education, and training. Therefore, to help you navigate your way, we present a broad range of options within the healthcare sector for your consideration. Medical Equipment Sales Medical equipment sellers offer invaluable support to the healthcare industry. These businesses provide health-related goods either to medical providers or directly to consumers. For instance, a business might supply bulk products like syringes, gauze, or IV fluid bags to hospitals and clinics. Alternatively, an entrepreneur might open a retail store that sells a variety of medical supplies like arm slings, walking aids, home health equipment, and more to the public. Medical Billing Services In the vast healthcare landscape, many hospitals and clinics have found efficiency by outsourcing their financial documentation and billing processes. This approach allows healthcare providers to focus their time and resources on what they do best: serving patients. You don’t need specific medical training to offer this service, but you do need to be familiar with the healthcare industry’s billing practices and have access to HIPAA-compliant software and devices to handle sensitive patient data securely and professionally. Medical Transcription Services Medical transcription is another niche where healthcare providers often seek external expertise. These services involve listening to and transcribing medical professionals’ voice recordings into written reports, which then become part of patients’ medical records. This service, which can often be carried out remotely, offers flexibility for both providers and transcriptionists. Veterinary Clinic A veterinary clinic presents an excellent business opportunity for individuals who are passionate about animals and wish to enhance their health and well-being. Starting such a clinic requires either a formal education in veterinary medicine or strategic partnerships with qualified veterinary healthcare providers. Despite the required expertise, it’s a rewarding enterprise for animal lovers. Health Insurance Specialist Health insurance specialists can bridge the gap between patients and the often confusing world of health insurance. These professionals work directly with patients to provide guidance about the available health insurance plans, reviewing their options with them, and helping them choose plans based on their unique healthcare needs. In a world where health insurance is a necessity, this role is becoming increasingly essential. Online Healthcare Business With the advent of digital technology, many healthcare professionals are transitioning towards a telehealth model. You could potentially establish an online clinic that connects with patients through video chats, offering convenience and flexibility. Some innovative online healthcare businesses have gone further to enhance their value proposition by providing prescription delivery services and other complementary offerings, making healthcare access even easier for patients. Medical Billing Software Development In the technological realm, there’s a significant demand for software developers who can cater to the specific needs of healthcare providers. Creating software to streamline billing processes can be an invaluable service for medical companies. These software programs must comply with strict privacy and industry regulations, necessitating ongoing updates and upgrades. This presents a profitable opportunity for individuals with the appropriate skills. Table 1: Profitable Healthcare Business Ideas To assist you in making an informed decision about entering the healthcare business sector, Table 1 outlines a variety of profitable healthcare business ideas. This table serves as a snapshot of each business idea, highlighting key aspects such as the nature of the business, skills required, and target market: Business Idea Description Skills/Qualifications Required Target Market Medical Equipment Sales Selling medical supplies to providers or directly to consumers Knowledge of healthcare products, sales skills Hospitals, clinics, general public Medical Billing Services Outsourcing financial documentation and billing for healthcare providers Familiarity with healthcare billing, HIPAA compliance Hospitals, clinics Medical Transcription Services Transcribing medical professionals' voice recordings into written reports Transcription skills, medical terminology knowledge Healthcare providers Veterinary Clinic Providing healthcare services to animals Veterinary medicine education or partnership with vets Pet owners Health Insurance Specialist Assisting patients with health insurance plans Knowledge of health insurance, communication skills General public, patients Online Healthcare Business Offering healthcare services through telehealth and other online means Healthcare qualifications, digital proficiency Patients seeking convenience Medical Billing Software Development Developing software for healthcare billing processes Software development skills, knowledge of healthcare industry regulations Healthcare providers More Great Business Ideas in the Healthcare Sector The healthcare sector presents an array of diverse and promising opportunities beyond the general ideas mentioned above. Here are some niche and emerging options that have considerable potential in the current healthcare landscape. Medical Cleaning Business Cater to the unique needs of clinics, hospitals, and other medical establishments by providing comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing services. This niche has gained importance in recent times, given its potential to reduce infection and disease transmission among vulnerable patient populations. Telehealth Software Development With the rising trend of telehealth services, healthcare providers require secure platforms to interact with their patients virtually. Here lies an opportunity to develop software offering live chat, video and voice calling, and secure messaging facilities, enabling seamless remote patient-doctor interactions. Retail Pharmacy Business If you’re interested in a more traditional, in-person business model, a retail pharmacy could be a suitable option. While you’ll need pharmacy professionals to distribute medication, these businesses also typically offer a variety of other products, from over-the-counter medicines to convenience items like food and greeting cards. Medical Lab Medical labs collaborate with healthcare providers, conducting a wide range of tests on samples to provide accurate information for diagnoses. This field requires some level of medical training, but the professionals usually don’t interact directly with patients, making it a unique blend of healthcare and laboratory work. Medical Waste Disposal Healthcare providers inevitably produce a significant amount of waste that needs careful and compliant disposal, such as syringes and expired medications. Offering safe and efficient disposal services to these medical facilities could fill a critical niche in the healthcare ecosystem. Drug Testing Business Drug testing clinics collect and process samples from individuals for employment screenings or court orders. These clinics operate similarly to medical labs but offer a more specialized service. As more businesses adopt stringent hiring policies, demand for these services is likely to grow. Medical Massage Therapy Massage therapy goes beyond the typical relaxation experience. Specialized therapists are available to help alleviate pain for patients dealing with cancer or chronic illnesses. Additionally, some therapists provide extra services, including rehabilitative stretches or physical therapy options. Dental Clinic Dental care is a critical aspect of overall health, presenting another avenue for healthcare business. Opening a dental clinic necessitates certain educational qualifications, yet it offers an essential service by assisting patients in maintaining good oral health, which in turn supports their overall wellness. Pediatric Clinic Pediatrics is a vital healthcare specialty, providing essential care to the younger population. A pediatric clinic can offer comprehensive services, from general health check-ups to specialized care like speech-language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. In-Home Healthcare Service In-home healthcare services have gained considerable traction in recent years, offering a valuable alternative to traditional clinic-based care. By taking healthcare to the patient’s home, these businesses provide essential nursing care and assistance with daily tasks, especially beneficial for the elderly or chronically ill. Given the aging American population, this business idea presents a promising opportunity.

By incorporating a healthcare-oriented approach, you can offer a unique value proposition, supporting clients in managing their health conditions effectively. Mental Health Counseling The emphasis on mental health has considerably increased in recent years, leading to a greater demand for mental health services. With the appropriate qualifications and training, you can offer mental health counseling services. These could be offered in-person or online, making it a versatile option that caters to the growing need for accessible mental health support. Health Care Providers Database For entrepreneurs interested in leveraging technology to deliver value in the healthcare industry, creating a comprehensive database of healthcare providers could be a promising venture. This online platform could encompass ratings, geographic locations, specialties, and other pertinent information that helps patients make informed choices about their healthcare providers. Wellness Coach Wellness coaching is another individual-centric service that can make a significant impact on people’s lives. As a wellness coach, you can work one-on-one with clients to help them meet their personal health and wellness goals. This role often entails conducting personalized sessions and offering guidance and support that cater to each client’s unique needs and aspirations. Table 2: Additional Niche and Emerging Business Ideas in the Healthcare Sector In Table 2, we provide a snapshot look at more niche and emerging business opportunities in the healthcare sector. Again, understanding the specifics of each business idea, including the required skills and target market, can guide you in selecting a venture that best aligns with your expertise and evolving market needs.

While a number of healthcare business opportunities can be quite lucrative, the profitability largely depends on your service offerings, geographical location, and initial startup costs. Many businesses that witness immediate profitability tend to focus on straightforward services such as medical transcription or billing, primarily because these services require minimal startup capital. Which Business Is Best in Medical? The ideal medical business will depend on your individual expertise, professional experience, and overall objectives. For individuals with medical degrees, a conventional healthcare facility may be the most appropriate choice. However, if your primary objective is to capitalize on a lucrative venture, you might want to consider focusing on low-cost, high-demand services such as medical records management and billing outsourcing. These sectors often provide steady revenue streams and have the added advantage of being operable remotely.

Whether you’re rooted in healthcare expertise or fueled by a passion for innovation, the healthcare sector offers a diverse range of opportunities to cater to the evolving needs of patients and healthcare providers alike. At its core, a healthcare business encompasses entities that provide medical services to patients or furnish products and services essential to the healthcare ecosystem. The expanse of this industry is immense, spanning from conventional medical practices to groundbreaking medical technology startups. In recent times, healthcare expenditure in the United States has accounted for nearly 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), signifying its profound economic impact. This financial allocation is dispersed among a multitude of private businesses, each contributing vital products and services critical for patient care. From pharmaceutical giants to providers of hospital services and beyond, these enterprises are integral components of the healthcare landscape. Additionally, those exploring healthcare business ideas can find numerous opportunities within this expansive sector. Image: Envato Elements More in: Develop an Idea , Healthcare Business"

With nearly 100 out of every 1000 children not surviving to see their fifth birthday, infant mortality at 70 per 1000 births, 32 per cent of pregnant women not receiving antenatal care and only about 40 per cent babies delivered in health facilities in Bayelsa State, the ambulance boats are timely to improve survival rates for women and children. ""The provision of these ambulance boats represents a critical step towards ensuring that even the most remote communities have access to lifesaving healthcare services, said Ms. Cristian Munduate, UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative. ""These boats will not only serve as a means of transportation for patients but also function as platforms for delivering essential healthcare interventions, such as immunizations, antenatal care, and health education, directly to those in need"". ""We are deeply grateful for the donation of these six ambulance boats, which bring hope to our riverine communities. This initiative is an important step in our ongoing efforts to safeguard the lives of our mothers, children, and vulnerable populations across Bayelsa. These boats will not only ensure timely medical interventions but also fortify our resolve to provide equitable healthcare services, irrespective of geographical barriers. Together, we are navigating towards a brighter, healthier future for every citizen of Bayelsa State."" Said His Excellency Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, Deputy Governor, Bayelsa State. This initiative builds on the priorities of the Federal Ministry of Health as expressed in the Nigeria Health Renewal Investment Initiative, to make the health system more equitable and efficient, reduce the number of children who have not received any vaccine, and improve immunization coverage. The delivery of the ambulance boats makes up part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2022 between the Bayelsa State Government, the Federal Ministry of Health, the Nigeria Governors Forum, GAVI, and UNICEF to improve routine immunization and primary healthcare systems and reduce loss of life, particularly among women and children. Note to Editors: The MoU has significantly strengthened primary healthcare service delivery in Bayelsa State by increasing the demand for healthcare services and bolstering its healthcare workforce through the recruitment of 527 skilled health workers, comprising nurses, midwives, and community health extension workers, addressing the chronic challenge of human resources for health. The renovation of six primary healthcare centres, including improvements in health and WASH amenities, has enhanced access to healthcare services, particularly in remote and underserved communities. Through integrated outreaches and supportive supervisory visits, the state has reached thousands of children with essential primary healthcare services, including immunization, nutrition, and birth registration.

This comprehensive program provides healthcare organizations across the continuum of care a roadmap to implement top-tier compliance standards by addressing key population monitoring gaps, prioritizing financial efficiencies, and upholding community healthcare and success. Continue Reading ProviderTrust co-founder and partner, Christopher Redhage ProviderTrust was founded in 2010 with a mission to create a safe healthcare experience for everyone. Since that time, the organization has uniquely led the way in providing innovative solutions that uphold data integrity for ongoing exclusion monitoring, timely license and credential verification, and healthcare vendor data collection. ProviderTrust data services encompass more than 10,000,000 monitored entities, 43,000,000 annual license verifications, and 3,600,000 vendors monitored continuously for compliance. Impact Compliance represents a shift in the organization's market approach, establishing a compliance spectrum that measures healthcare organizations' exclusion monitoring and license and credential verification processes against gold-standard practices to demonstrate their tangible impact on eradicating fraud , waste, and abuse. Impact Compliance considers three different components – population, primary sources, and monitoring/verification frequency – to outline industry best practices in holistic compliance monitoring. ""The industry has changed a lot since we started,"" said Christopher Redhage , ProviderTrust co-founder and partner. ""What is surprising, though, is how many organizations are doing exclusion monitoring and license verification manually or leveraging low-cost providers that are missing verifications and not only putting their organization at risk but enabling bad actors to continually manipulate the healthcare system. We want our solutions to be a roadmap to help organizations move from check-the-box compliance to a compliance department that is measuring their impact both internally and externally in the communities they service. That's how we play differently; that's how we partner to ensure safer healthcare for all."" ProviderTrust Addresses Vendor Data Gaps with Comprehensive Vendor Compliance Solution As part of ProviderTrust's larger Impact Compliance program, the organization's new Comprehensive Vendor Compliance solution includes updated financial benefits and a renewed commitment to supporting healthcare organizations in addressing one of the most difficult population monitoring challenges - vendor entities, vendor owners, and vendor employees. These populations often show up within the walls of healthcare organizations, whether via contracts or boots on the ground, interacting with workflows, employees, and/or patients, exposing healthcare organizations to unforeseen risks if not monitored properly. Comprehensive Vendor Compliance activates best practices in annual vendor data collection and ongoing exclusion monitoring of vendor populations, ensuring payment eligibility, vendor onboarding and approval workflows, custom questionnaires and attestations, and identification of vendor ownership structure. ""Over the last 14 years, we have worked hard to solve the many compliance monitoring challenges for employees and physician networks, and we've continued to take a hard look at the challenges that plague vendor networks within healthcare organizations,"" Redhage added. ""What we've seen is that most healthcare organizations lack the resources and/or infrastructure to properly manage compliance around vendor entities and vendor owner populations. At the basic level, these organizations lack the data needed to comply with the OIG regulations related to vendor monitoring. The result is that our healthcare system continues to empower bad actors, often hiding behind the corporate veil, to extract value out of the system and drive costs up for everyone. ProviderTrust solves this healthcare issue with Comprehensive Vendor Compliance by collecting the required vendor information to meet OIG standards, verifying and monitoring the vendors ongoing, all while helping to drive down costs and eliminate fraud ."" Comprehensive Vendor Compliance is complementary to ProviderTrust's Federal and State Exclusion Monitoring and License and Credential Verification solutions. To learn more, visit providertrust.com . About ProviderTrust ProviderTrust was founded in 2010 with a mission to create safer healthcare for everyone through OIG and state Medicaid exclusion monitoring. Today, the organization has developed the industry's most accurate dataset for ongoing exclusion monitoring and primary source verification, serving the nation's top health systems, payers, and pharmacy organizations. Our solutions monitor employees, vendors, provider networks, licenses, credentials, and more for OIG and state Medicaid exclusions, sanctions or disciplinary actions, license expirations, or suspensions.

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1523980.html,,"Urgent need to re - introduce Indian Medical Services to address India healthcare needs , say medical experts",20240418T131500Z,https://www.prokerala.com/news/photos/imgs/450/j-k-health-dept-seals-clinic-run-by-fake-doctor-in-anantnag-1692114.jpg,prokerala.com,English,India,XLV,Healthcare,healthcare,"New Delhi, April 18 : Think Change Forum (TCF), an independent think tank dedicated to generating new ideas and finding solutions for navigating through a new changing world, recently held a panel discussion titled -- Is it time for India to resurrect Indian Medical Services? The discussion highlighted the imperative of strengthening the public healthcare system and emphasised the pivotal role that Indian Medical Services (IMS) can play in achieving this objective. The panel consisted of representatives from medical associations, public-sector health institutions, and the private medical sector. The participants included Dr Sharad Agarwal - National President, the Indian Medical Association (IMA); Dr Varuna Pathak - Former Professor of Gynecology & Obstetrics, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal; Dr Sita Naik - Professor and Head of the Department of Clinical Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences; Dr Vidur Jyoti - Senior Director & Head, Minimal Access & General Surgery, Max Hospital, Gurgaon; Dr Rajesh Gupta - Additional Director, Pulmonology & Critical Care, Fortis Healthcare, Noida; Dr SL Vig - Assistant Professor Community Medicine - ESIC Medical College Faridabad. Experts urged for the introduction of an elite cadre for medical experts under Indian Medical Services (IMS) akin to Indian Administrative Services (IAS). IMS will help bring the sheen and trust back to the public health sector which has been lost to the private sector; help stop the brain drain from public medical services by attracting and retaining the best medical talent; allow for superior healthcare outcomes with better-managed facilities and processes, as no longer generalists will be managing the specialists; reduce health crises and reduction in tertiary cases by improved preventive healthcare at primary levels; and last but not the least will enable seamless coordination between states and Centre for healthcare policymaking. IMS was present during the British era but was discontinued after India's Independence. The current government has made commendable efforts in healthcare and has implemented impactful schemes like Ayushman Bharat. However, still, the gap is huge, requiring systemic changes. Expert panellists have proposed a '5-Point Agenda' for bringing IMS back in India: The first point emphasizes an excessive reliance on the private sector to meet the healthcare demands of Indian citizens. Overall, the healthcare infrastructure is fractured and falls short of providing quality and effective healthcare at scale. These shortcomings primarily stem from inefficient bureaucratic management rather than a lack of skills among healthcare professionals. An IMS will help bring the sheen and trust back to the public health sector which has been lost to the private sector. Explaining this, Dr Rajesh Gupta said, ""The majority of the Indian public relies on the private sector for healthcare services, with 60 per cent of inpatient admissions (IPDs) and 80 per cent of outpatient visits (OPDs) occurring in private facilities."" Dr Varuna Pathak, elaborated further, ""Most of the time, we observe systemic failures in healthcare, which are not necessarily the fault of healthcare professionals but rather of the administrator who would typically be a generalist bureaucrat."" Dr Vidur Jyoti said, ""During the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges and bottlenecks encountered in managing contingencies were primarily attributed to bureaucratic hurdles rather than any lack of commitment from healthcare professionals."" The second point highlighted challenges in staffing the public healthcare system with skilled doctors. The lack of incentives for these highly educated professionals to work under generalist administrators has resulted in a brain drain. To retain quality doctors and ensure health security for the population, there is an urgent need to establish IMS which will help stop brain drain from public medical services by attracting and retaining the best medical talent. Dr. Sharad Agarwal said, ""The implementation of IMS holds the promise of enhancing service quality through induction of skilled doctors and addressing the persistent doctor shortage, especially in rural areas. Crucial to its success is equipping the cadre with ample facilities and resources comparable to those provided to IAS or IPS officers. This will ensure that doctors are incentivised to join IMS, drawn by a clear career trajectory and motivated to serve communities, even in remote areas."" Dr. SL Vig said, ""For fresh medical graduates, the IMS can serve as a promising career path, commencing with postings at district or block levels. Advancement of opportunities within the cadre should be structured, allowing progression based on experience, from community health centre (CSC) to district, state and eventually ministry levels."" The third point underscored the necessity of superior health outcomes for the citizens with better-managed facilities and processes, which will happen when no longer generalists will be managing the specialists. Integrated Health Leadership, with leaders having both clinical capabilities and management capabilities, is what a country like India uniquely needs, to efficiently manage healthcare systems ranging from grassroots to the tertiary levels. Dr Sharad Agarwal explained, ""We are advocating for the reinstatement of IMS because healthcare requires a unique approach distinct from other fields. The case for an IMS becomes even more apparent when observing successful private healthcare setups, wherein medical professionals adeptly balance both clinical expertise and administrative skills."" Dr Sita Naik also suggested that ""There is a need to transform the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) into an all-India service in the form of IMS."" The fourth point focuses on an urgent need to avert growing incidences of health crises and reduction in tertiary cases which can happen by improving preventive healthcare and delivery at primary healthcare levels. An effective IMS will enable this, which in turn reduces the cost of health for all stakeholders. Explaining this, Dr Vidur Jyoti said, ""The need for change in medical services in India lies in the fact that the essentials of healthcare are being overlooked. We are essentially moving into disease management and are neglecting health management which has put immense pressure on the tertiary system. In healthcare, the essentials are knowledge acquisition, deployment and application which require constant updating, unlearning and relearning. To effectively manage these complexities, it is necessary to have dedicated medical service officers in the country."" Dr SL Vig said, ""Along with primary care, we need to offer primordial prevention and primary prevention also."" The fifth point highlights that an IMS will be able to enable seamless coordination and cooperation between the central and state health departments, for improved national healthcare policies for the country. Dr SL Vig elaborated on this, ""Respecting the constitutional framework, let's preserve health as a state subject while introducing the IMS. Similar to other central services, the IMS cadre can serve as a force multiplier to implement central healthcare policies and schemes, customising them to meet the unique healthcare requirements at the state and community levels."""

Credit: DC Studio / Shutterstock The Change Healthcare ransomware attack has provoked calls to mandate baseline security standards for healthcare providers during Congressional hearings on Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group (UHG) was criticized for its response to a February 2024 attack on its Change Healthcare subsidiary during a three-hour hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee . The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group broke into Change Healthcare’s systems and encrypted its data before demanding an extortionate payment to restore access. Change Healthcare operates the US’s biggest clearing house for medical claims. The disruption caused by the attack hit healthcare providers, hospitals, pharmacies, and patients across the US. Impacted systems were taken offline in response to the attack. During an earnings call on Tuesday, United HealthGroup said it had already taken $872 million in dealing with the attack and the disruption it caused. The aftershocks Unconfirmed reports , based on payments to a Bitcoin wallet associated with ALPHV, suggest that Change Healthcare paid a $22m ransom to cybercriminals. More recently, the self-styled RansomHub group claimed to have obtained stolen data from the Change Healthcare breach, threatening to leak this sensitive information unless it was paid off. The group published samples of stolen data in an effort to bolster its claims. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) this week launched an investigation into the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare , focused on whether a breach of protected health information occurred and Change Healthcare’s and UHG’s compliance with the HIPAA healthcare sector privacy regulations. Over the last five years, there has been a 264% increase in ransomware attacks, according to HHS. Hackers’ playground UnitedHealth , which owns health insurance businesses, and Change Healthcare merged in 2022. During the Congressional hearing, E&C chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) warned, “As our healthcare system becomes more consolidated, the impacts of cyberattacks – if successful – may be more widespread.” Sub-committee member Anna Eshoo (D-CA) described the healthcare sector as a “hackers’ playground” with UnitedHealth a prime target because of its size. “The attack shows how UnitedHealth’s anticompetitive practices present a national security risk because its operations now extend through every point of our health care system,” Eshoo said. “The cyberattack laid bare the vulnerability of our nation’s healthcare infrastructure.” Requirements of specific minimum cybersecurity standards may be necessary for certain healthcare entities, Congressman Frank Pallone said. Pallone also raised questions about whether consolidation of health technology companies poses an unreasonable risk to healthcare systems. Senator Mark Warner has proposed a bill to offer support payments to healthcare providers and vendors hit by cyberattacks providing they meet minimum security standards. Consolidation danger The consolidation in the healthcare sector more generally poses cybersecurity dangers, pointed out Raghu Nandakumara, head of industry solutions at Illumio. “Consolidation clearly provides lots of benefits and economies of scale, but the high level of interconnectivity leads to considerable cyber risks if not managed properly and consistently,” Nandakumara said. “The only way to significantly reduce this risk is through regulation that compels all organizations to achieve the same baseline level of cybersecurity.” The healthcare sector needs something akin to the EU’s Digital Operational and Resiliency Act (DORA), a set of regulations for the financial sector. “This harmonizes cyber security standards and mandates that all organizations within the sector implement the same basic level of security controls, such as network segmentation, to reduce risk and build resilience both within each organization and across the sector as a whole,” Nandakumara said. Kim Wiles, senior product manager and government cyber security expert at Nominet blamed the breach on “poor cybersecurity preparedness” and “badly managed supply chain and industry consolidation risks.” “We still don’t know how BlackCat breached Change Healthcare’s network, security testing, and tabletop exercises could have allowed UnitedHealthcare to avoid such a catastrophically systemic outcome from the breach of their new subsidiary. Governments should also expect these exercises to be done and reported to regulators to help them assess the viability of mergers in key industries,” Wiles said. Incident response plan The healthcare industry has proven to be a high-value target for cybercriminals, with organizations in possession of sensitive data such as patients’ medical information, hospital bills, and other financial documents. Healthcare organizations must adopt a comprehensive incidence response plan to defend against growing ransomware threats, advised Azeem Aleem, MD of the UK and Northern Europe at Sygnia, an incidence response and ransomware negotiation consultancy. “This involves mapping out critical data, defining key roles for breach alerts, safeguarding essential business operations, and reviewing third-party partnerships for potential data access risks,” Aleem said. “Regular testing of incidence response protocols through simulations and wargames helps refine processes, bolster backup strategies, and identify areas needing improvement.” Kelly Indah, a tech expert and security analyst at Increditools, said that “robust security due diligence during merger planning rather than later” could have helped Change Healthcare. She also recommended segmenting network access and credentials based on need-to-know, prioritizing security upgrades for legacy or outdated systems that may pose extra risks. “Achieving a robust security posture is no simple task, particularly when an organization experiences major changes like a large merger,” Indah said.

This initiative represents a significant investment in the total well-being of its employees, reinforcing Health Carousel's role as a pioneer in cultivating a supportive and enriching workplace environment. Continue Reading Health Carousel's Full Circle of Support program is a comprehensive well-being initiative designed to support the physical, financial, mental, social, and professional health of its employees. The 'Full Circle of Support' program is structured around five pillars: Physical Well-Being, Financial Well-Being, Mental Well-Being, Professional Well-Being, and Social Well-Being. Each pillar is designed to provide targeted support and resources, ranging from comprehensive health insurance plans and financial planning tools to professional development opportunities and community engagement activities. John Sebastian , CEO of Health Carousel, emphasized the program's alignment with the company's core values: ""At Health Carousel, we believe that our strength lies in our people. The 'Full Circle of Support' program is a testament to our commitment to not just meet, but exceed, the needs of our diverse workforce.

""We recognize the essential need for temporary healthcare workers to have access to substantial support programs. Health Carousel is at the forefront of meeting this demand, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to the welfare of our healthcare professionals,"" stated Earl Dalton , Health Carousel's Chief Nursing Officer and leader of the company's in-house clinical support team. This April, Health Carousel is proud to launch the 'Full Circle of Support' with a special focus on Mental Wellbeing, aptly named 'Mental Health Matters' in recognition of Stress Awareness Month. This initiative shines a spotlight on several key programs: AbleTo: A virtual behavioral coaching program provided by United Healthcare at no cost to plan participants, offering comprehensive support for various mental health concerns. Your Listening Partner (YLP): Exclusively available to Health Carousel healthcare professionals, YLP offers up to three free sessions with Dr. Claire Biedenharn , DMin, BCC, creator of Heart to Heart Spiritual Care and the Listening Partner program.

Bernie Sanders, an Independent representing Vermont, speaks at a Studio event. Jump to Section Share Post LinkedIn Facebook WhatsApp Email Copy link April 17, 2024 ­– The U.S. health care system is “totally broken,” according to Sen. Bernie Sanders. Speaking to members of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health community on April 12, Sanders, an Independent senator from Vermont, explained why the system doesn’t work. “It is a system not designed to provide health care to all people in a cost-effective way,” he said. “It is a system designed to make huge profits for the insurance companies, the drug companies, and many other industries within the system.” Sanders drew a large crowd to Kresge Auditorium Sanders spoke at a Studio event that filled Harvard Chan School’s Kresge Auditorium. The talk, also streamed online, was moderated by Sara Bleich , professor of public health policy at Harvard Chan School and vice provost for special projects at Harvard University. Outlining the problems plaguing health care in the U.S., Sanders noted that the nation spends $13,000 per person each year on health care—double that of comparable countries—yet has significantly worse health outcomes. Across the country, 85 million people are either uninsured or underinsured. People in the U.S. pay more money for prescription drugs than people anywhere else in the world. And about 60,000 Americans die each year because they can’t get access to health care in a timely way. The U.S. also lags in life expectancy—and not just compared to other high-income countries. “Our life expectancy is substantially lower than many other countries around the world, including countries like Portugal that spend a fraction of what we spend on health care,” Sanders said. He added, “If you are low-income or working-class in this country, your life expectancy will be 10 years shorter than people who have money. In other words, poverty in America is a death sentence.” He listed other problems with the system, including crushing amounts of medical debt that cause 500,000 people in America to go bankrupt each year, lack of access to health care in rural areas and rural hospitals shutting down, and a massive mental health crisis. “All of this to me is almost unbelievable,” Sanders said. “If we were a poor country, it would be explicable. Not in the richest country on earth. … We don’t have enough doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, mental health counselors, dentists. We don’t even have enough pharmacists. We have a major crisis in our public health workforce.” Medical students, he added, can sometimes face staggering debt for their education that can soar as high as $400,000 to $500,000. Facing such debt, new doctors are more likely to opt for a high-paying specialty rather than a position in primary care in a rural area in need of clinicians. Sanders called it “insane” that people’s health insurance is typically tied to their employment because it creates a system in which low-wage workers often have substandard health care. And if people lose their jobs—like many did during the pandemic—they may also lose their health care, he said. ‘Health care is a human right’ Long-term, Sanders would like to see a Medicare-for-all single-payer system in the U.S. But he acknowledged that the nation’s current politics don’t favor that kind of large-scale change, and highlighted a plan he proposed with Democratic Senate colleagues calling for expanding Medicare eligibility slowly over time so that it will eventually cover everyone. He believes that to effectively solve the nation’s health system problems “we must resolve that health care is a human right, not a privilege. The function is to guarantee high-quality health care to all people, regardless of their income, not to make huge profits for insurance companies and drug companies.” The health care debate, he added, “is not about health care—it’s about economics and about politics and about who gets what. … Can government actually respond to the needs of people who are hurting with regard to health care? Or are we going to continue to fall prey to the power of big money interests?” Bernie Sanders and Sara Bleich In response to a question from Bleich about the high cost of prescription drugs, Sanders suggested possible solutions, with drug companies. Another idea would be to offer drug companies prizes instead of patents—and if they develop successful drugs with the help of NIH-funded research, those drugs should be made available to people everywhere for a negotiated reasonable price, Sanders said. Bleich also asked about Sanders’ recent proposed legislation for a long COVID “moonshot.” The proposal calls for $10 billion over the next decade for a new long COVID research program at the National Institutes of Health. In addition to the funding, Sander said it’s important to let the 20 million Americans living with long COVID know that “you’re not alone, we understand that your suffering is real.” At the end of the program, Bleich posed questions to Sanders that had been sent in by students. One student asked Sanders to identify the most critical action people can take now to push for policy change in health care. “Expose how dysfunctional and wasteful and deadly the system is,” Sanders responded. “We need all of you to understand you’re in a war here, taking on very special interests who could care less whether people live or die. You’ve got to be vocal, and you’ve got to be prepared to take them on.” He added, “In my view, if we work together, I think we can create the kind of country I know we can become.” – Karen Feldscher Photos: Ben Gebo Related Topics Health Policy , Infectious Diseases , Mental Health Last Updated December 10, 2024 Related News How Lucian Leape inspired a patient safety movement Health Policy October 30, 2025 In the Media Assessing the fallout of MA hospital closures after Steward bankruptcy Health Policy October 28, 2025 In the Media Opinion: Equipping public health students to navigate controversy, uncertainty Health Policy October 22, 2025 Get the latest public health news Stay connected with Harvard Chan School Subscribe to our newsletters Unleash your potential at Harvard Chan School.

The claims are the latest development in the ongoing fallout from the widely felt Change Healthcare ransomware attack, which was first disclosed nearly two months ago. [Related: Federal Scrutiny Growing Over Change Healthcare Breach ] A report Monday from BleepingComputer indicated that the RansomHub cybercriminal gang has started to post data allegedly stolen from Change Healthcare on the group’s extortion site. The screenshots of files posted by the group suggest that both patient and corporate data were impacted, according to the report. “We are working with law enforcement and outside experts to investigate claims posted online to understand the extent of potentially impacted data,” UnitedHealth said in a statement Tuesday. “Our investigation remains active and ongoing.” UnitedHealth added that there’s “no evidence of any new cyber incident at Change Healthcare.” The attack against prescription processor Change Healthcare, which is a unit of UnitedHealth’s Optum subsidiary, was first disclosed Feb. 22. The attack prevented many U.S.-based pharmacies and hospitals, as well as other health-care facilities and offices, from processing claims and receiving payments for several weeks. A different cybercrime group, known as AlphV and Blackcat, had claimed responsibility for the attack and said on its darkweb site that it exfiltrated 6 TB of data from Change Healthcare. The claim of stolen data had previously prompted the Department of Health and Human Services to launch an investigation into the incident in connection with HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) rules. The probe has been focusing on “whether a breach of protected health information occurred and Change Healthcare’s and UHG’s compliance with the HIPAA rules,” according to a letter posted last month. The alleged data extortion attempt may be the second time UnitedHealth has been asked to pay a ransom demand in connection with the Change Healthcare attack. Security researchers previously shared evidence suggesting UnitedHealth paid cybercriminals a $22 million ransom to regain access to its systems. The insurance giant has declined to comment on the reports. Business Impact Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group reported Tuesday that the impacts of the Change Healthcare attack cost the company $872 million during the first quarter of the year. The figure includes both direct response costs and the impacts from business disruption, the company said. In addition, UnitedHealth noted that cash flows “were affected by approximately $3 billion due to the company’s cyberattack response actions, including funding acceleration to care providers, and were additionally impacted due to the timing of public sector cash receipts.” UnitedHealth said in March that it has advanced roughly $3 billion to care providers with finances disrupted by the attack."

(NYSE: AUNA) (""Auna"" or ""the Company""), a Latin American healthcare company with operations in Mexico, Peru and Colombia, today announced a business update regarding its operations in Colombia. On April 2 and 3, 2024, the Colombian healthcare regulator, Superintendencia de Salud (""SUPERSALUD""), assumed temporary control of three providers (""EPSs"") of general and mandatory health insurance plans in Colombia through an administrative intervention in order to oversee compliance with their payment obligations to healthcare service providers and with their financial and solvency requirements. These three EPSs are Sanitas EPS, a privately-owned insurance provider, Nueva EPS, a state-controlled insurance provider, and SOS EPS, a smaller regional insurance provider. SUPERSALUD noted that the interventions are preventive measures and are not intended to imply a reduction in the payment for healthcare services nor layoffs at the EPSs. Nueva EPS is the largest EPS in Colombia, backed by the Colombian government, with over 10 million members, and represents approximately 7% of Auna's consolidated revenues. Sanitas EPS is not material to Auna and Auna does not have any business relationship with SOS EPS. Measures taken as part of these administrative interventions include the appointment of a general manager tasked with facilitating compliance by the affected EPSs with financial and solvency requirements, along with facilitating payments to private healthcare service providers directly through the Colombian agency tasked with managing funds contributed to the public healthcare system, Administradora de los Recursos del Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud (""ADRES""). The Colombian healthcare system operates through a publicly funded healthcare system that funnels payments through private insurance companies to private healthcare service providers, such as Auna. Over 80% of healthcare services in Colombia are delivered by these private healthcare service providers and are paid for by private insurance companies. Private insurance companies receive most of their funding from ADRES. Auna delivers healthcare services to Nueva EPS policy members, with a long-standing relationship, and thus regularly receives payments from Nueva EPS. Since the administrative intervention of Nueva EPS and Sanitas EPS, Auna has continued to receive payments related to services provided to Nueva EPS and Sanitas EPS policy holders, and Auna is not expecting payments to deteriorate. Auna is closely monitoring developments in Colombia and will continue to inform the market of any material developments on this matter. Auna reiterates its mission of bringing healthcare access to the markets in the region in which it operates. About Auna Auna is a Latin American healthcare company with operations in Mexico, Peru and Colombia, prioritizing prevention and concentrating on high complexity diseases that contribute the most to healthcare expenditures. Our mission is to transform healthcare by providing access to a highly integrated healthcare offering in the underpenetrated markets of Spanish Speaking Americas. Founded in 1989, Auna has built one of Latin America´s largest modern healthcare platforms that consists of a horizontally integrated network of healthcare facilities and a vertically integrated portfolio of oncological plans and selected general healthcare plans. As of December 31, 2023, Auna's network included 31 healthcare network facilities, consisting of hospitals, outpatient, prevention and wellness facilities with a total of 2,308 beds, and 1.3 million healthcare plans.

These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect. In addition, Auna's business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Auna, which could result in Auna's expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Auna. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in forward-looking statements are limitations on reimbursement and payment for health services from insurance institutions in Colombia, statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, funding restrictions and solvency risks of third-party payers.

A significant number of neonates are dead due to a very virulent organism that has spread within this extremely vulnerable group of patients. Do not blame persons but investigate and rectify the poorly managed systems that have been operating in healthcare institutions in this country for years that place our highly skilled and qualified healthcare providers at serious risk at all levels of the organisation. Critically examine and strengthen the executive and senior management skills and competencies in managing this complex, dynamic system called healthcare. I hope that the class action lawsuit not only brings some closure for the relatives of the deceased babies but highlight a very serious problem with the management of healthcare within this country. The Trinidad and Tobago populace must demand that qualified, skilled, and experienced senior management personnel and executives be hired rather than facilitating selected persons in key positions such as CEOs, Medical Directors, Hospital Managers, Directors, CFOs etc. There exist very detailed protocols and processes for every single service-line in healthcare systems. There are rapidly evolving evidence-based systems that must be implemented in healthcare systems to adapt to the post-Covid era, the current fourth industrial period and new generations. Continuous measurement of healthcare systems must be implemented or strengthened if they exist and managed by skilled persons using standard universally accepted healthcare performance indicators and cascading dashboards. The philosophy of healthcare must now necessarily include a risk-based approach at all levels using Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) techniques to monitor, evaluate, report, and so improve the quality of healthcare at all levels in the organisation, viz., primary care through to tertiary care and now even at the homes of patients. Early warning signs are essential in all emergency systems such as disaster risk reduction, healthcare, border security and port health etc. The human body works that way. Failure to identify, implement, continuously monitor and report standard performance indicators of healthcare systems operations using these dashboards, such as hospital infection control, falls in hospital, errors and near misses, adverse events, waiting times, readmission rates, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, throughput rates, garbage codes, etc. will eventually lead to situations that we see today at the NWRHA. Failure to map all processes and revise standard operational procedures (SOPs) on an ongoing basis based on policies and procedures that are approved by the RHA Boards for everything imaginable; from a patient accessing a health centre at a remote site or a district visitor attending to a patient at his/her home or even a return call for an elective surgery or clinic appointment to highly complex systems such as exists at NICUs and ICUs etc. will lead to issues that we are seeing today. Every single procedure in healthcare has been documented already, for example, for appropriate insurance reimbursements in other states, the use of Common Procedural Codes and Terminology is vital. Appropriate legislation exists that protects patient data such as HIPAA (USA). The use of ERM and RCA at all levels of the organisation can protect from cyberattacks and data loss as occurred at the SWRHA recently and train persons at all levels to identify, mitigate, manage all risks that healthcare institutions are exposed to at this time and in the next ten years. I am so sorry that the parents, family, and friends of the deceased babies must go through this ordeal. I hope that leaders in healthcare and disaster management and indeed crime management, understand that blaming persons for a system problem is not right. This is the focus of ERM and RCA in healthcare. At least if you have already placed your people for whatever reason in key management and executive positions then at least contact University of Trinidad and Tobago and acquire some training and on the job executive coaching in these vital areas as soon as possible. Do the right thing, learn from mistakes and errors, and prevent adverse events in healthcare and improve now. There is always room for improvement.

Last Wednesday, National Council of Parent Teacher Associations (NPTA) head Walter Stewart, on TV6’s Morning Edition, said such incidents remained too high despite the presence of the School Oriented Policing Unit (SOPU). In a newspaper column published last week, the Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association (TTUTA) wrote, “While in some schools the permanent presence of police officers seems to have had an overall positive impact on student discipline, this picture is not consistent.” A breakfast shed business model It was a tumultuous week for the private business sector. The pending closure of MovieTowne, Tobago, underscored the lack of economic activity and growth on the sister isle which, according to Tobago businesswoman Diane Hadad, “has been at a stalemate”. The same can be said for Trini­dad, and that would be the optimistic position to adopt given that, also last week, ANSA McAL announced the closure of furniture retail chain Standard Distributors, followed by Nutrien Ltd confirming its October 23 “controlled shutdown” with a forecast of “no additional sales volumes from our Trinidad operations for the remainder of 2025”. Citizens awaiting next steps on jobs The United National Congress has been in office for more than six months. In that time the country has undergone changes that could not even have been imagined when the People’s National Movement was in office. The sense of hopelessness and despair that engulfed us all before has been transmuted into a bright new day and hope for the vast majority of our citizens who had been wilfully ignored for the last ten years. Save our sanity: enforce noise laws ACROSS the country, more and more people are being assaulted by unrelenting noise. Loud music pours from our neighbours’ homes, from cars with massive speakers, and even from boys on bicycles blasting tunes as they ride. Every sale, event, or celebration seems to demand the loudest possible soundtrack, while the rest of us are left helplessly enduring the constant bombardment. What many call “entertainment” has become an unending wave of noise that is breaking our collective peace and sanity. When leaders forget Remembrance Day THE Remembrance Day Parade is an occasion to recognise and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty for our country and to protect us from tyranny. It is in this regard that it was indeed noticed—and for the first time ever—there was the absence of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Security Minister, and Commissioner of Police to lay a wreath in their official capacity on Memorial Day. The ironies of politics THE fervent loyalty to party and leader, which overrides concerns for good governance, the welfare of the ­majority, and integrity and principle in public life is neither a new phenomenon in T&T nor is it confined to any one party, as seems to be suggested by Simon Wright. In a recent letter to the media, he states: “There is a dangerous and growing mindset in T&T—one where political loyalty has begun to outweigh national interest.” Legal constraints on economic revitalisation T&T can achieve Kamla’s dream Thomas-Felix will represent with integrity Avoiding the shadows of war Columbus all over again Facebook Twitter Instagram Tweets by expressupdates Instagram"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Sally Pipes is a scholar and think tank CEO who writes on health care. Follow Author Apr 15, 2024, 08:00am EDT Share Save RALEIGH, USA - MARCH 26: US President Joe Biden (L) along with vice president Kamala Harris (R) and North Carolina governor Roy Cooper (not seen) delivers remarks about healthcare in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States on March 26, 2024. (Photo by Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu via Getty Images Speaking to supporters in North Carolina late last month, Vice President Kamala Harris said , ""We here agree that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it."" President Biden picked up the thread when he joined Harris on stage, saying he envisioned ""a future where healthcare is a right""—a future he hopes to build by expanding Obamacare. Declaring health care a right does not make it so. Health care is a suite of goods and services, subject to the laws of supply and demand, just like everything else in our economy. The current occupants of the White House are hardly the first people to declare a right to health care. The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted in 1948, includes a ""right to . . . medical care"" Senator Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was one of the first politicians to argue that ""decent quality health care [is] a fundamental right and not a privilege,"" a talking point since echoed by Democrats including Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama . In this context, ""right"" just means ""something we think everyone ought to have."" In reality, rights are things to which every human is morally and legally entitled. Generally, when we talk about rights, we are talking about ""negative rights""—things that we enjoy naturally, absent interference from our neighbors and government. The ""unalienable"" rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness enumerated in the Declaration of Independence are the most famous examples of negative rights. The First Amendment's protection of Americans' freedom to speak, write, and worship, is a close second. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor ""Positive rights,"" meanwhile, require others to give something to us: food, education, health care. And that's where things get tricky. First of all, it's impossible to agree on what these rights entail. Does a ""right to health care"" mean people are entitled to basic things like vaccines and the ability to go to a doctor? Or does it cover a wider array of things, like surgeries and cutting-edge drugs? And who gets to define the parameters? Will it be the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or some other group entirely? Let's imagine for a moment that we could all agree on what a right to health care does or ought to include. That does not solve the biggest problem with positive rights, namely that they deal with finite resources. Declaring a right to housing does not open up land for development or pay for timber and tools, nor does declaring a right to education hire teachers and get kids to attend class. Similarly, declaring a right to health care does not change the fact that there are only so many doctors, hospital beds, and vials of medicine to go around. As with all other goods and services, access to these things is not determined by philosophical concepts, but by economic factors and government regulation. On the latter front, the Biden administration is actively undermining its stated goal. Two days after Biden and Harris spoke in North Carolina, their administration finalized a rule that would limit short-term, limited duration health plans to a maximum of four months—and thereby neuter them as a more affordable alternative to exchange coverage. Biden says he envisions a future where the Affordable Care Act helps ensure everyone has health insurance. But really, he's just interested in keeping his old boss's flailing healthcare law afloat. And he'll kill alternate forms of insurance to do it—even if, as in the case of limiting short-term insurance, doing so could deprive millions of Americans of health insurance they like and would prefer to keep. In North Carolina, Biden boasted about ""giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs"" through his signature legislative achievement, the Inflation Reduction Act. Once again, this policy cuts against Biden's goal of expanding access to health care. These price controls could lead to the development of 139 fewer drugs over the next decade. What good is a ""right"" to health care if people don't have the freedom to choose affordable insurance or access to lifesaving drugs? Declaring health care a right might woo voters, but it will not do anything to change the fundamental laws of supply and demand. Editorial Standards Reprints & Permissions"

The state has invested significantly in enhancing the health and well-being of its population and achieving sustainability, guided by the wise vision of HH the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, and in pursuit of Qatar's National Vision 2030. As a result, Qatar became the first country where all its municipalities earned the title of ""Healthy City"" from the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, Qatar Foundation's Education City was awarded the title of ""Healthy Educational City,"" and Qatar University was recognized as a ""Healthy University."" Achieving this milestone required placing health as a priority for cities by promoting health, equity, and sustainable development. This pioneering approach was translated into initiatives, strategic policies, and best practices by prioritizing ""Health in All Policies"" in close collaboration across various sectors of the state. The healthcare system in Qatar has become distinguished and unique, earning global trust and reaching international standards. Qatar's healthcare system revolves around the importance of comprehensive healthcare coverage for all members of society, improving the health of the Qatari community, meeting the needs of citizens, residents, and visitors alike, and elevating its services to the highest global standards to achieve Qatar's National Vision 2030. Regarding public healthcare facilities in the country, recent years have witnessed a qualitative leap with an increase in public healthcare facilities and a significant rise in competent healthcare and paramedical staff. By the end of 2023, the public sector had 19 hospitals and long-term care facilities, with the number of public health centers (including those under the Primary Health Care Corporation and those managed by the Qatar Red Crescent under an agreement with the Ministry of Public Health) reaching 35 centers distributed across the state, including 6 health and wellness centers. The total workforce in the public healthcare sector amounted to 29,960 healthcare workers. Conversely, Qatar also focused on encouraging investments in the private healthcare sector, which witnessed a qualitative leap. By the end of 2023, the private sector had 10 hospitals, 21 day surgery centers, 417 general and specialized health centers including dental centers, 319 diagnostic centers encompassing medical laboratories and diagnostic radiology centers, dental laboratories, and vision testing, along with 140 individual clinics and corporate clinics, 135 health and nursing agencies, and 1,251 primary healthcare units. The total workforce in the private healthcare sector amounted to 21,417 healthcare workers. As a result of massive investments in the healthcare sector, Qatar's average life expectancy has increased significantly, reaching 80.3 years in 2021, reflecting major improvements in the population's health indicators. Qatar also achieved several national, regional, and international accomplishments in public health, including global accreditations in public health, performance, operations, patient safety, patient engagement programs, strategic guidance for future years, healthcare development, and public-private partnership programs. HE Minister of Public Health Dr. Hanan Mohamed Al Kuwari emphasized earlier this year that Qatar is proud to be the first country in the world where all its municipalities earned the title of ""Healthy City"" from the World Health Organization. Additionally, Qatar University was awarded the title of ""Healthy University,"" and the Education City by Qatar Foundation received the title of ""Healthy Educational City."" These projects align with the priority of ""Health in All Policies"" in Qatar's National Health Strategy (2018-2022), supporting the Healthy City program. Five hospitals in Qatar were ranked among the top 250 academic medical centers globally. The Primary Health Care Corporation received Canadian accreditation according to Diamond Level Accreditation Standards. Moreover, the Qatar Red Crescent achieved platinum accreditation for all four healthcare centers it operates and manages under a cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Public Health. The Ministry of Public Health has received an award from the World Health Organization for World No Tobacco Day. Additionally, Qatar is proud to have recently launched the first phase of its health insurance system targeting visitors to the country, in accordance with Law No. (22) of 2021 regulating healthcare services within Qatar. This health insurance system aims to support the development and regulation of the healthcare sector in the country, improving the health of the population and their access to essential care services through an efficient and sustainable healthcare system, and regulating healthcare spending. Among the significant achievements in Qatar's healthcare sector is in the field of emergency medical services, where Hamad Medical Corporation's ambulance service has consistently achieved response rates exceeding set targets for emergency response times for the eleventh consecutive year. The target set in the first National Health Strategy is to reach the emergency scene within 10 minutes in urban areas and 15 minutes in rural areas for up to 75% of emergency calls. Aligned with technological advancements and digital transformation, Qatar's healthcare sector has enhanced its electronic health services, making the healthcare system interconnected through electronic systems that enable medical teams to access patient records across various public healthcare facilities, in addition to providing telemedicine services and home medication delivery. The Ministry of Public Health has also launched the new edition of Qatar National Formulary (QNF) via the ministry's website, serving as a national database providing comprehensive and updated information on pharmaceuticals, registration status, regulations, and guidelines, listing over 4,000 officially registered medicines updated monthly. Furthermore, Qatar has been a pioneer in ensuring the right to health, as enshrined in the country's permanent constitution, which emphasizes the state's concern for public health, providing means of disease prevention and treatment in accordance with the law. In this context, the Minister of Public Health emphasized in a press statement on World Health Day, celebrated on April 7, ""that Qatar, keen on ensuring the right to health for all residents, has worked to provide high-quality healthcare services to ensure that individuals in the community receive the care they need at the right place and time, in line with Qatar's national vision and health strategies, contributing to achieving sustainable development goals."" Qatar's healthcare system's efficient response to the global health challenge, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, has been recognized internationally. Qatar recorded one of the lowest pandemic-related mortality rates globally, and its advanced healthcare system and services have successfully supported major sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023, which were among the healthiest sports tournaments. Through collaboration between the Ministry of Public Health and local and international partners, these tournaments contributed to creating a sustainable legacy of health and sports. On the international level, Qatar has provided health support to medium and low-income countries. Notable initiatives include His Highness the Amir's directive for Qatar to treat 1,500 Palestinians from Gaza in designated hospitals, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian brothers amid Israeli aggression. The Ministry of Public Health has also launched several important initiatives aimed at supporting the right to health, including issuing the Patients' Rights and Responsibilities Charter, published in eight languages for ease of understanding by all residents. The charter clearly outlines patients' rights and duties and is mandatory for healthcare facilities in the country to display and implement. In terms of figures, in 2023, Hamad Medical Corporation's outpatient clinics recorded over 2.8 million visits and more than 1.3 million visits to emergency departments, with over 21.6 million laboratory tests, more than 60,000 surgeries, and over 22,000 births. Qatar also focuses on organ donation and transplantation, achieving unprecedented milestones. The number of organ donors registered in the country exceeded 530,000, with approximately 82 kidney transplants, 11 liver transplants, and 3 lung transplants performed successfully in 2023. Acknowledging Qatar's healthcare system's development and significant support for the World Health Organization, Qatar was elected as the President of the World Health Organization Executive Board for its 153rd session for one year, starting May 31, 2023. Furthermore, the World Health Organization designated three centers in Qatar for collaboration, including the Aging Medicine and Long-Term Care Management Department at Hamad Medical Corporation, the Tobacco Control Center, and the WCM-Q Collaborating Center for Disease Surveillance on HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and viral hepatitis. In the context of international cooperation, the Ministry of Public Health signed an operational arrangement memorandum with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the fields of radiology and food safety, aiming to establish a framework for (non-exclusive) cooperation between Qatar and the International Atomic Energy Agency in human health to contribute to enhancing healthcare quality in other countries, especially in less developed countries. Additionally, several advanced laboratories and centers in Qatar will be designated as collaborating centers with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Due to Qatar's significant efforts at both the national and international levels, Her Excellency Dr. Hanan Mohamed Al Kuwari, Minister of Public Health, was selected as the best minister in the world and awarded the Best Minister in the World Award during the recent Global Government Forum held in the United Arab Emirates, in recognition of her exceptional efforts in promoting excellence in the government sector and implementing successful, scalable, and sustainable initiatives.

As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see further innovations in health care. The most viable example of using AI in health care is the application of natural language processing, or NLP, and machine learning algorithms to improve clinical documentation and coding processes. Traditionally, clinical documentation and coding involve manually transcribing patient entries into electronic health records and assigning appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes for billing and insurance reimbursement processes. It can be very time-consuming, error-prone and subject to variability among health care providers. To address these challenges, providers are not only investing in digital transformation but also increasingly adopting AI-driven solutions to automate clinical documentation and coding tasks. These solutions use NLP to extract relevant information from unstructured and even handwritten clinical notes, such as patient histories, physical examinations and treatment plans. Then, machine learning algorithms help analyze data to suggest appropriate diagnosis codes, procedure codes and billing information. AI algorithms can accurately identify and extract relevant clinical information from unstructured text, reducing errors and inconsistencies in clinical documentation and coding. Hence, by automating clinical documentation and coding processes, AI-powered solutions can significantly improve accuracy and efficiency. It will also help streamline the workflow of various stakeholders. By automating manual documentation and coding tasks, AI solutions can free up health care workers’ time to focus on patient care activities and reduce administrative burdens. AI-powered solutions can help providers automate their processes and optimize revenue cycle management by ensuring accurate and timely billing, reducing claim denials and maximizing reimbursement for services rendered. It also helps them with regulatory compliance by automatically matching up with coding standards and various documentation guidelines. That is why health care providers are ambitiously putting their dollars into AI solutions. Even if there are many advantages to integrating AI into health care practice, it also brings several negative consequences and challenges. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration among stakeholders, including health care providers, developers, policymakers and, most importantly, patients. Governments must also establish ethical standards and regulatory frameworks for the responsible use of AI in health care to protect patients. Transparent and accountable AI systems, robust data protection measures and ongoing monitoring and governance are essential to mitigate risks and ensure the safe and effective use of AI in health care. Particularly, a lack of transparency can undermine trust in AI-powered health care solutions among patients and health care professionals. It is yet quite challenging to expect accountability when AI systems make numerous errors and produce unexpected outcomes. Regulators must outsmart AI systems. However, the rapid advancement of AI technology in health care has consistently outpaced the speed of development of regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines. There are still many ethical dilemmas around patient consent, data ownership, transparency of algorithms and the responsible deployment of AI in critical clinical decision-making. Clear and comprehensive regulations and ethical guidelines are much needed to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI in the medical field. AI algorithms could inadvertently perpetuate or amplify biases present in the data used to train them. It could lead to disparities in health care outcomes based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender or socio-economic status. Biased AI systems can exacerbate existing inequalities in health care and lead to unjust treatment of certain patient populations. AI algorithms, like any technology, are not infallible and can make errors, leading to misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment recommendations. Relying too much on AI-driven diagnosis without human intervention can result in harm to patients and undermine trust in AI-powered health care solutions. AI systems rely on large amounts of sensitive patient data, raising concerns about privacy breaches, unauthorized access and data misuse. Inadequate data protection measures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can, therefore, pose a significant risk to patients. AI algorithms may operate as dashcams to deal with these issues. However, it would be even more difficult to understand how AI engines arrive at their decisions. If these risks such as bias, misdiagnosis, privacy risks and lack of transparency are well taken care of with further advancement of technology and governance, AI would certainly fill the gap in health care.

In Short The Situation : Pursuant to California's Health Care Quality and Affordability Act (the ""HCQA""), the newly created Office of Health Care Affordability (""OHCA"") recently proposed statewide health care cost targets and standards and goals for the adoption of alternative payment models (""APMs""). The Result : The proposed health care cost targets and APM adoption goals will increase the pressure on California health care entities to reduce costs. These pressures will have a material impact on negotiations between health care providers and health care payers, and are likely to force many health care providers to rethink their approach to payer contracting. Looking Ahead : Health care providers in California should carefully monitor OHCA's activities and begin to plan for coming changes in their relations with health plans, health insurers, and other payers. Cost Targets The HCQA requires OHCA to establish both statewide and health care sector-specific cost targets that will apply to health care entities, including insurers and commercial and governmental health plans, hospitals and other licensed health facilities, and physician organizations. The cost targets to be established by OHCA are not absolute dollar figures, but are trend numbers, defined as the target percentage for the maximum annual increase in per capita health care expenditures. Health care expenditures include, among other things, amounts paid to health care providers for covered health care benefits, cost sharing (e.g., co-pay, coinsurance, and deductible) amounts for covered health care benefits paid by California residents, and health plan and insurer administrative costs and profits. Under the HCQA, the cost targets established by OHCA must ""promote a predictable and sustainable rate of change in per capita total health care expenditures."" OHCA must establish the first statewide health care cost target no later than June 1, 2024. Recently, OHCA proposed a statewide cost target of 3% for each of the five years commencing January 1, 2025. The proposed target is based not on historical changes in health care costs or spending, but on the average annual rate of change in historical median household income over the 20-year period from 2002-2022. In contrast to the 3% annual growth in median household income, the average annual growth in per capita health care spending over roughly the same period (2000-2020) was 5.4%, a figure that excludes certain costs included in OHCA's proposed cost target. The difference between the two figures is likely to pose serious challenges for health care providers in California, many of whom are still reeling from the impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and a significant increase in workforce wages. Nevertheless, OHCA believes that a cost target based on median household income is appropriate, as it best ""places California on the path of a more sustainable, affordable and equitable health care system, slowing the trajectory of growth [in health care costs] and improving affordability for all."" In addition to a statewide health care cost target, the HCQA requires OHCA to establish cost targets for specific health care sectors. Health sectors, to be defined by OHCA, may include geographic regions as well as individual health care entities. Thus, it is quite possible that payers, hospitals, and other providers will be subject to their own individualized cost target. Given that any provider-specific target must support the attainment of the statewide target, and that there are potential sanctions for exceeding the statewide target, it seems reasonable to assume that provider-specific targets typically will be no greater than the statewide target adopted by OHCA. Sector-specific cost targets need not be set by OHCA until June 1, 2028, so health care entities have some time to prepare. Enforcement Unlike the laws of most of the handful of other states that have adopted some sort of cost growth benchmarking programs, the HCQA expressly contemplates that the state will take enforcement action against health care entities that fail to comply with applicable statewide and/or sector-specific cost targets. Specifically, the director of OHCA is authorized to: Provide technical assistance to the health care entity to assist it to come into compliance; Require or compel public testimony by the health care entity regarding its failure to comply with applicable cost target(s); Require submission and implementation of performance improvement plans, including review and input from OHCA prior to approval; and Assess penalties in amounts initially commensurate with the failure to meet applicable cost targets, and in escalating amounts for repeated or continuing failure to meet such cost targets. In taking action against a health care entity, OHCA will consider the entity's contribution to cost growth in excess of the applicable target and any actions by the entity that ""have eroded, or are likely to erode, access, quality, equity, or workforce stability, factors that contribute to spending in excess of the applicable target, and the extent to which each entity has control over the applicable components of its cost target."" OHCA will not enforce compliance with the statewide cost target established for 2025, but will enforce compliance with the targets established for 2026 and beyond. Despite this lag, health care payers and health care providers should be feeling pressure to conform with the cost targets sooner rather than later, as deals they negotiate within the next year may impact their ability to meet cost targets in 2026. As such, compliance with cost targets will very soon become a key driver in payer-provider negotiations. From here on out, providers can almost certainly expect payers to refuse to entertain negotiated rate increases that exceed statewide or payer-specific cost targets. With margins already thin, controlling their own costs in equal measure will become a critical objective for most providers. Promotion of Alternative Payment Models In addition to setting and enforcing cost targets, OHCA is responsible under the HCQA for promoting a shift away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement to APMs that financially incentivize high-quality and cost-efficient care. To do so, OHCA is charged with, among other things, adopting standards for APMs that may be used during contracting between health care entities, setting statewide goals for the adoption of APMs, and measuring the state's progress toward those goals by requiring payers to submit data and other information to OHCA as appropriate. The HCQA requires OHCA to adopt the APM standards no later than July 1, 2024. In February of this year, OHCA released its proposed set of APM standards . The standards set forth a set of 10 ""best practices"" for APM contracting that focus on improving quality, affordability, and equity and that highlight the importance of data collection, data sharing, and transparency. At the same time, OHCA released its statewide goal for APM adoption, which seeks to have reimbursement for at least 75% of members enrolled in commercial, Medi-Cal, and Medicare Advantage plans paid under some sort of APM arrangement—specifically, one defined as either a Category 3 or Category 4 arrangement by the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network within the next 10 years (by 2034). While OHCA must promote and monitor use of the APM standards by contracting entities, OHCA does not yet have authority to enforce those standards or its statewide goal for APM adoption. As such, OHCA has signaled that it will seek to obtain stakeholder endorsement of the APM standards and a commitment from payers and purchasers to using the standards to guide their future contracting efforts. Given the breadth of the standards, and with enforcement of the health care cost targets not long off, it seems reasonable to assume that OHCA will have very little trouble engaging payers in support of these goals. Accordingly, health care providers can anticipate increased pressure from payers to move to APM reimbursement models. Five Key Takeaways The threat of cost target enforcement activity by OHCA will compel many health care providers to find new ways to control costs without sacrificing quality, access, or workforce stability. Similar pressures placed on health plans, insurers, and other payers will trickle down and will very soon become a key driver in payer-provider negotiations. Providers can almost certainly expect payers to refuse to entertain negotiated rate increases that exceed statewide or payer-specific cost targets. While OHCA has no ability to enforce the APM standards or adoption goals, pressure to move to APMs will nevertheless increase, as payers look to meet health care cost targets in a manner that supports state efforts to promote APMs. While some California providers (IPAs and large medical groups) are accustomed to managing risk, others (e.g., hospitals) are not. The transition to APMs is going to require provider contract managers and their staff to utilize (or recruit for) a whole new set of skill and support, including actuarial support, legal contract drafting, etc. Though scale may play a role in managing financial risk, health care providers looking to form or grow networks through mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions will need to be mindful of OHCA's Material Change Transaction and Pre-Transaction Review processes, which may create additional barriers to growth.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways Generative AI, which can create and analyze images, text, audio, videos and more, is increasingly making its way into healthcare, pushed by both Big Tech firms and startups alike. Google Cloud, Google's cloud services and products division, is collaborating with Highmark Health, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit healthcare company, on generative AI tools designed to personalize the patient intake experience. Amazon's AWS division says it's working with unnamed customers on a way to use generative AI to analyze medical databases for ""social determinants of health."" And Microsoft Azure is helping to build a generative AI system for Providence, the not-for-profit healthcare network, to automatically triage messages to care providers sent from patients. Prominent generative AI startups in healthcare include Ambience Healthcare, which is developing a generative AI app for clinicians; Nabla, an ambient AI assistant for practitioners; and Abridge, which creates analytics tools for medical documentation. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The broad enthusiasm for generative AI is reflected in the investments in generative AI efforts targeting healthcare. Collectively, generative AI in healthcare startups have raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to date, and the vast majority of health investors say that generative AI has significantly influenced their investment strategies. But both professionals and patients are mixed as to whether healthcare-focused generative AI is ready for prime time. Generative AI might not be what people want In a recent Deloitte survey , only about half (53%) of U.S. consumers said that they thought generative AI could improve healthcare — for example, by making it more accessible or shortening appointment wait times. Fewer than half said they expected generative AI to make medical care more affordable. Andrew Borkowski, chief AI officer at the VA Sunshine Healthcare Network, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' largest health system, doesn't think that the cynicism is unwarranted. Borkowski warned that generative AI's deployment could be premature due to its ""significant"" limitations — and the concerns around its efficacy. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement ""One of the key issues with generative AI is its inability to handle complex medical queries or emergencies,"" he told TechCrunch. ""Its finite knowledge base — that is, the absence of up-to-date clinical information — and lack of human expertise make it unsuitable for providing comprehensive medical advice or treatment recommendations."" Several studies suggest there's credence to those points. In a paper in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, OpenAI's generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, which some healthcare organizations have piloted for limited use cases, was found to make errors diagnosing pediatric diseases 83% of the time. And in testing OpenAI's GPT-4 as a diagnostic assistant, physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston observed that the model ranked the wrong diagnosis as its top answer nearly two times out of three. Today's generative AI also struggles with medical administrative tasks that are part and parcel of clinicians' daily workflows. On the MedAlign benchmark to evaluate how well generative AI can perform things like summarizing patient health records and searching across notes, GPT-4 failed in 35% of cases . Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement OpenAI and many other generative AI vendors warn against relying on their models for medical advice . But Borkowski and others say they could do more. ""Relying solely on generative AI for healthcare could lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments or even life-threatening situations,"" Borkowski said. Jan Egger, who leads AI-guided therapies at the University of Duisburg-Essen's Institute for AI in Medicine, which studies the applications of emerging technology for patient care, shares Borkowski's concerns. He believes that the only safe way to use generative AI in healthcare currently is under the close, watchful eye of a physician. ""The results can be completely wrong, and it's getting harder and harder to maintain awareness of this,"" Egger said. ""Sure, generative AI can be used, for example, for pre-writing discharge letters. But physicians have a responsibility to check it and make the final call."" Generative AI can perpetuate stereotypes One particularly harmful way generative AI in healthcare can get things wrong is by perpetuating stereotypes. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In a 2023 study out of Stanford Medicine, a team of researchers tested ChatGPT and other generative AI–powered chatbots on questions about kidney function, lung capacity and skin thickness. Not only were ChatGPT's answers frequently wrong, the co-authors found, but also answers included several reinforced long-held untrue beliefs that there are biological differences between Black and white people — untruths that are known to have led medical providers to misdiagnose health problems. The irony is, the patients most likely to be discriminated against by generative AI for healthcare are also those most likely to use it. People who lack healthcare coverage — people of color, by and large , according to a KFF study — are more willing to try generative AI for things like finding a doctor or mental health support, the Deloitte survey showed. If the AI's recommendations are marred by bias, it could exacerbate inequalities in treatment. However, some experts argue that generative AI is improving in this regard. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In a Microsoft study published in late 2023, researchers said they achieved 90.2% accuracy on four challenging medical benchmarks using GPT-4. Vanilla GPT-4 couldn't reach this score. But, the researchers say, through prompt engineering — designing prompts for GPT-4 to produce certain outputs — they were able to boost the model's score by up to 16.2 percentage points. (Microsoft, it's worth noting, is a major investor in OpenAI.) Beyond chatbots But asking a chatbot a question isn't the only thing generative AI is good for. Some researchers say that medical imaging could benefit greatly from the power of generative AI. In July, a group of scientists unveiled a system called c omplementarity-driven deferral to clinical workflow (CoDoC), in a study published in Nature. The system is designed to figure out when medical imaging specialists should rely on AI for diagnoses versus traditional techniques. CoDoC did better than specialists while reducing clinical workflows by 66%, according to the co-authors. In November, a Chinese research team demoed Panda , an AI model used to detect potential pancreatic lesions in X-rays. A study showed Panda to be highly accurate in classifying these lesions, which are often detected too late for surgical intervention. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Indeed, Arun Thirunavukarasu, a clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, said there's ""nothing unique"" about generative AI precluding its deployment in healthcare settings. ""More mundane applications of generative AI technology are feasible in the short- and mid-term, and include text correction, automatic documentation of notes and letters and improved search features to optimize electronic patient records,"" he said. ""There's no reason why generative AI technology — if effective — couldn't be deployed in these sorts of roles immediately."" ""Rigorous science"" But while generative AI shows promise in specific, narrow areas of medicine, experts like Borkowski point to the technical and compliance roadblocks that must be overcome before generative AI can be useful — and trusted — as an all-around assistive healthcare tool. ""Significant privacy and security concerns surround using generative AI in healthcare,"" Borkowski said. ""The sensitive nature of medical data and the potential for misuse or unauthorized access pose severe risks to patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Furthermore, the regulatory and legal landscape surrounding the use of generative AI in healthcare is still evolving, with questions regarding liability, data protection and the practice of medicine by non-human entities still needing to be solved."" Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Even Thirunavukarasu, bullish as he is about generative AI in healthcare, says that there needs to be ""rigorous science"" behind tools that are patient-facing. ""Particularly without direct clinician oversight, there should be pragmatic randomized control trials demonstrating clinical benefit to justify deployment of patient-facing generative AI,"" he said. ""Proper governance going forward is essential to capture any unanticipated harms following deployment at scale."" Recently, the World Health Organization released guidelines that advocate for this type of science and human oversight of generative AI in healthcare as well as the introduction of auditing, transparency and impact assessments on this AI by independent third parties. The goal, the WHO spells out in its guidelines, would be to encourage participation from a diverse cohort of people in the development of generative AI for healthcare and an opportunity to voice concerns and provide input throughout the process. ""Until the concerns are adequately addressed and appropriate safeguards are put in place,"" Borkowski said, ""the widespread implementation of medical generative AI may be … potentially harmful to patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.""

New Delhi, April 14 (IANS) Rural healthcare in India has witnessed remarkable progress in the last decade, with people living in remote areas getting better access to quality health services. The healthcare coverage, which can be credited to the expansion of telemedicine and adoption of digital health solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), together with the government's National Digital Health Mission has led to reductions in maternal and child mortality rates, polio eradication, and most recently eliminated visceral leishmaniasis or Kala-azar. Yet, gaps remain with a significant lack of skilled healthcare professionals, and technological advancement comparatively slow in the hinterlands. ""Over the last decade, India has made substantial progress in healthcare through technology and innovation. Telemedicine and digital health solutions have expanded access to remote areas. Innovations in medical devices and diagnostics have enhanced affordability and accuracy,"" Himanshu Sikka, project director, SAMRIDH, told IANS. Himanshu noted that the integration of AI and ML, and the National Digital Health Mission ""signify a transformative shift towards more accessible, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare."" ""Despite notable strides, persistent challenges like workforce shortages and technological gaps linger. Sustained investment in training, technology, and community collaboration is imperative for achieving universal health coverage and bridging the urban-rural healthcare gap by 2030,"" Himanshu said. One of the areas that SAMRIDH, a blended finance (BF) facility supported by USAID and implemented by IPE Global, works is for sickle cell screening. In remote areas of Odisha's Phulbani, Kandhamal, it used drones to conduct over 400 sickle cell tests. The drones help in collecting samples, testing, and providing diagnoses, among others. Boosting healthcare in rural areas is not only critical for the health results of the nation but also for the economy. It plays a pivotal role in fostering rural economic development. Priyadarshi Mohapatra, Founder, CureBay, told IANS that in the last 10 years, rural areas in the country have seen ""advancements in medical technology, robust health education programmes, and improved healthcare facilities."" These have collectively bolstered the quality of care across the nation, as well as led to reductions in maternal and child mortality rates. ""Promoting preventive practices, and accessible healthcare in rural areas significantly reduces the burden of diseases, aligning with India's sustainable development goals,"" she noted. The healthcare startup ensures accessibility to quality healthcare in remote areas via its eClinics which are powered by an intelligent tech platform offering online consultations and a comprehensive range of services.

The Local Spain - news@thelocal.es Published: 12 Apr, 2024 CET. Updated: Fri 12 Apr 2024 11:55 CET Share Add a comment Can you get free public healthcare in Spain if you become a permanent resident? (Photo by PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU / AFP) Permanent or long-term residency gives non-EU nationals in Spain extended rights, but does it also give foreigners access to public healthcare even if they’re not contributing to the country’s social security pot? All foreigners in Spain (those with residency papers and those who are undocumented) technically have the right to public healthcare assistance, according to Spanish law. However, when it comes to non-EU nationals, this universal ‘right to healthcare’ may only apply in practice to medical emergencies, while access to all other public healthcare services will depend on your residency status. Advertisement For example, a third-country national from the UK or the US that moves to Spain on a temporary residency visa will not be able to register with a public doctor for the first five years initially unless they are: Employed or self-employed and therefore paying social security contributions. Able to register a social security exchange form that grants them right to public healthcare in Spain (such as the S1 form for Brits in Spain). Paying into the convenio especial social security scheme that gives access to public healthcare after one year living in Spain. READ MORE: The pros and cons of Spain’s 'convenio especial' healthcare scheme If you don’t meet this criteria, you will have to get private health insurance cover for your first five years of residency in Spain, which will be a requirement even when applying for your temporary visa (non-lucrative visa, digital nomad visa etc). READ ALSO: The best private healthcare for foreigners in Spain Free public healthcare with permanent residency? After five years living continuously in Spain, you will be able to apply for permanent residency which will theoretically give you the right to public healthcare without the need to pay for it or private healthcare anymore. That is what the healthcare in Spain section on gov.uk states, as does the Spanish branch of International Organization for Migration (IOM), who say that applying for permanent residency will give you access to state healthcare - la sanidad pública - on the same basis as a Spanish citizen. However, on online forums Citizens Advice Bureau Spain and Brexpats in Spain, commentators have said that getting public healthcare on permanent residency without paying social security appears to be at the discretion of the regional healthcare systems. Whilst Murcia may not allow it, Valencia and Andalusia will - another example of how the interpretation of the rules in Spain can vary depending on who you ask and where you are; but it’s still worth a try. Advertisement According to IOM, once you’re a permanent resident, you need to register at your local INSS social security office. You may need to show a ‘legislation letter’ (‘documento de no exportación’ in Spanish) stating that you are not covered by your home country for healthcare. You can request this from your country’s healthcare services. The INSS will give you a document which you need to take to your local health centre. Remember that if your country pays for your healthcare, you cannot register for healthcare as a permanent resident.

One such complication that affects pregnant women, particularly in developing countries like Nepal, is pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organs, most often the liver and kidneys, that develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. This condition can have serious implications for both the mother and the baby if not managed promptly and effectively. In Nepal, where access to quality healthcare is limited in many rural areas and awareness about maternal health issues is often lacking, pre-eclampsia poses a significant threat to maternal well-being. Factors such as poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, and limited access to healthcare facilities exacerbate the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women across the country. One of the challenges in addressing pre-eclampsia in Nepal is the lack of awareness and understanding among both healthcare providers and pregnant women themselves. Many women may not recognize the symptoms of preeclampsia, which can include high blood pressure, swelling of the hands and face, headaches, vision changes, and abdominal pain. Without proper education and awareness campaigns, women may attribute these symptoms to the normal discomforts of pregnancy, delaying the diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia. Related story Maternal mortality rate being studied for the first time in Nep... Furthermore, the scarcity of trained healthcare professionals, especially in rural areas, makes it difficult to provide timely and appropriate care to pregnant women who develop pre-eclampsia. Limited resources, including medical supplies and equipment, further hinder the management of this condition in resource-constrained settings. Addressing pre-eclampsia in Nepal requires a multifaceted approach that focuses on prevention, early detection, and access to quality healthcare services. Improving antenatal care services and ensuring that pregnant women receive regular check-ups throughout their pregnancy can help in early identification of pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy-related complications. This involves training healthcare providers to recognize the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and providing them with the necessary tools and resources to manage the condition effectively. Community education and awareness programs are also crucial in empowering pregnant women to recognize the warning signs of pre-eclampsia and seek timely medical attention. It is advisable for different NGOs and INGOs engaged in healthcare initiatives to educate both the community and grassroots healthcare workers about pre-eclampsia. By educating women about the importance of prenatal care and encouraging them to attend antenatal check-ups regularly, we can help reduce the incidence and severity of pre-eclampsia in Nepal. In addition to preventive measures, improving access to healthcare facilities equipped to manage pre-eclampsia is essential. This may involve investing in infrastructure, medical supplies, and personnel training to ensure that pregnant women receive the care they need, regardless of their location. Mobile health clinics and telemedicine services can also help bridge the gap in access to healthcare in remote areas, allowing pregnant women to consult with healthcare providers and receive guidance on managing pre-eclampsia. Collaboration between government agencies, non-profit organizations, and healthcare providers is essential in addressing pre-eclampsia in Nepal. By pooling resources and expertise, stakeholders can develop and implement comprehensive strategies to prevent and manage pre-eclampsia effectively. This includes raising awareness about pre-eclampsia among policymakers and advocating policies that prioritize maternal health and access to quality healthcare services for pregnant women. In conclusion, pre-eclampsia is a significant concern for maternal health in Nepal, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Addressing this issue requires a concerted effort from healthcare providers, policymakers, and community members to improve access to prenatal care, raise awareness about pre-eclampsia, and ensure that pregnant women receive timely and appropriate medical attention. By prioritizing maternal health and investing in preventive measures and healthcare infrastructure, we can reduce the burden of pre-eclampsia and improve outcomes for mothers and their babies in Nepal."

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals develops, manufactures, markets, and sells generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. Needham says the company still believes Baqsimi is the best glucagon product based on its expertise, which is difficult to genericize, and its IP that goes to 2036. Needham notes that the market opportunity for Baqsimi is promising because only a small fraction of insulin users currently receive a prescription for glucagon to manage emergency hypoglycemia. There’s a widespread recommendation among doctors and guidelines that all insulin users should have access to a glucagon product, akin to an Epipen, for diabetic emergencies. Baqsimi is projected to reach peak sales of $250-270 million, a significant increase from $153 million in 2023. These sales estimates might be conservative, especially if the market expands, as Baqsimi currently faces competition primarily from Gvoke, another injectable glucagon product. In 2024, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals anticipates Baqsimi’s inaugural full-year performance to be fueled by a modest increase in product units sold, coupled with a slight decrease in prices due to elevated wholesaler fees compared to those paid by Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY ). In anticipation of competitors re-entering the market by the second half of 2024 and 2025, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals foresees new opportunities emerging despite potential shortages. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals is keen on exploring business development prospects, particularly in the endocrinology sector, to expand its product portfolio by leveraging Baqsimi’s commercial infrastructure. With $300 million in cash reserves and strong cash flow, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals is inclined towards debt financing for potential asset acquisitions. Needham keeps the Hold rating for Amphastar Pharmaceuticals. Price Action: AMPH shares are down 2.33% at $39.95 on the last check Wednesday.

The list of 700 U.S. companies was announced on March 27 after an analysis by Newsweek and Statista Inc., the world-leading statistics portal and industry ranking provider. Adventist HealthCare was among only 10 hospitals and healthcare systems in the U.S. to receive this prestigious recognition. Adventist HealthCare ranked 18th among 37 public and private organizations in the Healthcare and Life Sciences category, which included a broad range of care providers, device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and online health and wellness firms. Across all industries, Adventist HealthCare was one of 14 Maryland-based companies honored. ""Adventist HealthCare is honored to be a part of Newsweek's exclusive list and congratulates all of the other organizations that were named,"" said Terry Forde , President and CEO of Adventist HealthCare. ""Our place among the Most Trustworthy Companies in America 2024 speaks directly to our core values and reflects the integrity and dedication of our more than 10,000 team members and affiliated physicians.

The Most Trustworthy Companies in America 2024 were selected using a holistic approach that examined three main public pillars of trust: customer trust, investor trust, and employee trust. An independent survey asked about 25,000 U.S. residents to rate eligible companies they knew on all three touch points. A total of 97,000 evaluations of companies were submitted, Newsweek and Statista said.

We are grateful to our patients and community members who recognized this commitment and who rated us among the most trusted in America.""

The demand for healthcare professionals is expected to double globally by 2030 due to the increasing ageing population, demographic shifts and non-communicable diseases, an industry official said on Wednesday. Agency News PTI | Apr 10, 2024 05:58 PM IST A+ A- A- A+ Trending Stories BMC Elections Delhi Blast Air Pollution Umar Mohammad Aadhaar App Dharmendra Mumbai, Apr 10 (PTI) The demand for healthcare professionals is expected to double globally by 2030 due to the increasing ageing population, demographic shifts and non-communicable diseases, an industry official said on Wednesday. Global shortage and an ageing population have spurred the demand for Indian healthcare professionals who are highly respected in the international markets for their skills, NLB Services CEO Sachin Alug told PTI. Also Read | Char Dham Yatra 2024 Registration: Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri Temples To Open Doors for Devotees Soon, Know Dates and How To Register on registrationandtouristcare.uk.gov. ""We're seeing a surge in demand for healthcare professionals within the country as well as from countries like Malaysia, Italy, Portugal, Poland, and Germany. We expect demand for Indian healthcare professionals to double nationally and globally by 2030,"" he added. There has been a steady increase in demand for healthcare professionals in India as well as globally since Covid-19 owing to growing population, demographic shifts, and the rise of non-communicable diseases, Alug said. Also Read | BJP Foundation Day 2024 Date: Know the History and Significance of BJP Sthapna Diwas That Celebrates the Formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Currently, there are over three million registered nurses in India which means there are only 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people in the country, he noted. ""Whereas according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) it should be three nurses per 1,000 people. Similarly, the doctor-to-patient ratio in India (approximately 1:1,500) falls short of WHO (1:1,000) recommendations, especially in rural areas, posing significant challenges in delivering healthcare services efficiently nationwide,"" he noted. Similarly, with the largest number of medical colleges worldwide, India stands out as one of the primary exporters of healthcare workers to developed nations such as Europe, the Gulf region, the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel, said Alug. ""Japan and New Zealand have also emerged as new destinations for Indian nurses and doctors. We are witnessing 15 per cent growth in demand for Indian nurses across markets like Norway, Germany, Austria, among others,"" he added. Alug said there is a growing focus on cross-skilling initiatives, which ensures Indian nurses to be especially equipped with the necessary skills and qualifications to meet the specific healthcare requirements of different countries. He said adoption of technologies is driving growth across various sectors globally, including healthcare, which has emerged with a growing demand for home healthcare, including specialised services like physiotherapy, pain management, and chronic disease care. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of home healthcare services as a means to minimise exposure and alleviate the strain on healthcare facilities, Alug further noted. ""This experience has led to wider acceptance and integration of remote care solutions. Similarly, while telemedicine in India is not a new concept, its importance and necessity became more evident during the pandemic. ""The major drivers of demand for telemedicine in India was Covid-19, increased mobile and internet penetration, supportive government policies, advanced technologies, and convenience. This space alone is expected to drive the demand for Indian healthcare professionals by 18-20 per cent in the next 2-3 years,"" he said. When asked about availability of sufficient skills within the healthcare profession given the high demand both globally and nationally, he said apart from academia, training and upskilling opportunities are made available by healthcare giants. ""However, in terms of meeting the demand for skilling initiatives, we still have a long way to go,"" Alug added. (The above story is verified and authored by Press Trust of India (PTI) staff.

Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, turns to listen to a proposed amendment to the state budget on Monday, April 3, 2023, at the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau, Alaska. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon) The Alaska House of Representatives on Friday voted down a proposal by Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, to create a universal health care system open to all residents without regard to cost. Speaking on the House floor, Gray said, “The time has come for drastic action. We need to blow up the Alaska health care system.” Gray’s proposal, introduced as an amendment to an unrelated health care bill and billed as a single-payer system , was ruled out of order by Speaker of the House Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, and Tilton’s ruling was upheld by a 23-14 vote . The decision denied legislators a chance to speak on the merits or negatives of the proposal. It’s extraordinarily unusual for the House to make major policy changes via floor amendment, but it has happened before. Earlier this year, the House voted to raise the state’s age of sexual consent via a handwritten floor amendment . That decision has not been finalized. Speaking after Friday’s vote, Gray said he viewed the health care amendment as the first step toward legislative action in 2025 and that he offered it with an eye toward this fall’s legislative elections. “I’m a freshman legislator. There are many things that I want to do that I just haven’t found the right approach to. I have told lots of folks that if I get reelected, I want to work on health care,” he said after the vote. ADVERTISEMENT Gray’s amendment would have required the Alaska Department of Health to “design and implement” a “single-payer health care program” that would offer full health care, including but not limited to vision, dental, mental health treatment, prescription drugs and hospice care. Sen. David Wilson, R-Wasilla, is chair of the Senate Health and Social Services Committee and the sponsor of the bill targeted by Gray’s amendment. Wilson noted several technical flaws with the wording of Gray’s amendment, including what he called a fundamental misunderstanding of how the state currently offers Medicaid. Before implementing universal care, Alaska would have to first switch from a fee-for-service model of health care to one of managed care , Wilson said. ADVERTISEMENT The United States is the only developed country in the world without a universal health care system, and no American state has implemented one despite dozens of proposals . Vermont passed a single-payer law in 2011, but that state’s governor canceled the proposal over cost concerns in 2014. California legislators have repeatedly considered the concept, but the latest idea has also lost support amid a state budget deficit . According to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and published by Kaiser Family Foundation , Alaskans spent an average of $13,462 per person for health care in 2020. Gray said that based on a 2022 estimate of California’s single-payer health care costs, a single-payer system in Alaska would cost about $10,000 per person.

The study also suggests that family practice physicians who practice alone, without a team-based model, were less likely to have vaccinated patients. The study was based on 9,060 family physicians in Ontario who treat more than 10 million patients. Researchers looked at characteristics of the 10% of physicians who had the most unvaccinated patients as of November 1, 2021, when everyone in Canada was eligible for at least two doses of vaccine. Older docs more likely to have unvaccinated patients Physicians with the largest proportion of unvaccinated patients were more likely to be male (64.6% vs 48.1%), to have trained outside of Canada (46.9% vs 29.3%), and to be older (mean age, 56 vs 49 years). More unvaccinated patients were recent immigrants to Canada, had higher rates of material deprivation, and had lower incomes, the authors said. Though family practice physicians were not the first line of COVID-19 vaccinators in Canada, their influence and recommendations shape patient care. We know that relationships with trusted family physicians can positively influence patients' decisions. ""We know that relationships with trusted family physicians can positively influence patients' decisions,"" said senior author Noah Ivers, MD, in a CMAJ press release .

Vietnam reports its first human infection from H9 avian flu virus News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Vietnam's health ministry over the weekend reported a human H9 avian flu case, which involves a 37-year-old man from Tien Giang province in the southern part of the country, according to official statements translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary , an infectious disease news blog. mswine / Flickr cc The man's symptoms began on March 10, and 6 days later he sought care at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, where he was diagnosed as having severe viral pneumonia. Initial tests were positive for influenza A, but with gene segments similar to the H9 avian flu subtype. His sample was sent to the city's Pasteur Institute for follow-up testing and virus subtyping. An investigation revealed that the man lived adjacent to a poultry market, but there were no reports of sick or dead birds near the family's home. No similar symptoms have been found during monitoring of the man's contacts, and no respiratory illness outbreaks have been reported in his community. The ministry noted that 98 H9N2 cases have been reported in the Western Pacific region since 2015. Two of the infections were fatal, and both involved people who had underlying illnesses. It added that H9N2 has been found in Vietnamese poultry before. It is considered a low-pathogenic virus and usually causes only mild symptoms in birds. Report details health, economic impact of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene in hospitals News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Healthcare-Associated Infections WHO / FID Thompson New research conducted in seven sub-Saharan African counties highlights the health and financial impact of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities. In a report published late last week, non-governmental organization WaterAid estimated that inadequate WASH in healthcare facilities in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia contributed to 2.6 billion healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and 277,160 excess deaths in 2022. At least 50% of the HCAIs are believed to have been caused by antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. The economic costs of these infections is estimated to range from 2.5% to 10.9% of the healthcare budgets in the seven countries, while lost wages and productivity due to infections accounted for 0.4% to 2.9% of the countries' gross domestic product. Poor WASH paves way for healthcare-related infections The report notes that globally, nearly 4 million people—predominantly those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)—lack basic hygiene services at their healthcare facility, and one in five lack basic water services. Inadequate WASH at healthcare facilities in LMICs contributes to a rate of HCAIs that is more than twice that of high-income countries (15.5% vs 7.6%). ""The major transmission pathway for HCAIs is lack of cleanliness and hygiene measures provided during the delivery of healthcare,"" the report states. ""Beyond the health impacts, poor WASH in HCF [healthcare facilities] has additional negative consequences as it relates to other aspects of quality care, including patient satisfaction, dignified and respectful care, future healthcare seeking behaviours and healthcare worker morale, motivation and retention, all of which ultimately impact health outcomes."" WaterAid says the problem is likely to get worse as AMR rates rise, and argues that the less than US$1 per capita needed to provide basic wash services at healthcare facilities in these countries would be covered by savings from a reduction in the medical costs associated with HAIs. The group calls on national governments to develop a dedicated budget line for WASH in healthcare facilities and urges donors, G7 countries, and multilateral financing institutions to prioritize WASH when working with national governments in LMICs. Study suggests antibiotics before dental surgery cut risk of heart infection in high-risk patients News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Marco Herndorff / iStock A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the use of antibiotics prior to invasive dental procedures was associated with a reduced risk of infective endocarditis (IE) in high-risk patients, but not in those considered moderate- or low-risk, US and European researchers reported late last week in JAMA Cardiology. The findings support current antibiotic prophylaxis (infection prevention) guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which recommend that patients with cardiac conditions that are associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE—an infection of the heart valve—should receive antibiotics before invasive dental procedures. Previous guidelines from the organizations had recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for a wider range of patients. 59% less risk of infection in high-risk patients A total of 30 studies covering 1,152,345 IE cases were included in the review; 8 of the studies were case-control/crossover, cohort, or self-controlled case series studies, and 22 were time-trend studies. Meta-analysis of the group of 8 studies found that high-risk patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis were 59% less likely to develop IE (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57) than those who didn't receive antibiotic prophylaxis. No significant associations were found for individuals at moderate or low/unknown risk. Results from the time-trend studies were inconsistent, with 9 studies finding no significant changes in IE incidence since the AHA and ESC antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines for invasive dental procedures were narrowed in 2017, 7 finding a significant increase in IE incidence for the overall population, and 3 finding a significant decrease. The authors of the study say that while the findings add valuable evidence for defining the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing IE following invasive dental procedures, studies with a more rigorous scientific approach, such as randomized clinical trials, are needed. Quick takes: US measles cases top 100, WHO extends polio emergency News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles Polio In its latest weekly update the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 16 more measles cases, raising the national total to 113. The number of affected jurisdictions remained at 18. Of the 113 cases, 83 (73%) are related to outbreaks, seven of which have been reported so far. Sixty-five people were hospitalized for measles complications, with the highest percentages in young children and adults. Of the outbreak total, 83% of people were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. For comparison, the CDC reported 58 cases for all of last year, of which 28 (48%) were part of four outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) polio emergency committee met for the 38th time on March 20 to assess the latest developments and recommended that the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which was declared in May 2014. In a statement today, the WHO said some of the factors involved in extending the health emergency include wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) infections in critical areas and historic reservoirs in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with lineages seen in Afghanistan in 2022 now being detected in Pakistan in 2023 and 2024. Also, the agency said the risk of further spread of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) remains high, with ongoing cross-border detections in Africa and a new emergence in South Sudan, despite never having used the oral poliovirus type 2 vaccine. The group also noted that vaccination gaps are still a threat, given weak routine immunization and lack of access in northern Yemen and Somalia, which have large unvaccinated populations.

Vietnam reports its first human infection from H9 avian flu virus News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Vietnam's health ministry over the weekend reported a human H9 avian flu case, which involves a 37-year-old man from Tien Giang province in the southern part of the country, according to official statements translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary , an infectious disease news blog. mswine / Flickr cc The man's symptoms began on March 10, and 6 days later he sought care at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, where he was diagnosed as having severe viral pneumonia. Initial tests were positive for influenza A, but with gene segments similar to the H9 avian flu subtype. His sample was sent to the city's Pasteur Institute for follow-up testing and virus subtyping. An investigation revealed that the man lived adjacent to a poultry market, but there were no reports of sick or dead birds near the family's home. No similar symptoms have been found during monitoring of the man's contacts, and no respiratory illness outbreaks have been reported in his community. The ministry noted that 98 H9N2 cases have been reported in the Western Pacific region since 2015. Two of the infections were fatal, and both involved people who had underlying illnesses. It added that H9N2 has been found in Vietnamese poultry before. It is considered a low-pathogenic virus and usually causes only mild symptoms in birds. Report details health, economic impact of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene in hospitals News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Healthcare-Associated Infections WHO / FID Thompson New research conducted in seven sub-Saharan African counties highlights the health and financial impact of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities. In a report published late last week, non-governmental organization WaterAid estimated that inadequate WASH in healthcare facilities in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia contributed to 2.6 billion healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and 277,160 excess deaths in 2022. At least 50% of the HCAIs are believed to have been caused by antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. The economic costs of these infections is estimated to range from 2.5% to 10.9% of the healthcare budgets in the seven countries, while lost wages and productivity due to infections accounted for 0.4% to 2.9% of the countries' gross domestic product. Poor WASH paves way for healthcare-related infections The report notes that globally, nearly 4 million people—predominantly those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)—lack basic hygiene services at their healthcare facility, and one in five lack basic water services. Inadequate WASH at healthcare facilities in LMICs contributes to a rate of HCAIs that is more than twice that of high-income countries (15.5% vs 7.6%). ""The major transmission pathway for HCAIs is lack of cleanliness and hygiene measures provided during the delivery of healthcare,"" the report states. ""Beyond the health impacts, poor WASH in HCF [healthcare facilities] has additional negative consequences as it relates to other aspects of quality care, including patient satisfaction, dignified and respectful care, future healthcare seeking behaviours and healthcare worker morale, motivation and retention, all of which ultimately impact health outcomes."" WaterAid says the problem is likely to get worse as AMR rates rise, and argues that the less than US$1 per capita needed to provide basic wash services at healthcare facilities in these countries would be covered by savings from a reduction in the medical costs associated with HAIs. The group calls on national governments to develop a dedicated budget line for WASH in healthcare facilities and urges donors, G7 countries, and multilateral financing institutions to prioritize WASH when working with national governments in LMICs. Those not vaccinated against COVID-19 more likely to be poorer, immigrants, study shows News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Phil Roeder / Flickr cc A study today in CMAJ describes the characteristics of family practice physicians who see the largest share of patients unvaccinated against COVID-19, and reveals that the largest percentage practice in marginalized, lower-income neighborhoods. The study also suggests that family practice physicians who practice alone, without a team-based model, were less likely to have vaccinated patients. The study was based on 9,060 family physicians in Ontario who treat more than 10 million patients. Researchers looked at characteristics of the 10% of physicians who had the most unvaccinated patients as of November 1, 2021, when everyone in Canada was eligible for at least two doses of vaccine. Older docs more likely to have unvaccinated patients Physicians with the largest proportion of unvaccinated patients were more likely to be male (64.6% vs 48.1%), to have trained outside of Canada (46.9% vs 29.3%), and to be older (mean age, 56 vs 49 years). More unvaccinated patients were recent immigrants to Canada, had higher rates of material deprivation, and had lower incomes, the authors said. Though family practice physicians were not the first line of COVID-19 vaccinators in Canada, their influence and recommendations shape patient care. We know that relationships with trusted family physicians can positively influence patients' decisions. ""We know that relationships with trusted family physicians can positively influence patients' decisions,"" said senior author Noah Ivers, MD, in a CMAJ press release . ""Our study highlights the need to create equitable systems and processes that create opportunities for primary care teams to play a crucial role in influencing both general and SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine-related decision-making."" Study suggests antibiotics before dental surgery cut risk of heart infection in high-risk patients News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Marco Herndorff / iStock A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the use of antibiotics prior to invasive dental procedures was associated with a reduced risk of infective endocarditis (IE) in high-risk patients, but not in those considered moderate- or low-risk, US and European researchers reported late last week in JAMA Cardiology. The findings support current antibiotic prophylaxis (infection prevention) guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which recommend that patients with cardiac conditions that are associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE—an infection of the heart valve—should receive antibiotics before invasive dental procedures. Previous guidelines from the organizations had recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for a wider range of patients. 59% less risk of infection in high-risk patients A total of 30 studies covering 1,152,345 IE cases were included in the review; 8 of the studies were case-control/crossover, cohort, or self-controlled case series studies, and 22 were time-trend studies. Meta-analysis of the group of 8 studies found that high-risk patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis were 59% less likely to develop IE (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57) than those who didn't receive antibiotic prophylaxis. No significant associations were found for individuals at moderate or low/unknown risk. Results from the time-trend studies were inconsistent, with 9 studies finding no significant changes in IE incidence since the AHA and ESC antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines for invasive dental procedures were narrowed in 2017, 7 finding a significant increase in IE incidence for the overall population, and 3 finding a significant decrease. The authors of the study say that while the findings add valuable evidence for defining the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing IE following invasive dental procedures, studies with a more rigorous scientific approach, such as randomized clinical trials, are needed.

Quick takes: US measles cases top 100, WHO extends polio emergency News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles Polio In its latest weekly update the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 16 more measles cases, raising the national total to 113. The number of affected jurisdictions remained at 18. Of the 113 cases, 83 (73%) are related to outbreaks, seven of which have been reported so far. Sixty-five people were hospitalized for measles complications, with the highest percentages in young children and adults. Of the outbreak total, 83% of people were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. For comparison, the CDC reported 58 cases for all of last year, of which 28 (48%) were part of four outbreaks. The World Health Organization (WHO) polio emergency committee met for the 38th time on March 20 to assess the latest developments and recommended that the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which was declared in May 2014. In a statement today, the WHO said some of the factors involved in extending the health emergency include wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) infections in critical areas and historic reservoirs in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with lineages seen in Afghanistan in 2022 now being detected in Pakistan in 2023 and 2024. Also, the agency said the risk of further spread of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) remains high, with ongoing cross-border detections in Africa and a new emergence in South Sudan, despite never having used the oral poliovirus type 2 vaccine.

Since 2010, the nation has witnessed significant enhancements in its health care system. This has resulted in improved services and quality of life. The constitution, established in 2010 , guarantees every individual the right to access the highest attainable standards of health care. Presently, Kenya’s health care system holds the second position in Africa , with South Africa leading in first place. Despite this achievement, Kenya’s health care system is still facing obstacles to meeting its goal of having Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines UHC as being able to provide people with access to quality and essential health services (treatment, prevention, rehabilitation etc.) without subjecting the user to financial hardship. Currently, investments play a crucial role in helping accomplish this goal. U.S. Trade and Development Agency The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) study grant to the Kenya Hospital Association (KHA) will expand and improve Kenya’s health care infrastructure. The project will increase access to more than 96,000 patients annually. It will support the building of five medical centers with advanced equipment. Furthermore, it will expand cancer treatment services at the Nairobi Hospital and digitize its health care services and operations. World Bank Vaccine Facility The World Bank announced in February 2024 that it will be financing Kenya’s first vaccine production facility. The facility is expected to be built and operational in 2029 and will be able to meet Kenya’s growing vaccine demand. The population of Kenya is increasing steadily by approximately 2% a year. Currently, the vaccine demand is 16 million people. However, it is expected to reach upwards of 25 million people in the coming years. This investment will help decrease the mortality rate from preventable diseases through immunizations. Finally, with this new facility, Kenya will be able to catch up with South Africa in producing vaccines and successfully avoid vaccine shortages by producing locally. $215 million Resilient Health Systems Project Kenyan citizens, refugees, the counties of Garissa and Turkana (host communities) and women and children who are considered low-income will be able to receive an improved quality of health care. This project will play a crucial role in furthering UHC and care. It will increase the capacity of people that they can care for, addressing geographical challenges, financing and worker shortages. The financial management of Kenya’s Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA), which provides health products and technology, will be improved by enhancing accountability and transparency. The lack of health care delivery and services will be addressed for about 1.8 million people in host communities. Additionally, this will aid 590,000 refugees living in Garissa and Turkana. It will support the transition and operation of the Social Health Authority (SHA). In collaboration with UHC, it will provide “efficient, affordable and non-discriminatory health care services to all Kenyans.” Final Remark With investments like these, Kenya’s health care system is set to make a transformative step toward achieving its dream of UHC. Increasing access to quality health care for rural, low-income individuals, refugees, mothers and children will help improve socioeconomic inequalities in Kenya . These investments help ensure that Kenya is able to maintain a leadership role in health care. They guarantee access to health care as a fundamental right, as defined in its constitution. – Gabrielle Schwartz Photo: Flickr April 8, 2024 https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg 0 0 Hemant Gupta https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/borgen-project-logo.svg Hemant Gupta 2024-04-08 01:30:02 2024-04-07 14:17:45 How Investments Are Improving Kenya’s Health Care System"

Δ The sector is witnessing a transformation, especially in the B2B domain. Digital payments , online procurement platforms and artificial intelligence are igniting a phase shift that is reshaping the B2B healthcare landscape. While those persistent pillars of technological innovation may sound familiar, their impact and applications within B2B healthcare are meant to address a range of challenges and issues that set healthcare apart from other industries. These include longstanding bottlenecks around interoperability, regulatory compliance, legacy administrative processes, manually driven payments workflows and growing data fragmentation . Still, it isn’t necessarily time to throw the baby out with the bathwater. While healthcare represents a unique playing field for digital innovations to redefine how healthcare businesses interact, market and transact with each other, there remain some best practices that carry over from other highly regulated, security-critical and traditionally fragmented sectors. As with other B2B ecosystems, B2B transactions in healthcare are characterized by larger order values and longer contract durations, which contribute to a more stable and predictable revenue stream. Additionally, B2B relationships in healthcare are built on trust and long-term partnerships, which are crucial in an industry where the stakes are high, and the need for reliability is paramount.

As businesses navigate these changes, the focus on personalization, efficiency and partnership will be key to success in this evolving landscape. The shift toward digital B2B payments in healthcare is driven by the need for better cash flow management and the desire to minimize the administrative burden associated with traditional payment methods. “You’d be surprised how many healthcare providers in the country still don’t even have a website for accepting online … payments, and that you have to call an office to speak to someone to process a credit card transaction,” Brad Garfield , managing director and head of healthcare solutions at J.P. Morgan Commercial Banking, told PYMNTS in August. “There’s so much opportunity for improvement.” By embracing digital payments, healthcare businesses can streamline their operations, improve financial management and focus on delivering high-quality care. Digital B2B payment methods facilitate faster transactions, reduce the risk of errors, and offer enhanced security features, making them an attractive option for healthcare businesses. “By using virtual cards , we’ve been able to speed up the payment process overall between insurance companies and medical providers,” Chad Wallace , executive vice president and global head of commercial solutions at Mastercard , told PYMNTS in January, explaining that the healthcare payment cycle can frequently be slow, with extended approval and reimbursement times. This can lead to cash flow issues for healthcare providers and businesses, affecting their financial stability. See also: As B2B Operations Digitize, Marketing Does Too: Enter the B2B Influencer Procurement Modernization Becomes Paramount for Growth A growing focus on simplifying the current procure-to-pay system in place by many hospitals to help navigate the massive number of suppliers to choose from and adjust to changing needs is also transforming the landscape’s operational realities and B2B dynamics. “The whole expense side of healthcare isn’t being thought of, and the lack of price transparency and efficiency in the medical supply space ends up affecting the actual patients themselves,” Jonathan Chen , founder and CEO of Nitra , told PYMNTS in February. “Every single day, doctors are buying from the major brands like McKesson, Henry Shine, AbbVie, all these folks, and oftentimes they’re doing it manually through a salesperson who comes to their office and sends them an invoice … it gets very jumbled up, and the process is obscure, as is the pricing transparency,” Chen added, noting that the existing infrastructure creates a lot of additional costs that have been rising due to margin expansion and supply chain challenges. Building and maintaining strong relationships with healthcare clients, including hospitals, clinics and other providers, is essential for B2B vendors. Understanding the unique needs and challenges of each B2B customer segment, providing ongoing support and delivering value-added services are critical for long-term success in the healthcare market.

Opinions expressed are those of the author. | Membership (fee-based) Apr 08, 2024, 06:15am EDT Share Save KJ Dhaliwal is a serial entrepreneur currently building a healthcare AI app. He previously started & sold Dil Mil to SDG, where he was CSO. getty In an era of technological breakthroughs, healthcare stands at the brink of a monumental transformation driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI). This isn't just about incremental improvements; it's about a fundamental revolution in delivering healthcare—making it more accessible, personalized and efficient than ever before. As a tech entrepreneur with deep roots in a family of healthcare professionals and as someone who has navigated various health systems from the patient's perspective, I have a unique vantage point. My journey has instilled in me a firm belief in technology's power to revolutionize healthcare and enhance human well-being. Having observed AI's capacity to reshape numerous sectors, I am motivated to leverage my expertise in technology, science and consumer applications to pioneer AI-driven solutions. These are not merely designed to treat illness and disease. They're designed to prevent them altogether, marking a pivotal step toward a healthier future. Predictive Analytics: The Crystal Ball Of Healthcare Imagine if we could anticipate health issues before they arise, using the vast sea of health data combined with AI's analytical might. This is no longer the stuff of science fiction. AI's capacity to sift through and make sense of data heralds a shift toward predictive analytics and preventative care. By identifying risk factors and foreseeing potential health outcomes, AI is steering healthcare away from its traditional reactive stance toward an emphatically preventive model. This approach not only has the potential to save countless lives but could also ease the immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Personalized Medicine: Tailor-Made Health Solutions At the same time, AI is redefining the concept of personalized patient care. By analyzing an individual's genetic blueprint, lifestyle and personal preferences, AI crafts bespoke medical advice and treatment plans. This means treatments that are not only more effective but also bear fewer side effects, significantly enhancing patient outcomes and satisfaction. Breaking Down Barriers: Healthcare For All AI is also the key to making healthcare more democratic. By leveraging technologies like chatbots and virtual assistants, medical consultation and advice are becoming accessible to anyone with a smartphone or computer, bridging the gap between healthcare providers and remote or underserved populations. This leap toward universal access to personalized healthcare is a crucial step toward a more equitable healthcare system. Sharper Diagnostics: Seeing The Unseen Moreover, AI is set to revolutionize diagnostics through its unparalleled accuracy and speed. Machine learning algorithms can detect diseases at their nascent stages by analyzing health data in ways humans simply cannot. This early detection is vital for conditions where timing can drastically change the patient's outcome. By integrating individual health data into the diagnostic process, AI is fine-tuning the precision of diagnostics, ensuring that care is customized for each patient's unique needs. Navigating The Ethical Landscape However, this journey toward an AI-driven future in healthcare is fraught with ethical dilemmas, particularly concerning privacy and data security. To navigate these challenges, organizations should prioritize transparency, patient consent and robust data protection measures. During my time in the industry, I've learned the importance of involving patients and the public in conversations about data use, ensuring technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that respects individuals' rights and fosters trust. Ultimately, people want to be respected, and you have to earn and keep their trust to build a sustainable solution and make an impact in healthcare. Choosing Or Building The Right Solution For Your Organization Embarking on the AI journey in healthcare requires careful consideration. Organizations should start by clearly defining their needs and objectives. When evaluating AI solutions, focus on scalability, interoperability with existing systems and the solution's ability to comply with regulatory standards. If you're planning to build your own solution, prioritize a multidisciplinary approach that includes input from healthcare professionals, tech experts and patients. This is a difficult decision, but collaborative effort ensures the solution is technically sound and aligned with real-world needs and considerations. The Road Ahead: A Collaborative Vision The integration of AI in healthcare is more than just a technological upgrade; it's a comprehensive reimagining of patient care. This transformation, rich with innovation, requires a concerted effort from technologists, healthcare professionals and policymakers to overcome challenges and harness AI's full potential. As we look toward this promising horizon, AI is not merely a hopeful vision; it's also a tangible force for good, ready to redefine healthcare in ways we've only dreamed of. The future it heralds is one of greater accessibility, personalization and preventative care—marking a new era in healthcare that prioritizes the well-being of humanity above all.

The headline figure is that 58 percent of healthcare workers state they feel burnt out due to understaffing , and over half feel just as, if not more, strained than they were during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information comes from a survey conducted by Carta Healthcare . The survey probes the most practical solution to the problem and finds that the vast majority (77 percent) of nurses believe AI is the solution to the worsening personnel shortages. The survey was conducted drawing on the experiences of 500 U.S. healthcare workers and it established that the biggest threats to the healthcare industry are high care costs (74.3 percent), the nurse shortage (63.1 percent), and the lack of personnel to care for the aging population (58.6 percent). These results align with a Carta Healthcare October 2022 healthcare consumer survey, where consumer respondents agreed that high costs and lack of personnel were among the top concerns. A solution could be with automation and artificial intelligence. This is because overwhelming paperwork seems to be a leading cause of healthcare burnout. To add to this, over half of healthcare workers (58 percent) say that being short staffed is the biggest factor for burnout, followed by low pay and long hours (46.6 percent). Healthcare professionals also cite the following reasons for burnout: Quality of care has declined (27.9%) Personnel issues (27.5%) Quality of necessary supplies and equipment (26.3%) Lack of leadership (23.9%) Admin/paperwork (22.3%) Politics/ bureaucracy and red tape (20.9%) The market realities of the U.S. healthcare system mean that patients feel that wait times during healthcare visits have become longer (46 percent). In response to those consumer survey results; healthcare workers admit that the catalyst is a lack of staff. Thirty-five percent (35.1 percent) of respondents see staffing shortages as a significant issue. Concerningly for healthcare sustainability, 37.1 percent of healthcare workers say they would choose another career path. When healthcare professionals were asked if they were to leave their current position, what likely would be the reason(s), responses align with the pain points that are causing burnout: Low pay and long hours (53.8%) Short-staffed facilities (45.4%) Lack of leadership (31.5%) Personnel issues (31.3%) Healthcare workers similarly identified several factors that could increase their job satisfaction, including higher pay (65.3 percent), more staffing to limit the burden (48.2 percent), the ability to have more time for direct patient care (32.1 percent), and technological advancements to help them do their jobs (29.1 percent). As a counter to these concerns, healthcare professionals, based on the survey, hope that the AI-induced efficiencies, as demonstrated by other industries, will spill over to healthcare to help reduce the impact of worker shortages. Between healthcare workers and consumers, however, positive perceptions and awareness of AI in healthcare seem to differ. For example, the majority of healthcare workers (86.1 percent) feel they have a good understanding of how AI is used in healthcare, compared to only 57 percent of patient respondents in the Carta Healthcare August 2023 healthcare AI consumer survey.

The company's technology has been used in healthcare before. For example, Nvidia launched its Clara AI platform for medical imaging in 2018. However, the company appears to have shifted its healthcare efforts into a higher gear. Nvidia has announced multiple new healthcare collaborations and services over the last few weeks. On March 18, the company introduced a new suite of 25 ""microservices"" for healthcare organizations. This platform enables customers to integrate generative AI into existing applications.

AI holds the potential to streamline a wide range of administrative tasks, including appointment scheduling, claims processing, and clinical documentation. This hasn't been a major area of focus for Nvidia so far, but it could present a big opportunity for the company. Should you buy Nvidia stock because of its healthcare efforts? Nvidia's ongoing expansion into the lucrative healthcare market could achieve tremendous success. However, I don't think these healthcare efforts by themselves justify buying the stock right now. But what about the combination of Nvidia's healthcare initiatives and everything else the company is doing? Its overall growth prospects remain highly attractive. My chief concern with Nvidia is that its stock has such lofty expectations baked in that any hint of less-than-spectacular results could cause shares to fall hard.

( NASDAQ:PCSA ) stock in the last year recovered part of their losses as the stock rose by 18% last week. However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$40k since the time of purchase. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Processa Pharmaceuticals Processa Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last Year Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Co-Founder David Young for US$52k worth of shares, at about US$2.45 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$2.79. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price. In the last twelve months Processa Pharmaceuticals insiders were buying shares, but not selling. They paid about US$3.45 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! NasdaqCM:PCSA Insider Trading Volume April 7th 2024 There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying. Insiders At Processa Pharmaceuticals Have Bought Stock Recently It's good to see that Processa Pharmaceuticals insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$139k worth of shares. That shows some optimism about the company's future. Does Processa Pharmaceuticals Boast High Insider Ownership? For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Our data indicates that Processa Pharmaceuticals insiders own about US$507k worth of shares (which is 6.4% of the company). We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. We do generally prefer see higher levels of insider ownership.

The introduction of various ultrasound techniques and the establishment of specialised departments in cardiology are also success stories. The availability of services like oncology, neurology, and orthopedics have enhanced healthcare services.” The introduction of thalassemia tests, blood platelet separation, and testing machines has been noteworthy.

People are aware about the healthcare services, leading to a greater focus on personal health.” Meanwhile, regular training programmes for healthcare service providers have led to enhanced patient care and a more empathetic approach. “The Covid-19 pandemic has further emphasised the need for well-equipped healthcare facilities, leading to the conversion of wards into ICUs at different hospitals,” Dr Minz added.

Image by © Tim Sandle Healthcare vehicle: An ambulance waits for the net call. Image by © Tim Sandle Healthcare professional, according to a new survey , hope that the AI-induced efficiencies , as demonstrated by other industries, will spill over to healthcare to help reduce the impact of worker shortages. The vast majority of healthcare workers (86.1 percent) feel they have a good understanding of how AI is used in healthcare, compared to only 57 percent of the general population. This is according to a survey from Carta Healthcare . Although nearly three-quarters (73.1%) of healthcare professionals report knowing if they are actively using AI in their health practice, this isn’t common knowledge for patients. Most patients (71 percent) do not know whether or not their healthcare providers use AI. Healthcare workers and patients agree on one point regarding AI: They have trust issues. Just over one-third (36.7 percent) of healthcare workers say they trust AI in healthcare. Similarly, only 38 percent of patients trust AI in healthcare. These findings underscores the need to always have a human subject matter expert in the loop to review AI results and make decisions; AI should never be trusted to make healthcare decisions or present information to a patient without SME review. Despite reasonable AI trust issues that can be addressed with human review, the vast majority (85.3 percent) of healthcare professionals believe AI can help improve patients’ healthcare experience, and more than three-quarters (76.9 percent) think that AI could be useful to help combat labour shortages. Throughout the survey, healthcare workers cite specific AI use cases that have already helped the most to combat labour shortages, such as AI for data analytics, entry, and management for clinical documentation (73.9 percent), followed by AI/automated tools to reduce duplicate paperwork (65.7 percent). The new healthcare technologies that healthcare workers are interested in are: Medical imagery to spot early diseases (55.6 percent). Technology to facilitate data entry and paperwork to reduce the administrative burden (52.2 percent). Diagnostic expediency for better patient outcomes (49 percent). These findings are based on a U.S. national online survey of 502 healthcare professionals conducted by Propeller Insights for Carta Healthcare.

World Health Day 2024: Why Is It Important To Make Healthcare Affordable And Accessible In India? VERIFIED By: Written by Kinkini Gupta | Updated : April 6, 2024 8:28 PM IST Every year, World Health Day is observed on 7th of April. This day marks the foundation of the esteemed World Health Organisation (WHO) which deals with health crisis' all across the world. WHO was officially founded on 7th of April, 1948. Its commemoration is done in order to draw focus on the millions of healthcare issues that still plague the world today in 2024. The aim for the world is to be more aware and prevent as many diseases as they can for future generations. On this World Health Day, we are going to discuss the desperate necessity of affordable and accessible healthcare in a country like India. Why Is It Important To Make Healthcare Affordable In India? India delivers both private and public healthcare. The quality of private healthcare is very good but also very expensive. Partha Pratim Das Mahapatra, the Founder and CEO of EzeRx spoke to TheHealthsite.com and said, "" In a nation where healthcare is often a luxury, accessibility shouldn't be a privilege but a fundamental right. According to recent data, approximately 16.4% of India's population lives in poverty. Out of this, about 4.2% are considered to be in extreme poverty, with a deprivation score exceeding 50%."" This strata of people cannot afford private healthcare facilities and they do not have insurance for treatment of non-communicable and chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, kidney transplant, etc. Also Read 62% Indians Daily Calories Come From Carbs And Protein, Scientists Alarm Risk Of Obesity, Diabetes And Heart Disease Finland Calling?

There are critical shortages in specialties like mental health and even primary care . Steward Health Care , whose nine Eastern Massachusetts hospitals serve more than 200,000 patients annually, is facing a grave financial crisis. It’s too early to know how it will be resolved, but options include takeovers by other hospitals, consolidations, or closings — like at New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton . And while Steward’s services are likely to shrink, other Massachusetts hospital systems are proposing to add capacity and invest heavily in new, expanded services. As all of this is happening, Massachusetts continues to be one of the nation’s most expensive states for health care. A recent Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts poll found that 40 percent of residents say they have delayed or avoided getting care due to costs. So what’s going on? Why all the turmoil? It appears to be a troubling symptom of our collective failure to have comprehensive, long-term health care planning in Massachusetts. Long-range planning would allow the state to build on the many strengths of its health care system with a clearer understanding of its evolving needs and resources. It would equip policy makers and the private sector with the ability to make more informed decisions and monitor and evaluate progress in meeting goals for affordability, access, quality, and equity. Advertisement The state and the health care community should start by enlisting experts in population science, epidemiology, economic trends, and health equity to project current trends over the next 10 to 15 years. Key areas for analysis, forecasting, and monitoring would include changes in the population such as location, age, race, and ethnicity, as well as changes in disease prevalence, socioeconomic trends, patient preference, and advances in research and technology. For example, we as health care leaders should be asking: ▪ Where will in- and out-migration occur across Massachusetts? Where will residents want to get their care? How far should someone be expected to travel for needed care, and is it different if they’re in an urban area with buses and subways versus rural areas with limited public transportation options? ▪ What will demographic changes mean for the number and types of clinicians that will be needed? How will an aging population affect the incidence of diseases and the amount of geriatric, skilled nursing, and palliative care needed? ▪ How many inpatient beds will Massachusetts need? How should they be distributed across the state, and at what price? What technological advancements will allow patients to receive care in a community setting or at home rather than in a hospital? ▪ How will mental health care evolve? How many mental health professionals and facilities will we need, and where will they be needed most? ▪ How is the state’s population diversifying? What kind of recruitment and training will be needed to ensure the makeup of our clinical workforce reflects our population, and what will be needed to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care delivery and outcomes? It’s tempting to say that there aren’t enough resources to answer these questions now, that the health care sector needs to focus on the issues before it today. But if the state and the health care sector don’t act now, we might lose the chance to further strengthen and maintain a dynamic, resilient health care system. We must make the investment today so we don’t continue to grapple with these challenges tomorrow. Advertisement This can’t be just a state government initiative. Everyone with a stake in health care should support this work, just as Massachusetts health care organizations; business, labor, consumer advocates, and faith-based groups; and others partnered with government to design and enact Massachusetts health care reform almost 20 years ago. Imagine how much better prepared Massachusetts would be if an unexpected crisis occurs or a major expansion or transaction were in the works. We would have a framework that we could consult, because we had come together as a community and aligned ourselves around a common, data-driven vision for providing residents with timely access to safe, effective, equitable, and affordable care when and where they need it.

April is Health Care Decisions Month. A couple years ago, when I heard of this month-long awareness campaign, I thought it was odd. I didn’t understand the importance of having an official health care proxy and discussing how I want my medical care to be handled if I become unable to make decisions on my own. I did not know that my family would not automatically be making these decisions. To ensure that my wishes are known, it was important to set up a health care proxy. A health care proxy is a document in which an individual appoints an agent to legally make health care decisions on behalf of the patient when they are incapable of making and executing health care decisions. While a health care proxy can be setup with a lawyer when you prepare your will and other estate documents, it is not necessary to involve a lawyer in this specific document. A health care proxy can be completed at home and only needs your signature with two witnesses. (Note: you should work with a reputable attorney that specializes in estate planning when you prepare your estate documents.) × This page requires Javascript.

Melanie Stansbury and Teresa Leger Fernandez joined U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra to talk about health care in New Mexico with doctors and local leaders. ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — U.S. Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Teresa Leger Fernandez joined U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra to talk about health care in New Mexico with doctors and local leaders. “We have people in American society that are falling through the health care cracks, whether the state is not providing enough resources, or because they live in rural communities, or they live in poor communities, they are being missed,” Becerra said. Leger Fernandez and Stansbury highlighted two big problems with health care in the state – access to health care for Latinos, specifically in rural communities, and the importance of bringing qualified medical professionals to those areas. “Lack of access to health care in rural areas, people are dying because of that,” Leger Fernandez said. “Let’s be honest, it kills. It also kills the local economy because people leave our beautiful rural areas, because they don’t have access to health care.” The goal now is to increase the number of facilities to serve those communities and increase the number of practitioners. “We know that you’re struggling to keep your clinics open, we know that you’re struggling to bring talent to New Mexico and to bring it up in the communities,” Stansbury said. State leaders say they are doing what they can to address the issues, and will continue to do so."

The Result : The proposed health care cost targets and APM adoption goals will increase the pressure on California health care entities to reduce costs. These pressures will have a material impact on negotiations between health care providers and health care payers, and are likely to force many health care providers to rethink their approach to payer contracting. Looking Ahead : Health care providers in California should carefully monitor OHCA's activities and begin to plan for coming changes in their relations with health plans, health insurers, and other payers. Cost Targets The HCQA requires OHCA to establish both statewide and health care sector-specific cost targets that will apply to health care entities, including insurers and commercial and governmental health plans, hospitals and other licensed health facilities, and physician organizations. The cost targets to be established by OHCA are not absolute dollar figures, but are trend numbers, defined as the target percentage for the maximum annual increase in per capita health care expenditures. Health care expenditures include, among other things, amounts paid to health care providers for covered health care benefits, cost sharing (e.g., co-pay, coinsurance, and deductible) amounts for covered health care benefits paid by California residents, and health plan and insurer administrative costs and profits. Under the HCQA, the cost targets established by OHCA must ""promote a predictable and sustainable rate of change in per capita total health care expenditures."" OHCA must establish the first statewide health care cost target no later than June 1, 2024. Recently, OHCA proposed a statewide cost target of 3% for each of the five years commencing January 1, 2025. The proposed target is based not on historical changes in health care costs or spending, but on the average annual rate of change in historical median household income over the 20-year period from 2002-2022. In contrast to the 3% annual growth in median household income, the average annual growth in per capita health care spending over roughly the same period (2000-2020) was 5.4%, a figure that excludes certain costs included in OHCA's proposed cost target. The difference between the two figures is likely to pose serious challenges for health care providers in California, many of whom are still reeling from the impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and a significant increase in workforce wages. Nevertheless, OHCA believes that a cost target based on median household income is appropriate, as it best ""places California on the path of a more sustainable, affordable and equitable health care system, slowing the trajectory of growth [in health care costs] and improving affordability for all."" In addition to a statewide health care cost target, the HCQA requires OHCA to establish cost targets for specific health care sectors. Health sectors, to be defined by OHCA, may include geographic regions as well as individual health care entities. Thus, it is quite possible that payers, hospitals, and other providers will be subject to their own individualized cost target. Given that any provider-specific target must support the attainment of the statewide target, and that there are potential sanctions for exceeding the statewide target, it seems reasonable to assume that provider-specific targets typically will be no greater than the statewide target adopted by OHCA. Sector-specific cost targets need not be set by OHCA until June 1, 2028, so health care entities have some time to prepare. Enforcement Unlike the laws of most of the handful of other states that have adopted some sort of cost growth benchmarking programs, the HCQA expressly contemplates that the state will take enforcement action against health care entities that fail to comply with applicable statewide and/or sector-specific cost targets. Specifically, the director of OHCA is authorized to: Provide technical assistance to the health care entity to assist it to come into compliance; Require or compel public testimony by the health care entity regarding its failure to comply with applicable cost target(s); Require submission and implementation of performance improvement plans, including review and input from OHCA prior to approval; and Assess penalties in amounts initially commensurate with the failure to meet applicable cost targets, and in escalating amounts for repeated or continuing failure to meet such cost targets. In taking action against a health care entity, OHCA will consider the entity's contribution to cost growth in excess of the applicable target and any actions by the entity that ""have eroded, or are likely to erode, access, quality, equity, or workforce stability, factors that contribute to spending in excess of the applicable target, and the extent to which each entity has control over the applicable components of its cost target."" OHCA will not enforce compliance with the statewide cost target established for 2025, but will enforce compliance with the targets established for 2026 and beyond. Despite this lag, health care payers and health care providers should be feeling pressure to conform with the cost targets sooner rather than later, as deals they negotiate within the next year may impact their ability to meet cost targets in 2026. As such, compliance with cost targets will very soon become a key driver in payer-provider negotiations. From here on out, providers can almost certainly expect payers to refuse to entertain negotiated rate increases that exceed statewide or payer-specific cost targets. With margins already thin, controlling their own costs in equal measure will become a critical objective for most providers. Promotion of Alternative Payment Models In addition to setting and enforcing cost targets, OHCA is responsible under the HCQA for promoting a shift away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement to APMs that financially incentivize high-quality and cost-efficient care. To do so, OHCA is charged with, among other things, adopting standards for APMs that may be used during contracting between health care entities, setting statewide goals for the adoption of APMs, and measuring the state's progress toward those goals by requiring payers to submit data and other information to OHCA as appropriate. The HCQA requires OHCA to adopt the APM standards no later than July 1, 2024. In February of this year, OHCA released its proposed set of APM standards . The standards set forth a set of 10 ""best practices"" for APM contracting that focus on improving quality, affordability, and equity and that highlight the importance of data collection, data sharing, and transparency. At the same time, OHCA released its statewide goal for APM adoption, which seeks to have reimbursement for at least 75% of members enrolled in commercial, Medi-Cal, and Medicare Advantage plans paid under some sort of APM arrangement—specifically, one defined as either a Category 3 or Category 4 arrangement by the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network within the next 10 years (by 2034). While OHCA must promote and monitor use of the APM standards by contracting entities, OHCA does not yet have authority to enforce those standards or its statewide goal for APM adoption. As such, OHCA has signaled that it will seek to obtain stakeholder endorsement of the APM standards and a commitment from payers and purchasers to using the standards to guide their future contracting efforts. Given the breadth of the standards, and with enforcement of the health care cost targets not long off, it seems reasonable to assume that OHCA will have very little trouble engaging payers in support of these goals. Accordingly, health care providers can anticipate increased pressure from payers to move to APM reimbursement models. Five Key Takeaways The threat of cost target enforcement activity by OHCA will compel many health care providers to find new ways to control costs without sacrificing quality, access, or workforce stability. Similar pressures placed on health plans, insurers, and other payers will trickle down and will very soon become a key driver in payer-provider negotiations. Providers can almost certainly expect payers to refuse to entertain negotiated rate increases that exceed statewide or payer-specific cost targets. While OHCA has no ability to enforce the APM standards or adoption goals, pressure to move to APMs will nevertheless increase, as payers look to meet health care cost targets in a manner that supports state efforts to promote APMs. While some California providers (IPAs and large medical groups) are accustomed to managing risk, others (e.g., hospitals) are not. The transition to APMs is going to require provider contract managers and their staff to utilize (or recruit for) a whole new set of skill and support, including actuarial support, legal contract drafting, etc. Though scale may play a role in managing financial risk, health care providers looking to form or grow networks through mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions will need to be mindful of OHCA's Material Change Transaction and Pre-Transaction Review processes, which may create additional barriers to growth.

The momentum must be kept up Recent UK healthcare education mission to China is a testament to the importance of keeping dialogue and engagement alive Reading Time: 4 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Nora Colton Published: 5:30am, 5 Apr 2024 Updated: 6:01am, 5 Apr 2024 With pandemics, droughts , floods , wildfires and conflict across the world, we are living in an era of “polycrisis” , which is placing a major toll on global health. Countries are grappling with how to look after ageing populations , combat the rise in non-communicable diseases, address a lack of healthcare access and deal with the rise of misinformation and disinformation in health. Advertisement This rapid, complex change coincides with increased geopolitical tensions and difficult global governance , meaning our ability to tackle these challenges as a global community is falling short. The pandemic showed us that global health systems can pull together in the face of an acute shared threat. Take the project between UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and China that, building on previous healthcare engagement, saw the two nations collaborate to develop Covid-19 rapid test kits – a significant milestone in enabling Britain to contain and combat the pandemic. Or take EU member states coming together to create a reserve of personal protective equipment that could be quickly mobilised across the bloc. International dialogue is crucial in building more robust and resilient global healthcare systems. Unfortunately, the momentum for collaboration, such as that between United Kingdom and China, or even among European Union member states, hasn’t been kept up, and this is something all nations should seek to change. As many global health experts have recognised, there’s mounting evidence that we need to move away from health systems that are too focused on therapeutics, and move towards integrated care. From my conversations with healthcare authorities worldwide and the academic research of the University College London’s Global Business School for Health, it’s clear that an integrated approach is best at preventing sickness, creating services tailored to local needs and keeping healthcare workers engaged. Advertisement While there is no perfect formula for a functioning healthcare system, nations can and should learn from those around them. The more we look to international best practices, the quicker we will see patient outcomes improve.

Markey to draft new federal Legislation Updated: 6:43 PM EDT Apr 3, 2024 Editorial Standards ⓘ By Alison Kuznitz, State House News Service U.S. Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren excoriated Steward Health Care's top executive inside Beacon Hill's largest hearing room Wednesday, where they set up an empty chair for CEO Ralph de la Torre, who declined to testify about financial decisions that have jeopardized operations at its Massachusetts hospitals.During their Senate subcommittee hearing exploring the harms of private equity in the health care sector, Markey and Warren also promoted two new proposals designed to regulation private investments in health care, protect quality of care for patients, and prevent another health care crisis like Steward's from unfolding elsewhere across the country.As Markey pointed out, Steward's footprint extends beyond its hospitals in Massachusetts to its other facilities in Ohio, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Texas that he said are also without the supplies they need.Markey said de la Torre declined to speak at the hearing, and he said Steward also refused to send another executive who could answer lawmakers' questions.""So that seat for their testimony was empty today, as empty as the promises which Steward and Ralph de la Torre had made to the state of Massachusetts,"" Markey told reporters after the hearing, which lasted just under two hours in Gardner Auditorium.""So, we're going to make sure that Dr. de la Torre and Steward become nationally famous, that they become the example of the dangers of allowing private equity to take over a health care system,"" Markey continued. ""And we're not going to stop until we put the safeguards in place that protect patients, protect doctors and nurses from having a medical system that is looted.""Markey, Warren and state legislators trained their focus on Steward this year after the company's financial problems spilled into public view, in part stemming from a backlog of unpaid rent tied to the sale of Steward's real estate to Medical Properties Trust. Gov. Maura Healey has rebuked Steward for not providing financial documents to state regulators and called on the company to exit the Commonwealth's health care market.A Steward spokesperson declined to comment about why de la Torre did not appear at the state Capitol. The spokesperson also declined to weigh in on the senators' scathing remarks made about de la Torre and the company during the hearing.Warren called de la Torre's absence ""cowardice.""""Shame on Dr. de la Torre,"" Warren said. ""He owes the residents of Massachusetts an explanation for his part in looting Steward hospitals.""Last week, Markey said Steward ""is emblematic of a national problem that requires a national solution"" and said transparency and accountability reforms are needed ""to guarantee that our country has a health care system, not a wealth care system.""Markey said his draft bill unveiled Wednesday, called the Health over Wealth Act, could bolster transparency and accountability for private equity and for-profit companies. Markey said it would require private equity companies to set aside funding to safeguard access to patient care, provide a ""bigger voice"" for health care workers and patients to review and block potential deals, and require for-profit companies to disclose their financial information and staffing levels, among other components.His proposal would require health care entities owned by private equity to report on debt, fees collected by the private equity firm, dividends paid by the health care entity to the private equity fund, lobbying or political spending, sale leaseback agreements, lease payments, interest paid on lines of credit, and transactions with vendors or service providers.Markey said he's seeking public comment through May 3, as the senator aims to prevent ""Steward's failures from becoming America's health care standards.""Warren said Wednesday she also intends to introduce legislation to regulate private equity in health care.Warren said her proposal would prohibit health care entities that receive federal funding from selling or mortgaging their assets to real estate investment trusts. It would also authorize the federal government to claw back compensation from health care executives and private equity investors ""whose predatory financial engineering endangers the viability of a hospital,"" she said.""I will say it bluntly: Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people,"" Warren said. ""Steward Health Care is a clear-cut example of private equity exploiting for-profit health care. Investors looted the hospital and got rich, while nurses, doctors and other workers tried hard to provide care. Supplies ran out and contractors walked away because they weren't getting paid.""Dr. Ellana Stinson said she previously worked as an emergency medicine physician at three Steward facilities, including Carney Hospital in Dorchester. Reflecting on how resources and specialty services dwindled, Stinson said she felt like she could no longer provide safe or quality care.Private equity firms have led buyouts, mergers and acquisitions of more than 30% of hospitals in the U.S., said Stinson, president of the New England Medical Association.""Having spent time at other PE sites around the country the level of deprivation was seemingly worse in some areas,"" Stinson said. ""Increasing wait times (and) critical shortages of staff lead to dangerous boarding levels and critically dangerous patient-to-nurse ratios in the emergency department, seeing upwards to 14-to-1 ratios at times.""Dr. Donald Berwick, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned that patients are facing unprecedented risk due to private equity investors prioritizing profits over the care system's underlying mission to heal people.Reform is needed to prevent private equity firms from threatening the ""adequacy and quality of care,"" said Berwick, president emeritus of the Boston nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement.""We should forbid the typical private equity approach of loading health care organizations with s, extracting capital and leaving stripped down organizations in bankruptcy or worse,"" Berwick said. ""Personally, I would forbid private equity firms from owning or controlling health care delivery.""Steward's for-profit model has ripple effects on the overarching health care landscape, including nonprofit hospitals that must adapt their operations and commitment to patients to stay competitive, Berwick said.""We are one system, so you can't damage one component without seeing damage downstream,"" Berwick said.Michael Curry, president and CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, issued a similar warning during a listening session hosted by Markey last week. Curry said Steward's crisis ""poses serious threats to access to care for health center patients and communities.""""Health centers will be there, stepping up with whatever means they have, because by design health centers are responsive to the needs of the communities they serve. Doing their critical work is becoming harder every day due to unprecedented workforce shortages,"" Curry said. ""As we shared with Senator Markey today, we urge policymakers to take a critical eye to how the growth of for-profit health care is contributing to the challenges our system is facing.""State lawmakers also held an informational hearing on private equity in health care last week.The accelerating pace of private equity investments across the national health care system — including in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical centers and physician specialties — has resulted in steeper patient costs and poorer quality of care, researchers told the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing.The panel was presented with options to strengthen the state's regulatory authority over health care transactions, particularly expanding the Health Policy Commission's ability to impose conditions on proposed major changes to medical entities.Committee co-chairs Sen. Cindy Friedman and Rep. John Lawn attended part of Wednesday's hearing.""Sen. Friedman had a great hearing last Monday up here in the State House, so our intent is to partner with her and the other state legislative leaders to make sure that Massachusetts is the leader in putting protections in place against a repetition of what Steward has done,"" Markey told reporters.The HPC has said it plans to review a deal to sell Steward Health Care's physician network to for-profit insurer Optum Care, an arrangement that quickly raised red flags last week for House Speaker Ron Mariano and Warren, who warned of ""significant antitrust concerns."" Warren said Optum already covers more than 10 percent of doctors across the country.Berwick called Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, ""another aggressive for-profit company."" He predicted the deal, should it move forward, would drive up costs for patients.""They're absolutely the world's experts on upcoding,"" Berwick said, a term that Warren said means ""charging more.""Fearing the collapse of Steward, Warren emphasized a solution is needed and ""not an opportunity to make things worse.""""A quick sale to another outside investor could do more harm here than good,"" Warren said.Drawing applause, she added, ""Federal and state regulators should think once, and think twice, and think three times before they let another corporate investor suck more money out of the Steward system.""

Markey said his draft bill unveiled Wednesday, called the Health over Wealth Act , could bolster transparency and accountability for private equity and for-profit companies. Markey said it would require private equity companies to set aside funding to safeguard access to patient care, provide a ""bigger voice"" for health care workers and patients to review and block potential deals, and require for-profit companies to disclose their financial information and staffing levels, among other components. His proposal would require health care entities owned by private equity to report on debt, fees collected by the private equity firm, dividends paid by the health care entity to the private equity fund, lobbying or political spending, sale leaseback agreements, lease payments, interest paid on lines of credit, and transactions with vendors or service providers. Markey said he's seeking public comment through May 3, as the senator aims to prevent ""Steward's failures from becoming America's health care standards."" Warren said Wednesday she also intends to introduce legislation to regulate private equity in health care. Warren said her proposal would prohibit health care entities that receive federal funding from selling or mortgaging their assets to real estate investment trusts. It would also authorize the federal government to claw back compensation from health care executives and private equity investors ""whose predatory financial engineering endangers the viability of a hospital,"" she said. ""I will say it bluntly: Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people,"" Warren said. ""Steward Health Care is a clear-cut example of private equity exploiting for-profit health care. Investors looted the hospital and got rich, while nurses, doctors and other workers tried hard to provide care. Supplies ran out and contractors walked away because they weren't getting paid."" Dr. Ellana Stinson said she previously worked as an emergency medicine physician at three Steward facilities, including Carney Hospital in Dorchester. Reflecting on how resources and specialty services dwindled, Stinson said she felt like she could no longer provide safe or quality care. Steward Health Care gets pushback on plan to sell doctor network to Optum Private equity firms have led buyouts, mergers and acquisitions of more than 30% of hospitals in the U.S., said Stinson, president of the New England Medical Association. ""Having spent time at other PE sites around the country the level of deprivation was seemingly worse in some areas,"" Stinson said. ""Increasing wait times (and) critical shortages of staff lead to dangerous boarding levels and critically dangerous patient-to-nurse ratios in the emergency department, seeing upwards to 14-to-1 ratios at times."" Dr. Donald Berwick, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned that patients are facing unprecedented risk due to private equity investors prioritizing profits over the care system's underlying mission to heal people. Reform is needed to prevent private equity firms from threatening the ""adequacy and quality of care,"" said Berwick, president emeritus of the Boston nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement. ""We should forbid the typical private equity approach of loading health care organizations with s, extracting capital and leaving stripped down organizations in bankruptcy or worse,"" Berwick said. ""Personally, I would forbid private equity firms from owning or controlling health care delivery."" Steward's for-profit model has ripple effects on the overarching health care landscape, including nonprofit hospitals that must adapt their operations and commitment to patients to stay competitive, Berwick said. ""We are one system, so you can't damage one component without seeing damage downstream,"" Berwick said. Michael Curry, president and CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, issued a similar warning during a listening session hosted by Markey last week. Curry said Steward's crisis ""poses serious threats to access to care for health center patients and communities."" ""Health centers will be there, stepping up with whatever means they have, because by design health centers are responsive to the needs of the communities they serve. Doing their critical work is becoming harder every day due to unprecedented workforce shortages,"" Curry said. ""As we shared with Senator Markey today, we urge policymakers to take a critical eye to how the growth of for-profit health care is contributing to the challenges our system is facing."" State lawmakers also held an informational hearing on private equity in health care last week. The accelerating pace of private equity investments across the national health care system — including in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical centers and physician specialties — has resulted in steeper patient costs and poorer quality of care, researchers told the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. The panel was presented with options to strengthen the state's regulatory authority over health care transactions, particularly expanding the Health Policy Commission's ability to impose conditions on proposed major changes to medical entities. Committee co-chairs Sen. Cindy Friedman and Rep. John Lawn attended part of Wednesday's hearing. ""Sen. Friedman had a great hearing last Monday up here in the State House, so our intent is to partner with her and the other state legislative leaders to make sure that Massachusetts is the leader in putting protections in place against a repetition of what Steward has done,"" Markey told reporters. The HPC has said it plans to review a deal to sell Steward Health Care's physician network to for-profit insurer Optum Care, an arrangement that quickly raised red flags last week for House Speaker Ron Mariano and Warren, who warned of ""significant antitrust concerns."" Warren said Optum already covers more than 10 percent of doctors across the country. Berwick called Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, ""another aggressive for-profit company."" He predicted the deal, should it move forward, would drive up costs for patients. ""They're absolutely the world's experts on upcoding,"" Berwick said, a term that Warren said means ""charging more."" Fearing the collapse of Steward, Warren emphasized a solution is needed and ""not an opportunity to make things worse."" ""A quick sale to another outside investor could do more harm here than good,"" Warren said. Drawing applause, she added, ""Federal and state regulators should think once, and think twice, and think three times before they let another corporate investor suck more money out of the Steward system.""

Imprint operated under license. | Paid Program Apr 02, 2024, 04:49pm EDT Share Save NVIDIA President Jensen Huang Flickr In the dynamic arena of healthcare technology, NVIDIA stands as a beacon of progress, guided by Jensen Huang's visionary leadership. With the recent unveiling of AI microservices , the introduction of a groundbreaking AI chip, the anticipation surrounding a next-generation robot, and a series of strategic partnerships, NVIDIA is sculpting a future where healthcare is transformed through the power of AI. These innovations, driven by Huang's belief in the power of humility and innovation, signify a leap towards a more efficient, personalized, and interconnected healthcare ecosystem. By seamlessly integrating advanced AI into the fabric of healthcare, from diagnostics to patient care, NVIDIA is not merely responding to current trends; it's pioneering a future where technology and human-centric care coalesce to improve lives globally. Generative AI Microservices: Unleashing a New Era in Healthcare NVIDIA's recent launch of generative AI microservices is setting the stage for a seismic shift in healthcare. With over two dozen new microservices now available, NVIDIA is enabling healthcare enterprises worldwide to harness the latest advances in generative AI across any cloud platform.

By automating the conversion of clinical conversations into structured notes, their technology aims to drive down the administrative burden on clinicians, potentially saving them hours each day. With its capacity to swiftly process and summarize key medical information from dialogues, even in challenging acoustic environments, we are looking at impacting administrative burden —perhaps the biggest driver responsible for clinical burnout today. The Blackwell B200 GPU: A Quantum Leap in Healthcare Computing At the heart of NVIDIA's technological revolution in healthcare is the Blackwell B200 GPU, heralded as the world's most potent chip for AI. This groundbreaking GPU is engineered to offer up to 20 petaflops of FP4 horsepower—an astounding 2.5 times increase from its H100 Hopper GPU, which serves as a crucial component for getting us where we are today with generative AI. Such computational power is pivotal for healthcare organizations, enabling the real-time processing and analysis of extensive medical datasets. This capability is critical for developing more informed, faster clinical decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency. It’s also important to consider the impact toward payment innovation across healthcare, where, according to Turquoise Health, there are 630 Terabytes (TB) or 78 billion health records worth of data in machine readable files held by health plans alone. The Blackwell B200 GPU is a manifestation of NVIDIA's foresight and Huang's leadership ethos, aiming to democratize access to advanced AI analytics in healthcare. It promises a future where AI-accelerated healthcare solutions are within reach for all, ensuring that cutting-edge technology can drive innovations in patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment efficacy. Project GR00T: Envisioning Human-Centric Robotics in Healthcare Huang notes, “Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today.” And with the introduction of Project GR00T, NVIDIA ventures into the realm of embodied AI, anticipating a future where humanoid robots become integral to healthcare delivery. These next-generation robots are being designed to understand and execute tasks with a level of dexterity and empathy previously unseen, embodying Huang's vision of a future where technology seamlessly integrates with humanity to enhance healthcare services.

NVIDIA's foray into humanoid robotics with Project GR00T illustrates a commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI and robotics, ensuring that technological advancements serve to complement and augment human efforts in healthcare, rather than replace them. NVIDIA's Strategic Partnerships Across the Healthcare Ecosystem NVIDIA is not working in isolation. Its collaborations with renowned companies are testament to its commitment to transforming healthcare: Hippocratic AI: Redefining Patient Care with AI-Powered Empathy The strategic alliance announced between Hippocratic AI and NVIDIA is catalyzing a revolution in healthcare communication, merging AI's computational prowess with the nuanced art and science linked to “empathy inference.” This collaboration—enabling conversations of a low-latency nature—leverages NVIDIA’s AI platform to bring to life “healthcare agents” capable of engaging with patients in real-time conversations that were once the exclusive domain of human caregivers. Demonstrating the power of this partnership, user tests have shown a remarkable increase in patient trust and comfort—a 5-10% rise in emotional connection with every half-second reduction in response time. The decreased time goes beyond efficiency; and serves as a catalyst for what may help further innovation in patient experience. Empowered by NVIDIA’s advanced H100 Tensor Core GPUs and the innovative NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, these AI agents have surpassed industry standards, outperforming notable models like GPT-4 and LLaMA2 70B Chat in safety benchmarks. Such achievements underscore the transformative potential of integrating state-of-the-art AI with healthcare, promising not just to fill the gaps in staffing shortages but to forge a new paradigm in patient engagement. Microsoft: Shaping the Next Generation of Healthcare Innovation Recently, Microsoft announced a partnering with NVIDIA to further AI, cloud, and accelerated computing. In harnessing Microsoft Azure's vast capabilities alongside NVIDIA's cutting-edge AI and computing platforms, this partnership appears well-rooted for transformation across life sciences and patient care. From accelerating drug discovery through AI-powered analyses to enhancing diagnostics with advanced imaging technology, the potential benefits appear to be immense. This strategic alliance not only democratizes access to groundbreaking healthcare solutions but also paves the way for more personalized, efficient, and accessible patient care. This AI-driven collaboration exemplifies how collaborative technological advancement sets the stage for driving future positive impacts on healthcare outcomes globally—a forward-thinking approach to addressing the complexities of modern medicine. Tightening up on Security In healthcare and other highly regulated environments, NVIDIA recognizes security is a crucial aspect. The landscape of security is evolving rapidly, with the rise of ransomware attacks and supply chain attacks. As a result, we are witnessing the rise of governance and recommendations such as Software Bill of Materials and Zero Trust Architectures . Progress is being made at the silicon level to secure hardware with trusted suppliers and verification. An example of this is HPE’s silicon root of trust , which offers protection against firmware attacks. Additionally, there will be an increase in computations running on secure enclaves to safeguard privacy and ensure that sensitive data remains harder to access. Looking Ahead As we stand at the threshold of a new frontier in healthcare, the journey led by pioneers like NVIDIA serves as a testament to the boundless potential of artificial intelligence. Yet, the true essence of this transformation lies not just in the technology itself, but in our collective will to harness it responsibly, with humans always in the loop. NVIDIA's role in this paradigm shift reminds us of the power of collaboration and the importance of keeping human empathy at the core of innovation. As we venture further into this era of AI-enhanced healthcare, let us be inspired to embrace these advancements not merely as technological triumphs but as tools to deepen our connection to one another, improve patient care, and enrich the human experience.

Their commitment underscores the transformative potential of AI in reshaping the future of healthcare delivery. From accelerating drug discovery to optimising patient care pathways, the possibilities seem boundless. However, amidst the optimism, it’s crucial to recognise the inherent complexities and challenges associated with harnessing AI in healthcare. Advertisement One of the most pressing concerns is the issue of data bias, which threatens to perpetuate healthcare disparities and exacerbate existing inequities. Without robust safeguards in place, AI algorithms run the risk of amplifying systemic biases present within healthcare datasets, inadvertently compromising the quality of care for marginalised populations. Furthermore, the non-deterministic nature of AI poses significant regulatory and ethical dilemmas. Unlike traditional medical devices that adhere to predictable algorithms, AI-powered systems exhibit a degree of unpredictability that complicates their integration into clinical practice. Advertisement Ensuring patient safety and accountability in this rapidly evolving landscape requires a concerted effort to establish transparent guidelines and regulatory frameworks that prioritise ethical AI development and deployment. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI in healthcare are undeniable. By augmenting clinical decisionmaking with real-time insights and predictive analytics, AI has the power to enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline treatment protocols, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Moreover, in resource-limited settings, AI-driven innovations hold the promise of expanding access to quality care and empowering frontline healthcare workers with advanced tools and support. As we navigate the complexities of integrating AI into healthcare, it is imperative to adopt a cautious yet forward-thinking approach. Collaborative efforts between policymakers, healthcare providers, technologists, and ethicists are essential to ensure that AI remains a force for good in the realm of global health. By prioritising equity, transparency, and accountability, we can harness the full potential of AI to usher in a new era of healthcare innovation that benefits all members of society. While the road ahead may be fraught with challenges, the transformative potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable. By embracing innovation while upholding ethical principles, the world can harness the power of AI to drive meaningful progress towards a future where all individuals have access to high-quality, personalised healthcare. This requires a concerted effort to address concerns, but the rewards of a more efficient, equitable, and effective healthcare system are well worth the effort.
